On January 31, 2013, Plaintiff RREF BB Acquisitions, Inc. (“RREF”) \ncommenced this action against Defendants by filing its Complaint in Brunswick County \nSuperior Court. The action was designated as civil action number 13 CVS 193 by the Clerk \nof Superior Court of Brunswick County.  \n2.  In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges two claims for relief: for breach of a \nPromissory Note dated November 6, 1997 (as to Mark Saunders and Sibyl Saunders) (“First \nClaim”), and for breach of a Promissory Note and Guaranty of Payment dated February 8, \n2005 (as to MAS Properties, Mark Saunders and Sibyl Saunders) (“Second Claim”). \n3.  On April 29, 2013, Defendants MAS Properties, L.L.C. a/k/a MAS Properties \nLLC (“MAS”), Mark A. Saunders (“Mark Saunders”) and Sibyl H. Saunders (“Sibyl \nSaunders”) (collectively, “Defendants”) filed an Answer and Counterclaims against Plaintiff, \nand a Third Party Complaint naming Branch Banking & Trust Company (“BB&T”). \nDefendants allege the following claims for relief against RREF and/or BB&T: (1)First Claim \nfor Relief [Declaratory Judgment Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 1-253 to 267]; (2) Second \nClaim for Relief [Breach of Contract]; (3) Third Claim for Relief [Breach of the Implied \nCovenant of Good Faith & Fair Dealing]; (4) Fourth Claim for Relief [Breach of Duty to \nNegotiate in Good Faith]; (5) Fifth Claim for Relief [Misrepresentation/Fraudulent \nConcealment]; (6) Sixth Claim for Relief [Breach of Fiduciary Duty/Constructive Fraud]; (7) \nSeventh Claim for Relief [Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices]); (8) Eighth Claim for Relief \n[Indemnity/Subrogation]; and (9) Ninth Claim for Relief [Violation of Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act].  \n \n \n4.  On July 1, 2013, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Dismiss and Amended Reply to \nCounterclaim. Third-Party Defendant BB&T filed a Motion to Dismiss Third Party \nComplaint on August 2, 2013. Pursuant to a stipulation by all parties on July 26, 2013, \nPlaintiff and Third-Party Defendant filed a Joint Memorandum in Support of Motions to \nDismiss (“Memo”) on August 2, 2013. 1  \n5.  On November 3, 2014, Plaintiff and BB&T filed their Joint Motion for \nSummary Judgment, supporting evidentiary materials, and a Memorandum in Support.  In \nthe Joint Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff seeks summary judgment on its two \nclaims for breach of promissory notes and the guaranties.  Plaintiff and BB&T also seek \nsummary judgment on each of the nine counterclaims/third-party claims made by \nDefendants.  Defendants filed a response in opposition to the Joint Motion for Summary \nJudgment and supporting evidentiary materials including, inter alia , the Affidavits of Debra \nBoodro, Douglas T. Yeates, John Marshall and Mark A. Saunders \n6.  On March 23, 2015 Plaintiff and BB&T filed their Motion to Strike Affidavit of \nDebra Boodro and Portions of Affidavits of Douglas T. Yeates, John Marshall and Mark A. \nSaunders (“Motion to Strike”).  Defendants filed a response in opposition to the Motion to \nStrike. \nFACTS \n7.  Defendant Mark Saunders (“Saunders”) has been in real estate development \nin North Carolina for roughly thirty years. 2  He is currently the principal of a group of \nBrunswick County real estate businesses known as “The Coastal Companies.”3 The Coastal \n                                                \n1  The Motions to Dismiss are coextensive with the Motion for Summary Judgment. Accordingly, and \nwith the consent of the parties, the Court considers the Motions to Dismiss as subsumed in the Motion \nfor Summary Judgment. \n2  See Deposition of Mark A. Saunders (“Saunders Dep.”) 15. \n3 Dep. Ex. 149; Saunders Aff. ¶ 2; see Deposition of Elaine Jordan (“Jordan Dep.”) 5;. \n \n \nCompanies provide services in both commercial and personal real estate development. \nCoastal Companies employs in-house counsel, Elaine Jordan (“Jordan”). 4   \n8.  Saunders is also the registered agent and a member/manager of Defendant \nMAS Properties (“MAS”), a North Carolina limited liability company that conducts business \nunder the Coastal Companies umbrella. 5  \n9.  Plaintiff RREF BB Acquisitions, LLC (“RREF”) is an “acquisition entity” that \nacquires primarily real-estate secured loans. 6 On December 7, 2012, RREF acquired the loans \nat issue in this case from Third-Party Defendant BB&T.7  \n10.  Third-Party Defendant BB&T is a large, well-known North Carolina banking \ncorporation. In its Code of Ethics, Policies & Procedures, and Philosophy, which are available \nto the public, BB&T promotes “honesty,” “integrity,” “open communication,” and \n“transparent, extensive communication,” and pledges to avoid “manipulation, concealment, \nabuse of confidential information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair \ndealing practice.”8   Mark Saunders has been a customer of BB&T and its local predecessor, \nUnited Carolina Bank (“UCB”), for approximately thirty years. 9 During that time, Robert \nCox (“Cox”), BB&T’s agent in the Shallotte, North Carolina office, served as Saunders’ \nprimary contact with BB&T and/or UCB. 10  Saunders was among Cox’s largest clients. 11  \n11.  The matter currently pending before the Court arises from a dispute over two \nloans between BB&T and Defendants. On November 6, 1997, BB&T and Mark Saunders \n                                                \n4  Jordan Dep. 5.  \n5 Compl. ¶ 2; Countercl. ¶ 1; Dep.

United Carolina Bank was acquired by BB&T in 1997. Id.  \n10  Deposition of Robert Cox (“Cox Dep.”) 20, 37; Saunders Aff. ¶ 2. \n11  Id.  \n \n \nexecuted a promissory note for a $1,000,000.00 loan to Mark Saunders, with his wife, Sibyl \nSaunders, identified as an “Additional Co-maker.”12   On February 8, 2005, BB&T made a \nsecond loan, in the amount of $4,275,000.00, to MAS. 13  Mark and Sibyl Saunders entered into \nGuaranty Agreements in connection with the 2005 loan to MAS. 14  (The 1997 and 2005 loans \nare collectively referred to as “the Loans”). \n12.  Though the original terms of the Loans were for one and three years, \nrespectively, BB&T and Defendants extended, modified, or renewed the Loans on almost an \nannual basis until 2012. Many of these renewals took place after the Loans had reached \nmaturity. 15  \n13.  In early 2012, Bank of America initiated legal proceedings against Defendants \nand related entities, seeking recovery on loans worth over $70 million and the appointment \nof a receiver. 16  In the lawsuit, Bank of America sought the appointment of a receiver to \nmanage certain of Saunders’ business property based on a default on loans taken with Bank \nof America.  \n14.  BB&T became aware of the Bank of America lawsuit and decided not to renew \nthe Loans. 17  On February 2, 2012, one month prior to the maturation date of the Loans, 18  \nSteve Gruendel (“Gruendel”), BB&T outside counsel, sent written notice to Defendants that \nBB&T did not intend to renew the Loans. 19  \n                                                \n12  Dep.

Exs. 26, 27. \n \n \n15.  On February 27, 2012, Saunders and Jordan met with BB&T representative \nCindy Bean (“Bean”) and Gruendel at the Shallotte BB&T Branch to discuss BB&T’s decision \nnot to renew the Loans. 20   At the time of the meeting, Saunders understood that management \nof the Loans had been transferred from his primary BB&T contact, Cox, to Bean, and knew \nthat Bean worked for a “troubled loan/workout sort of department” at BB&T. 21  At the end of \nthat meeting, the parties held a mutual understanding that BB&T would not take any action \non the Loans for 60 days. 22   \n16.  On March 2, 2012, the Loans matured under the existing written terms. 23   \n17.  On March 6, 2012, BB&T’s outside counsel sent Jordan draft copies of \nforbearance agreements that would release BB&T from liability to the Saunders for any \nclaims arising from the Loans, in exchange for which BB&T was willing to honor the 60-day \nwait period to see what happened with the Bank of America receivership motion. 24  Saunders \ntestified in his deposition that he was “unfavorably surprised” by the draft forbearance \nagreements, which to his recollection had not been discussed at the February 27 meeting and \nwhich had never been required for previous extensions or modifications of the Loans.25  \nDefendants did not accept the forbearance agreements, and the agreements were never \nexecuted. 26  \n18.  On March 9, 2012, the Honorable John R. Jolly, Jr. denied the Bank of America \nreceivership motion. 27  On March 14, 2012, Gruendel sent Saunders a “reservation of rights” \n                                                \n20  Saunders Dep. 94; Jordan Dep. 68-69; Deposition of Cynthia Bean (“Bean Dep.”) 37-41. \n21  Saunders Dep. 96-97.

The \nnotice informed Saunders that BB&T’s forbearance from taking action on the Loans was still \ncontingent on Defendants’ execution of the forbearance agreements, and that, in the absence \nof an executed agreement, BB&T “intend[ed] to commence the exercise of its rights and \nremedies with respect to the Loans.”28  \n19.  In or around March 2012, BB&T also began to market the Loans to potential \nthird-party purchasers. 29  On March 23, 2012, Bean emailed Mike Hennessy (“Hennessy”), \nthe group leader for BB&T’s North Carolina asset resolution group, informing him that the \nLoans were “already being marketed.”30   It is undisputed that BB&T never informed \nDefendants that it was marketing or attempting to sell the Loans. \n20.  The parties continued to negotiate the terms of the Loans for several months, \nthrough summer and into fall 2012. 31  Nevertheless, in July 2012, BB&T notified Defendants \nthat it was initiating formal foreclosure proceedings as to the properties securing the Loans. 32   \n21.  On October 2, 2012, BB&T created an “internal asset summary form” related \nto a possible sale of the Loans. 33  On the same date, Bean emailed Saunders a request for \ncertain financial information to “evaluate a restructure” of the Loans. 34  Saunders’ response \n                                                \n28  Dep.

On or about October 22, 2012, Plaintiff RREF received a copy of the October 2 \nasset summary regarding the Loans from BB&T. 36  \n23.  On October 25, 2012, in anticipation of a meeting scheduled between BB&T \nand Defendants, Gruendel sent Defendants a term sheet with BB&T’s proposed terms for \nrestructure of the Loans. 37  The term sheet, labeled “Term Sheet for Discussion Purposes \nOnly,” contained disclaimers on every page that it did “not constitute any kind of commitment \nor undertaking” and that the terms therein were “subject to the internal approval process” of \nBB&T. 38  \n24.  On October 29, 2012, Saunders, Jordan, and Defendants’ outside counsel, Rick \nRayburn, met with Bean, Hennessy, and BB&T’s legal counsel to discuss terms of a \nrestructuring of the Loans.39  The parties dispute whether a final “meeting of the minds” was \nreached at the October 29 meeting as to all material terms of a restructure agreement, but \nthe record indicates that the parties agreed on many of the proposed terms contained in the \nOctober 25 term sheets. 40  As part of the agreed terms, Saunders was to convey certain real \nestate to BB&T in satisfaction of part of the Loan debt. Defendants were also to create a new \nlegal entity, dubbed “Newco,” to which BB&T would make a new loan to refinance the existing \n                                                \n35  Dep.

On November 1, 2012, Bean noted in BB&T’s internal loan system that the \nOctober 29 meeting was “successful in negotiating a structure for extension and deeds in lieu \nwhich I will be submitting for approval in the next week or so.”43  On the same date, Gruendel \nsent Defendants a term sheet revised to reflect BB&T’s understanding of the terms agreed \nupon at the October 29 meeting. The term sheet contained the same disclaimers as the \nOctober 25 term sheet: that it did “not constitute any kind of commitment or undertaking on \nthe part of the Bank, but [was] intended solely to facilitate discussions on the materials \ncontained herein,” and that the terms were “subject to the internal approval process.”44  \n26.  On November 19, 2012, Jordan emailed Gruendel a revised version of the \nNovember 1 term sheet, with “changes tracked to meet our understanding of the discussions \nwe had in Charlotte.”45  Among other things, Defendants’ revised November 19 term sheet \nremoved Sibyl Saunders as a guarantor and changed Defendants’ obligation to renew a \nbuilding permit from an outright obligation to a “best efforts” standard. 46  \n27.  On or about November 20, 2012, Hennessy instructed those involved to cease \ncommunications with Saunders and Jordan, because Saunders’ notes were “up for sale.”47  In \nhis deposition, Hennessy stated that it was BB&T’s policy to go “dark” and cease \ncommunications with clients once their notes were posted for sale. 48   Accordingly, BB&T \n                                                \n41  Saunders Dep. 158-69; Jordan Dep. 10-12, 21-28, 144; Rayburn Dep. 67-69. \n42  Saunders Dep. 169. \n43  Dep.

On December 4, 2012, Jordan sent Gruendel a follow up email regarding the \n“term sheet and restructure closing.”49  Gruendel responded that BB&T was “having some \ninternal discussions still” and that he would be in touch “as soon as [he had] something to \nreport.”50  \n29.  On December 7, 2012, BB&T closed a transaction with Plaintiff that included \nsale of the Loans. On December 13, 2012, Gruendel informed Jordan that BB&T had sold the \nLoans to Plaintiff. 51   There is no evidence in this record regarding whether Defendants \nattempted to negotiate a restructuring of the Loans with Plaintiff.  Defendants contend that, \nhad they known that the loans were up for sale, they would have attempted to purchase the \nLoans themselves or had a third party purchase them on their behalf.  52   They also contend \nthat had BB&T notified them that the November 1, 2012 term sheet was a “best and final \noffer” they would have accepted it. 53  \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiff/BB&T’s Motion to Strike \n30.  In the Motion to Strike, Plaintiff and BB&T challenge certain testimony \ncontained in the affidavits of four individuals filed by Defendants, moving the Court to strike \nportions of the testimony contained therein and exclude them from the Court’s consideration \nof the Summary Judgment Motion. Specifically, the Motion to Strike seeks to exclude from \nevidence: (a) the entire affidavit of Deborah Boodro, (b) paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and \n                                                \n49  Dep.

Yeates, (c) paragraphs 6 and 7 of the affidavit of John Marshall, and (d) \nparagraphs 40 and 41 of the affidavit of Mark Saunders. \n31.  The Court has considered the Strike Motion, the briefs supporting and \nopposing the Strike Motion, and the affidavits addressed by the Strike Motion, and concludes, \nin its discretion, that the Strike Motion should be DENIED. \nPlaintiff/BB&T’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n32.  Plaintiff and BB&T have moved for summary judgment both as to Plaintiff’s \nclaims, pursuant to Rule 56(a), and as to the counter and third-party claims raised by \nDefendants, pursuant to Rule 56(b).  The claims in this action arise from the maturation of \nthe Loans in March 2012, the negotiations to restructure the Loans, and BB&T’s sale of the \nLoans to Plaintiff in December 2012.  Plaintiff and BB&T contend the parties were \nsophisticated business entities engaged in an arms-length negotiation to restructure two \ncommercial loans, that the negotiations ultimately were unsuccessful, and that BB&T then \nlawfully exercised its right to sell the loans to Plaintiff.  BB&T also contends that it had no \nduty to disclose to Defendants that BB&T was attempting to sell the Loans while the parties \nwere attempting to negotiate a restructure agreement.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and BB&T \nargue that they are entitled to summary judgment on its claims for breach of the Loans and \nas to Defendants’ third-party claims and counterclaims. \n33.  Defendants contend that Defendants and BB&T reached an agreement to \nrestructure the Loans at the October 29, 2012 meeting, but that BB&T then refused to honor \nand subsequently breached the agreement when it sold the Loans to Plaintiff.  Defendants \nalso contend that BB&T and Defendants had a long, multifaceted, and unique lender-\nborrower relationship that created a duty on BB&T to disclose to Defendants that BB&T was \nattempting to sell the loans.   Defendants argue that BB&T’s failure to make such disclosure \namounted to a fraud on Defendants.  Finally, Defendants contend that even if a final and \n \n \nenforceable agreement on a restructure was not reached, BB&T had a duty to continue \nnegotiating in good faith towards reaching a restructure agreement after the October 29 \nmeeting that required BB&T to inform Defendants that the November 1, 2012 term sheet \nwas BB&T’s best and final offer. \n34.  “Summary judgment is appropriate 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there \nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.'” Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs ., LLC , 365 N.C. \n520, 523 (2012) (quoting Rule 56(c)). Any inference of fact should be drawn against the \nmovant. Forbis v. Neal , 361 N.C. 519, 523-524 (2007) (citing Caldwell v. Deese , 288 N.C. 375, \n378 (1975)). A genuine issue of material fact will require the court to preserve the issue for a \nfinder of fact. Bumpers v. Cmty. Bank of N. Va , 367 N.C. 81, 90 (2013).  Although the Court \nmust view the record “in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion,” Rule \n56(e) provides that summary judgment may not be defeated by “mere allegations or denials,” \nbut rather that the opposition must be supported by “specific facts showing that there is a \ngenuine issue for trial.”  Patterson v. Reid , 10 N.C. App. 22, 28 (1970).  \n35.  The interrelated nature of a number of the claims raised by the parties in this \naction require the Court address them out of their actual sequence in the pleadings.  \nBreach of Fiduciary Duty \n36.  In its Sixth Claim for Relief, Defendants allege that “BB&T owed the \n[Defendants] fiduciary duties as a result of the confidential and fiduciary relationship \nbetween BB&T and [Defendants].”54   Defendants allege that BB&T “had a duty to disclose \nall material facts to [Defendants]” and “to act in good faith and with due regard for the \n                                                \n54  Countercl. ¶ 86. \n \n \n[Defendants’] best interests,” and that “BB&T’s misrepresentations and material omissions \nwere in breach of its fiduciary duties to [Defendants].”55  \n37.  A fiduciary relationship has been defined under North Carolina law to exist \nwhen “there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience \nis bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing \nconfidence.” Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 367 N.C. 363, 367 (2014) (quoting Green v. \nFreeman , 367 N.C. 136, 141 (2013)).  Fiduciary relationships are those “in which there is \nconfidence reposed on one side, and resulting domination and influence on the other.” Dalton \nv. Camp , 353 N.C. 647, 651-52 (2001) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Abbitt v. Gregory , 201 \nN.C. 577, 598 (1931)). \n38.  There is no reported North Carolina appellate case in which a fiduciary \nrelationship has been found in a borrower-lender transaction. Dallaire , 367 N.C. at 368 \n(“Ordinary borrower-lender transactions . . . are considered arm’s length and do not typically \ngive rise to fiduciary duties.”); Sec.  Nat'l Bank of Greensboro v. Educators Mut. Life Ins. Co. , \n265 N.C. 86, 95 (1965) (“There was no fiduciary relationship; the relation was that of debtor \nand creditor.”); see also Branch Banking & Trust Co. v. Thompson, 107 N.C. App. 53, 61 \n(1992)  (The “mere existence of a debtor-creditor relationship between [the parties does] not \ncreate a fiduciary relationship.” (alteration in original) (citations omitted)); Lassiter v. Bank \nof N.C. , 146 N.C. App. 264, 268 (2001) (“A lender is only obligated to perform those duties \nexpressly provided for in the loan agreement to which it is a party.”).  Despite this fact, our \nSupreme Court has opined that “it is possible, at least theoretically, for a particular bank-\ncustomer transaction to give rise to a fiduciary relationship under the proper circumstances.” \n                                                \n55  Id. ¶¶ 87, 89, 91. \n \n \nDallaire , 367 N.C. at 368 (citation omitted).  Defendants contend that the facts in this case \npresent just such “proper circumstances.”   \n39.  The facts surrounding the relationship between BB&T and Saunders are \nlargely undisputed, although the parties’ characterizations of the relationship differ.  \nSaunders and his businesses have banked with the same Shallotte branch of BB&T for \napproximately 30 years. 56   Saunders worked with one BB&T banker, Robert Cox, for over 25 \nyears. 57   Saunders took out 16 commercial loans with BB&T over the years, and at one point \nhad over $25 million on deposit with the Shallotte branch. 58   Saunders, however, also had \nsignificant relationships with other banks, including loans worth roughly $70 million from \nBank of America. 59   BB&T also acted as the retail banker for contractors and purchasers of \nlots in Saunders’ communities, making over $250 million dollars’ worth of residential \nmortgage loans. 60   Saunders assisted BB&T charity fundraising campaigns. 61  \n40.  Saunders characterizes BB&T as an “advisor and confidant” with whom he met \nto “assess market conditions” in the local real estate market.  BB&T encouraged Saunders to \nmake a 1999 purchase of a community known as “SeaScape,” and provided him advice \nregarding building additional model homes. 62   Saunders also acknowledges, however, that at \nleast as of early 2012, BB&T was treating the relationship like a typical borrower-lender one.  \nIn February 2012, BB&T advised Saunders that it did not intend to renew the Loans that \nthe full balances were due on March 2, 2012.  In early March 2012, BB&T for the first time \nsought to have Saunders sign forbearance agreements, and in mid-2012, BB&T initiated \n                                                \n56  Saunders Aff. ¶ 2.  \n57  Id.  \n58  Id.  ¶ 3. \n59  Id.  ¶ 11. \n60  Id.  ¶¶ 4-5. \n61  Id.  ¶ 6. \n62  Id.  ¶ 4. \n \n \nforeclosure proceedings against properties securing the Loans.  Certainly, as of mid-2012, at \nthe latest, BB&T made it clear that it viewed the Loans as a business transaction in which \nit intended to protect its own interests \n41.  The facts in this case do suggest that Saunders had a trusted, long-term \nbusiness relationship with BB&T that was mutually beneficial to both.  Saunders worked \nclosely with BB&T in financing, developing various residential communities and in selling \nthe homes in those communities.  The facts do not, however, create a genuine issue of fact \nregarding whether BB&T stood in a fiduciary relationship with Saunders.  To the contrary, \n“common to all [fiduciary] relationships is a . . . duty of the fiduciary to act in the best interests \nof the other party.”  Dallaire , 367 N.C. at 367.  It would seem nearly antithetical to require a \ncommercial lender to put a borrower’s interests ahead of its own in a business transaction.  \nId.  at 368 (“[T]he law does not typically impose upon lenders a duty to put borrowers’ interests \nahead of their own.”).  While our appellate courts have held out the possibility that \n“theoretically” a lender-borrower relationship could create a fiduciary duty, it is difficult to \nconceive a situation in which a banking lender would owe a fiduciary duty to a sophisticated \nand experienced business customer. \n42.  The Eastern District of North Carolina’s recent decision in The Caper \nCorporation v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , No. 7:12-CV-357-D, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119506 \n(E.D.N.C. Aug. 22, 2013), is instructive.  Although Caper Corporation  involved a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion, the allegations at issue were strikingly similar to the facts present in this case.  In \nCaper Corporation , the action arose out of the plaintiff borrower’s “dissatisfaction with a loan \ncontract and an associated interest rate swap contract that the parties entered in 2005.” Id.  \nat *1. The plaintiff alleged claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, duress, breach of \nfiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. Id.   The plaintiff \nalleged a 30 year relationship with Wells Fargo, and that Wells Fargo was a “trusted advisor” \n \n \nwith “superiority, control, and influence” over the plaintiff. Id.  at **22-23.  The plaintiff also \nalleged that it chose to enter into the transaction at issue with Wells Fargo, even though it \ndid not offer the best loan terms, because of the plaintiff’s longstanding and close relationship \nwith Wells Fargo.  The plaintiff contended that Wells Fargo had “a duty to act in the best \ninterests of its customers, including [the plaintiff].”  Id.  at *23.  The Court held that the \nplaintiff was a “sophisticated business entity that for a number of years acquired, developed, \nand sold a variety of real properties.”  Id.  at *24 (internal quotations and citations omitted).  \nThe borrower “simply was unable through negotiation to convince Wells Fargo” to restructure \nthe loan transaction in the manner the plaintiff desired.  Id.  Finally, the Court held that the \nplaintiff had “failed to plausibly allege any circumstance beyond an arm’s-length, creditor-\ndebtor relationship between a bank and a sophisticated, repeat business customer.” Id . at \n*25.  Accordingly, the district court dismissed all of the plaintiff’s claims. Id . at *37. \n43.  In addition, even if a fiduciary relationship had existed between BB&T and \nDefendants, such relationship ceased once BB&T declared Defendants in default of the Loans \nand the positions of the parties became adverse.  Indeed, as of early 2012, Defendants and \nBB&T were represented by attorneys and were negotiating to protect their respective best \ninterests. In such circumstances, no fiduciary obligation exists between the parties, and \nBB&T “did not have an affirmative duty to disclose unfavorable facts” regarding its strategy \nin the restructuring negotiations.  Piedmont Inst. of Pain Mgmt. v. Staton Found., 157 N.C. \nApp. 577, 583-84 (2003) (finding that the fiduciary relationship between the parties ended at \nthe point that “both parties were represented by counsel” and “were negotiating for the \ntermination of legal rights”). \n44.  This Court reaches the same conclusion as the court in Capers .  Although the \nfacts show a significant relationship existed between Saunders and BB&T, they simply are \nnot sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact regarding the existence of a fiduciary \n \n \nrelationship between the parties.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s motion for summary \njudgment with regard to Defendant’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty should be GRANTED. \nDefendants’ Claim for Fraudulent Concealment  \n45.  In their Fifth Claim for Relief, Defendants allege that BB&T committed fraud \nagainst Defendants by failing to disclose to Defendants that BB&T was marketing and \nattempting to sell the Loans while it was at the same time negotiating with Defendants to \nrestructure the Loans. 63  In order to establish actual fraud, Defendants must show (1) a false \nrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) \nmade with an intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the \ninjured party. Forbis v. Neal , 361 N.C. 519, 526-27 (2007).  “Additionally, reliance on alleged \nfalse representations [or concealment] must be reasonable.” Sullivan v. Mebane Packaging \nGrp., Inc. , 158 N.C. App. 19, 27 (2003). Reliance is unreasonable where the plaintiff could \nhave discovered the truth through reasonable diligence, but did not investigate. Id .  \nDefendants contend that BB&T had a duty to disclose, and concealed from Defendants, that \nit was trying to sell the Loans.  Defendants further argue that even if BB&T did not have a \nduty to disclose, it created a duty to disclose by its representations regarding its corporate \nhonesty, integrity and transparency in dealing with customers.   \n46.   In order to avoid summary judgment on their claim for fraud, Defendants \nmust demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether BB&T had a duty to \ndisclose, and concealed, that it was trying to sell the Loans.  A claim for fraud may be based \nupon a failure to disclose a material fact only where the party had a duty of disclosure. Hardin \nv. KCS Int'l, Inc. , 199 N.C. App. 687, 696 (2009). Such a duty arises (a) when the parties have \na fiduciary relationship, (b) where a party to an arms-length transaction “has taken \n                                                \n63  Countercl. ¶ 75. \n \n \naffirmative steps to conceal material facts from the other,” or (c) where a party knows of a \n“latent defect in the subject matter of the negotiations about which the other party is both \nignorant and unable to discover through reasonable diligence.” Harton v. Harton , 81 N.C. \nApp. 295, 297-98 (1986); see also  Friedland v. Gales , 131 N.C. App. 802, 807 (1998).  In \naddition, if a party to a negotiation undertakes to speak, that party is then under a duty to \ndisclose as to the matters about which the party has chosen to speak.  Ragsdale v. Kennedy , \n286 N.C. 130, 139 (1974) (“The rule is that even though a vendor may have no duty to speak \nunder the circumstances, nevertheless if he does assume to speak he must make a full and \nfair disclosure as to the matters he discusses.”). \n47.  BB&T was not in a fiduciary relationship with Defendants.  There also is no \nevidence in the record that suggests that BB&T took “affirmative steps” to hide that it was \nmarketing and attempting to sell the loans.  There was no representation made to \nDefendants, express or implied, that BB&T would not sell the loans if the circumstances \nwarranted it.  Nor is there evidence, such as internal BB&T communications, that BB&T \ndirected their representatives involved in the negotiations with Defendant to conceal the fact \nthat it was attempting to sell the loans.  Accordingly, the record evidence fails to create an \nissue of fact that BB&T took “affirmative steps” to conceal that it was attempting to sell the \nLoans, and BB&T therefore did not have a duty to disclose on that basis. \n48.  Typically, commercial parties in arms-length negotiations with one another do \nnot have a duty to disclose.  See B&F Slosman v. Sonopress, Inc. , 148 N.C. App. 81, 86 (2001) \n(finding that the defendant had no duty to disclose to the plaintiffs where the plaintiffs “were \nsophisticated businessmen, who were experienced with transactions involving commercial \nleases”); Computer Decisions, Inc. v. Rouse Office Mgmt. of N.C., Inc. , 124 N.C. App. 383 \n(1996) (holding that where the two parties were sophisticated in negotiating commercial real \nestate transactions, the lessor did not have a duty to disclose to the lessee that it was \n \n \nnegotiating a lease with another party for the same premises); C.F.R. Foods, Inc. v. Randolph \nDev. Co., 107 N.C. App. 584, 589 (1992) (holding a commercial vendor owed no duty to disclose \nto a commercial vendee the presence of a landfill containing organic materials where vendee \nhad full opportunity to make pertinent inquiries and failed to do so).  As discussed above, \neven a party who formerly owed a fiduciary duty is no longer required to disclose once the \nparties are in adversarial positions and are represented by counsel, as BB&T and Defendants \nwere here. Piedmont Inst. of Pain Mgmt. , 157 N.C. App. at 583-84. \n49.  Defendants contend that “BB&T had a duty to speak under the totality of the \ncircumstances . . . because it knew about a ‘defect’ in the subject matter of the negotiations \nand  because it chose to speak and thus took on the duty to make ‘full and fair’ disclosure that \nit was marketing the [Loans].”64   Defendants claim that the “totality of circumstances” that \ncreated BB&T’s duty to disclose included the parties’ long-term, close business relationship \nand history of loan renewals; BB&T’s conduct during the restructuring negotiations in 2012; \nBB&T’s public representations regarding its honesty, integrity and transparency; and \nBB&T’s policy of ceasing communications with a customer once it puts a loan up for sale.   \n50.    The “totality of the circumstances,” however, includes all  of the undisputed \nfacts and not just those on which Defendants have chosen to focus.  Here, the undisputed \nfacts also show that Saunders and MAS were sophisticated business parties with vast \nexperience in the real estate business and in loan transactions. The undisputed facts further \nestablish that in January 2012, BB&T advised Defendants that it would not renew the Loans \nand demanded payment in full on or before March 2, 2012.  BB&T also sought forbearance \nagreements from Defendants, initiated foreclosure proceedings and sent Defendants multiple \nnotices that BB&T reserved all rights with regard to the Loans.  The loan restructuring \n                                                \n64  Defs.’ Br. at 20 (emphasis in original). \n \n \nnegotiations were handled by individuals with whom Saunders had not previously dealt and \nwho were associated with BB&T’s troubled loans group.  Both parties were represented by \ncounsel from the time BB&T notified Defendants of the default until the sale of the Loans to \nPlaintiff.  Accordingly, the undisputed facts make it clear that BB&T did not treat the \nrestructuring of the Loans in the same fashion that it had treated prior extensions and \nmodifications of the Loans with Saunders.  \n51.  With regard to BB&T’s representations about its honesty, integrity and \ntransparency, these types of general and vague corporate “puffing” could not reasonably have \nlead a businessman of Saunders’ experience to believe that BB&T would not sell the Loans.  \nIn addition, it is undisputed that Defendants were not aware of BB&T’s policy of ceasing \ncommunications with borrowers once BB&T put the customer’s loans up for sale.  In other \nwords, Defendants could not have relied upon the fact that BB&T was negotiating with them \nup until November 19, 2012, as an affirmative indication that BB&T was not  attempting to \nsell the loans. \n52.  The Computer Decisions, Inc., 124 N.C. App. 383, and B&F Slosman , 148 N.C. \nApp. 81, decisions are instructive on a commercial business entity’s duty to disclose during \nnegotiations with another business entity.  In  Computer Decisions, Inc., the plaintiff \ncorporation was negotiating with Defendant Rouse to lease commercial office space.  124 N.C. \nApp.  at 385.  Rouse was aware that the plaintiff had a short deadline for securing new office \nspace. Id.  at 385-86.  At an in-person meeting, the parties reached verbal agreement on the \nkey terms of an initial lease, but left certain other terms undecided.  Nevertheless, Rouse’s \nvice president stated, “[w]e have a deal.”  Id.   The parties later circulated draft terms which \nRouse signed, but the parties continued to negotiate over final terms. Id.  at 386. \nUnbeknownst to the plaintiff, Rouse was also negotiating with another prospective tenant to \nlease the same office space while it was negotiating with the plaintiff.  Shortly before the \n \n \nplaintiff needed to move into the new office space, Rouse notified the plaintiff that it had \nrented the space to another party. Id.  Computer Decisions brought claims against Rouse for \nbreach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair trade practices.  The fraud \nclaim was based on Rouse’s failure to disclose to the plaintiff that it was negotiating with \nanother tenant.  Id. at 388-89.  The trial court granted summary judgment on all claims, \nfinding that (1) any verbal agreement was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, and (2) \nRouse had no duty to disclose its negotiations with the other tenant.  Id.   In affirming \nsummary judgment, the Court of Appeals held that “there is no duty of disclosure in a \ncommercial real estate transaction between commercial parties.” Id. at 389. \n53.  In B&F Slosman , the plaintiff Slosman was negotiating the terms of an \nextension and expansion of a lease for plant space with the defendant corporation, Sonopress, \nInc. (“Sonopress”).  Despite several exchanges of written proposals and summaries of terms, \nthe parties never reduced the new lease to writing.  148 N.C. App. at 83-84.  Slosman, \nhowever, alleged that Sonopress had represented that “the parties had an agreement,” and \nthat the lease was being signed by Sonopress.  Id . at 86.  Sonopress moved into the expanded \nspace and began paying rent. Id.  at 84.  Sonopress subsequently refused to enter into a \nwritten lease, vacated the premises, and stopped paying rent.  Id.   Slosman sued Sonopress \nfor breach of lease, unjust enrichment, and unfair and deceptive business practices, and at \ntrial the court directed a verdict in Sonopress’ favor on all claims.  Id.  at 82. On appeal, \nSlosman argued that Sonopress was estopped from relying on the statute of frauds in defense \nof the claim for breach of lease because Sonopress fraudulently failed to disclose during the \nnegotiations (1) that the lease was subject to a corporate approval process, (2) that Sonopress \nhad no intention of agreeing to a five year lease term, and (3) that it had rejected written \nlease terms proposed by Slosman.  Id.  at 86-87.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal \nof the lease claim on statute of frauds grounds, holding that Sonopress did not have a duty \n \n \nto disclose because Slosman was a “sophisticated business[  ]” and was “experienced with \ntransactions involving commercial leases.”  Id.  at 87. \n54.  In this case, the undisputed facts are that Defendants were sophisticated \nbusiness entities highly experienced in commercial real estate loan transactions. It also is \nundisputed that Defendants were fully on notice of the adversarial nature of the restructure \nnegotiations with BB&T from the very beginning and were represented by counsel \nthroughout the negotiations.  Whatever past negotiations between Defendants and BB&T for \nloan extensions may have looked like, the 2012 restructure negotiations clearly were “arms-\nlength.”  BB&T never made any express representations to Defendants that it would not sell \nthe loans, nor could Defendants reasonably have assumed BB&T would not sell the loans \nmerely because it negotiated with Defendants over the course of several months.  Under these \nfacts, BB&T was not under a duty to disclose Defendants that it was attempting to sell the \nLoans.65  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s motion for summary judgment on Defendants’ \nclaim for fraud should be GRANTED. \nDefendants’ Claim for Breach of Contract \n55.  The Court will next consider the question of whether Defendants and BB&T \nreached a binding, enforceable agreement to modify the Loans at the October 29, 2012 \nmeeting.  Determination of this question is critical to the analysis of both of Plaintiff’s claims \nfor collection on the Loans, and impacts some of Defendants’ remaining claims.  In their \nSecond Claim for Relief, Defendants allege that the parties reached “a definitive, binding \nagreement to modify and restructure the two loans” at the October 29, 2012 meeting, that \nBB&T repudiated and breached the agreement by selling the Loans to Plaintiff, and that \n                                                \n65  At the hearing, Defendants’ counsel admitted that had BB&T disclosed that it was attempting to \nsell the Loans, Defendants could have declared bankruptcy, leaving BB&T with limited opportunity \nto fully collect on the Loans.  Defendants’ counsel claimed, however, that Defendants were acting in \ngood faith and would not have declared bankruptcy. \n \n \nPlaintiff breached that agreement by refusing to abide by the agreement reached between \nDefendants and BB&T. 66  \n56.  Plaintiff and BB&T move for summary judgment on Defendants’ breach of \ncontract claim on the grounds that the agreement being negotiated by the parties involved \nboth the conveyance of real property and a commercial loan commitment of more than \n$50,000, and was therefore subject to the statute of frauds.  Plaintiff and BB&T contend that \nsince the agreement was not reduced to writing, it cannot be enforced. 67   Defendants contend \nthat Plaintiff and BB&T should be estopped from raising the statute of frauds because BB&T \nfailed to disclose that it was trying to sell the Loans, and thereby committed fraud. 68  \n57.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals has recently restated the long-\nestablished proposition that “[i]f a contract falls within the statute of frauds, the party \nagainst whom enforcement is sought may generally avoid enforcement if there is no written \nmemorandum of that party’s assent to the contract.”  Plasma Ctrs. of Am., LLC v. Talecris \nPlasma Res., Inc. , 222 N.C. App. 83, 89 (2012).  In North Carolina “[a]ll contracts to sell or \nconvey any lands . . . shall be void unless said contract, or some memorandum or note thereof, \nbe put in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by some other person \nby him thereto lawfully authorized.” G.S. § 22-2.  In addition, G.S. § 22-5 requires any \n“commercial loan commitment . . . for a loan in excess of [$50,000]” to be in writing and signed \nby the party to be bound.  Again, it is undisputed that the agreement Defendants seek to \nenforce involved the restructuring of loans far in excess of $50,000 and the conveyance of \ncertain lands from Defendants to BB&T.  It also is undisputed that no written agreement \nwas ever signed by the parties. \n                                                \n66  Countercl. ¶¶ 53-59. \n67  Pl. & Third-Party Def.’s Joint Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) 14-16. \n68  Defs.’ Br. at 12-15. \n \n \n58.  Defendants do not dispute that the North Carolina statute of frauds would \napply to the agreement allegedly reached on October 29, 2012. Instead, Defendants argue \nthat BB&T should be equitably estopped from raising the defense of the statute of frauds in \nthis case because it had a “duty to disclose” to Defendants that it was trying to sell the Loans \nand failed to do so.   The North Carolina Supreme Court has recognized that “in proper cases \nan estoppel predicated upon grounds of silence or fraud may override the statute of frauds.” \nPowell v. City of Newton , 364 N.C. 562, 568 (2010) (quoting Callaham v. Arenson , 239 N.C. \n619, 626 (1954)).  “When faced with oral agreements involving real property interests, our \ncourts have limited the application of the equitable estoppel doctrine to situations where the \nparty seeking to invoke the statute of frauds has engaged in ‘plain, clear and deliberate \nfraud.’”   Macon Bank v. Gleaner , __ N.C. App. __, __, 770 S.E.2d 114, 119 (2015) (quoting B \n& F Slosman , 148 N.C. App. 81 (internal citations omitted)).  Thus, application of estoppel is \npredicated on a finding of actual fraud .  Id. \n59.  For the same reasons discussed fully above with regard to Defendants’ claim \nfor fraud, the Court concludes that BB&T did not have a duty to disclose under the \nundisputed facts in this record, and Defendants’ contention that Plaintiff should be estopped \nfrom raising the statute of frauds fails as a matter of law. Since the Court concludes that any \nagreement reached at the October 29, 2012 meeting would had to have been put in writing \npursuant to G.S. §§ 22-2 and 22-5, Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s motion for summary judgment on \nDefendants’ claim for breach of contract is GRANTED. 69  \nDefendants’ Claim for Declaratory Judgment \n                                                \n69  Plaintiff and BB&T also argue that no binding agreement was reached between the parties on \nOctober 29, 2012 because there was no “meeting of the minds” since the parties did not agree on all \nmaterial terms and because the written terms subsequently exchanged between the parties contained \nlanguage expressly disclaiming that an agreement had been reached.  Because the Court has \nconcluded that Defendants’ claim should be dismissed because of the statute of frauds, it does not \nreach this argument. \n \n \n60.  In their First Claim for Relief, Defendants seek a declaratory judgment \npursuant to G.S. §1-253 et seq . and North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 57.  In summary, \nDefendants seek a declaration regarding (a) whether the parties reached a binding and \nenforceable agreement to restructure the loans, and (b) whether BB&T has the “legal right” \nto sell the Loans to Plaintiff. 70   Plaintiff and BB&T seek summary judgment in their favor as \nthe claim for declaratory relief pursuant to Rule 56(b). \n61.  Under North Carolina law, a declaratory judgment is a statutory remedy that \ngrants a court the authority to “declare rights, status, and other legal relations” when an \n“actual controversy” exists between parties to a lawsuit. G.S. § 1-253; Pine Knoll Shores v. \nCarolina Water Serv., Inc. , 128 N.C. App. 321, 321-22 (1998). Summary judgment may be \ngranted on a claim for declaratory judgment if there remain no issues of material fact and \neither party is entitled to relief as a matter of law. Smith v. Marez , 217 N.C. App. 267, 270 \n(2011) (internal citation omitted). \n62.  With regard to Defendants’ request for a declaration addressing the existence \nand enforceability of an agreement to restructure the loans, for the reasons stated above, the \nCourt concludes the parties did not reach a binding and enforceable agreement to restructure \nthe Loans. \n63.  The promissory notes and deeds of trust comprising the Loans contain no \nrestrictions whatsoever on BB&T’s right to sell the loans. 71   There are no other facts in the \nrecord that suggest BB&T’s right to sell the Loans was restricted.  In addition, Defendants \ndo not make any argument that, absent an enforceable restructure agreement, BB&T did not \nhave the “legal right” to sell the Loans to a third party, including RREF.  \n                                                \n70  Countercl. ¶¶ 47-52. \n71  Dep.

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s motion for summary judgment on \nDefendants’ claim for declaratory judgment regarding the existence of a binding agreement \nto restructure the Loans and regarding BB&T’s right to sell the Loans to Plaintiff is \nGRANTED in Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s favor. \nPlaintiff’s Claims for Breach of Promissory Notes and Guaranties  \n65.  The Court will next consider Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on its \ntwo claims for breach of the Loans.  In its First Claim for Relief, Plaintiff alleges that Mark \nand Sibyl Saunders breached their obligations under the promissory note dated November 6, \n1997.  In the Second Claim for Relief, Plaintiff alleges that MAS breached its obligations \nunder the promissory note dated February 8, 2005, and that Mark and Sibyl Saunders \nbreached their obligations under the guaranty agreements that each of them executed on \nFebruary 8, 2005.  It is undisputed that the Loans were assigned by BB&T to Plaintiff on \nDecember 7, 2012, and RREF is now the holder of the Loans. \n66.  The facts regarding Plaintiff’s claims for relief are undisputed.  Defendants do \nnot dispute that they executed the promissory notes and guaranties, that the loans provided \npursuant to the promissory notes matured, that Defendants defaulted in their obligations \nonce the promissory notes matured, and that Defendants have not repaid the Loans.  \nDefendants’ sole defense to these claims is based on their contention that Defendants and \nBB&T reached a binding and enforceable agreement to restructure the Loans, and \naccordingly, that they have a new agreement with BB&T.  As discussed above, the Court \nalready has concluded that BB&T and Defendants did not enter into a binding and \nenforceable agreement to restructure the Loans.   \n67.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law on its First Claim for Relief as to Mark Saunders, and its Second Claim for \n \n \nRelief as to Mark Saunders and MAS Properties. The Motion for Summary Judgment as to \nPlaintiff’s First and Second Claims for Relief should be GRANTED as to those parties. \n68.  However, in light of Defendant Sibyl Saunders’ affirmative defense regarding \nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, discussed below, the Court finds that the Motion for \nSummary Judgment as to Plaintiff’s First and Second Claims for Relief should be DENIED \nas to Sibyl Saunders. \nDefendants’ Claim and Affirmative Defense for Violation of the ECOA \n69.  Movants seek summary judgment on Defendants’ affirmative defense under \nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”). 72   Defendants’ Eleventh Affirmative Defense \nalleges that BB&T violated the ECOA 73  and the related regulations adopted pursuant to the \nECOA (“Regulation B”)74  by requiring Sibyl Saunders to co-sign the 1997 Loan and guarantee \nthe 2005 Loan when Mark Saunders and MAS were independently creditworthy.    \nDefendants’ Eleventh Affirmative Defense contends that Plaintiff’s claims are barred based \nupon BB&T’s violation of the ECOA.   \n70.  The ECOA prohibits creditors from discriminating against “any applicant, \nwith respect to any aspect of a credit transaction . . . on the basis of race, color, religion, \nnational origin, sex or marital status.” 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a). 15 U.S.C. § 1691b provides the \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with the authority to “prescribe \nregulations to carry out the purposes of” the ECOA.  These regulations are collectively known \nas “Regulation B.” \n71.  Regulation B provides in pertinent part: \n(d)  Signature of spouse or other person. \n                                                \n72  Defendants originally alleged that BB&T violated the ECOA as their Ninth Claim for Relief, but \nvoluntarily dismissed that claim in response to Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s Motion to Dismiss and \npurported to incorporate the allegations from the Claim into their Eleventh Affirmative Defense. \n73  The ECOA is codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.  \n74  12 CFR 202.1 et seq.  \n \n \n \n(1)  Rule for qualified applicant. Except as provided in this paragraph, a \ncreditor shall not require the signature of an applicant's spouse or other \nperson, other than a joint applicant, on any credit instrument if the \napplicant qualifies under the creditor's standards of creditworthiness \nfor the amount and terms of the credit requested. A creditor shall not \ndeem the submission of a joint financial statement or other evidence of \njointly held assets as an application for joint credit.  \n \n[. . . .]  \n(5) Additional parties. If, under a creditor's standards of creditworthiness, \nthe personal liability of an additional party is necessary to support the \ncredit requested, a creditor may request a cosigner, guarantor, \nendorser, or similar party. The applicant's spouse may serve as an \nadditional party, but the creditor shall not require that the spouse be \nthe additional party. \n75   \nThe FDIC has issued Guidance on Regulation B stating that “if a creditor routinely requires \nspousal guarantees . . . . without first ascertaining whether an applicant is creditworthy, then \nthe conditioning of the loan on the spousal guarantee violates § 202.7(d)(1).”76  \n72.  The North Carolina Court of Appeals has recently suggested that a violation \nof the ECOA may serve as an affirmative defense in an action brought by a lender against a \nguarantor-spouse. RL Regi N.C., LLC v. Lighthouse Cove, LLC , __ N.C. App. __, 748 S.E.2d \n723 (2013), rev’d on other grounds , RL Regi N.C., LLC v. Lighthouse Cove, LLC , 367 N.C. \n425 (2014).  In RL Regi , the guarantor spouse had signed a forbearance agreement with the \nbank that “waiv[ed] and releas[ed] any claims . . . [and] release[d] and discharge[d] the \nLender . . . from any and all claims, defenses and causes of action.” RL Regi N.C., LLC , 367 \nN.C. at 426. On appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, the Supreme Court found \nthat the defendant had validly waived her ECOA claims as part of a “voluntary settlement,” \n                                                \n75  Regulation B, 12 C.F.R. § 202.7(d) (2015). \n76  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Financial Institution Letters: Guidance on Regulation B \nSpousal Signature Requirements (2004), available at \nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/2004/fil0604a.html.  \n \n \nwhich was not a “precondition to the original contract for credit.” Id. at 429-430 (citing \nBallard v. Bank of Am. , 734 F.3d 308, 314 (4th Cir. 2013)).  \n73.  During her deposition, Sibyl Saunders testified that she signed the promissory \nnotes at issue “simply because [she] was Mark’s spouse . . . . It was just something that the \nbank required in order for him to do what he needed to do businesswise.”77  Cox stated during \nhis deposition that BB&T’s regular practice was to require a personal guaranty by the spouse \nof the borrower unless the borrower requested otherwise. 78  Conversely, Hennessy stated that \nhe did not believe that spousal guaranties were required as a matter of course on commercial \nreal estate loans during the time period at issue, but that he could not say for certain without \nseeing the loan documents. 79  A question of fact therefore exists as to whether Sibyl Saunders \nvoluntarily signed the Loan promissory notes or was required to do so as Mark Saunders’ \nspouse, in violation of the ECOA. \n74.  Furthermore, the Court is persuaded that an issue of fact exists as to whether \nSibyl Saunders has waived any ECOA defense. The modification agreements signed in \nconnection with the Loans “affirm[ed] any and all obligations to [BB&T] and certif[ied] that \nthere [were] no defenses or offsets against said obligations.”80  This language is much \nnarrower in scope than the language addressed by the Supreme Court in RL Regi  N.C., LLC ., \nand is susceptible of multiple interpretations. Where a contract is ambiguous, the parties’ \nintent is a question of fact that must be resolved by a finder of fact. Cleland v. Children’s \nHome, Inc. , 64 N.C. App. 153, 157 (1983) (citing Silver v. Bd. of Transp., 47 N.C. App. 261, \n268 (1980)). \n                                                \n77  Deposition of Sibyl Saunders 43. \n78  Cox Dep. 49-50. \n79  Hennessy Dep. 52. \n80  See, e.g. , Dep. Exs. 139-140, 179-182.  \n \n \n75.  The Court finds that issues of fact exist as to whether BB&T required Sibyl \nSaunders to sign the Loans in violation of the ECOA, and whether Sibyl Saunders has waived \nany ECOA defense by signing the modification agreements at issue. Summary judgment is \ntherefore DENIED as to this defense and as to Plaintiff’s ability to recover against Sibyl \nSaunders on their First and Second Claims for Relief. \n \nDefendants’ Claim for Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith \n76.  Defendants allege as a Third Claim for Relief that “[u]nder the various loan \nagreements between BB&T and [Defendants], BB&T impliedly covenanted to them that it \nwould deal with them fairly and in good faith.”81   Defendants allege that BB&T breached this \ncovenant of good faith by its entire course of conduct including, inter alia : declaring the Loans \nin default; failing to renew the Loans once the motion for receivership was denied in the Bank \nof America lawsuit; failing to disclose to Defendants that it was attempting to sell the Loans; \nrequesting confidential financial information from Saunders that BB&T then disclosed to \nPlaintiff; failing to abide by the alleged agreement to restructure the loan; and selling the \nloans to Plaintiff for an inadequate sum without first offering them to Defendants.82   Since \nthe Court has determined that the undisputed facts establish that the parties did not enter \ninto a binding and enforceable agreement to restructure the Loans, Defendants’ claim must \nbe based on an implied covenant arising from the Loans themselves or from some other \nagreement.  Macon Bank , 2015 N.C. App. LEXIS 221 *9, n. 2. \n77.  In North Carolina, “[i]n every contract there is an implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing that neither party will do anything which injures the right of the other \nto receive the benefits of the agreement.” SunTrust Bank v. Bryant/Sutphin Prop., LLC , ___ \n                                                \n81  Countercl. ¶ 62. \n82  Id. ¶ 63. \n \n \nN.C. App. __, 732 S.E.2d 594, 603 (2012) (quoting Bicycle Transit Auth. v. Bell , 314 N.C. 219, \n228 (1985)).  A breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing “requires the \nwrongful intent of a party to deprive another party of its contractual rights.” Hamm v. Blue \nCross & Blue Shield of N.C. , 2010 NCBC 14, ¶80 (citing Dull v. Mut. of Omaha Ins. Co. , 85 \nN.C. App. 310, 318 (1987)). \n78.  Preliminarily, given the Court’s rulings in this Order regarding Defendants’ \nfraud and breach of contract claims, Plaintiff and BB&T’s motion for summary judgment on \nDefendants’ claim for breach of the covenant of good faith, to the extent Defendants’ claim is \npremised on BB&T’s failure to disclose and breach of the alleged agreement to restructure \nthe Loans, is GRANTED. \n79.  The other conduct on which Defendants rely in support of their claim simply \ndoes not create an issue of fact regarding whether BB&T breached of a duty of good faith and \nfair dealing arising from the Loans.  Defendants allege that BB&T somehow duped Saunders \ninto providing financial and other information to a real estate consultant, Mathias Linden, \nto be used in its foreclosure efforts and not for a restructuring agreement. 83   The evidence in \nthe record does not support this allegation.  In fact, the evidence cited by Defendants in \nsupport of this allegation does not show that BB&T misled Saunders, nor does it establish \nfor what purpose Linden was retained. 84  To the contrary, Bean’s email to Saunders \nintroducing Linden stated only that he was “a real estate consultant [  ] retained by BB&T to \nassist BB&T in certain situations” and that he would “aid BB&T in evaluating the proposal \nyou have submitted to BB&T regarding your loans with BB&T.”85   More significantly, \n                                                \n83  Defs.’ Br. at 7. \n84  Ex. 115; Hennessy Dep. 216-17; Gruendel Dep. 50-51. \n85  Ex. 115. \n \n \nDefendants have not pointed to any facts in the record showing that the information provided \nto Linden was used for any purpose other  than evaluating the restructuring proposals.  \n80.  Similarly, the evidence does not create any genuine issue of fact that BB&T \nacted unfairly or in bad faith by not offering Saunders the opportunity to buy the Loans before \nit sold them to Plaintiff.  BB&T was not under a contractual or any other obligation to offer \nto sell the loans to Saunders.  In addition, Hennessy testified without contradiction that \nBB&T would not sell a defaulted loan back to the customer at a discount because this would \nbe “a direct benefit to the guarantor who didn’t honor the obligations to begin with.”86  \n81.  Ultimately, the undisputed facts establish that BB&T did not breach a duty of \ngood faith and fair dealing arising from the Loans.  Rather, the restructure negotiations were \nan arms-length, adversarial process.  Both BB&T and Defendants took actions that they \nbelieved necessary to protect their own financial interests while continuing to attempt to \nreach a resolution on the restructure.  For example, Defendants refused to execute the \nforbearance agreements requested by BB&T.  The undisputed facts also show that although \nDefendants were in default on a multi-million dollar loan, BB&T did not immediately and \naggressively pursue its rights to foreclose.  Instead, BB&T negotiated with Defendants for \nover eight months and agreed upon most of the significant elements of a potential \nrestructure, but finally decided to protect its interests by selling the Loans to a third party. \nDefendants have failed to create an issue of fact regarding their claim for breach of a duty of \ngood faith and fair dealing, and Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s motion for summary judgment on this \nclaim should be GRANTED. 87  \n                                                \n86  Hennessy Dep. 293-95. \n87  BB&T also argues that since there was no breach of the underlying contract (the Loans), Defendants \ncannot establish a breach of a duty of good faith arising from the Loans.  In support of their argument, \nBB&T cites to SunTrust Bank v. Bryant/Sutphin Prop., LLC , 222 N.C. App. 821 (2012), in which the \nCourt of Appeals affirmed dismissal of a claim for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing, holding “[a]s the jury determined that plaintiff did not breach any of its contracts with \n \n \n \n \nDefendants’ Claim for Breach of Duty to Negotiate in Good Faith \n82.  As a Fourth Claim for Relief, Defendants have alleged that BB&T breached a \nduty to negotiate in good faith. 88   Defendants allege that “if the Court finds that BB&T and \n[Defendants] did not reach a binding agreement, they had nevertheless agreed on all terms \nnecessary to reach a binding agreement, and the parties therefore had a duty to negotiate \nand finalize the agreement in good faith.”89   Defendants allege that BB&T breached this duty \nby “repudiating the agreement” and selling the Loans to Plaintiff. 90   Defendants argue that \neven if no binding and enforceable agreement was reached on October 29, 2012, a finder of \nfact could still conclude that the parties reached a binding agreement to continue to negotiate \nin good faith, which BB&T breached by failing to inform Defendants that the November 1 \nterm sheet was its final offer and failing to communicate with BB&T after November 19, \n2012. 91    \n83.  BB&T contends that North Carolina has never recognized a claim for a duty to \nnegotiate in good faith, and urges the Court not to do so in this case.  Defendants concede \nNorth Carolina has not expressly recognized such a claim, but argue that it should under \nthese facts.  Defendants rely primarily on two cases recognizing a duty to negotiate that were \n                                                \ndefendants, it would be illogical for this Court to conclude that plaintiff somehow breached implied \nterms of the same contracts.” Id . at 833.  Defendants cite to the United States District Court’s decision \nin Robinson v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. , No. 5:12-CV-590-F, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50797 \n(E.D.N.C. Apr. 9, 2013), in which the court analyzed North Carolina appellate law  but did not \nexpressly discuss the Robinson  decision, and rejected the precise argument urged by BB&T here, \nnamely, that there must be some “other” breach of the express contract for a breach of the duty of good \nfaith and fair dealing claim to survive.  Since the Court has determined that Defendants’ claim fails \nfor other reasons, it does not address Plaintiff’s argument. \n88  Countercl. ¶¶ 66-70. \n89  Id.  ¶ 67. \n90  Id.  ¶ 68. \n91  Defs.’ Br. At 17-18. \n \n \ndecided under the laws, respectively, of West Virginia and New York, Burbach Broad. Co. of \nDel. v. Elkins Radio Corp ., 278 F.3d 401, 408-09 (4th Cir. 2002) and Sony Ericsson Mobile \nComm. USA, Inc. v. Agere Systems, Inc., 2007 NCBC 28 (N.C. Super. Ct. 2007), aff’d, 195 \nN.C. App. 577 (2009).  In Burbach , the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stated that it was \n“following the modern trend in contract law” and held that West Virginia would recognize a \nclaim based on a “binding preliminary agreement” between parties to continue negotiations \nin good faith without being bound to ultimately agree on a contract.  278 F.3d. at 407-09. The \nCourt based its conclusion in part on the grounds that West Virginia already recognized a \nclaim for good faith and fair dealing arising from a contract.  Id.  at 409.  The Fourth Circuit \nadopted the analysis applied by the court in Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. of Am. v. Tribune \nCo. , 670 F. Supp. 491 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), and described the “binding preliminary agreement” as \nfollows: \n[The] agreements do not commit the parties to their ultimate contractual \nobjective. Rather, they commit the parties to negotiate the open issues in good \nfaith in an attempt to reach the contractual objective within the agreed \nframework. Under this duty to negotiate in good faith, a party is barred from \nrenouncing the deal, abandoning the negotiations, or insisting on conditions \nthat do not conform to the preliminary agreement. \n278 F.3d at 407.  The Court further noted that: \nThis obligation does not guarantee that the final contract will be concluded if \nboth parties comport with their obligation, because good faith differences in \nthe negotiation of the open issues may prevent the parties from reaching a final \ncontract. It is also possible that the parties will lose interest due to changed \ncircumstances and will mutually abandon the negotiation. \n \nId.  at n.2. \n84.  In Sony Ericsson Mobile, the Honorable John R. Jolly, Jr. of this Court, \napplying New York law, also recognized a claim based on a “binding preliminary agreement,” \ndescribing it as follows: \nA preliminary agreement to negotiate is similar to a preliminary agreement \nwith open terms in that the parties agree to certain primary terms of the \n \n \nagreement and leave other terms to be negotiated. It is, however, different from \na preliminary agreement with open terms in that the parties do not agree to \nbe bound by any substantive terms, but rather agree to continue to negotiate \nall terms in good faith. Accordingly, a party to such an agreement is not bound \nby the substantive terms of the agreement, although it may be obligated to \nnegotiate. Such agreement may be enforceable. \n2007 NCBC at ¶ 18 n.5 (citing 1 Farnsworth on Contracts , § 3.8a, n.4 (3d ed. 2004); Ashland \nMgmt., Inc. v. Janien , 82 N.Y.2d 395, 624 N.E.2d 1007 (N.Y. 1993)). \n85.  Other courts also have held in accord with Burchbach  and Sony Ericsson  and \nadopted the reasoning in Teacher’s Ins. & Annuity Ass’n v. Tribune Co. to enforce preliminary \nagreements to negotiate in good faith. See, e.g. , Stanford Hotels Corp. v. Potomac Creek \nAssoc .., L.P., 18 A.3d 725, 735 (D.C. 2011)(citing Teacher’s Ins. & Annuity Ass’n , 670 F. Supp. \n491,  and recognizing enforceability of a binding preliminary agreement to negotiate in good \nfaith);  Gurley v. King , 183 S.W.3d 30 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005) (same); Cochran v. Norkunas , \n398 Md. 1, 919 A.2d 700 (Md. 2007)(same).  Other courts have recognized a claim based on \nan agreement to negotiate in good faith without specific reliance on Teacher’s Ins. & Annuity \nAss’n.  See e.g., Venture Assoc. Corp. v. Zenith Data Syst. Corp., 987 F.2d 429, 433 (7 th  Cir. \n1993) ; Itek Corp. v. Chicago Aerial Ind., Inc., 248 A.2d 625 (Del. 1968); 1 E. Allan Farnsworth, \nFarnsworth on Contract , § 3.26b (3d ed. 2004) (numerous cases cited therein). \n86.  In its recent decision in Butler v. Balolia, 736 F.3d 609 (1st Cir. 2013), the First \nCircuit Court of Appeals concluded that Washington would recognize a claim based on a \nbinding agreement to negotiate. Id.  at 614-16. In reaching this conclusion, the court \nconducted an exhaustive analysis of case law, treatises and other scholarly writings and \nfound that: \n[T]wo things seem clear.  First, many more jurisdictions have recognized the \nenforceability of contracts to negotiate than have repudiated the doctrine. . . . \nSecond, the trend line appears to be moving steadily in favor of recognizing a \ncause of action for breach of a contract to negotiate. \n \n \n \n736 F.3d at 614 (citations omitted). The court also considered the policy and practical \narguments in favor of, and against, the recognition of such a claim, and held that those \nconsiderations weighed in favor of finding that Washington would join the “trend line.” Id. \n87.  Defendants argue that the course of the negotiations, the substantial number \nof terms upon which the parties reached agreement on October 29, 2012, and BB&T’s words \nand conduct following the October 29 meeting created an agreement between the parties to \ncontinue to negotiate in good faith towards a final agreement.  Accordingly, Defendants \ncontend that BB&T “was required at a minimum to inform [Defendants]” that the November \n1 term sheet was a final offer, and that the failure to do so coupled with BB&T ceasing \ncommunications with Defendants constituted a breach of the duty. 92   The facts in this case \nshow that the parties reached agreement on almost every material term of a restructure \nagreement on October 29, 2012.  Defendants have presented evidence that “BB&T stressed \nthat the deal needed to, and would, close before the end of the year,” and that at the \nconclusion of the meeting “Saunders and Hennessy shook hands to acknowledge the \nagreement reached.”93   On November 1, 2012, Bean made an entry in BB&T’s internal system \nthat the parties “were successful in negotiating a structure for extension and deeds in lieu  \nwhich I will be submitting for approval in the next week or so.”  In addition, on November 1, \n2012, Gruendel emailed Jordan a revised term sheet summarizing the terms on which BB&T’ \nbelieved the parties had reached agreement.  The term sheet stated that it was “to facilitate \ndiscussion  on the terms contained herein.” 94  BB&T, however, never notified Defendants that \nBB&T considered the November 1 term sheet the last, best and final terms that BB&T would \naccept, leading Defendants to conclude that they could request further revisions, as they did \n                                                \n92  Id. at 18. \n93  Defs.’ Br. at 8-9. \n94  Dep. Ex. 97 (emphasis added). \n \n \non November 19.  Defendants have presented evidence that had Defendants accepted the \nNovember 1, 2012 term sheet, the restructure deal would have closed. 95  \n88.  The Court concludes that, based on the unique facts present in this case, \nDefendants’ claim for breach of a duty to negotiate in good faith may be viable.  First, as \ndiscussed above, other jurisdictions have recognized such a claim and the trend is in favor of \nrecognizing such claims.  Second, North Carolina already implies in every contract a duty of \ngood faith and fair dealing.  The Court sees no reason that an agreement to continue \nnegotiating in good faith would not be enforceable, provided that it met all of the \nrequirements for contract formation under North Carolina law.  A jury could conclude that \nwhile the parties did not reach a final agreement on all of the material terms of a restructure \ndeal in the October 29, 2012 meeting, their words and conduct established an agreement to \ncontinue negotiating in attempt to finalize the terms of the agreement and close on a \nrestructure agreement before the end of 2012. 96   While it did not bind either party to the final \nterms of a restructure deal, such an agreement would carry with it an implied obligation that \nthe parties to conduct any further negotiations of the terms in good faith. A jury also could \nfind that BB&T’s failure to notify Defendants that the November 1, 2012 term sheet was its \nbest and final offer after months of negotiations, and BB&T’s decision to cease \ncommunications with Defendants after Defendants responded to the term sheet, were not \n“fair dealing” or in “good faith.”  Accordingly, the Court concludes that there are disputed \nissues of fact regarding whether the parties entered in an agreement to continue negotiating \nin good faith, and whether BB&T breached such an agreement, and that Plaintiff’s and \n                                                \n95  Hennessy Dep. 274; Saunders Aff. ¶ 34. \n96  North Carolina recognizes that oral agreements may constitute enforceable contracts. See, e.g. , \nKornegay v. Aspen Asset Gp., LLC , 204 N.C. App. 213, 221 (2010). Of course, Defendants still would \nbe required to show that all elements of an enforceable contract under North Carolina law, including \nthe consideration exchanged for the agreement.  \n \n \nBB&T’s motion for summary judgment as to Defendants’ Fourth Claim for Relief should be \nDENIED.  \nDefendants’ Claim for Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \n89.  In their Seventh Claim for Relief, Defendants allege that BB&T and Plaintiff \ncommitted unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of G.S. § 75-1.1 et seq .  \nDefendants allege that “BB&T’s and [Plaintiff’s] breaches of contract are accompanied by \nsubstantial aggravating circumstances, including” BB&T providing Defendants’ “confidential \nfinancial information” to Plaintiff. 97   In their brief, Defendants contend that their unfair and \ndeceptive practices claim is not “exclusively based on a breach of contract with substantial \naggravating circumstances.” 98   Rather, Defendants allege that the claim is based on \n“fraudulent concealment, lying, reliance, and damage from the other claims” raised by their \nComplaint. 99   Plaintiff and BB&T contend that the claim for unfair  \n90.  G.S. § 75-1.1 declares unlawful any “[u]nfair methods of competition in or \naffecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” To \nstate a claim under G.S. § 75-1.1, a plaintiff must allege (1) that the defendant committed an  \nunfair or deceptive act or practice, or unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting \ncommerce, (3) which proximately caused actual injury to the plaintiff or his business.

Son-\nLan Dev. Co., Inc ., 205 N.C. App. 133, 143 (2010) (quoting Walker v. Branch Banking & Trust \nCo. , 133 N.C. App. 580, 583 (1999)). “Stated another way, a party is guilty of an unfair act or \n                                                \n97  Countercl. ¶¶ 95-97. \n98  Defs.’ Br. 17-18. \n99  Id . \n \n \npractice when it engages in conduct which amounts to an inequitable assertion of its power \nor position.” Id.  (citation omitted). “A practice is deceptive if it has the capacity or tendency \nto deceive.” Id. (citation and alteration omitted). \n91.  The Court has concluded that that issues of material fact exist regarding \nDefendants’ claim for breach of duty to negotiate in good faith.  The same conduct upon which \nDefendant might be able to establish that BB&T acted unfairly or in bad faith arguably also \ncould be sufficient to constitute conduct that is unfair or deceptive within the meaning of G.S. \n§ 75-1.1.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that there are material issues of disputed fact \nwhich must be resolved in order to make a determination on Defendants’ claim for unfair and \ndeceptive trade practices, and that Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s motion for summary judgment as \nto Defendants’ Seventh Claim for Relief should be DENIED. 100  \nDefendants’ Claim for Indemnity \n92.  Finally, in their Eighth Claim for Relief, entitled “Indemnity/Subrogation,” \nDefendants contend that, to the extent that Defendants are found to be liable to RREF, this \nliability is derivative of BB&T’s actions and that BB&T should be liable in the amount of any \njudgment entered against Defendants in favor of RREF. \n93.  Under North Carolina law, a right of indemnification may arise in three \ncircumstances: (1) an express contract; (2) a contract implied-in-fact; and (3) a contract \nimplied-in-law. Carl v. State , 192 N.C. App. 544, 557-58 (2008). 101  In Defendants’ brief in \n                                                \n100  The Court also notes that the parties dispute whether or not Defendants suffered injury as a result \nof BB&T’s conduct in this case. \n101  Because Defendants have since identified their claim as one for indemnification, the Court’s \nanalysis will focus on that legal theory instead of subrogation. Subrogation is an equitable concept \nthat allows for “the substitution of one person in the place of another with reference to a lawful claim \nor right.” Gen. Ins. Co. v. Faulkner , 259 N.C. 317, 324 (1963) (internal quotations omitted). \n“Subrogation rights are categorized as either the right of conventional subrogation—that is, \nsubrogation by agreement between the insurer and the insured—or the right of equitable subrogation, \nby operation of law, upon the payment of the loss.” In re A Declaratory Ruling by the N.C. Comm’r of \nIns. Regarding  11 N.C.A.C. 12.0319 , 134 N.C. App. 22, 31 (1999) (internal quotations omitted). Even \n \n \nresponse to the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants explicitly stated that “Defendants’ indemnity \nclaim is an indemnity implied-in-law claim.”102  Defendants go on to say that the Court should \nnot “get tangled in the label for the claim for relief,” because Defendants are “simply claiming \nthat” BB&T must bear any of Defendants’ liability to RREF. 103  The parties do not dispute \nthat Counterclaim Eight “rises or falls” with Defendants’ other Counterclaims. 104  \n94.  “[T]he indemnity implied-in-law arises from an underlying tort, where a \npassive tort-feasor pays the judgment owed by an active tort-feasor to the injured third \nparty.” Kaleel Builders, Inc. v. Ashby , 161 N.C. App. 34, 39 (2003). The “implied contract” \narises from the passive tort-feasor’s discharge of an obligation owed by the active tort-feasor, \nwhich entitles the passive tort-feasor to recover from the active tort-feasor. Id.  \n95.  Therefore, for this doctrine to apply to the case at bar, Defendants would be a \n“passive tort-feasor” and, more significantly, BB&T would have to be the “active tort-feasor” \nagainst RREF . There are no claims in this case suggesting that BB&T has committed a tort, \neither directly or through Defendants, against RREF.  Though Defendants urge the Court \nnot to be constrained by the doctrine of indemnification, Defendants have presented the \nCourt with no other legal basis from which to conclude that BB&T should be liable for any \ndebt owed by Defendants to RREF.  Plaintiff’s and BB&T’s motion for summary judgment as \nto Defendants’ claim for indemnification/subrogation should be GRANTED. \nCONCLUSION \n NOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, it hereby is ORDERED that:  \n                                                \nif the legal doctrine of subrogation were to extend to a situation like that before the Court, it is \nundisputed that there exists no “subrogation by agreement” and that Defendants have not yet paid \nany amount due under the loans such that equitable subrogation would be appropriate. Subrogation \nis therefore not appropriately before the Court at this time.  \n102  Defs.’ Br. Opp. Pl.’s & Third-Party Def.’s Joint Mot.
