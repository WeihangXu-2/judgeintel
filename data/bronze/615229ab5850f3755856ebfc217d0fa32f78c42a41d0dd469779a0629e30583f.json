Lodge on Lake Lure, LLC, 2016 NCBC 84. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nRUTHERFORD COUNTY \n \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n15 CVS 221 \nHORST V. BRUNNER, \n  \n                                    Plaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nTHE LODGE ON LAKE LURE, LLC, \n \n                                   Defendant. \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON MOTION \nFOR INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court ex mero motu and on the Motion for \nInvoluntary Dismissal (“Motion”) filed by David R. Hillier, duly -appointed Receiver \n(“Receiver”) for Defendant The Lodge on Lake Lure, LLC (“ Defendant” or “ the \nLodge”), in the above-captioned case.  Having reviewed the Motion  and the Court’s \ndocket in this case  and the Related Cases, as that term is defined below , the Court \nhereby GRANTS the Motion. \nGum, Hillier & McCroskey, P.A., by David R. Hillier, as Receiver for \nDefendant The Lodge on Lake Lure, LLC. \n \nBledsoe, J. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n2. The above case is one of several related matters pending before the Court \ninvolving claims against the Lodge.  McCarthy v. The Lodge on Lake Lure, LLC, No. \n15 CVS 1156  (Rutherford County)  was designated to the Court as a mandatory \ncomplex business case and assigned to the undersigned on November 16, 201 5.  On \n \n \nDecember 21, 2015, the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court \ndesignated to the undersigned as Rule 2.1/2.2 complex business cases: (1) this action; \n(2) Hopke v. The Lodge Catering Service, No. 14 CVS 797 (Rutherford County); and \n(3) Brunner v. Brunner, 14 CVS 918 (Rutherford County).  On January 14, 2016, the \nChief Justice also designated Bellin v. The Lodge Catering Service, No. 14 CVS 1086 \n(Rutherford County) to the undersigned as a Rule 2.1/2.2 complex business case.   \nCollectively, the Court refers to these five cases as the “Related Cases.” \n3. In a January 15, 2016 order in each of the Related Cases, the Court ordered \nthe parties in the Related Cases to participate in a joint mediation.  All parties, except \nfor Plaintiff Horst V. Brunner (“Brunner”), participated in a single mediation on April \n21, 2016.  In a May 9, 2016 Motion for Order Approving Interim Distribution filed in \nthis action, the Receiver reported that the parties in the Related Cases had reached \na settlement agreement to resolve the remaining claims  in the Related Cases .  \nBrunner has not appeared in any of the Related Cases since their designation to the \nundersigned, and he did not participate in the mediation.  As a result, the settlement \ndid not resolve his claims in this action.   \n4. The Court’s June 30, 2016 order in each of the Related Cases approved the \nReceiver’s proposed final accounting and final distribution and directed the Receiver \nto disburse funds held in receivership to effectuate the parties’ settlement agreement.  \nIn that order, the Court also directed counsel to file voluntary dismissals in each \naction once the settlement had been effectuated  to comply with the settlement \nagreement.  In light of Brunner’s lack of participation in the  Related Cases to date, \n \n \nthe Court forecast in the June 30, 2016 order that it would entertain a motion for \ninvoluntary dismissal in this action in the event Brunner remained absent from this \nlitigation. \n5. The Receiver filed the present Motion on July 19, 2016.  The Receiver’s \nMotion seeks involuntary dismissal of this action—15 CVS 221—for Brunner’s failure \nto prosecute this lawsuit.  The briefing period on the Motion  has since concluded, \nBrunner has failed to respond to the Motion  or otherwise appear, and the Motion is \nripe for resolution.   \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n6. “For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any \norder of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim therein \nagainst him.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 41(b).   “Unless the court in its order for dismissal \notherwise specifies, a dismissal under this section . . . operates as an adjudication \nupon the merits.”  Id. \n7. In light of the severity of dismissal as a sanction in a civil case, “the trial \ncourt must . . . consider lesser sanctions when dismissing a case pursuant to Rule \n41(b) for failure to prosecute.”  Wilder v. Wilder, 146 N.C. App. 574, 576, 553 S.E.2d \n425, 426–27 (2001).  Specifically, a trial court judge must consider “(1) whether the \nplaintiff acted in a manner which deliberately or unreasonably delayed the matter; \n(2) the amount of prejudice, if any, to the defendant; and (3) the reason, if one exists, \nthat sanctions short of dismissal would not suffice.”  Id. at 428, 146 N.C. App. at 578.  \n \n \n \nIII. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n8. The Court makes the following FINDINGS OF FACT for the purpose of \nruling on the MOTION: \n9. Brunner is “a German national who resides in Rutherford Co unty, North \nCarolina . . . and also in South Africa.”  (Compl. ¶ 1.)  He is the sole Plaintiff in this \naction, and he also is a Defendant in three of the Related Cases:  14 CVS 797, 15 CVS \n1156, and 14 CVS 918.     \n10. The Lodge is a North Carolina limited liability company whose principal \nasset was a piece of commercial real estate in Lake Lure, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶ \n2.)  Brunner is the principal and sole member of the Lodge.  (Compl. ¶ 1.) \n11. Brunner filed this action on December 19, 2014, bringing claims for judicial \ndissolution, the appointment of a receiver, and the resolution of claims against the \nLodge.  (Compl. ¶ 15.)  Brunner had apparently located a purchaser for the Lodge’s \nproperty but was unable to convey the property because of the pending claims against \nthe Lodge.  (Compl. ¶ 13.) \n12. On April 30, 2015, prior to the transfer of any of the Related Cases to the \nundersigned, Senior Resident Superior Court Judge J. Thomas Davis appointed \nDavid R. Hillier as Receive r for the Lodge in this action.   Judge Davis found that a \nreceiver was necessary to manage the Lodge given the likelihood of success on the \nmerits of Plaintiff’s claim for judicial dissolution.  At the time of the appointment, the \n \n \nLodge’s real estate had already been liquidated, and those proceeds comprised \nsubstantially all of the Lodge’s remaining assets.   \n13. On May 21, 2015, several months before any of the Related Cases were \nassigned to the undersigned, the Rutherford County Clerk of Superior Court entered \ndefault against Brunner for his failure to answer or otherwise respond to the \ncomplaint in 14 CVS 797.  Superior Court Judge Marvin P. Pope entered a default \njudgment against Brunner in that action two months later  in the amount of \n$137,783.60.  \n14. Since designation to the undersigned, Brunner has not made any \nappearances before the Court nor has he otherwise participated or been represented \nby counsel in this action or in any of the other Related Cases. \n15. Through the parties’ mediation, the Receiver has resolved all claims brought \nagainst the Lodge in the Related Cases, except for Brunner’s claims in this action.  As \nthe parties effectuate the settlement agreement and resolve the Related Cases, t he \nReceiver desires to seek an order from the Court terminating the receivership.   \n16. Brunner has not responded to the Receiver’s Motion for Involuntary \nDismissal in this action. \n17. The Court has considered lesser  sanctions against Brunner , including  \nmonetary sanctions and the exercise of its contempt powers.  \n \n \n \n \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n18. The Court makes the following CONCLUSIONS OF LAW for the purpose of \nruling on the MOTION: \n19.  “Provided a plaintiff has not been lacking in diligence, the mere passage of \ntime does not justify dismissal for failure to prosecute as our cour ts are primarily \nconcerned with the trial of cases on their merits.”  In re Will of Kersey, 176 N.C. App. \n748, 751, 627 S.E.2d 309, 311 (2006) (citation omitted).  Nevertheless, the Court may \nproperly dismiss a claim for failure to prosecute “where the pla intiff manifests an \nintention to thwart the progress of the action to its conclusion, or by some delaying \ntactic plaintiff fails to progress the action toward its conclusion.”  Id. \n20. Brunner’s abandonment of his claims in this case and the other Related \nCases deliberately and unreasonably delays th e final adjudication of this action .  \nBrunner’s nonparticipation in this case and in the other Related Cases, including the \nentry of default judgment against him in 14 CVS 797 more than one year ago, goes \nbeyond a “mere passage of time” and constitutes an unreasonable delay of th is \nlitigation similar to that found and affirmed in Cohen v McLawhorn, 208 N.C. App. \n492, 704 S.E.2d 519 (2010).  In Cohen, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s \nconclusion that th e plaintiff had deliberately and unreasonably delayed the matter \nwhere “plaintiff did absolutely nothing to prosecute his case over more than a year’s \ntime, and, then, when defendants calendared the trial in order to have the case \nresolved, plaintiff ignored the trial.”  Id. at 502–03, 704 S.E.2d at 527.   \n \n \n21. Here, the Receiver’s most recent fee report reflects that Brunner has been \nin communication with the Receiver as recently as April 2016 .  (Receiver’s Consent \nMot. to Approve Receiver’s Final Accounting an d Final Distribution , Ex. A .)  \nNevertheless, Brunner has failed to make an appearance , participate in the court -\nrequired mediation on April 21, 2016 , respond to the Motion , or take any action in \nconnection with the prosecution of this case since prior to this action’s transfer to the \nundersigned over ten months ago.  On the basis of this conduct, the Court concludes \nthat Brunner’s “wholesale failure to prosecute . . . constitute[s] a delaying tactic” \nsufficient to support a conclusion that the first Wilder factor is satisfied.  Cohen, 208 \nN.C. App. at 503, 704 S.E.2d at 527.  See also Foy v. Hunter, 106 N.C. App. 614, 618, \n418 S.E.2d 299, 302 (1992) (“Whether a plaintiff . . . has engaged in some delaying \ntactic may be inferred from the facts surrounding the delay in the prosecution of the \ncase.”).    \n22. With regard to the second Wilder factor, t he Lodge  is significantly \nprejudiced by Brunner’s failure to prosecute this case.  In a Rule 41(b) analysi s, \nevaluating the prejudice to a defendant may include consideration of the time, energy, \nand finances expended.  United States v. Merrill, 258 F.R.D. 302, 309 (E.D.N.C. 2009) \n(applying F.R. Civ. P. 41(b) and considering the significant time and energy expended \nby defendants to advance their interests in the litigatio n).1  Indeed, our Court of \nAppeals has affirmed a Rule 41(b) dismissal based upon a trial court ’s conclusions \n                                                 \n1  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) is nearly identical to North Carolina’s Rule 41(b), and \ncases construing the federal Rule 41(b) have instructional value in North Carolina.  Wilder, \n146 N.C. App. at 577–78, 553 S.E.2d at 427. \n \n \nthat the plaintiff’s failure to prosecute had prejudiced defendants who had, over six \nyears, “expended considerable time and resources” and “participated reasonably and \nactively to reach a resolution” in the case.   Lentz v. Phil’s Toy Store , 228 N.C. App. \n416, 423, 747 S.E.2d 127, 132 (2013). \n23. In this case, a t the time of the Receiver’s appointment, substantially all of \nthe Lodge’s assets had already been liquidated, and the Receiver’s primary task was \nto resolve claims against the Lodge.  The Receiver, together with counsel for all other \nparties in the Related Cases, has reached a settlement agreement resolving all of the \noutstanding claims aga inst the Lodge in the Related Cases .2   Judge Davis’s order \nfound that the appointment of the Receiver was necessary “pending the Court’s \ndecision on dissolution and if dissolution is decreed to wind up the defendant and \ncomplete the dissolution.”  (Order Appointing Receiver ¶ 4.)  If Brunner’s abandoned \nclaim for dissolution is not dismissed, the Lodge will be forced to remain in a \nreceivership, despite the fact that the Receiver has already expended significant time \nand resources in fulfilling his duties on behalf of the Lodge.  The Court therefore \nconcludes that the Lodge will be significantly prejudiced if Brunner’s claims are not \ndismissed. \n24.  As to the final Wilder factor, the Court has considered less drastic sanctions \nto address Brunner’s failure to prosecute this case , and the Court concludes that no \nsanction short of dismissal will suffice in the circumstances presented here .  In \n                                                 \n2  The sale of the Lodge’s real property and the resolution of claims against it were primary \nmotives in Brunner’ s bringing this action.  Because Brunner has essentially received the \nrelief he originally requested, the Court further concludes that Brunner is unlikely to appear \nand bring this case to conclusion. \n \n \nconsidering lesser sanctions, the Court “is not required to list and specifically reject  \neach possible lesser sanction prior to determining that dismissal is appropriate.”  \nBadillo v. Cunningham, 177 N.C. App. 732, 735, 629 S.E.2d 909, 911 (2006). \n25. The Court concludes that lesser sanctions would not be effective in this case.  \nThe Court could impose a monetary sanction or use its contempt powers to compel \nBrunner’s compliance and participation.  However, Brunner has already suffered a \nsix-figure default judgment against him in one of the Related Cases, which he has not \nsought to contest or vaca te since its entry over a year ago .  Brunner’s apparent \ntolerance of that judgment suggests that any sanction against him in this action short \nof dismissal will not impose a unique penalty likely to compel Brunner’s renewed \nlitigation of this action.   \n26. Having considered the relevant factors under Wilder, the Court concludes , \nbased upon its findings of facts and conclusions of law, as well as in the exercise of its \ndiscretion, that Brunner has failed to prosecute this action and that dismissal under \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 41(b) is warranted.   \n27. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby GRANTS the Motion and DISMISSES \nPlaintiff’s Complaint with prejudice. \nSO ORDERED, this the 3rd day of November, 2016. \n \n \n \n \n      /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III   \n      Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n      Special Superior Court Judge \n        for Complex Business Cases \n "
