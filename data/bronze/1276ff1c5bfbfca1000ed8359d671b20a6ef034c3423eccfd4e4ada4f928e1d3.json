  "raw_text": "NAMS Holdings, LLC v. Reece, 2018 NCBC 32. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 12288 \n \nNAMS HOLDINGS, LLC, a Delaware \nLimited Liability Company, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nGRANT C. REECE; JAMES B. \nCHAPMAN; and SMART \nPROCESSING, LLC, a North \nCarolina Limited Liability Company, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION  \nON MOTION TO DISMISS  \nCOUNTERCLAIMS \n \n \n1. Plaintiff NAMS Holdings, LLC (“NAMS”) acquired the payment-processing \nbusiness of Defendants Grant C. Reece and James B. Chapman in 2014.  As part of \nthe deal, Reece and Chapman became members of NAMS.  They agreed, among other \nthings, to present new business opportunities  to NAMS and not to solicit its \ncustomers and client s for a term of five years.  NAMS now contends that Reece, \nChapman, and Reece’s new company, Smart Processing, LLC (collectively , \n“Defendants”), violated these obligations.   \n2. In response, Defendants deny any wrongdoing and assert counterclaims for \nindemnification and the advancement of legal fees and expenses incurred in \ndefending this lawsuit .  Defendants base their claims on language in NAMS’s  \noperating agreement , which requires NAMS to indemnify any person for losses \nincurred “by reason of the fact” that the person is a member of the company.  Because \nReece and Chapman are members of NAMS, Defendants contend they are entitled to \nindemnification and advancement. \n3. NAMS moves to dismiss the counterclaims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the \nNorth Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  Having considered the motion, the briefs \nsupporting and opposing the motion, and the parties’ arguments at the hearing on \nJanuary 25, 2018, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion to \ndismiss. \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A., by Adam K. Doerr and Charles H. \nBowyer, for Plaintiff.  \n \nAlexander Ricks, PLLC , by Alice C. Richey and Lucas D. Garber, for \nDefendants.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \n4. Reece and Chapman  are the former owners of  a payment-processing \nbusiness known as North American Merchant Services, Inc .  In 2014, they sold the \nbusiness to NAMS, a Delaware limited liability company.   \n5. To effectuate the sale, the parties executed two agreements.  (See Answer to \nAm. Compl & Am. Countercl. ¶  7, ECF No. 43  [“Countercl.”].)  The first is NAMS’s \noperating agreement (“LLC Agreement”), which governs its organization and \noperation.  (ECF No. 17.2 [“ LLC Agreement ”].)  The LLC Agreement divides the \ncompany’s membership into two classes.  ANARAQ NAMS Holdings LLC became the \nsole Class A member.  (See LLC Agreement Ex. A.)  Reece and Chapman became, and \nremain, Class B members.  (See Countercl. ¶¶ 7–9; LLC Agreement Ex. A.)  As Class \nB members, Reece and Chapman do not have managerial authority and may not take \nactions on behalf of NAMS.  (See LLC Agreement §§ 5.1, 6.1.)  \n6. The second agreement, a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”), details \nthe terms of the sale.  ( ECF No. 36.3  [“SPA”].)  NAMS acquired all outstanding \ninterests in the payment-processing business, and i n return, Reece and Chapman \nreceived cash payments and their Class B membership interests in NAMS.  (See SPA \n§§ 2.1, 2.2.)  Reece and Chapman  also agreed to a number of restrictive covenants, \nincluding an agreement not to solicit NAMS’s “merchant customer[s]” and “merchant \nclient[s]” for a period of five years .  (SPA §  9.3(b), (c).)  In addition, Reece and \nChapman “shall have the duty to communicate or present” certain business \nopportunities to NAMS in the event either “acquires knowledge” of the opportunity \n“while . . . hold[ing] Class B Units.”  (SPA § 9.5.) \n7. NAMS contends that Defendants breached these obligations.  In its original \ncomplaint, NAMS alleged that it sold most or all of its assets to CMS Processing, LLC \n(“Clarus”) in late 201 6.  (Com pl. ¶  14, ECF No. 3.)  A few months later, Clarus \ninformed NAMS that Defendants had successfully persuaded a number of merchants \nto stop doing business with Clarus and instead to use the services of Smart \nProcessing.  ( See Compl. ¶ 17.)  NAMS immediately filed this action, claiming that \nDefendants breached section 9.3 of the SPA and parallel non-solicitation provisions \nin the LLC Agreement.  (Compl. ¶¶ 19–21, 25.)  NAMS also moved for a preliminary \ninjunction, which the Court denied.  (ECF No. 29.) \n8. NAMS amended its complaint on September 25, 2017, adding new \nallegations and revising its claims .  The amendments omit any claim for breach of \nthe LLC Agreement but introduce new allegations that Reece and Chapman breached \nsection 9.5 of the SPA by diverting business opportunities to themselves .  (See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 69–72, ECF No. 36.)  NAMS seeks indemnification for the breaches and a \ndeclaratory judgment that Reece and Chapman, as Class B members, are subject to \nsection 9.5.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 118–26, 134–38.) \n9. The amendments also  introduce a claim for tortious interference with \ncontract.  NAMS alleges that Reece and Chapman, “[a]s Class B Members of NAMS,” \nwere “apprised of” the transactions  with Clarus .  ( See Am. Compl . ¶  129; LLC \nAgreement § 8.4.)  It further alleges that Defendants interfered with the agreements \nbetween NAMS and Clarus by intentionally soliciting and converting merchants, \ncausing NAMS to breach the agreements.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 130–33.) \n10. Defendants timely answered and filed counterclaims for  indemnification \nand advancement.  ( See Countercl. ¶¶ 19, 23–37.)  The counterclaims are based on \nsection 5.4 of the LLC Agreement, which states that NAMS must indemnify any \nperson “against any losses, liabilities, damages and expenses . . . incurred or suffered \nby” the person “by reason of the fact that” he “is or was a Member” of NAMS.  (LLC \nAgreement § 5.4(a).)  It also states that  NAMS must “pay the expenses incurred by \nany [person] indemnifiable hereunder, as such expenses are incurred, in connection \nwith any proceeding in advance of the final disposition .  . . .”  (LLC Agreement \n§ 5.4(a).) \n11. According to Defendants, each of NAMS’s claims is based, at least in part, \non Reece and Chapman’s status as Class B members.  ( See Countercl. ¶ 27.)  This, \nDefendants contend, entitles them to indemnification as well as advancement of the \nlegal fees and expenses incurred in defending this lawsuit.  ( See Countercl. ¶¶ 28, \n35.)   \n12. NAMS moved to dismiss the counterclaims on November 27, 2017.  (ECF \nNo. 48.)  The motion has been fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing on January \n25, 2018 , at which counsel for all parties appeared.  The motion is ripe for \ndetermination. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n13. A motion to dism iss under Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency” of the \nclaims for relief.  Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs Grp., Inc. 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 \nS.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).  The motion should be granted only (1) when the defendant’s \npleading on its face r eveals that no law supports the counterclaim; (2) when the \npleading on its face reveals the absence of a fact sufficient to make a good claim; or \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the pleading necessarily defeats the counterclaim.  See \nJackson v. Bumgardner, 318 N.C. 172, 175, 347 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1986). \n14. In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must treat the well -pleaded \nallegations of the counterclaims as true and view the facts and permissible inferences \n“in the light most favorable to” the non-moving party.  Ford v. Peaches Entm’t Corp., \n83 N.C App. 155, 156, 349 S.E.2d 82, 83 (1986); see also Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, \n98, 176 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1970).  “[T]he court is not required to accept as true any \nconclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact.”  Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, \n147 N.C. App. 52, 56, 554 S.E.2d 840, 844 (2001).   \n15. The Court “may properly consider documents which are the subject of” the \ndefendant’s pleading without converting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into one for summary \njudgment.  Weaver v. St. Joseph of the Pines, Inc., 187 N.C. App 198, 204, 652 S.E.2d \n701, 707 (2007). \nIII. \nANALYSIS  \n \n16. Defendants ground their  counterclaims for indemnification and \nadvancement in section 5.4(a) of the LLC Agreement.  NAMS contends that section \n5.4(a), by its terms, does not apply to the claims in the amended complaint .  This \ndispute requires the Court to interpret the operating agreement of NAMS, a \nDelaware limited liability company.  Thus, Delaware law gov erns.  See, e.g., Meyers \nv. Quiz-DIA LLC, 2017 Del. Ch. LEXIS 96, at *10 –11 (Del. Ch. June 6, 2017) ; Cable \nTel Servs. v. Overland Contr., 154 N.C. App. 639, 642, 574 S.E.2d 31, 33 (2002) (noting \nthat North Carolina courts generally apply “[t]he law of the state chosen by the \nparties to govern their contractual rights and duties”). \nA. “By Reason of the Fact” \n17. Under Delaware law, limited liability companies have “broad authority to \nprovide for indemnification” of their members and managers “by contract in their \noperating agreements.”  Senior Tour Players 207 Mgmt. Co. LLC v. Golftown 207 \nHolding Co. LLC , 853 A.2d 124, 127 (Del. Ch. 2004); see also Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \n§ 18-108.  “The scope of a party’s right to indemnification under an operating \nagreement is the refore governed by contractual principles.”  Meyers, 2017 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 96, at *11 .  When interpreting the agreement , “the role of a court is to \neffectuate the parties’ intent.”  Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Am. Legacy Found., 903 A.2d \n728, 739 (Del. 2006).  \n18. Here, the LLC Agreement requires NAMS to indemnify any person “to the \nfullest extent permitted under” Delaware law if that person incurs losses “by reason \nof the fact that” he “is or was a Member” of the company.  (LLC Agreement § 5.4(a).)  \nThe key phrase —“by reason of the fact” —is imported from the Delaware statute \ngoverning indemnification of corporate directors and officers.  See Del. Code Ann. tit. \n8, §  145(a)–(b).  This use of  statutory language has interpretive significance , \nsuggesting an intent to absorb the substantial  body of precedent construing and \napplying section 145.  In analogous cases, Delaware courts have held that “case law \ninterpreting that statutory provision bears on” the construction of  the phrase “by \nreason of the fact” as used in  an LLC’s operating agreement.  Costantini v. Swiss \nFarm Stores Acquisition LLC, 2013 Del. Ch. LEXIS 296, at *11 (Del. Ch. Dec. 5, 2013); \nsee also Meyers, 2017 Del. Ch. LEXIS 96, at *14 .  The Court agrees and follows the \nlead of the Delaware courts in looking  to this case law to interpret section 5.4(a) of \nthe LLC Agreement. \n19. In the corporate context, Delaware courts have construed the “by reason of \nthe fact” requirement broadly but not “so broadly as to encompass every suit brought \nagainst an officer or director.”  Weaver v. ZeniMax Media, Inc., 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS \n10, at *9 –10 (Del. Ch. Jan. 30, 2004).  Rather, there must be “a nexus or causal \nconnection between any of the underlying proceedings . . . and one’s official corporate \ncapacity.”  Homestore, Inc. v. Tafeen , 888 A.2d 204, 215 (Del. 2005) .  Mere “but for” \ncausation is insufficient; the corporate powers must be “use[ful] or necessary for the \ncommission of the alleged conduct” upon which the claim is based.  Paolino v. Mace \nSec. Int’l, Inc., 985 A.2d 392, 406 (Del. Ch. 2009) (quoting Bernstein v. TractManager, \nInc., 953 A.2d 1003, 1011 (Del. Ch. 2007)) .  Thus, “the key inq uiry is whether the \nclaim depends on a showing that the official breached duties, quintessentially \nfiduciary duties, he owed to the corporation in that capacity or faces liability from a \nthird party due to actions taken in his official capacity.”  Zaman v. Amedeo Holdings, \nInc., 2008 Del. Ch. LEXIS 60, at *55 (Del. Ch. May 23, 2008). \n20. In some circumstances, the causal connection is clear.  A breach of fiduciary \nduty that arises out of an individual’s “status as a corporate officer” satisfies the \nstatutory requirement.  Perconti v. Thornton Oil Corp. , 2002 Del. Ch. LEXIS 51, at \n*16 & n. 23 (Del. Ch. May 3, 2002) .  Likewise, the causal nexus exists when the \nindividual “us[es] inside information which he possessed by virtue of his corporate \nstatus” to carry out t he alleged wrongful conduct.   Id. at * 19; see also  Brown v. \nLiveOps, Inc. , 903 A.2d 324, 328 , 330  (Del. Ch. 2006)  (denying motion to dismiss  \nindemnification for copyright infringement and trade-secret misappropriation claims \nwhere former officer “gained access to the company’s source codes while he was a \ncorporate official at the company”). \n21. By contrast, Delaware courts are hesitant to require indemnification for \nclaims that an officer “breached his individual obligations” to the company.  Cochran \nv. Stifel Fin. Corp., 2000 Del. Ch. LEXIS 179, at *20–21 (Del. Ch. Dec. 13, 2000), aff’d \nin relevant part , 809 A.2d 555 (Del. 2002).  Thus, “claims br ought by a corporation \nagainst an officer for excessive compensation paid or breaches of a non -competition \nagreement are ‘quintessential examples of a dispute between an employer . . . and an \nemployee.’”  Weaver, 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 10, at *10 (quoting Cochran, 2000 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 179, at *19).  Such claims “are not brought ‘by reason of the fact’ of the” \nperson’s official capacity.  Id.; see also Charney v. Am. Apparel, Inc. , 2015 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 238, at *48–51 (Del. Ch. Sept. 11, 2015). \nB. Indemnification \n22. This case law informs the Court’s interpretation of section 5.4(a) of the LLC \nAgreement.  In short, for section 5.4(a) to apply, there must be a causal connection \nbetween the claims in the amended complaint and Reece and Chapman’s status as \nmembers of the company.  Put another way, the question is whether NAMS’s claims \nimplicate Reece and Chapman’s official status or instead  turn on  “a specific and \npersonal contractual obligation.”  Paolino, 985 A.2d at 403.   \n23. To make this determination, the Court must “exa min[e] the pleadings.”  \nCharney, 2015 Del. Ch. LEXIS 238, at *48 (quoting Holley v. Nipro Diagnostics, Inc., \n2014 Del. Ch. LEXIS 268, at *23 (Del. Ch. Dec. 23, 2014)).  “The Court must seek to \ndiscern the nature of the claims which [Defendants are] called upon to defend by \nreading the [amended complaint] as a whole and providing a reasonable \ninterpretation of the substance of the allegations of each count.”  Weaver, 2004 Del. \nCh. LEXIS 10, at *14. \n1. Business Opportunities \n24. NAMS’s first, second, and fourth claims all relate to Reece and Chapman’s \nduties under the SPA , specifically the requirement not to solicit NAMS’s merchant \nclients (section 9.3) and the obligation to present business opportunities to NAMS \n(section 9.5).  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 48–65, 69–72, 119–22.)  NAMS alleges that Reece \nand Chapman  breached both provisions , seeks indemnification for the alleged \nbreaches, and  requests a declaratory judgment that  section 9.5 “is operative and \napplicable to Reece and Chapman.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 124–26, 135–38.)   \n25. Notably, Defendants put section 9.3 to the side.  Their counterclaim does not \nappear to seek indemnification for the alleged breach of  the non -solicitation \nrestrictions, and their opposition brief  omits any discussion of secti on 9.3.  (See \nCountercl. ¶¶ 20, 23–28; Defs.’ Br. Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. to Dismiss Defs.’ Countercl. 8–\n9, 11–16, ECF No. 52  [“Opp’n”].)  Accordingly, the Court need not address whether \nthere is a causal connection between the claim for breach of section 9.3 and Reece and \nChapman’s status as members of NAMS.   \n26. Section 9.5 is a different matter.   NAMS argues that section 9.5 imposes \npersonal obligations under the SPA, thus bearing no causal relation to Reece and \nChapman’s status as members.  (See Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss Defs.’ Countercl. \n7–9, ECF No. 49 [“Pl.’s Br.”]; Pl.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss Defs.’ Countercl. \n8–12, ECF No. 60  [“Reply”].)  Defendants, on the other hand,  read this section to  \nimpose a duty “owed to NAMS .  . . by Reece and Chapman as Members of the LLC.”  \n(Opp’n 8; see also Opp’n 12.)   \n27. At first blush, the language of section 9.5 appears to support Defendants.  It \nstates that Reece and Chapman “ shall have the duty to communicate or present” \nbusiness opportunities “while [each] holds Class B Units.”  (SPA § 9.5.)  The amended \ncomplaint likewise  alleges that “Section 9.5  . . . unequivocally requires Reece and \nChapman, for so long as they hold Class B Units , to present NAMS . . . with all \n‘Corporate Opportunities.’”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 69 (emphasis added); see also Am. Compl. \n¶ 138.)  According to Defendants, “any duty arising under Section 9.5  . . . springs \nfrom” Reece and Chapman’s  membership status , which  must be “determined by \nreference to the LLC Agreement,” and NAMS’s claims based on section 9.5 therefore \narise “by reason of the fact” that Reece and Chapman are members.  (Opp’n 12 ; see \nalso Opp’n 16.) \n28. Having carefully considered the pleadings and the underlying agreements, \nthe Court disagrees.  Reece and Chapman’s duty to present business opportunities to \nNAMS cannot arise from their membership status because the LLC Agreement \nexpressly waives that duty for members .  In section 5.3(b), NAMS and its members \n“waive any fiduciary or other duty of the Members and the Manager, incl uding, \nwithout limitation, fiduciary or other duties that may be related to or associated with \nself-dealing, corporate opportunities or otherwise, so long as such Person acts in a \nmanner consistent with this Agreement.”  (LLC Agreement §  5.3(b) (emphasis \nadded).)   \n29. As a result, the source of Reece and Chapman’s duty to present corporate \nopportunities lies elsewhere —in the SPA itself .  As NAMS correctly observes, the \nSPA is a separate agreement and one that Reece and Chapman negotiated and \nexecuted in their personal capacities, “not as members of the LLC.”  (Reply 2.)  Section \n9.5 does not impose a blanket duty on members.  It  treats Reece and Chapman as \nindividuals, imposing a duty to present corporate opportunities but exempting “any \nbusiness opportunity” that Reece and Chapman are “obligated to share with” their \nemployers.  (SPA § 9.5.)  This limited duty is better viewed as a condition of the sale \nof their business, rather than a condition of membership.  It is therefore a personal \nobligation, not one that arises out of their status as members of NAMS. \n30. The fact that section 9.5 refers to Reece and Chapman’s membership \ninterests does not mean that the duty arises out of their status as members.  The LLC \nAgreement’s waiver of the very same duty makes this clear.  Rather, the reference to \nmembership is a timing limitation —that is, the personal duty imposed by the SPA \nexists only for so long as Reece and Chapman hold Class B units.  (See Reply 7.) \n31. Defendants insist that this is sleight of hand.  They contend that NAMS \namended its complaint to remove crucial references to the LLC Agreement, assert \nclaims only under the SPA, and thereby evade its indemnification obligations.   (See \nOpp’n 10–11.)  According to Defendants, Delaware courts reject “pleading formalism” \nof this type and look to the underlying nature of the pending claims.   (Opp’n 10 \n(quoting Reddy v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., 2002 Del. Ch. LEXIS 69, at *19–20 (Del. Ch. \nJune 18, 2002)).) \n32. But the Court’s conclusion is not a product of artful pleading; it is instead  \ndriven by the structure of the arms-length agreements the parties freely executed .  \nDelaware law stresses the importance of contract in the LLC context.  See Fillip v. \nCenterstone Linen Servs., LLC, 2013 Del. Ch. LEXIS 294, at *14  (Del. Ch. Dec. 3, \n2013); see also Del. Code Ann. tit. 6 , § 18-1101(b) (“It is the policy of [the Limited \nLiability Company Act] to give the maximum effect to the principle of freedom of \ncontract and to the enforceability of limited liability company agreements.”).  Parties \nare free to organize an LLC as they wish, including contracting to impose or forgo \nfiduciary duties.  See Kelly v. Blum, 2010 Del. Ch. LEXIS 31, at *41 –42 & n.67 (Del. \nCh. Feb. 24, 2010) (citing Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, § 18-1101(c)).   \n33. The parties could have imposed a duty to present business opportunities as \na condition of membership in NAMS.  See, e.g., Broz v. Cellular Info. Sys., Inc. , 673 \nA.2d 148, 154 (Del. 1996) (noting that, in the corporate context, the obligation not to \nusurp corporate opportunities is “one species of the broad fiduciary duties assumed \nby a corporate director or officer”).  Instead, the parties agreed that members owe no \nfiduciary duty to present corporate opportunities to NAMS but that Reece and \nChapman owe a limited duty as part of the sale of the company.  They also bargained \nfor an indemnification provision specific to the SPA, which does not require NAMS to \nindemnify Reece and Chapman for their own breaches of its terms.  (See SPA § 10.2.)  \nThese decisions were reasonable and fully permitted by Delaware law.  See Del. Code \nAnn. tit. 6, § 18-108; see also Meyers, 2017 Del. Ch. LEXIS 96, at *11; Fillip, 2013 Del. \nCh. LEXIS 294, at *14, 16; Senior Tour Players 207 Mgmt. Co., 853 A.2d at 127.   \n34. The result is that NAMS may sue Reece and Chapman, who happen to be \nmembers, for their acts under the SPA without triggering the indemnification \nobligations imposed by the LLC Agreement.  See Bernstein, 953 A.2d at 1016–17.  To \nhold otherwise would upset this carefully crafted bargain, contrary to the Court’s role \n“to effectuate the parties’ intent.”  Lorillard Tobacco, 903 A.2d at 739. \n35. The analysis in Reddy is therefore irrelevant.  All of the claims in that case, \nincluding contract claims, “could be seen as fiduciary allegations .  . . that a senior \nmanagerial employee failed to live up to his duties of loyalty and care to the \ncorporation” as he “perform[ed] his day-to-day managerial duties.”  Reddy, 2002 Del. \nCh. LEXIS 69, at *20.  By contrast, Reece and Chapman have no managerial duties \nas passive interest holders, and the LLC Agreement extinguishes any duties of \nloyalty they might otherwise have. \n36. Likewise, the amendments made by NAMS  to its complaint are beside the \npoint.  The allegations in the original complaint concerning breach of the LLC \nAgreement related to non-solicitation, not corporate opportunities .  Furthermore, \nNAMS omitted those allegations from the amended complaint after it was noted that \nthe LLC Agreement automatically termi nated upon the sale of assets to Clarus and \nthat the relevant provisions did not survive the termination.   See NAMS Holdings, \nLLC v. Reece, 17 CVS 228 ¶  13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017).   As such, the Court \ndiscerns no attempt, bad faith or not, on the p art of NAMS to avoid its obligations \nunder the LLC Agreement. \n37. In conclusion, the language of the SPA and the LLC Agreement is \nunambiguous.  The duty to present business opportunities to NAMS is one that is \npersonal to Reece and Chapman, not a condition of their membership in NAMS.  \nAccordingly, the Court holds that NAMS’ s first, second, and fourth claims were  not \nbrought “by reason of the fact” that Reece and Chapman are members of NAMS, and \nsection 5.4(a) of the LLC Agreement does not apply to these claims as a matter of law.  \nTo the extent Defendants’ claim for indemnification relates to these three claims, it \nis dismissed with prejudice. \n2. Tortious Interference with Contract \n38. NAMS’s third claim alleges that all Defendants tortiously interfered with \nthe contract s between NAMS and Clarus .  ( See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 128–33.)  NAMS \nalleges that “[a]s Class B Members of NAMS . . ., Reece and Chapman have received \nexecution copies of the” agreements  between NAMS and Clarus  and therefore had  \n“knowledge of and/or were apprised of [their] terms and conditions .”  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 129.)  It further alleges that Defendants’ efforts to solicit and convert customers  \n“have caused Clarus to allege breaches” of those agreements.  (Am. Co mpl. ¶¶ 129, \n132–33.) \n39. NAMS contends that this claim is not brought by reason of the fact that \nReece and Chapman are members of NAMS.  ( See Pl.’s Br. 5.)  Defendants respond \nthat the claim specifically alleges that Reece and Chapman gained knowledge of the \nagreements “through their status as Class B Members ,” and thus Reece, Chapman, \nand Smart Processing, as their affiliate, have stated a claim for indemnification.   \n(Opp’n 14; see also LLC Agreement § 5.4(a).) \n40. Defendants’ argument is persuasive.  Delaware courts have held that where \na corporate official learns of confidential or proprietary information by virtue of his \nofficial capacity and then uses that information to harm the company, claims arising \nout of that conduct are brought by reason of t he individual’s official capacity.  See \nBrown, 903 A.2d at 329–30; see also Holley, 2014 Del. Ch. LEXIS 268, at *27; Pontone \nv. Milso Indus. Corp., 100 A.3d 1023, 1051 (Del. Ch. 2014).   \n41. The amended complaint alleges that Defendants acquired knowledge of the \nClarus agreements by virtue of their membership in NAMS.  (See Am. Compl. ¶ 129.)  \nIndeed, NAMS alleges no other means by which Defendants acquired this knowledge.  \nThen, in full knowledge of the agreements, Defendants “knowingly, willfully, and \nintentionally interfered with” them by soliciting and converting merchant customers.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 133.)  These allegations are sufficient to state a claim for relief.   See \nPontone, 100 A.3d at 1051 (holding that claims, including claim for tortious \ninterference, were brought by reason of defendants’ official capacity where alleged \nwrongdoing was “facilitated by the confidential proprietary and trade secret \ninformation they acquired from serving as directors and officers”). \n42. In its reply brief, NAMS does not directly address this connection between \nthe knowledge Reece and Chapman acquired and their status as Class B members.  \nInstead, NAMS argues that the claim against Reece and Chapma n “could not have \nbeen made ‘by reason of the fact that’ they were members of the LLC because they \nhave no authority to act” on NAMS’s behalf as Class B members .  (Reply 6, 10–12.)  \nThis argument reads Delaware law too narrowly  (and comes dangerously close  to \nnullifying indemnification for NAMS’s members altogether).  The use of confidential \ninformation acquired by virtue of one’s official status is an act that establishes the \nrequired causal connection between the alleged wrongdoing  and the individual’s \nofficial capacity.  See Brown, 903 A.2d at 329–30; see also Holley, 2014 Del. Ch. LEXIS \n268, at *27; Pontone, 100 A.3d at 1051.   \n43. NAMS’s other argument is that the claims arise out of personal obligations \nunder the SPA.  (See Pl.’s Br. 4–5, 10–12; Reply 2–5.)  That is true as to NAMS’s first, \nsecond, and fourth claims, but the claim for tortious interference does not arise under \nthe SPA, and NAMS alleges no breach of any SPA provision in connection with this \nclaim.  Rather, Reece and Chapman acquired knowledge of the Clarus agreements \nunder the LLC Agreement and by virtue of their membership in NAMS.  Applying \nthe LLC Agreement’s indemnification provision to the claim for tortious interference \nwould not interfere with any rights or obligations in the SPA and would not upset the \nparties’ bargain. \n44. The conclusion that Defendants have stated a claim for indemnification does \nnot mean that they are necessarily entitled to indemnification.  NAMS may \ndemonstrate, through discovery, that Defendants’ expenses are “attributable to” their \nown “fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence,” and therefore not indemnifiable.  \n(LLC Agreement §  5.4(a).)  But at this stage, taking the allegations in a light most \nfavorable to Defendants, the Court concludes that Defendants have adequately \nalleged that the claim for tortious interference with contract was brought by reason \nof the fact that Reece and Chapman  are members of NAMS.  See Holley, 2014 Del. \nCh. LEXIS 268, at *27; Pontone, 100 A.3d at 1051; Brown, 903 A.2d at 329–30.   \n45. To the extent Defendants’ counterclaim for indemnification is based on \nNAMS’s claim for tortious interference with contract, the motion to dismiss is denied. \nC. Advancement \n46. Defendants also claim that they are entitled to adv ancement of their legal \nfees in defending NAMS’s claims.   Under Delaware law, indemnification and \nadvancement are related but “distinct and different legal rights.”   Majkowski v. Am. \nImaging Mgmt. Servs., LLC, 913 A.2d 572, 586–87 (Del. Ch. 2006) (citations omitted); \nsee also Senior Tour Players 207 Mgmt. Co., 853 A.2d at 128 (citation omitted).  The \nright to advancement does not necessarily turn on whether, after the final disposition \nof a case, an individual will be entitled to indemnification.  See Majkowski, 913 A.2d \nat 586 (citations omitted); Senior Tour Players 207 Mgmt. Co. , 853 A.2d at 128 \n(citation omitted). \n47. Defendants’ right to advancement, if any, is contractual.  In the LLC \ncontext, “the Delaware L imited Liability Company Act confers upon contracting \nparties ‘nearly unfettered contractual discretion in determining whether to grant \nadvancement.’”  Grace v. Ashbridge LLC, 2013 Del. Ch. LEXIS 315, at *13 (Del. Ch. \nDec. 31, 2013) (quoting Donohue v. Corning, 949 A.2d 574, 578 (Del. Ch. 2008)).   \nDelaware “courts have been equally clear . . . that Delaware’s public policy favoring \nadvancement does not trump basic principles of contract interpretation.”  Fillip, 2013 \nDel. Ch. LEXIS 294, at *16 (citing Majkowski, 913 A.2d at 593).  Accordingly, the \nCourt must interpret the LLC Agreement “like any other contract, ascertaining the \nparties’ intent from the plain meaning of the terms they chose.”  Id. at *14 (citation \nomitted).   \n48. The LLC Agreement’s advancement provision states that NAMS “shall pay \nthe expenses incurred by any [person] indemnifiable hereunder, as such expenses are \nincurred, in connection with any proceeding in advance of the final disposition, so \nlong as [NAMS] rec eives an undertaking by such [person] to repay the full amount \nadvanced” if that person is not ultimately entitled to indemnification.  (LLC \nAgreement § 5.4(a).)  The parties joust over the phrase  “indemnifiable hereunder.”  \nDefendants maintain that, becau se indemnification and advancement are distinct \nlegal rights, their right to advancement is not conditioned upon whether or not they \nare entitled to indemnification.  (Opp’n 7.)  NAMS’s position is that the plain language \nof the LLC Agreement conditions advancement on being indemnifiable.  (Pl.’s Br. 13; \nReply 12–15.)  Accordingly, if Defendants are not indemnifiable as a matter of law, \nthey are not entitled to advancement.  (Pl.’s Br. 13; Reply 14–15.)   \n49. The Court agrees with NAMS.  Although indemnification and advancement \nare distinct legal rights, the parties expressly conditioned advancement on the \npossibility of being indemnified.  The plain meaning of “ indemnifiable hereunder” \nrequires that it be possible for a person to be indemnified under section 5.4(a) for that \nperson’s advancement rights to be triggered.  Thus, if Defendants are not entitled to \nindemnification as a matter of law, as NAMS suggests, they are not entitled to \nadvancement.  \n50.  The Court has determined as a matter of  law that Defendants are not \nentitled to indemnification for their defense of NAMS’s claims for breach of contract, \nindemnification, and declaratory judgment to the extent those claims concern the \nalleged breach of the corporate-opportunities provision.  It would make little sense to \nconstrue the LLC Agreement’s advancement provision to provide advancement for \nclaims for which Defendants, as a matter of law, could not be indemnified.  Delaware \ncourts have likewise denied advancement as a matter of law in circumstances where \na party was not sued by reason of the fact of their corporate status.  See, e.g, Charney, \n2015 Del. Ch. LEXIS 238, at *47 –56; Bernstein, 953 A.2d at 1016 –17; Weaver, 2004 \nDel. Ch. LEXIS 10, at *12 –18.  Accordingly, as a matter of law,  Defendants are not \nentitled to advancement of their legal expenses in defending NAMS’s first, second, \nand fourth claims for relief. \n51. Defendants have, however, stated a claim for indemnification as to NAMS’s \nclaim for tortious interference with contract.  As a result, Defendants have also stated \na claim for advancement of their legal expenses incurred in defending  the tortious \ninterference claim.  In the event it is ultimately determined that Defendants are not \nentitled to indemnification, they may be required t o return the advanced fees.  For \nnow, the potential for indemnification supports the counterclaim for advancement.  \nSee Holley, 2014 Del. Ch. LEXIS 268, at *38; Majkowski, 913 A.2d at 586.   \n52. The Court therefore denies the motion to dismiss the counterclaim  for \nadvancement to the extent it concerns the underlying tortious interference claim.  \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n53. For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part  and DENIES in \npart the motion to dismiss. \na. The Court GRANTS the motion with respect to Defendants’ \ncounterclaims for indemnification and advanc ement as to NAMS ’s claims for \nbreach of contract, indemnification, and declaratory judgment.  To this extent, \nDefendants’ counterclaims are DISMISSED with prejudice. \nb. The Court DENIES the motion with respect to De fendants’ \ncounterclaims for indemnification and advancement as to NAMS ’s claim for \ntortious interference with contract.  \n \nThis the 16th day of April, 2018. \n /s/ Adam M.
