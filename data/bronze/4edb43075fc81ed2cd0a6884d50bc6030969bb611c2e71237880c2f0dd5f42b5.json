Anderson, 2008 NCBC 1 \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA   IN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY                              06 CVS 2941 \n \n \nCLASSIC COFFEE CONCEPTS, INC., \n \n  Plaintiff, \n \n v. \n \nJ. MICHAEL ANDERSON, \n \n  Defendant. \nORDER & JUDGMENT  \n \nMayer Brown LLP by Eric H. Cottrell for Plaintiff Classic Coffee Concepts, \nInc. \n \nMcNaughton & Shelton, PLLC by Edward J. McNaughton and Gregory L. \nShelton for Defendant J. Michael Anderson. \n \nDiaz, Judge.  \n{1} The Court called this matter for trial on 1 October 2007.  The parties \nwaived their right to a jury trial. \n{2}   After considering the opening statements of the parties, the testimony of \nthe witnesses, the exhibits presented and admitted at trial,1 and the closing \narguments of the parties, the Court enters the following Order and Judgment. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{3} Plaintiff Classic Coffee Concepts, Inc. (“Classic Coffee” or the “Company”) \nfiled its Complaint in Mecklenburg County Superior Court on 13 February 2006. \n{4} On 24 April 2006, Defendant J. Michael Anderson (“Anderson”) answered \nthe Complaint and also asserted counterclaims (the “Counterclaims”) for Breach of \n                                                 \n1 To the extent not ruled on at trial, all objections to the introduction and use of Joint Exhibits 1–89 \nare OVERRULED.  In particular, Anderson having withdrawn his objection to Joint Exhibit 33 \nfollowing the close of his evidence, the Court considered this exhibit.    \nContract (as to a Stockholders Agreement), Unconscionability, Breach of \nEmployment Contract, and Judicial Dissolution.  \n{5} The case was subsequently transferred to the North Carolina Business \nCourt and assigned to me as a mandatory complex business case. \n{6} On 22 June 2006, Classic Coffee moved to dismiss Anderson’s \nCounterclaims for Unconscionability and Judicial Dissolution.  The Court granted \nPlaintiff’s motion by Order dated 1 December 2006. \n{7} On 24 April 2007, Classic Coffee dismissed its Complaint with prejudice. \n{8} On 22 May 2007, the Court granted Classic Coffee’s Motion to Amend its \nNotice of Dismissal to reflect that such dismissal was without prejudice. \n{9} Prior to trial, Anderson dismissed his Counterclaim alleging breach of the \nEmployment Agreement, leaving only his claim alleging breach of the Stockholders \nAgreement for trial.  \n{10} As to that claim, Anderson stipulated at trial that he was only pursuing \nrelief for two specific breaches:  (1) Classic Coffee’s alleged failure to properly value \nhis stock, and (2) Classic Coffee’s alleged failure to redeem his stock within sixty \ndays of the effective date of Anderson’s termination as a Classic Coffee employee.  \n \nII. \nFINDINGS OF FACT2\nA. \nTHE PARTIES \n{11} Classic Coffee is a closely-held Delaware corporation with its principal \nplace of business in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  (Joint Exs. 1, 33.) \n{12} Anderson is a citizen and resident of Statesville, North Carolina. \n{13} From 1993 to 22 July 2003, Anderson was employed by Classic Coffee, first \nas its Controller, and eventually as its Chief Financial Officer.  (Joint Ex. 15.)   \n                                                 \n2 Where appropriate, the Court has identified the joint exhibit supporting a particular finding of fact.  \nMany of the Court’s findings, however, come from the testimony presented at trial.  Because no final \ntranscript has been prepared, the Court’s order does not refer to a record citation for such facts.  \n{14} Anderson also served as a director of Classic Coffee. \n{15} Anderson owns 15,000 of Classic Coffee’s 45,000 issued and outstanding \nshares of common stock.3  (Joint Ex. 2.) \nB. \nTHE DISPUTE \n{16} On 5 December 2000, Anderson and Classic Coffee entered into a \nStockholders Agreement.  (Joint Ex. 1.) \n{17} On or about that same date, Anderson entered into a Pledge Agreement \nand a separate Continuing and Unconditional Guaranty Agreement (“Guaranty \nAgreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank”).  (Joint Exs. 3, 10.)  \n{18} On 22 July 2003, Anderson’s employment with Classic Coffee was \nterminated “without cause,” effective 1 August 2003.  (Joint Exs. 13, 15.)   \n{19} The Stockholders Agreement requires Classic Coffee to purchase, and the \nstockholder whose employment is terminated without cause to sell, all of the \nCompany’s stock held by such stockholder.  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 3.1(b).) \n{20} The Stockholders Agreement also provides that the “price per share at \nwhich the Stock of a Stockholder shall be purchased and sold . . . shall be equal to \nthe quotient of the ‘fair market value’ of [Classic Coffee] . . . divided by the total \nnumber of shares . . . issued and outstanding.”  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 3.2(a).) \n{21} The Stockholders Agreement defines Classic Coffee’s “fair market value” as \nthe difference between the fair market value of the Company’s capital stock \ndetermined by the independent appraisal of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan \nand Trust (“ESOP”) “for the most recent valuation that precedes the date of the \nStockholders termination of employment” and the liquidation preference of any \npreferred stock of the Company issued and outstanding as of the date of \ntermination.”  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 3.2(b).)4 \n                                                 \n3 Anderson was unclear about what he paid for his shares, at one point testifying that it may have \nbeen a total of $150.00, then later stating that it may have been only $1.00. \n4 The Company never issued preferred stock. \n{22} The Stockholders Agreement allows Classic Coffee to pay a stockholder for \nhis shares by equal installments on a sixty-month promissory note.  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ \n3.3(b).) \n{23} As to stockholder employees who are terminated “without cause,” the \nStockholders Agreement requires that the “fair market value” of the employee’s \nshares be re-calculated on the anniversary date of the stockholder’s termination \nuntil the stockholder is paid in full, and that any increase in the value of the stock \nbe added to the balance of the promissory note.  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 3.3(b).) \n{24} Under paragraph 3.4 of the Stockholders Agreement, “[t]he closing of any \npurchase and sale [of stock] . . . shall be consummated . . . within sixty (60) days \nfollowing . . . the termination of the Stockholder’s employment with [Classic \nCoffee].”  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 3.4.) \n{25} Classic Coffee never established an ESOP. \n{26} Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, Anderson’s stock was assigned to the \nBank as collateral for his personal guarantee of Classic Coffee’s loan agreements \nwith the Bank.  (Joint Ex. 3.)  \n{27} The termination of Anderson’s employment with Classic Coffee did not \ndischarge his obligations under the Guaranty Agreement.  (Joint Ex. 10 ¶ 7.) \n{28} The Stockholders Agreement addresses the question of pledged stock in \nthe context of a mandatory redemption following termination of an employee: \nIf one of the events described in Article . . . III of this Agreement \noccurs prior to the time that all of a Stockholder’s Stock is released \nfrom the Stock Pledge, the Company, if otherwise permitted under \nthe terms of the Stock Pledge, . . . shall exercise its rights pursuant \nto Article III to purchase said pledged Stock.  In such event, the \ntotal purchase price for the Stock shall be determined in accordance \nwith this Agreement and the Company shall be entitled to a dollar-\nfor-dollar credit against the purchase price to be paid to such \nStockholder for the Stock for any amounts paid to the Bank to \nretire the obligation of the Stockhol der to the Bank or to otherwise \nobtain the release of the pledged Stock from the Stock Pledge.  \n \n(Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 1.2(b) (emphasis added).) \n \n{29} Following the termination of Anderson’s employment, Classic Coffee asked \nthe Bank to release Anderson’s stock.  (Joint Exs. 58, 64.)  However, Classic Coffee \nowed a substantial amount of money to the Bank at that time, and the Bank \nrefused to release the stock.  (Joint Ex. 58.)  \n{30} Classic Coffee made no monetary offer to the Bank to release Anderson’s \nstock.  \n{31} Classic Coffee did not redeem Anderson’s stock within sixty days of the \neffective date of his termination. \n{32} Anderson made numerous demands for redemption of his shares following \nhis termination.  (Joint Exs. 53–54, 56–57, 59.)  \n{33} On each occasion, Classic Coffee responded either (1) that it could not \nredeem Anderson’s shares while they were pledged to the Bank, or (2) that it was \nconducting a valuation to determine the price it would pay for Anderson’s shares.  \n(Joint Exs. 53, 55–56, 58.)  \n{34} Several months before Anderson was terminated, Classic Coffee’s outside \naccountants (Cherry Bekaert Holland, hereinafter “CBH”) prepared a draft \nappraisal of the Company for purposes of conducting a goodwill impairment \nanalysis.5  (Joint Ex. 31.) \n{35} CBH’s draft appraisal (prepared on 7 February 2003) set the Company’s \nfair value at $12,500,000.00, on a controlling interest basis.6  (Joint Ex. 31.) \n{36} The information used by CBH to prepare the draft appraisal consisted of \nsales projections prepared by Anderson, with input from other Classic Coffee \nemployees.  (Joint Ex. 26.) \n{37} The sales projections provided to CBH included markedly more aggressive \nsales numbers (the so-called “bright” plan) than those provided by the Company to \nits lenders (the so-called “bank” plan).  (Joint Ex. 87.) \n                                                 \n5 “Goodwill impairment” is an accounting standard requiring that the recorded value of a company’s \ngoodwill be equal to or greater than its fair value.  If it is not, goodwill is said to be impaired, \nrequiring a write-off to its present fair value.  \n6 Applying that value, Anderson’s 15,000 shares would be worth over $4 million. \n{38} The “bright” plan was created for internal planning purposes and was \nnever intended to be disseminated outside of the Company.   \n{39} Had CBH known about the two sets of conflicting sales projections, it \nwould have “thought long and hard” about conducting an appraisal without \naddressing this discrepancy.  \n{40} The CBH draft appraisal valued Classic Coffee at its fair value, not fair \nmarket value. \n{41} An appraisal based on “fair value” does not account for certain discounts in \nvalue that are typical for closely-held companies, including lack of marketability of \nthe stock, discounts for minority interests, and “keyman” discounts. \n{42} CBH used its draft appraisal to support its goodwill impairment analysis, \nand accounting conventions limit its use to that purpose. \n{43} Because CBH was using the appraisal for a limited purpose, it did not \nissue it in final form. \n{44} Standard accounting conventions make it inappropriate to use the 7 \nFebruary 2003 draft appraisal to value the Company’s stock as if an ESOP had been \nin place.   \n{45} Anderson also asked CBH to prepare a second appraisal in conjunction \nwith potential merger talks with an outside entity.  (Joint Ex. 32.) \n{46} For purposes of this appraisal, CBH was asked to determine the \nCompany’s fair market value as of 31 December 2002.  (Joint Ex. 32.) \n{47} CBH took its February 2003 valuation of “fair value” and factored in \ndiscounts applicable to a closely-held corporation to arrive at a fair market value for \nthe Company (on a controlling interest basis) of $8,390,000.00.\n7  (Joint Ex. 32.) \n{48} CBH submitted its second appraisal (in draft form) to Anderson on or \nabout 18 March 2003.  (Joint Ex. 32.) \n{49} CBH advised Anderson that its appraisal was valid only for the specific \npurpose for which it was prepared.  (Joint Ex. 32.)  \n                                                 \n7 Applying that value, Anderson’s 15,000 shares would be worth over $2.7 million. \n{50} An ESOP fair market value appraisal is markedly different than a \nconventional fair market value appraisal.8 \n{51} ESOP regulations require appraisals to be “full appraisals” and neither \none of CBH’s draft appraisals were full appraisals. \n{52} Pursuant to standard accounting conventions, it is inappropriate to use \nCBH’s second draft appraisal to value the Company’s stock as if an ESOP had been \nin place. \n{53} Anderson did not share the CBH draft appraisals with the other members \nof the Company’s board of directors.   \n{54} On or about 3 November 2003, Classic Coffee retained Marshall & Stevens \n(“M&S”) to perform a valuation as if an ESOP were in place for the purpose of \ndetermining Classic Coffee’s fair market value and, in turn, the value of Anderson’s \nstock.  (Joint Ex. 33.) \n{55} According to the M&S report, as of 31 December 2002 (approximately one \nyear before Anderson was terminated), “the fair market value of 100% of the equity \nin Classic Coffee Concepts, Inc., on a non-marketable, minority interest basis [was \n$360,000.00].”  (Joint. Ex. 33).   \n{56} In turn, the fair market value of one share of the Company’s stock (based \non 45,000 outstanding shares) was $8.00, thus setting a value of $120,000.00 for \nAnderson’s 15,000 shares.  (Joint Ex. 33.) \n{57} Classic Coffee notified Anderson of this valuation on or about 19 February \n2004, but did not tender this amount to Anderson because the Bank had not yet \nreleased Anderson’s shares from the stock pledge.  (Joint Ex. 81.) \n                                                 \n8 One distinguishing factor (although not the only one) is how the existence of an ESOP affects the \n“marketability” discount used by a valuation professional.  Such a discount reflects the financial \nreality that shares of small closely-held corporations do not trade frequently and therefore are \ngenerally less attractive than similar publicly held stocks for which there is a ready market. \nOkerlund v. United States, 365 F.3d 1044, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  A typical ESOP, however, obligates \nan employer to purchase a departing employee’s stock, thus establishing a potential market for the \nstock.  As a result, while a marketability discount still applies to ESOP shares in a closely-held \ncorporation, it is typically less than would be applied otherwise.  (Joint Ex. 33.)  \n{58} On or about 3 May 2005, Classic Coffee engaged M&S to perform another \nfair market value appraisal for the purpose of valuing Anderson’s stock as of 31 \nDecember 2004, in the context of a hypothetical ESOP.  (Joint Ex. 34.)   \n{59} The second M&S appraisal placed the fair market value of Anderson's \nstock at $192,000.00.   (Joint Ex. 34.)   \n{60} In or around November 2005, Classic Coffee began negotiating a \nrefinancing of its credit facility with the Bank.  In connection with those \nnegotiations, Classic Coffee again requested that the Bank release Anderson’s \nshares.   \n{61} This time, the Bank agreed to release Anderson’s shares.   \n{62} On 14 December 2005, Classic Coffee informed Anderson that it would \n“proceed with the mandatory redemption of [Anderson’s] stock as required by the \nStockholders Agreement.”  (Joint Ex. 83.)  \n{63} Classic Coffee’s letter, which was enclosed with copies of documents setting \nforth the terms and conditions of the proposed transaction, set a purchase price of \n$192,000.00 and a closing date of 30 December 2005.  (Joint Ex. 83.)  \n{64} Anderson refused to tender his stock to Classic Coffee.    \n{65} On 6 March 2007, M&S modified its 31 December 2004 appraisal.  (Joint \nEx. 85.)  In arriving at its $192,000.00 value for Anderson’s shares, M&S failed to \nconsider the effect of an agreement between Classic Coffee and another company on \nPlaintiff’s equity value.\n \n{66} Accounting for this agreement should have resulted in the value of the \nequity of Classic Coffee being zero as of 31 December 2004, except for some nominal \nspeculative value.  (Joint Ex. 85.) \n{67} Thus, the value of Anderson’s stock as of 31 December 2004, based on the \nM&S modified appraisal, was at or near zero.  (Joint Ex. 85.) \n \n \n \n \nIII. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n{68} This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute and personal \njurisdiction over the parties. \n{69} Venue is proper because Plaintiff’s principal place of business is in \nMecklenburg County and the events giving rise to this action occurred, in whole or \nin part, in Mecklenburg County. \n{70} Venue is also proper because the 5 December 2000 Stockholders \nAgreement that is the subject of this action provides that all litigation relating to it \nshall be brought and maintained exclusively in the courts of Mecklenburg County, \nNorth Carolina.  (Joint. Ex. 1, ¶ 5.8.) \n{71} Classic Coffee stipulated at trial that it breached the Stockholders \nAgreement by failing to perform valuations of Anderson’s shares annually.   \n{72} Anderson also claims that Classic Coffee breached the Stockholders \nAgreement by failing to purchase his shares within sixty days of his termination.   \n{73} Classic Coffee contends it did not breach this provision of the Stockholders \nAgreement because Anderson’s shares were at all relevant times pledged to the \nBank as collateral, and therefore Anderson was in no position to tender them for \nredemption. \n{74} The Court, however, concludes that the Bank’s release of Anderson’s \nshares was not a condition precedent to Classic Coffee’s obligation to redeem them. \n{75} To the contrary, the Stockholders Agreement required Classic Coffee to (if \nnecessary) purchase Anderson’s shares from the Bank and credit the purchase price \nto the net amount due Anderson for the redemption. \n{76} Alternatively, nothing on the face of the Stockholders Agreement \nprevented Classic Coffee from redeeming the shares in exchange for Anderson \nrelinquishing any and all rights to those shares upon their release by the Bank. \n{77} Classic Coffee never did anything more than request that the Bank release \nAnderson’s shares.  \n{78} Accordingly, the Court concludes that Classic Coffee breached the terms of \nthe Stockholders Agreement by failing to redeem the shares within sixty days of \nAnderson’s effective date of termination. \n{79} The Court concludes further that Classic Coffee’s over two-year delay in \ntendering performance amounted to a material breach, and Anderson is therefore \nentitled to judgment in his favor.  Cf. Avesair, Inc. v. Inphonic Inc., 2007 NCBC 32 \n¶¶ 15, 27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 16, 2007), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/ \n101607%20Order%20Webpage.pdf (applying Delaware law, which the court stated \nrecognizes many of the same principles of contract construction as North Carolina, \nand concluding that a party materially breaches an agreement where he fails to \nperform within a reasonable time).  \n{80} As to the form of the judgment, a person damaged by a breach of contract \nis entitled to be placed, insofar as this can be done by money, in the same position \nhe would have occupied if there had been no breach.  Lee Cycle Ctr., Inc. v. Wilson \nCycle Ctr., Inc., 143 N.C. App. 1, 9, 545 S.E.2d 745, 750 (2001)  (quoting Perfecting \nServ. Co. v. Prod. Dev. & Sales Co., 259 N.C. 400, 415, 131 S.E.2d 9, 21 (1963)). \n{81} Here, this means Classic Coffee should have tendered payment for \nAnderson’s shares within sixty days of the effective date of Anderson’s termination \nas a Classic Coffee employee. \n{82} The principal dispute at trial, however, was the amount that Anderson \nshould receive for those shares. \n{83} Anderson contends the price Classic Coffee offered him for his shares on 14 \nDecember 2005 was too low because the Company did not follow the terms of the \nStockholders Agreement in calculating the share price. \n{84}  The parties in this case attempted to fix on a valuation mechanism \nprecisely to avoid this type of dispute. \n{85} To that end, the Stockholders Agreement provides that the price for an \nexiting shareholder’s shares would be the “fair market value” of those shares as \n“determined by the independent appraisal obtained by the ESOP for the most \nrecent valuation that precedes the date of the Stockholder’s termination of \nemployment.”  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 3.2(b).) \n{86} North Carolina courts are bound to follow the agreement of the parties as \nto valuation of stock, “whether the value appears to be high or low compared to the \noriginal purchase price.”  Hickory Orthopaedic Ctr., P.A., v. Nicks, 179 N.C. App. \n281, 287, 633 S.E.2d 831, 835 (2006) (citing Lagies v. Myers, 142 N.C. App. 239, \n247, 542 S.E.2d 336, 342 (2001)). \n{87} The evidence at trial, however, showed that Classic Coffee never \nestablished an ESOP and therefore never timely determined the “fair market value” \nof Anderson’s stock consistent with the Stockholders Agreement. \n{88} The Court has considered whether the failure to establish an ESOP \namounted to a failure of a condition precedent excusing performance by both \nparties.  It has declined to so find in this case for the following reasons:  (1) \nconditions precedent are not favored by the law, Craftique, Inc. v. Stevens & Co., \n321 N.C. 564, 566, 364 S.E.2d 129, 131 (1988), and (2) neither party argued the \npoint at trial, requesting instead that the Court fix the value of Anderson’s shares \non the evidence presented. \n{89} Accordingly, the Court proceeds to consider the evidence as to value.  \n{90} Anderson argues that the two CBH draft appraisals are the most reliable \nevidence of value because they rely on management’s contemporaneous sales \nprojections.   In support of that proposition, Anderson points me to the Delaware \nCourt of Chancery’s opinion in Prescott Group Small Cap, L.P., v. Coleman Co., No. \n17802, 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 131 (Del. Ch. Sept. 8, 2004). \n{91} Prescott involved an appraisal proceeding brought by former minority \nshareholders of the defendant following defendant’s merger into its parent \ncorporation.  Plaintiffs in that case claimed that the fair value of their shares on the \nmerger date was over five times what defendant was willing to pay.  Id. at *3.   \n{92} The Delaware Court of Chancery accepted plaintiffs’ valuation, noting that \nit was based on management projections available as of the date of the merger, \nwhile defendant’s evidence of value relied exclusively on “after-the-fact adjustments \nto such projections made during litigation.”  Id. at *75.  \n{93} Prescott, however, is inapposite because the management projections \nreviewed by the court in that case were entirely consistent with what the defendant \nwas contemporaneously representing to all of its constituencies, including its \nshareholders, lenders, and outside financial analysts.  As the court explained, \n[t]hose projections had been furn ished to [defendant’s] banks in \ncircumstances where [defendant’s] performance and prospects were \nbeing carefully scrutinized and where it was essential that \n[defendant’s] actual performance met or exceeded those projections.  \nSecond, the projections had been ‘vetted’ for reliability by an \nindependent firm, . . .  which the banks had engaged for that \npurpose.  Third, management had represented the projections as \ntheir best estimate of the future. \n \nId. at *52. \n    \n{94} In contrast, the 7 February 2003 CBH draft appraisal tendered by \nAnderson was not based on fair market value and was created for purposes of \ncomplying with an outside accounting requirement related to goodwill impairment.  \n{95} Moreover, unlike the projections in Prescott, the projections used by CBH \nto prepare its first draft appraisal relied on wildly optimistic sales figures that the \nCompany never realistically expected to meet and that flatly contradicted the more \nrealistic projections provided by the Company to its lenders. \n{96} Similarly, the 18 March 2003 draft appraisal, while premised on fair \nmarket value, (a) was prepared for a specific purpose unrelated to the valuation of \nAnderson’s stock, (b) was not a full fair market value appraisal, as would have been \nrequired for purposes of an ESOP appraisal, (c) was never finalized by CBH, and (d) \nrelied on the same distorted sales projections generated by Anderson.  \n{97} Additionally, at trial Anderson put the onus on the Court to fill in \nsubstantial gaps in his valuation model to arrive at his preferred estimate of fair \nmarket value.  The Court declines that invitation. \n{98} Instead, the Court concludes that the most reliable estimate of the fair \nmarket value of Anderson’s stock at the time he was entitled to receive payment for \nit is $120,000.00, as calculated by M&S in November 2003.  (Joint Ex. 33.) \n{99} The M&S appraisal is the only evidence of value that attempts to honor \nthe parties’ agreement, by arriving at a fair market value of Anderson’s shares as of \n31 December 2002, based on the existence of a hypothetical ESOP.9     \n{100} At trial, Classic Coffee conceded that the $120,000.00 amount was the \nappropriate measure of value, but requested that it be allowed to pay Anderson in \ninstallments over sixty months, as provided by the terms of the Stockholders \nAgreement.  (Joint Ex. 1 ¶ 3.3(a).) \n{101} However, because Classic Coffee materially breached the Stockholders \nAgreement, the Court DENIES that request.  \n{102} As for Anderson’s remedy, generally, “where there is a material breach of \nthe contract going to the very heart of the instrument, the other party to the \ncontract may elect to rescind and is not bound to seek relief at law by an award for \ndamages.”  Wilson v. Wilson, 261 N.C. 40, 43, 134 S.E.2d 240, 242 (1964).   \n{103} Nevertheless, to rescind a contract “there must be, within a reasonable \ntime after knowledge of the material breach, an election by the aggrieved party to \ncancel.”  Marantz Piano Co. v. Kincaid, 108 N.C. App. 693, 696, 424 S.E.2d 671, 673 \n(1993). \n{104} Anderson did not present evidence of such an election, nor did he request \nat trial that the Court rescind the Stockholders Agreement. \n{105} Accordingly, the Court concludes that Anderson is entitled to judgment in \nhis favor for $120,000.00, together with interest at 8% from 1 October 2003 until \n                                                 \n9 Two years later, M&S prepared a second fair market value appraisal of Anderson’s interest in \nClassic Coffee, which resulted in a value of $192,000.00 for the shares.  See supra ¶¶ 58-59.  After \ncarefully reviewing the record, however, the Court credits the evidence presented by the Company at \ntrial, which demonstrated that this valuation was based on an erroneous assumption (not made in \nthe first M&S report) regarding the Company’s overall debt (Joint Ex. 85), and that the value of the \nCompany’s shares as of 31 December 2004 was at or near zero.
