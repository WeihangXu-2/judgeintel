(\"EHP\"), filed its \nComplaint in this matter.  The Complaint alleges seven claims for relief (\"Claim(s)\"): \nFirst Claim for Relief (Breach of Contract – General Partnership Agreement); Second \nClaim for Relief (Dissolution – General Partnership Agreement); Third Claim for Relief \n                                            \n1 On January 11, 2008, the court entered a Consent Order for Appointment of Manager, pursuant to \nwhich N. Hunter Wyche, Esq. was appointed manager (the “Manager”) of HPB.  On May 12, 2008, the \nManager filed, under seal, a motion seeking court approval of sale of Albemarle Plantation to a third \nparty.  By Order dated June 12, 2008, the court allowed this motion and authorized the sale of Albemarle \nlantation.  The property ultimately was sold.  The sale is not relevant to the instant issues. \n(Dissolution – General Partnership Agreement);2 Fourth Claim for Relief (Dissolution – \nNorth Carolina Uniform Partnership Act); Fifth Claim for Relief (Dissolution – General \nPartnership Agreement/Assignment); Sixth Claim for Relief (Breach of Contract – Phase \nII Contract) and Seventh Claim for Relief (Declaratory Judgment – N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-\n253). \n[3] Defendants have answered timely and raised certain affirmative defenses \nand counterclaims, and there has been extensive motion practice undertaken by the \nvarious parties to this action.3 \n[4] On June 26, 2008, EHP filed the Moti on relative to its Fourth and Seventh \nClaims. \n[5] The court has heard oral argument on the Motion, and it is ripe for \ndetermination.4 \n[6] Unless otherwise indicated herein,  the material facts reflected in \nparagraphs 7 through 31 of this Order exist, are undisputed5 and are pertinent to the \nissues raised by the Motion. \nII. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n                                            \n2This Claim is stated in the alternative to the Second Claim.  \n3 The counterclaiming Defendants subsequently dismissed, without prejudice, their Second, Third, Fourth \nand Fifth Counterclaims. \n4 The Defendants argue that the Motion is not ripe because discovery has not been completed.  However, \nthe evidence proffered on the issues raised by the Motion has included affidavits or testimony from most \nof the principals involved in this controversy, and the Motion has been fully briefed and argued.  The \nvarious parties have had sufficient time to conduct any desired discovery relative to the Motion, and the \ncourt's ruling on the Motion arises from clear rules of contractual construction.  Consequently, the court \nconcludes that neither party will be unfairly prejudiced by the court's going forward at this time with a \nruling on the Motion. \n5 It is not proper for a trial court to make findings of fact in determining a motion for summary judgment \nunder Rule 56.  However, it is appropriate for a Rule 56 ruling to reflect material facts that the court \nconcludes exist and are not disputed, and which support the legal conclusions with regard to summary \njudgment.  Hyde Ins. Agency v. Dixie Leasing, 26 N.C. App. 138, 142 (1975). \n[7] On or about July 22, 1987, Nathan S. Hurdle (“Hurdle”); EHP; Ralph \nGeorge Bosher (\"Ralph Bosher\") and Ralph Bosher's children, Robert M. Bosher (\"Bo \nBosher\"), Virginia W. Bosher (\"Ginny Bosher\"), Carolyn Bosher Maloney (\"Carolyn \nBosher\") and Christina Bosher Herz (\"Christina Bosher\"),6 executed a written general \npartnership agreement (the \"Partnership Agreement\"), by which they (collectively, the \n\"Partners\") formed and intended to operate HPB as a North Carolina general \npartnership (the \"Partnership\").7 \n[8] The Partnership Agreement was amended pursuant to written \namendments dated January 8, 1990; March 27, 1991 and May 18, 1993.8 \n[9] At the time of execut ion of the Partnership Agreement in 1987, the primary \nasset of the Partnership consisted of approximately 750 acres of undeveloped land in \nPerquimans County.  Over the years that followed, HPB successfully developed \nAlbemarle Plantation.9 \n[10] In 1991, Hurdle withdrew from HPB and his interest was divided among \nthe remaining partners.10  In May 2001, Ralph Bosher assigned his remaining \nownership interest in HPB to his children and to some extended family members.11 \n[11] As a result of Ralph Bosher's poor health beginning in the late 1990's, \nEHP took over primary management of the Partnership, including the marketing and \nsale of Albemarle Plantation's lots, condominiums and single family homes.12   \n                                            \n6 For purposes of the Motion, Bo Bosher, Ginny Bosher, Carolyn Bosher and Christina Bosher also may \nbe referred to collectively as the \"Bosher Partners\". \n7 Am.

Id. at ¶¶ 23-24. \n12 Id. at ¶¶ 25-26. \n[12] On October 25, 2005, EHP gave HPB notice of its intent to withdraw from \nthe Partnership (\"Notice of Withdrawal\"), effective December 31, 2005.13   \n[13] Under Section 11 of the Partnership Agreement, upon withdrawal of a \npartner, the remaining partners may either terminate the Partnership or purchase the \nwithdrawing partner's interest in the Partnership.14 \n[14] By letter dated October 27, 2005, the Bosher Partners accepted EHP's \nwithdrawal and elected to purchase EHP's Partnership interest and to continue the \nPartnership as a going concern.15   \n[15] Section 11 of the Partnership Agr eement further provides that \"[i]f the \nremaining partners (or any of them) elect to purchase the withdrawing partner's interest, \nthe value of the interest of a withdrawing partner shall be as stated in Section 13 herein \nand payment of the amount due to the withdrawing partner shall be made in cash in \nequal quarterly installments . . . .\"16 \n[16] Section 13 of the Partnership Agr eement provides that the value of a \nwithdrawing partner's interest shall be: \nthe book value thereof, as it appears upon the books and \nrecords of the partnership as of  the close of business on the \neffective date of withdrawal, (with the date of such evaluation \nhereinafter referred to as “the effective date”), as adjusted by \nsubstituting the fair market valu e as of such date, in place of \nbook value, of any inventory owned by the partnership.  \nSuch book value, adjusted as  herein provided, shall be \ncomputed by the certified p ublic accountant regularly \nemployed by the partnership , in accordance with the \naccounting practices regularly followed by the partnership, \nand in cases not covered by such practices in accordance \nwith standard accounting practice. . . .

Countercls. ¶ 34. \n21 There has been no forecast of evidence that the Phase II land was contemplated to be used for any \nother purposes.  \ngolf course, pro shop, clubhouse, restaurant and marina.  EHP's argument would \nembrace all Phase I and Phase II properties.22 \n[22] The Bosher Partners contend that \"inventory\" includes only Phase I land \nand improvements developed at that time and offered for sale by the Partnership as \ncondominiums or residential lots.  They contend that the term does not include Phase I \ndevelopment amenities or Phase II undeveloped land owned by the Partnership.23   \n[23] The deposition testimony and affidav its of record establish that the \nrespective Partners, at the time the Partnership Agreement was drafted and signed, did \nnot focus upon or reach a clear understanding or definition of what the word \"inventory\" \nwould mean, as it is used in Section 13 of the Partnership Agreement. \n[24] For example, Christina Bosher stat ed in her Affidavit that \"[she] was not \ninvolved in any discussions at the time the Partnership Agreement was signed \nregarding the meaning of the word 'inventory' or what it included.  [She] had no \nunderstanding whatsoever what that term was supposed to mean.  To [her] knowledge, \n[her] siblings also did not have any understanding as to what the word 'inventory' meant \nat that time.\"24 \n[25] However, Christina Bosher further stated in her Affidavit that, although she \nhad no clear understanding as to what \"inventory\" meant, her understanding of the \nPartnership Agreement was that EHP, upon withdrawal, should receive an amount \nequal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the fair market value of all of the Partnership's \nassets.25 \n                                            \n22 Pl’s. Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Fourth and Seventh Claims Relief 6. \n23 Id. at ¶¶ 35-36. \n24 Christina Bosher Aff. ¶ 6. \n25 Id. at ¶ 9. \n[26] Bo Bosher likewise testified tha t, at the time he signed the Partnership \nAgreement, he had had no discussions with any attorneys or with his siblings \nconcerning the terms or content of the Agreement.26  Prior to EHP's withdrawal, he had \nnever discussed with his siblings how much a withdrawing partner would be entitled to \nbe paid for his interest under the Agreement, and did not even know the word \n\"inventory\" was included in the Agreement.27 \n[27] Ginny Bosher similarly testified t hat she did \"not recall\" any discussions \nwith the other parties to the Partnership Agreement concerning the term \"inventory\" \nprior to EHP's withdrawal.28   \n[28] After EHP's Notice of Withdraw al, Ginny Bosher undertook efforts to \ndetermine what \"inventory\" meant and what the Partners had intended by this term.  \nShe first contacted Art Robb (\"Robb\"), the certified public accountant regularly \nemployed by HPB until 2007.  Robb told her that \"he was going to let the lawyers work \n[the meaning of inventory] out.\"29 \n[29] Robb stated in his Affidavit that \"inventory\" was not mentioned or \ndiscussed until after EHP's Notice of Withdrawal.30   \n[30] Ginny Bosher asked Robb to cont act J. Fred Riley, Esq. (\"Riley\"), the \nattorney for HPB who had drafted the Partnership Agreement in 1987, for Riley's \"take\" \non \"what inventory means.\"  With respect to the negotiation and drafting of the \nPartnership Agreement, Riley stated that \"none of the partners appeared or gathered \ntogether to negotiate the terms of the Partnership Agreement.\"  Rather, the Partnership \n                                            \n26 Bo Bosher Dep. 49. \n27 Id. at 54-55. \n28 Ginny Bosher Dep. 76. \n29 Id. at 195. \n30 Robb Aff. ¶ 5. \nAgreement was a \"standard, 'cookie-cutter' Partnership Agreement that [Riley] used for \npartnerships at that time.\"31 \n[31] In contrast, other Partners testif ied that they understood \"inventory\" to \nmean only the assets available for sale, not including undeveloped property.32 \nIII. \nPLAINTIFF'S MOTION – THE PARTIES' CONTENTIONS \n[32] Based on the proffered evidence t hat the parties did not specifically \ndiscuss or agree upon the meaning of the term \"inventory\" as used in the Partnership \nAgreement, EHP contends that as a matter of law either (a) there was no meeting of the \nminds by the respective Partners in HPB as to the term \"inventory,\" or (b) in the \nalternative the term is too ambiguous to be enforced.  Therefore, EHP argues, because \nSections 11 and 13 of the Partnership Agreement incorporate and rely on the term \n\"inventory,\" they are unenforceable.  Plaintiff contends that in the absence of an \nenforceable provision in the Partnership Agreement governing the procedures for \nwithdrawal by EHP from the Partnership, the North Carolina Uniform Partnership Act \n(\"UPA\") controls, and dissolution of HPB is required by G.S. 59-59.33 \n                                            \n31 Id. at 195-96. \n32 For example, Phil Upton testified that “the logical conclusion for [him] on what inventory is is what you \nhave that you’re selling to people, which is homesites ad condominiums.”  Phil Upton Dep. at 182.  Bo \nBosher likewise testified that inventory to him meant “everything on the shelf that’s for sale.”  Bo Bosher \nDep. at 60.  However, Bo Bosher also signed a letter dated January 20, 2005, which Phil Upton drafted, \nproposing that EHP’s interest upon withdrawal be determined by an appraisal of all the assets of Phase I \n(including the sewer plant).  See Bo Bosher Dep. Ex. 5; Phil Upton Dep. 190. \n33 Plaintiff’s Second, Third and Fifth Claims in substance rest upon the same contentions with regard to \nenforceability of Sections 11 and 13 of the Partnership Agreement. \n[33] Consequently, Plaintiff argues that its Fourth Claim (for judicial dissolution \nof HPB based on EHP's withdrawal) and Seventh Claim (for declaratory judgment) \nshould be granted as a matter of law. 34 \n[34] On the other hand, Defendants c ontend that (a) EHP has no standing to \nseek dissolution of HPB because it no longer is a Partner of HPB and (b) the issue of \nstanding aside, there exist material issues of fact with regard to the definition of \n\"inventory\" in the Partnership Agreement and that the Motion therefore should be \ndenied.35 \nA. \nDISCUSSION \n1. \nApplicable Law \n[35] Under Rule 56(c), su mmary judgment is to be rendered \"forthwith\" if the \npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with \nthe affidavits, if any, show that upon the forecast of evidence there exists no genuine \nissue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of \nlaw.  Grayson v. High Point Dev. Ltd. P'ship, 175 N.C. App. 786, 788 (2006).  The court \nviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Bruce-Terminix \nCo. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 130 N.C. App. 729, 733 (1998). \n[36] The court first will consider Defendants' threshold procedural defense with \nregard to the issue of standing.  \n                                            \n34 EHP’s Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Claims also seek judicial dissolution of HPB and \nrelated relief on other grounds, such as breach of the Partnership contract and conduct that makes it \nimpracticable to carry on a business relationship.  The instant Motion does not address those alternate \ncontentions.  Rather, the Motion only seeks summary judgment on the grounds considered in this Order. \n35 Defs.’ Resp. Pl’s. Mot. Summ. J. Fourth and Seventh Claims Relief 4-5, 6. \n2. \n \nStanding \n \n[37] A party must have standing to assert a claim in order to invoke the subject \nmatter jurisdiction of this court.  See Estate of Apple v. Commercial Courier Express, \nInc., 168 N.C. App. 175, 177, disc. rev. denied, 359 N.C. 632 (2005).  The question of \nstanding is jurisdictional and may be raised at any time.  Crouse v. Mineo, 189 N.C. \nApp. 232, 236 (2008). \n[38] Defendants argue t hat EHP does not have standing to seek dissolution of \nHPB because EHP voluntarily withdrew from the Partnership, and it may not thereafter \nseek judicial dissolution under G.S. 59-62 (providing that the only persons with standing \nto seek judicial dissolution are a partner and a purchaser of a partner's interest). \n[39] Plaintiff argues that it is not s eeking dissolution pursuant to G.S. 59-62, as \nargued by Defendants.  Rather, it contends it is proceeding under G.S. 59-59, which \nprovides that a partnership is dissolved by any \"partner ceasing to be associated in the \ncarrying on . . . of the business.”  Consequently, EHP argues that even if its withdrawal \nwere to be deemed ineffective under the Partnership Agreement, it would have standing \nto proceed under G.S. 59-59. Plaintiff argues that Sections 11 and 13 of the Partnership \nAgreement are unenforceable, that the provisions of G.S. 59-59 are applicable and that \nit has standing to state its Claims in this action. \n[40] The court concludes that for purposes  of the Motion, Plaintiff EHP either \n(a) withdrew from the Partnership as provided by the Partnership Agreement, or (b) its \nleaving the business relationship with the Partners arguably may have brought about a \ndissolution under G.S. 59-59.  Under either scenario, EHP has standing to propound its \narguments arising under its Fourth and Seventh Claims.  \n3. \nPlaintiff's Fourth and Seventh Claims \n[41] In substance, the iss ue before the court is simple.  It is whether there exist \nany genuine issues of material fact with regard to the meaning of the term \"inventory\" as \nit is used in the Partnership Agreement. \n[42] Plaintiff EHP argues that the parti es did not discuss, did not negotiate and \ndid not understand the meaning of the term \"inventory\" as it is used in the Partnership \nAgreement to determine the value of a withdrawing Partner's share in the Partnership.  \nFurther, EHP contends that evidence that the various Partners' ideas, if any, as to what \n\"inventory\" meant were different establishes that there was no meeting of the minds as \nto the term \"inventory.\"  Alternatively, EHP argues that the term \"inventory\" is so \nambiguous that Sections 11 and 13 of the Partnership Agreement are unenforceable.  \nConsequently, EHP argues, that there exists no enforceable provision in the Partnership \nAgreement governing the procedures for withdrawal of a Partner, and that the default \nprovisions of the UPA control. \n[43] Because G.S. 59-59 requires dissolution of a partnership upon the \nwithdrawal of a partner, in the absence of an appropriate agreement between the \npartners, EHP contends it is entitled to a judicial declaration that HPB was dissolved by \nEHP's withdrawal.36 \n                                            \n36 In substance, EHP's goal is to have the value of its interest in HPB based on the value of all HPB \nassets. \n \n[44] The responding Defendants contend to the contrary.  In substance, they \nargue that there exist genuine issues of material fact with regard to the meaning of \n\"inventory\" in the Partnership Agreement, that this presents an issue for the trier of fact \nand that Plaintiff's Claims are not appropriate for summary judgment. \n[45] Defendants argue that in North Carolina, where there is only one \n“reasonable interpretation” of a term, the term is plain and the contract is enforced \naccording to that reasonable interpretation.  Further, that where there is more than one \n“reasonable interpretation” of a material contractual provision, ambiguity may exist, but \nis not fatal.  Defendants contend that in such instances, the court can look to extrinsic \nevidence to see which reasonable interpretation the parties intended.  Among others, \nthey rely upon Whirlpool Corp. v. Dailey Constr., Inc., 110 N.C. App. 468, 471 (1993). \n[46] Defendants argue therefor e, that determination of what is meant by the \nword \"inventory\" in the Partnership Agreement should be made by the ultimate trier of \nfact based upon evidentiary showings, and that summary judgment is not appropriate. \n[47] The court is not persuaded by the ar guments of either the Plaintiff or the \nresponding Defendants. \n[48] The fact that a term in a contra ct was not specifically discussed by the \nparties to the agreement does not lead necessarily to a conclusion that the term cannot \nbe defined by the court, or that the provision is void.  See Kroger Ltd. P’Ship v. \nGuastello, 177 N.C. App. 386, 389-93 (2006) (where the court interpreted the meaning \nof the disputed term “building” in a lease agreement). \n[49] Rather, our courts routinely and properly use customary rules of \nconstruction in determining the natural and ordinary meaning of disputed contractual \nprovisions.  Unless there is an ambiguity on the face of the agreement that is not \nsusceptible to reasonable construction, a determination by the court is proper.  See \nPiedmont Bank and Trust Co. v. Stevenson, 79 N.C. App. 236, 240 (1986); see also \nCharlotte Hous. Auth. v. Fleming, 123 N.C. App. 511, 514 (1996) (construing the word \n“guest\" in a lease); E.L. Scott Roofing Co. v. State of N.C., 82 N.C. App. 216, 223 \n(1986). \n[50] It is not uncommon for contract s to be form-based and not created from \n\"scratch.\"  Indeed, one reason the use of form contracts is beneficial is because terms \nmay acquire meaning from continual use over time.  The very fact that the term \n“inventory” appears in the Partnership Agreement weighs in favor of according it specific \nmeaning; that is, the term was chosen not haphazardly without thinking, but was chosen \nfor inclusion in a form contract precisely because it carries meaning. \n[51] It is not fatal to a contract that so me of its signatories later disagree as to \nwhat a material term “means” or argue that the term is susceptible to different \n“meanings.”  Instead, in North Carolina “[t]he heart of a contract is the intention of the \nparties, which is to be ascertained from the expressions used, the subject matter, the \nend in view, the purpose sought, and the situation of the parties at the time.”  Elec. Co. \nv. Ins. Co., 229 N.C. 518, 520 (1948).  Where there is only one “reasonable \ninterpretation” of a contractual term, the term is plain and the contract is enforced \naccording to that reasonable interpretation.  Whirlpool Corp., 110 N.C. App. at 471; \nKlein v. Avemco Ins. Co., 289 N.C. 63, 66 (1975). \n[52] In determining whether a contractual provision is susceptible to definition \non the face of the agreement, the court should look to the natural and ordinary meaning \nof words.  With regard to the instant matter there are numerous sources that can assist \nthe court in this effort.  Black’s Law Dictionary defines “inventory” as “raw materials or \ngoods in stock.”  BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 902 (9th ed. 2009).  Webster's Third New \nInternational Dictionary defines \"inventory\" as \"raw materials, supplies, work in process, \nand finished goods on hand as of a given date,\" and as \"goods or materials \naccumulated against future needs.\"  (emphasis added).  WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW \nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1189 (3d ed. 2002).  The North Carolina Uniform Commercial \nCode (\"UCC\"), at G.S. 25-9-102 (48)(b) and (d) defines \"inventory\" as goods which \"are \nheld . . . for sale\" and \"consist of raw materials, work in process, or materials used or \nconsumed in a business.\" 37  (emphasis added). \n[53] In the instant case, it is undi sputed that HPB holds the unsold and \ndeveloped lots and condominium units in Phase I for future sale.  It also is undisputed \nthat HPB holds the undeveloped land in Phase II for future development and sale.  The \nbusiness of HPB is and always has been the development and sale of Albemarle \nPlantation residential lots and condominiums.  The court is forced to conclude that both \nunsold developed lots and condominiums in Phase I and the undeveloped land in \nPhase II of Albemarle Plantation constitute \"inventory\" for purposes of Sections 11 and \n13 of the Partnership Agreement. \n[54] The forecast of undisputed evidence does not support Plaintiff's \ncontentions that (a) there was no meeting of the minds between the Partners with \nregard to material provisions of the Partnership Agreement or (b) that the Partnership \nAgreement is unenforceable because of hopeless ambiguity. \n                                            \n37 The UCC deals with \"goods\" and not real property.  However, the \"inventory\" concept is the same in \neither instance, and the UCC provision is instructive. \n[55] Accordingly, the court CONCLUDES t hat there exist no genuine issues of \nmaterial fact with regard to the definition of the word \"inventory\" for purposes of \nSections 11 and 13 of the Partnership Agreement, and that both unsold developed lots \nand condominiums in Phase I and the undeveloped land in Phase II of Albemarle \nPlantation constitute \"inventory\" for such purposes.  Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to \nappropriate summary judgment in its favor with regard to paragraphs 132, 138 and 139 \nof its Seventh Claim, as to which the Plaintiff's Motion should be GRANTED.  With \nregard to the remaining allegations of Plaintiff's Seventh Claim, there exist genuine \nissues of material fact, and the Motion should be DENIED. \n[56] The court further CONCLUDES t hat there exist no genuine issues of \nmaterial fact with regard to Plaintiff's contentions that there was no meeting of the minds \nbetween the Partners with regard to material provisions of the Partnership Agreement or \nthat the Partnership Agreement is unenforceable because of hopeless ambiguity.  \nRather, the forecast of evidence does not support Plaintiff's allegations in this regard. \n[57] Accordingly, Plaintiff is not entit led to summary judgment in its favor with \nregard to Plaintiff's Fourth Claim, and as to it the Motion should be DENIED. \nIV. \nTHE REMAINING MOTIONS \nA. \nPlaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n[58] Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on t he Pleadings seeks dismissal as to all \nof Defendants' counterclaims (\"Counterclaims\"), pursuant to Rules 12(c), 12(b)(6) and \n12(b)(7). \n[59] Defendants subsequently voluntarily dismissed their Second, Third, Fourth \nand Fifth Counterclaims (\"Dismissed Counterclaims\").  Accordingly, as to the Dismissed \nCounterclaims, Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is MOOT and should be \nDENIED. \n[60] The court CONCLUDES t hat Defendants' First Counterclaim (Declaratory \nJudgment) states a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Plaintiff's Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleadings as to the First Counterclaim should be DENIED. \nB. \nDefendants' Motion to Dismiss \n[61] Defendants' Motion to Dismiss seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's First through \nSixth Claims, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \n[62] Dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate when the \ncomplaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  In deciding a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint are taken as true and \nadmitted, but conclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of facts are not admitted.  \nSutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 98 (1970). \n[63] A complaint fails to state a clai m upon which relief can be granted when \neither (a) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim, (b) \nthe complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim or \n(c) some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.  \nJackson v. Bumgardner, 318 N.C. 172, 175 (1986). \n[64] However, a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted unless it (a) does not give sufficient notice to the \ndefendant of the nature and basis of the plaintiff’s claim or (b) appears beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the plaintiff could not prove any set of facts in support of his claim \nthat would entitle him to relief.  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. at 108. \n[65] When a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is  denied, by subsequently utilizing \ndiscovery a moving defendant may be able to ascertain more precisely the details of \nplaintiff’s various claims and whether the plaintiff can prove facts which will entitle \nplaintiff to have a jury decide the merits of one or more of the stated claims.  Sutton v. \nDuke, 277 N.C. at 98.  If there then exists a good faith contention that the plaintiff \ncannot prove sufficient facts as to any such claim, the defendant may seek relief \nthrough good-faith utilization of Rule 56 or other suitable procedural device. \n[66]   The court CONCLUDES that Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support \nits First through Sixth Claims, and that Defendants' Motion to Dismiss should be \nDENIED. \nC. \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \n[67] Certain Defendants also lodged a Motion for Summary Judgment with \nregard to all of Plaintiffs Claims. \n[68] With regard to Plaintiff's First Claim and Sixth Claim, there exist genuine \nissues of material fact, and as to said Claims, the Defendants' Motion for Summary \nJudgment should be DENIED. \n[69] With regard to Plaintiff's Seventh Claim , this court has ruled that Plaintiff is \nentitled to summary judgment in its favor with regard to paragraphs 132, 138 and 139 of \nsaid Claim, and as to said paragraphs, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment \ntherefore should be DENIED.  With regard to the remaining allegations of said Seventh \nClaim, there exist genuine issues of material fact, and Defendants' Motion for Summary \nJudgment likewise should be DENIED. \n[70] Plaintiff's Second Claim is based in substance upon Plaintiff's contention \nthat the position taken by Defendants with regard to the definition of \"inventory\" \nconstitutes either (a) a breach of the Partnership Agreement or (b) a withdrawal by \nDefendants of their acceptance of EHP's withdrawal from the Partnership and their \ncorresponding election to purchase EHP's Partnership interest and to continue the \nPartnership as a going concern.  As a result, Plaintiff contends it is entitled to a decree \nof dissolution of EHP.38  The court CONCLUDES that the forecast of evidence in this \nmatter does not support Plaintiff's allegations with regard to its Second Claim.  \nConsequently, there exist no genuine issues of material fact with regard to such Claim, \nand Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to the Second Claim should be \nGRANTED. \n[71] Plaintiff's Third and Fourth Claim s in substance are based upon Plaintiff's \ncontention that either (a) there was no meeting of the minds between the Partners with \nregard to material provisions of the Partnership Agreement or (b) the Partnership \nAgreement is unenforceable because of hopeless ambiguity.  As a result, Plaintiff \ncontends that Sections 11 and 13 of the Partnership Agreement are unenforceable and \nthat Plaintiff is entitled to a decree of judicial dissolution.39  The court CONCLUDES that \nthe forecast of evidence in this matter does not support Plaintiff's allegations with regard \nto its Third and Fourth Claims.  Consequently, there exist no genuine issues of material \n                                            \n38 Compl. ¶¶ 96-99. \n39 Id. at ¶¶ 100-15. \nfact with regard to such Claims, and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment as to \nthe Third and Fourth Claims should be GRANTED. \n[72] Plaintiff's Fifth Claim is based upo n Plaintiff's contention that a brief \ntransfer in 2004 of the Bosher Partners' ownership interests in HPB to an entity known \nas the Bosher Family LLC constituted such a material breach of the Partnership \nAgreement that it entitles Plaintiff to a decree of judicial dissolution of HPB.40  The court \nCONCLUDES that the forecast of evidence in this matter does not support Plaintiff's \nallegations with regard to its Fifth Claim.  Consequently, there exist no genuine issues \nof material fact with regard to such Claim, and Defendants' Motion for Summary \nJudgment as to the Fifth Claim should be GRANTED. \nNOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing CONCLUSIONS, it is \nORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that: \n[73] Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgm ent with regard to its Fourth Claim is \nDENIED. \n[74] Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Ju dgment with regard to paragraphs 132, \n138 and 139 of its Seventh Claim is GRANTED, as follows: the definition of the word \n\"inventory\" for purposes of Sections 11 and 13 of the Partnership Agreement shall \ninclude both unsold developed lots and condominiums in Phase I and the undeveloped \nland in Phase II of Albemarle Plantation. \n[75] With regard to the remaining allegat ions of Plaintiff's Seventh Claim, the \nPlaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. \n[76] Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Defendants' \nCounterclaims is DENIED. \n                                            \n40 Id. at ¶¶ 116-22. \n[77] Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plai ntiff's First through Sixth Claims is \nDENIED. \n[78] Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment with regard to Plaintiff's \nSecond, Third, Fourth and Fifth Claims is GRANTED, and said Claims hereby are \nDISMISSED. \n[79] Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgm ent with regard to Plaintiff's First, \nSixth and Seventh Claims is DENIED. \n[80] The court will hold a st atus conference relative to this action on Thursday, \nNovember 4, 2010, beginning at 11:00 am at the North Carolina Business Court, 225 \nHillsborough Street, Suite 303, Raleigh, North Carolina. \nThis the 5th day of October, 2010. \n \n "
