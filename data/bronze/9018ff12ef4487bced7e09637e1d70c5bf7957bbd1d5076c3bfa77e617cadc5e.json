THIS MATTER is before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel the \nproduction of documents that have been withheld from discovery by Defendants on \nthe basis of attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine (the “Motion”).  \n(ECF No. 78.)  Following review and consideration of the Motion, briefs and exhibits \nfiled in support and in opposition to the Motion, arguments of counsel during a \nhearing held on 2 4 June 2021,  and other matters of record, and after having \nconducted an in camera review of the documents at issue, the Court determines that \nFord v. Jurgens, 2021 NCBC 64. \n \n \nthe Motion should be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part for the reasons set \nforth below. \nBrooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard LLP, by Clint S. Morse, \nKatarina K. Wong, and James L. Bobbitt III , for Plaintiffs Christopher \nKisgen and John Ford. \n \nWilson Ratledge, PLLC, by Michael Ostrander, for Defendant s TREIA \nFoundation, Inc. and Triangle Real Estate Investors Association \n(TREIA), LLC. \n \nHarris Sarratt & Hodges, LLP, by Donald J. Harris, and McAngus, \nGoudelock & Courie, PLLC, by Jeffrey D. Keister and Sean R. Madden, \nfor Defendants Kathie Russell and Carl Jurgens, Jr. \n \nWilson Ratledge, PLLC, by Michael Ostrander, and Goldberg Segalla, by \nThomas M. Buckley and Allegra Amelia Sinclair, for Nominal Defendant \nTriangle Real Estate Investors Association, Inc. \n \nEarp, Judge.  \nI.  BACKGROUND \n2. The underlying derivative action was filed on 9 April 2020 by John Ford \nand Christopher Kisgen (“Derivative Plaintiffs”), two former Board members of \nTriangle Real Estate Investors Association Inc. (the “Association” or “TREIA Inc.”), a \nnon-profit real estate investment association founded in 2003 to provide educational \nand networking benefits to its membership.  (Am. Compl., ¶¶ 1, 13, ECF No. 11; Aff. \nKathie Russell, at Ex. D (“Articles of Incorporation”), ECF 9.5.) \n3. Plaintiffs complain on behalf of the Association that two other \nAssociation Board members, Kathie Russell (“Russell”) and Carl Arnold Jurgens, Jr. \n(“Jurgens”), “through a series of misrepresentations and blatant omissions  . . . took \nactions to redirect control and ownership of the [Association, ]” (Am. Compl., ¶ 2), to \n \n \ntwo newly formed entities: Triangle Real Estate Investors Association, LLC, a for -\nprofit entity (“TREIA, LLC” or the “LLC”), and TREIA Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit \ncorporation established for charitable purposes (the “Foundation”) (collectively the \n“New Entities”), (Am. Compl. ¶ 11).  They further allege that Russell and Jurgens did \nnot reveal to either the Association’s Board or its membership that they intended to \nbe the sole members and owners of  the new TREIA, LLC, that Russell and Jurgens \nmisled the Association Board regarding its role  in the governance of the new  LLC, \nand that Russell and Jurgens improperly transferred funds from the Association to \nthe New Entities in violation of the Association’s Articles of Incorporation.   ( Am. \nCompl., ¶¶ 26, 37–39, 60–63.) \n4. Defendants deny any wrongdoing with respect to the formation of the \nNew Entities or their funding from the Association’s coffers.  They contend that both \nthe Board and the Association’s membership approved the conversion o f the \nAssociation into the New Entities, and that Russell and Jurgens acted to carry out \nthe Association’s decision.  They argue that this action is brought by two former Board \nmembers who simply disagree with the strategic direction the Association has taken.  \n(Resp. Br. Opp. Pls.’ Mot. Compel 9, ECF No. 83.) \n5. As amended,\n1 the Complaint alleges derivative claims for: (1) Breach of \nFiduciary Duty against fellow Association Board members Jurgens and Russell, (2) \nImproper Distribution of monies transferred from the Association to the New \nEntities, (3) a Declaration that the dissolution of the Association and “all transactions \n \n1 An amended complaint was filed on 28 April 2020.  (ECF No. 11.) \n \n \nrelated thereto” are void, (4) Legal Malpractice and Attorney Fraud against Russell, \n(5) Common Law Trademark Infringement and U nfair Competition, and (6) Unfair \nand Deceptive Trade Practices in violation of Chapter 75 of the North Carolina \nGeneral Statutes. \n6. The case has followed an arduous path to reach this point.  Earlier \nmotions for preliminary injunction, to a ppoint a receiver and, by the Plaintiff, for \npartial summary judgment, have been denied.  A C ase Management Order was \nentered on 28 July 2020 and has been amended to extend the discovery period six  \ntimes. \n7. Most recently, a series of discovery issues have er upted that the Court \nhas heard pursuant to Business Court Rule (“BCR”) 10.9.  This Motion arises from \none of the disputes that was not resolved during the BCR 10.9 process  and pertains \nto drafts of the LLC’s operating agreement and the individual Defendant s’ \ncommunications with counsel during the drafting process. \n8. Specifically, Plaintiffs state that they served requests for production on \neach of the Defendants separately on 26 October 2020.  Request 23 sought, “[a]ll \ndrafts of the LLC’s Operating Agreement and all communications related to the LLC’s \nOperating Agreement and any drafts thereof.”   (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Compel 2, ECF \nNo. 79.)  All Defendants responded on 29 December 2020 objecting to Request 23 on \nmultiple grounds, including “attorney -client privilege and work product.”  (Pls.’ Br. \nSupp. Mot. Compel  2.)  On 15 March 2021 Defendants produced, and later \nsupplemented, a privilege log asserting that drafts of the requested operating \n \n \nagreement, some containing redlined edits, and communications to and from counsel \nwere protected from discovery by “the attorney -client privilege, privileged \ncommunication and work product.”  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Compel, at Ex. 1, ECF No. \n79.1.)  \n9. Plaintiffs filed the Motion on 19 April 2021 requesting that the Court \ncompel production of drafts of the operating agreement that were created for the LLC, \nalong with the communications to and from counsel that were generated  during the \ndrafting process.   \n10. Plaintiffs argue that these documents are relevant to their claims that \nRussell and Jurgens m isled the Association’s Board and its members —both \naffirmatively and by omission—into changing the corporate structure so that Russell \nand Jurgens could take control of the Association and its assets for themselves.  They \npoint to fact disputes that have arisen concerning the terms of the o perating \nagreement. (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Compel 12.) \n11. In response to Defendants’ objection that the requested documen ts are \nprotected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine, Plaintiffs \nargue that the work product doctrine is inapplicable, that Defendants waived the \nattorney-client privilege by putting the advice they received from  counsel at is sue, \nthat drafts of the Operating Agreement are not confidential communications, and \nthat, in any event, the fiduciary and crime -fraud exceptions to the attorney -client \nprivilege apply such that the documents are not protected.  \n \n \n12. Having reviewed the briefs submitted and heard the arguments of \ncounsel, the Court determined that an in camera review of the documents at issue \nwas appropriate.  ( See Order Following Conference, ECF No. 92.)  Defendants \nsubmitted the documents in question, which fall into two categories: (1) drafts of the \nLLC’s Operating Agreement;  and (2) e -mail communications between and among \nRussell, Jurgens, Donald Harris (counsel for Russell and Jurgens),  and attorneys of \nthe Wilson Ratledge law firm (representing the Association , the LLC , and  the \nFoundation).  The Court has conducted its review, and the Motion is ripe for \ndisposition. \nII. ANALYSIS \n13. The Court starts with the framework for determining whether the \ndocuments at issue are protected from discovery by either the attorney -client \nprivilege or the work product doctrine. \nA.  Attorney-Client Privilege \n14. It is well -established that i n North Carolina, the attorney -client \nprivilege applies if: “(1) the relation of the attorney and the client existed at the time \nthe communication was made, (2) the communication was made in confidence, (3) the \ncommunication relates to a matter about which the attorney is being professionally \nconsulted, (4) the communication was made in the course of giving or seeking legal \nadvice for a proper purpose although litigation n eed not be contemplated [,] and (5) \nthe client has not waived the privilege.”  State v. Murvin, 304 N.C. 523, 531 (1981); \nsee also  Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc.,  2019 NCBC \n \n \nLEXIS 54, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. 16 Aug. 2019) , aff’d per curiam , 377 N.C. 551 \n(2021); Morris v. Scenera Research, LLC, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 34, at *14 (N.C. Super. \nCt. 26 Aug. 2011).  “If any one of these five elements is not present in any portion of \nan attorney-client communication, that portion of the co mmunication is not \nprivileged.”  In re Investigation of the Death of Miller, 357 N.C. 316, 335 (2003). \n15. Given its impact, the attorney -client privilege is construed strictly.  \nEvans v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 142 N.C. App. 18, 31 (2001) (providing that “courts \nare obligated to strictly construe the privilege ”); State v. Smith , 138 N.C. 700, 703 \n(1905) (“As the rule of privilege has a tendency to prevent the full disclosure of the \ntruth, it should be limited to cases which are strictly within the principle of the policy \nthat gave birth to it.”) (quotation marks omitted). \n16. The party seeking to utilize the attorney-client privilege as a shield from \ndiscovery bears the burden of proof . Wachovia Bank v. Clean River Corp. , 178 N.C. \nApp. 528, 531 (2006).  Here, that burden is on Defendants. \nB.  Work Product Doctrine \n17. In contrast to the  robust protection  bestowed by the attorney -client \nprivilege, the work product doctrine provides  limited immunity from discovery f or \ndocuments and other tangible things prepared “in anticipation of litigation.”  \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 26(b)(3).  Once the party invoking the doctrine establishes that \nthe documents or things in question were prepared in anticipation of litigation, work \nproduct immunity attaches unless  the other party establishes that he has \n“substantial need of the materials in preparation of the case” and that he “is unable \n \n \nwithout undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other \nmeans.”  Id.   Even so, if the work product contains the mental i mpressions, \nconclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney concerning the litigation in \nwhich the material is sought, the court will not order  disclosure of that information.  \nId. \n18. Although the reach of the work product doctrine is broader than that of \nthe attorney -client privilege,  because it is a limit on discovery, it, too, must be \nnarrowly construed.  Evans, 142 N.C. App. at 29 (“Because work product protection \nby its nature may hinder an investigation into the true facts, it should be narrowly \nconstrued consistent with its purpose . . . .”) (citation omitted).  Therefore, not every \ndocument created when litigation looms is subject to its protection.  To be covered by \nthe work product doctrine, the document must be created in anticipation of litigation.  \nSee Willis v. Duke Power Co., 291 N.C. 19, 35 (1976); Evans, 142 N.C. App. at 29.   \n19. However, “[t]he phrase ‘in anticipation of litigation’ is an elastic \nconcept[,]” and determining whether a document was or was not prepared in \nanticipation of litigation is dependent on the circumstances.  Cook v. Wake Cty. Hosp. \nSys., 125 N.C. App. 618, 623 (1997).  Federal decisions provide some guidance.  \nBrewer v. Harris, 279 N.C. 288, 292 (1971) (Where our case law on civil procedure is \nnot definitive, our Supreme Court directs us to federal decisions for “ enlightenment \nand guidance.”) (citation omitted).   \n20. While the federal courts are not aligned with respect to the wording used \nto define when a document is prepared “in anticipation of litigation,” they do require \n \n \nthat the prospect of litigation —rather than business considerations —be the central \nmotivator.  See United States v. Richey , 632 F.3d 559, 567 (9th Cir. 2011) (applying \nthe “because of” test to “determine whether the document was created because of \nanticipated litigation, and would not have been created in substantially similar form \nbut for the prospect of litigation”) (citation and quotation marks omitted); Nat’l Union \nFire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co. , 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4 th Cir. 1992) (“[I]n \nresolving the question of whether matters are immune from discovery because of the \nwork product rule, attention must be turned first to whether the documents or \ntangible things were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial  . . . .”); United \nStates v. Davis, 636 F.2d 1028, 1040 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 862 (1981) \n(“[T]he primary motivating purpose behind the creation of the document was to aid \nin possible future litigation.”). \n21. If documents are prepared in the ordinary course of business —even if \ndrafted in response to an event that portends litigation —they are not work product.  \nSaunders v. Hull Prop. Grp., LLC , No. COA17-1115, 2018 N.C. App. LEXI S 254, at \n*7 (N.C. Ct. App. 20 Mar. 2018) (unpublished) (stating that the North Carolina Court \nof Appeals “has consistently held that reports published in accordance with a \ncompany’s established policy are not protected work product, even when drafted in \nresponse to an event that might foreseeably give rise to litigation”); Fulmore v. \nHowell, 189 N.C. App. 93, 102 (2008) (concluding that a report created pursuant to a \nsafety manual was prepared in the ordinary course of business negating “the \npossibility of the protection of the report under the doctrine of work product”); Evans, \n \n \n142 N.C. App. at 30 (affirming the trial court’s denial of work product immunity over \nthe defendant-insurers’ “claims diary” because “the investigation stage of the claims \nprocess is one carried out in the ordinary course of an insurer’s business”); Cook, 125 \nN.C. App. at 625 (reversing the trial court’s denial of a motion to compel production \nof an accident report that “would have been compiled, pursuant to the hospital’s \npolicy, regardless of whether [the plaintiff] intimated a desire to sue the hospital or \nwhether litigation was ever anticipated by the hospital”).   \n22. This is true even if litigation involving the document might result.  See, \ne.g., United States v. El Paso Co., 682 F.2d 530, 542–43 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, \n466 U.S. 944 (1984) (papers relating to the preparation of tax returns do not gain \nwork product immunity solely because the IRS may conduct an audit); Status Time \nCorp., v. Sharp Elecs., Corp., 95 F.R.D. 27, 29 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (documents relating to \nfiling for or maintaining a patent are not protected solely because litigation of the \npatent right is a possibility); In re Penn Cent. Commercial Paper Litig., 61 F.R.D. 453, \n468 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (finding that offering circulars are not protected solely because  \nliability may result or because their author is a lawyer). \n23. The Court now turns to the documents that are the subject of the \nMotion. \nDrafts of the Operating Agreement \n24. The drafts at issue include a first draft of the Operating Agreement \nprepared by Kathie R ussell (identified by LLC as Exhibit B) and subsequent drafts \nwith edits made either by attorneys from Wilson Ratledge, who represent the LLC, \n \n \nor by Russell or Jurgens (identified by LLC as “Exhibits D, F, G, I, J, L, O, Q).  The \nLLC’s final Operating Agreement (Exhibit R) has been produced to Plaintiffs and is \nalready a part of the record.  ( See Aff. Kathie Russell , at Ex. B (“TREIA, LLC \nOperating Agreement”), ECF No. 9.3.) \n25. Defendants argue that the requested drafts exchanged between counsel \nfor the LLC 2 and Russell and Jurgens constitute attorney -client privileged \ncommunications because they contain redlined changes and communications between \nthe LLC and its counsel made in confidence about a matter for which counsel was \nbeing professionally consulted.  (Resp. Br. Opp. Pls.’ Mot. Compel 3–5.)    \n26. However, Plaintiffs contend that the operating agreement —at least, \nonce it was final —was not intended to be a confidential document.  Moreover, they \nargue that even if drafts  of the operating agreement  are protected by the attorney -\nclient privilege, any such privilege has been waived  because Defendants put advice \nthey received from counsel “at issue.”  Alternatively , they argue that  either the \nfiduciary exception or the crime -fraud exception to the atto rney-client privilege \nrequires disclosure of the drafts.  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Compel 8 –15.)  The Court \naddresses these arguments in turn. \nA. Confidential Communication \n27. A communication intended to be disclosed to third parties is not \nconfidential.  Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 54, at *73.  In \n \n2 The Court notes that Mr. Harris was also privy to these communications.  However, no \nparty has raised an issue regarding waiver or application of the common-interest doctrine \nand, therefore, the Court will not raise one.  \n \n \nmany instances,  however, determining when one’s intention regarding a draft \ndocument changes from an intention to seek and receive attorney advice to an \nintention to publish the document to others can be difficult.  In this case, however, e-\nmail communications accompanying the drafts, beginning with the first, indicate that \nthey were sent between clients and counsel for discussion and revision.  Even those \nportions of the drafts that went through the process unchanged and became part of \nthe final operating agreement were first subject to attorney scrutiny.  Other portions \nof the drafts reflect legal advice in the form of marginal comments and redline edits \nmade by counsel.  Given this e-mail traffic revealing that Defendants’ intent was not \nto publish the drafts until their counsel had fully advised them regarding revisions, \nthe drafts are protected by the attorney-client privilege.  Morris, 2011 NCBC LEXIS \n34, at *21–22 (noting in dicta that “drafts of potential [contracts] prepared by counsel \nfor client review would be privileged up to the point at which they were intended to \nbe given” to a third party); cf. Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS \n54, at *75 –76 (involving drafts that appear t o have been intended for disclosure to \nthird parties).   \nB. Implicit (Subject Matter) Waiver:  Putting Legal Advice at Issue  \n28. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants implicitly waived the privilege by \n“putting at issue” the advice received from counsel regarding the legality of the \nprocess used to transition to the New Entities.  Specifically, they point to a  6 April \n2020 e-mail from several Board members, including Jurgens and Russell, telling the \nmembership: “It’s important to know the attorney has reviewed the \n \n \nrestructuring initiative and confirmed that it is being done in a manner that \ncomplies with applicable laws and regulations .”  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Compel, \nat Ex. 12, ECF No. 79.12.) \n29. Given the import of the privilege and the fact that Defendants did not \nexpressly state their intention to waive the privilege, th e Court treads cautiously in \nthe area of implied waiver.  See, e.g., In re Keeper of Records, 348 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir. \n2003) (explaining that the evaluation of claims for implied  waiver of attorney-client \nprivilege “demands a fastidious sifting of the facts and a careful weighing of the \ncircumstances”); United States v. Desir,  273 F.3d 39, 46 (1st  Cir. 2001)  (“Implied \nwaiver requires a careful weighing of the facts and ‘should not  be applied \ncavalierly.’ ”) (quoting In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175, 186 (2d Cir. \n2000)).  \n30. This Court uses a balancing approach to determine the scope of subject \nmatter waiver so that the result is remedial, rather than punitive.  Technetics Grp. \nDaytona, Inc. v. N2 Biomedical, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 116, 17–19 (N.C. Super. Ct \n8 Nov. 2018).  Under  this approach, when one party waives the privilege to use a \nportion of the party’s communications with the party’s attorney to advance a position \nin litigation, the court broadens the waiver to eliminate any unfair advantage.  “On \nthe other hand, ‘when the disclosure does not create an unfair advantage, courts \ntypically limit the waiver to the communications actually disclosed.’ ”  Id. at *18  \n(quoting Teleglobe Commc’ns v. BCE, Inc., 493 F.3d 345, 361 (3d Cir. 2007)). \n \n \n31. In this case, t he e-mail purporting to  put attorney advice at issue is \ndated 6 Apri l 2020 and refers to the past (“.  . . the attorney has reviewed  . . . and \nconfirmed”).  The earliest date of the documents at issue —drafts of the Operating \nAgreement and accompanying communications with counsel —is 9 April 2020 .  \nConsequently, the e- mail above, which predates the documents at issue,  could not \nhave referred to the m and, therefore, cannot be considered a waiver as to them.  \nIndeed, the documents produced for in camera review do not express an opinion \nregarding whether the  Association’s restructuring efforts complied with the law or \nnot.  Moreover, it is unclear who “the attorney” referenced is and whether that person \nis the same counsel consulted with respect to the LLC’s operating agreement. \n32. On these facts the Court finds that the 6 April 2020 e -mail referencing \na review done by an attorney at some point in the past does not result in waiver of \nthe privilege with respect to subsequent drafts of the LLC’s operating agreement and \nthe accompanying attorney-client communications. \nC. Fiduciary Exception   \n33. Plaintiffs contend that attorneys from Wilson Ratledge represented both \nthe Association and the LLC.  T herefore, they argue, Plaintiffs,  as members of the \nAssociation’s Board, should be privy to all communications with Wilson Ratledge, \nincluding the redlined drafts of the LLC’s operating agreement and the accompanying \ne-mail communications.  (Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Compel 5, ECF No. 85.) \n34. Defendants respond that the documents and communications at issue \nonly relate to the LLC and not the Association, and that the lawyers were working \n \n \nonly for the LLC at the time.  They further argue that, in any event, the lawyers owed \nno fiduciary duty to these particular Plaintiffs who were not members of the \nAssociation’s Board at the time of the communications.   (Resp. Br. Opp. Pls.’ Mot. \nCompel 5–7.)  \n35. The fiduciary exception has not  been recognized by the North Carolina \nstate courts.  However, non-binding authority suggests that in some circumstances a \nshareholder in a derivative action may access documents that a corporation claims \nare protected from the attorney -client privilege if the shareholder shows good cause \nas to why the privilege should not apply.  See,  e.g., Market el Media, Inc. v. \nMediapotamus, Inc. , No. 5:13 -CV-427-D, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76523, at *12 \n(E.D.N.C. 11 June 2015) (“ In some shareholder derivative contexts, th e so -called \nfiduciary exception to the attorney -client privilege can require, for good cause, \ndisclosure of communications covered by the corporation's privilege to dissident \nshareholders.”).   \n36. However, in jurisdictions that have recognized the fiduciary e xception, \n“courts have generally found the fiduciary exception inapplicable to communications \nmade during a time when the parties’ interests were not aligned or when the subject \nof the communications did not involve matters that a fiduciary would owe a dut y to \ndisclose to a beneficiary.”  Herrmann v. Rain Link, Inc., No. 11-1123-RDR, 2012 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 50553, at *6 (D. Kan. 11 Apr. 2012). \n37. Thus, even if the exception were to be recognized in this State’s \njurisprudence, it is undisputed that the parties’ interests were not aligned when the \n \n \ncommunications occurred.  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Compel 3–6.)  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the fiduciary exception is inapplicable. \nD. Crime-Fraud Exception  \n38. Plaintiffs contend that the crime -fraud exception to the attorney-client \nprivilege applies because the communications at issue were generated as part of a n \neffort to carry out fraudulent activity.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that counsel was \nretained to assist Defendants’ effort to “paper over” Defendants’ secret, true \nintentions with respect to the LLC’s ownership and its finances. \n39. Defendants contend that preparation of the Operating Agreement was \nnot activity in furtherance of fraud but was merely to record in written form what \nDefendants contend had already been decided.  Russell and Jurgens argue that, prior \nto engaging in the drafting process with counsel, they were forthcoming about their \nposition with respect to both the ownership of the LLC and its funding but that \nPlaintiffs simply did not agree with  them.  In short, Defendants assert that the \noperating agreement does nothing more than reflect their stated position. They  \ncontend, therefore, that Plaintiffs have not made a showing sufficient to meet their \nburden for asserting the crime-fraud exception. \n40. The crime -fraud exception  eliminates attorney-client privilege \nprotection when a client uses legal representation for an improper purpose such as to \ncommit or facilitate a crime or fraud.  Miller, 357 N.C. at 335 (“the attorney -client \nprivilege cannot serve as a shield for fraud or as a tool to aid in the commission of \nfuture criminal activities; if a communication is not ‘made in the course of seeking or \n \n \ngiving legal advice for a proper purpose,’ it is not protected.” ) (quoting State v. \nJennings, 333 N.C. 579, 611 (1993)) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also \nState v. Davenport , 227 N.C. 475, 498 (1947) (“the communication must have been \nmade in the course of seeking legal advice for a proper purpose; hence, no privilege \nexists where advice is sought in aid of a contemplated violation of law .”); Window \nWorld of Baton Rouge, LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 54, at *39–40. \n41. Unlike the fiduciary exception, North Carolina courts have recognized \nthe crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege.  See Miller, 357 N.C. at 335 \n(noting that “[w]hen certain extraordinary circumstances are present, the need for \ndisclosure of attorney -client communications will trump the confidential nature of \nthe privilege”) (citing United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554 (1989)); Window World of \nBaton Rouge, LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 54, at *39.  Even so, the case law defining the \ncontours of the exception is limited.  Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC, 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 54, at *42. \n42. As explained by Chief Judge Bledsoe in Window World of Baton Rouge, \nLLC, the party invoking the crime-fraud exception must make a prima facie showing \nthat otherwise privileged communications fall within the exception.  Id. at * 43 \n(citation omitted).  “The invoking party must show that (1) the client was engaged in \nor planning a criminal or fraudulent scheme when he sought the advice of counsel to \nfurther the scheme, and (2) the documents containing the privileged materials bear \na close relationship to the client's existing or future scheme to commit a crime or \nfraud.”  Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).  “Prong one of this test is satisfied \n \n \nby a prima facie showing of evidence that, if believed by a trier of fact, would establish \nthe elements of some v iolation that was ongoing or about to be committed.”  Id.  at \n*43–44.  “Prong two may be satisfied with a showing of a close relationship between \nthe attorney-client communications and the possible criminal or fraudulent activity.”  \nId. at *44.   \n43. Given the importance of the attorney-client privilege to North Carolina’s \njurisprudence and the resulting scrutiny that should be applied to any exceptions,  \nMiller, 357 N.C. at 331, parties advancing the crime-fraud exception must prove the \nprima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence.  Window World of Baton Rouge, \n2019 NCBC LEXIS 54 at *45–46 (citing In re Napster Copyright Litig., 479 F.3d 1078, \n1095 (9th Cir. 2007) (“requiring a moving party to establish the existence of the crime-\nfraud exception by a preponderance of the evidence is consonant with the importance \nof the attorney-client privilege.”). \n44. Furthermore, the crime-fraud exception applies only when the client has \nengaged the services of a lawyer “in furtherance of future illegal conduct.”  Zolin, 491 \nU.S. at 556 (emphasis added); see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena , 220 F.R.D. 130, \n151–52 (D. Mass. 2004).  Past or completed crimes or frauds do not trigger the \nexception.  Zolin, 491 U.S. at 556. \n45. At the time the communications in this case occurred, Defendants had \nalready communicated their intention to be the only members of the LLC —at least \nfor the time -being—and to finance the LLC and the Foundation with Association \nfunds.  While they may or may not have fully understood the legal ramifications \n \n \nresulting from the transfer of Association funds at the time the transfer occurred, \nDefendants point out that the operating agreement that was thereafter created \nclearly reflected the distribution to the New Entities.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not \nalleged that the attorneys were consulted to facilitate criminal or fraudulent activity \nthat was ongoing or was to take place in the future.   \n46. Plaintiffs’ reliance on United States v. Gorski , 807 F.3d 451 (1st  Cir. \n2015), is unavailing.  In Gorski , the defendant engaged counsel to create corporate \ndocuments crafted to appear as though they were signed before the date of applicable \nregulatory amendments so that the defendant could perpetuate a false impression \nwith the U.S. Small Business Association.  After he was indicted and the government \nissued subpoenas for documents, the defendant withheld certain documents \ncontaining communications with his counsel on the basis of the attorney -client \nprivilege.  The prosecution argued that, even if the documents were covered by the \nprivilege, the crime -fraud exception applied because the defendant had used the \nattorneys’ work in furtherance of his illegal scheme.  The district court agreed that \nthe exception applied because there was a reasonable basis to believe that the \nattorney-client communications “were intended by the client to facilitate or conceal \nthe criminal or fraudulent activity.”  Id.  at 461.  The First Circuit affirmed.\n3  Id. at \n462. \n \n3 Although the First Circuit’s “reasonable basis” standard differs from the “preponderance \nof the evidence” standard adopted herein, this difference is not determinative of the \noutcome in the case before the Court. \n \n \n47. As stated above, in this case the attorney -client communications \noccurred after Defendants made plain their position that the LLC would be owned, \nat least initially, by them and funded by monies from the Association.  There is no \nevidence to suggest that the attorneys were engaged to help Plaintiffs conceal this \nposition or otherwise to create an ongoing subterfuge.  To the contrary, the operating \nagreement at issue documents Defendants’ position.  Whether or not the Association \nBoard or its members were aware of these aspects of the restructuring at earlier, key \ntimes, is a different issue. \n48. Therefore, the Court concludes that, at least as to the attorney -client \ncommunications at issue, Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden to show by a \npreponderance of the evidence that the crime -fraud exception applies to defeat th e \nassertion of attorney-client privilege over drafts of the operating agreement. \nE. Work Product Doctrine \n49. As a governing document  for the LLC , the operating agreement has a \ndistinct business purpose separate and apart from any concern about possible \nlitigation.  Stated differently, although the threat of litigation may have been in the \nair, the independent business reason for drafting the operating agreement to govern \nthe LLC strips the resulting drafts from work product protection.  Therefore,  any \ndrafts not protected by the attorney -client privilege would not be  shielded from \ndiscovery by the work product doctrine.  Here, however, the attorney-client privilege \ninsulates the drafts at issue from discovery. \n \n \nRelated E-mail Communications \n50. Defendants claim that e -mails accompanying and related to the draft \nOperating Agreements sent among members of the group of Russell, Jurgens, various \ncounsel at Wilson Ratledge, and Donald Harris are protected from discovery by the \nattorney-client privilege. \n51. A number of the e -mails are in the nature of “transmittal” \ncommunications.  When the e -mails do not furnish or request legal advice and are \nmerely transmittal documents, they are not attorney -client privileged \ncommunications.  Window World of Baton Roug e, LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 54, at \n*68–72 (gathering cases).  Accordingly, the Court finds that e -mails identified as \nExhibit N, Exhibit P, and Jurgens -Russell Exhibit C are subject to discovery and \nshould be produced. \n52. On the other hand, more substantive e -mails are protected by the \nprivilege.  There is no dispute that Wilson Ratledge counsel represented the LLC, \n(Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Compel 5 (arguing that Wilson Ratledge counsel represented \nboth the Association and the LLC)), the communications were intended to be \nconfidential and relate to a matter about which counsel was being professionally \nconsulted, and the communications were made in the course of giving or seeking legal \nadvice for a proper purpose.  For the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs’ arguments  \nregarding waiver or application of an exception to the privilege does not change the \nresult.  The attorney -client privilege protects these communications.  Therefore, e-\nmails identified as Exhibit A, Exhibit C, Exhibit E, Exhibit H, Exhibit K, Exhibit M, \n \n \nJurgens-Russell Exhibit A, and Jurgens-Russell Exhibit B are privileged and are not \nsubject to discovery. \nIII. CONCLUSION \n53. For the reasons state above, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel is GRANTED \nin part and DENIED in part.  The Court ORDERS Defendants to produce e -mails \nidentified as Exhibit N, Exhibit P , and Jurgens-Russell Exhibit C  within ten days \nfrom entry of this Order.  The remaining documents are protected by the attorney -\nclient privilege and shall not be produced. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this the 5th day of October, 2021. \n \n \n \n /s/ Julianna Theall Earp \n Julianna Theall Earp \n Special Superior Court Judge \n  for Complex Business Cases \n \n \n "
