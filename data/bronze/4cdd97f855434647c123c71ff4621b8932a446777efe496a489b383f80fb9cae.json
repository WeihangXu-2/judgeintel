THIS MATTER is before the Court following  the 4 August 2023 filing of \ntwo motions to dismiss : (1) Goodwin Procter, LLP’s (“Goodwin”) motion to dismiss  \nDefendants and Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Counterclaims 2 \n(“Goodwin’s Motion to Dismiss”) pursuant to Rules 12(b)(5) and 12(b)(6) of the North \n \n1 The Court enters this Amended Order and Opinion to clarify thr ee things: (1)  that the \ndismissal of Goodwin Procter, LLP and Leila Strickland pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5) was \nwithout prejudice, (infra at 15); (2) that the Court did not consider Affidavits of Service filed \nafter full briefing and a hearing on the motions addressed herein , (infra at 7–8); and (3) to \ncorrect the date of the hearing , set forth in Section I herein , from 7 November 2022 to \n7 November 2023, (infra at 6).  \n \n2 The counterclaims are contained in a filing titled “Defendants’ First Amended Joint Partial \nAnswer to Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint and Second Amended Counterclaims,” (the \n“Counterclaims”).

This Amended Order and O pinion addresses Goodwin and Strickland’s  \narguments, made in the Motions pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5) , that Counterclaim \nPlaintiffs Shayne Guiliano and 108Labs, LLC (“Counterclaim Plaintiffs”) failed to \nproperly effect service of the Counterclaims pursuant to Rule 4, thereby warranting \ntheir dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5). \n3. For the reasons discussed below, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES \nin part Goodwin ’s Motion to Dismiss,  GRANTS in part  and DENIES in part \nBIOMILQ and Strickland’s Motion to Dismiss as to Strickland’s defense of improper \nservice, and DEFERS ruling on BIOMILQ and Strickland’s Motion to Dismiss to the \nextent it seeks dismissal of the Counterclaims against BIOMILQ pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6). \n \n3 Identical copies of BIOMILQ and Strickland ’s Motion to Dismiss were filed at ECF \nNos. 185–86.  \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. by J.

Bowens and \nSaleisha Averhart, for Defendant 108Labs, LLC. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \nI. BACKGROUND \n4. This dispute began as one focused on the alleged misappropriation  by \nMr. Guiliano of trade secret information allegedly owned by BIOMILQ regarding a \nprocess to develop cell-cultured human milk .  It has since expanded to encompass  \nMr. Guiliano’s alleged ownership rights in 108Labs, LLC, a North Carolina  limited \nliability company, that Mr. Guiliano contends developed antecedent technology.  The \nfactual background and procedural history of this matter is set forth in greater detail \nin the Court’s 10 February 2023 Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Joint Motion to \nDismiss or in the Al ternative Hold Proceedings in Abeyance.   See BIOMILQ, Inc. v. \nGuiliano, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 10, 2023).  The Court sets forth \nherein only those portions of the factual and procedural background relevant and \nnecessary to its determination of the Motions. \n \n4 Following the filing of the Motions and briefing, Shayne Guiliano (“Mr. Guiliano”) elected \nto proceed pro se.  (See ECF No. 223.)  On 29 November 2023, the Court permitted attorneys \nTara D. Warwick and Jonathan A. Carnes of Carnes Warwick, PLLC to withdraw as counsel \nof record for Mr. Guiliano.  (ECF No. 232.) \n5. BIOMILQ initiated this action on 4 March 2022 by filing its Complaint, \n(ECF No. 3), and its  Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and P reliminary \nInjunction, (ECF No. 4) , against Mr. Guiliano.  This matter was designated to the \nNorth Carolina Business Court on the same day, (ECF No. 7), and assigned to the \nundersigned on 7 March 2022, (ECF Nos. 1–2).   \n6. BIOMILQ filed its First Amended Complaint as of right on 13 April 2022 , \nadding 108L abs, LLC ( “108Labs”) as a Defendant .  (ECF No. 42.)  Thereafter, on \n15 June 2022, Counterclaim Plaintiffs  filed their Joint Motion to Dismiss or in the \nAlternative Hold Proceedings in Abeyance.  (See ECF No. 73.)  On 10 February 2023, \nthe Court granted Counterclaim Plaintiffs’  motion in part, dismissing without \nprejudice some of BIOMILQ ’s claims .  BIOMILQ, In c., 2023 NCBC LEXIS 24, at \n**30–32.  Following permission of the Court, (see ECF Nos. 135–36), BIOMILQ filed \nthe Second Amended Complaint (the “SAC”) on 21 April 2023,  (Second Am. Compl., \nECF No. 137 [“SAC”]). \n7. On 6 February 2023,  Counterclaim Plaintiffs, filed a document entitled \nAnswer and Counterclaims .  (ECF No. 120 .)  In this filing, Counterclaim Plaintiffs \nfailed to a nswer the allegations in the First Amended Complaint , but rather solely \nattempted to bring  counterclaims against BIOMILQ and to raise additional claims \nagainst Strickland, Michelle Egger, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, LLC, and \nGoodwin.  (See ECF No. 120.)  Counterclaim Plaintiffs did not obtain a summons for \neither Strickland or Goodwin prior to or at the time of filing that document. \n8. Counterclaim Plaintiffs  filed Defendants’ Amended Answer and \nCounterclaims (“First Amended Counterclaims” ) on 2 March 2023, (ECF No. 127 ), \nagain without causing  summonses to be issued by the Clerk of Superior Court for \nservice upon either Goodwin or Strickland.  After the Court inquired regarding the \nstatus of the issuance of summonses at the Case Management Conference in April \n2023, (see ECF No. 134), Counterclaim Plaintiffs secured the issuance of summonses \nfor service upon Goodwin and Strickland on 20 April 2023,5 (ECF Nos. 183.2, 187.2).  \n9. On 1 May 2023 , Counterclaim Plaintiffs attempted to serve Strickland by \nsending the summons to her, along with the Answer and Counterclaims and the First \nAmended Counterclaims, by use of Federal Express Corporation’s  (“FedEx”) “FedEx \nExpress Saver” service.  According to the tracking history  filed with the Court  by \nCounterclaim Plaintiffs, the materials were purportedly delivered to Strickland on \n2 May 2023.   (See Aff. Service , ECF No. 148 [“Aff. Serv.”]; Ex. A, ECF No. 148.1 \n[“Strickland Receipt”].)  Notably, the receipt for Strickland’s package did not have or \nrequire a signature.  (Strickland Receipt 1 (“Signed for by: S. IGNATURE [sic] NOT \nREQ”).) \n10. On 2 May 20 23, Counterclaim Plaintiffs attempted to serve Goodwin by \nsending the summons directed to it, along with the Answer and Counterclaims and \nFirst Amended Counterclaims, to Goodwin’s address in Boston, Massachusetts, using \nthe same FedEx Express Saver service.  (Aff. Serv.; Ex. F, ECF No. 148.6 [“Goodwin \n \n5 The Court may take judicial notice of the summons es issued against Goodwin  and \nStrickland, including the date on which they were issued.  Kroger Ltd. P’ship I v. Guastello, \n177 N.C. App. 386, 395 (2006). \nReceipt”].)  The package  was addressed to “Goodwin  Procter LLP ,” but no t to a  \nspecifically identified person.  (Goodwin Receipt 1.)  According to the tracking history \nfiled with the Court by Countercla im Plaintiffs , the package was delivered to \nGoodwin’s mailroom on 4 May 2023 .  ( Goodwin Receipt 1 .)  The delivery receipt  \nappears to have been signed by “T. Pisarevskaya”.  (Goodwin Receipt 1.) \n11. Counterclaim Plaintiffs filed their Affidavit of Service  with the Court on \n31 May 2023, setting forth the process by which service on Strickland and Goodwin \nwas purportedly effected.  (See Aff. Serv.) \n12. Counterclaim Plaintiffs  thereafter filed the  operative Counterclaims on \n5 June 2023.  (Second Am . Countercls.)  No new summons es were issued in \nconnection with the Counterclaims. \n13. On 12 July 2023, in response to a timely motion consented to by all parties, \nthe Court entere d its S cheduling Order extending the time for Counterclaim \nDefendants, including S trickland and Goodwin,  to file their responses to the \nCounterclaims and for Counterclaim Plaintiffs to file any response briefs .  (ECF \nNo. 175.)  Accordingly, Goodwin, BIOMILQ, and Strickland file d the Motions now \nbefore the Court with  supporting briefs on 4 August 2023.  (See Goodwin Mot.; \nBIOMILQ & Strickland Mot.)  \n14. Having considered the Motions , briefing, and arguments by counsel at a \nhearing on 7 November 2023, at which all parties were present and represented \nthrough counsel, the Motions are now ripe for resolution.  (See ECF No. 210.)  \n15. Following the filing of the Motions, completion of briefing on the Motions, \nand conclusion of the hearing on 7 November 2023, Mr. Guiliano filed the Affidavit of \nService on 8  December 2023, without comment , request for consideration or other \nrelief, which purports to show that he effected service of the Counterclaims  and an \nalias and pluries summons upon Goodwin “in accordance wit h Rule 4(j)(8)(c), ” (the \n“Goodwin Affidavit of Service”).  (ECF No. 235.)  \n16. On 28 December 2023, after the Court entered its Order and Opinion on the \nMotions, Mr. Guiliano filed the Guiliano Affidavit of Service to Strickland, indicating \nthat, roughly seven  days before the Court entered the Order and Opinion, \nMr. Guiliano purportedly served Strickland with the Counterclaims and an alias and \npluries summons issued on 27 November 2023 (the “Strickland Affidavit of Service”).  \n(ECF No. 244.) \n17. Mr. Guiliano did not promptly bring these matters to the undersigned’s \nattention or request that the Court consid er these subsequent procedural \ndevelopments in conjunction with the Court’s determination of the Motions. \n18. Rule 6(d) provides, in relevant part, that  \nopposing affidavits shall be served at least two days before the hearing \n[on a motion].  If the opposing affidavit is not served on the other parties \nat least two days before the hearing on the motion, the court may \ncontinue the matter for a reasonable period to allow the responding \nparty to prepare a response, proceed with the matter without considering \nthe untimely served affidavit , or take such other action as the ends of \njustice require. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 6 (emphasis added); see Lane v. Winn-Dixie Charlotte, Inc., 169 \nN.C. App. 180, 184–85 (2005). \n19. To be clear, the Court did not consider the Goodwin Affidavit of Service or \nthe Strickland Affidavit of Service in its consideration of the Motions, and no  party \nto this action requested that the Court consider these documents.  The Court does not \nherein determine whether such service on either Goodwin or Strickland was proper \nunder Rule 4, and the Court does not herein determine whether the filing of the \nGoodwin Affidavit of Service or the Strickland Affidavit of Service is satisfactory proof \nof service on either Counterclaim Defendant.  Rather, the Court, in its discretion, has \nnot considered the later-filed affidavits in its ruling on the Motions. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n20. “It is well established that a court may obtain personal jurisdiction over a \ndefendant only by  the issuance of summons and service of process by one of the \nstatutorily specified methods .”  Glover v. Farmer, 127 N.C. App. 488, 490 (1997)  \n(citation omitted) .  Pursuant to Rule  12(b)(5), an action must be dismissed whe n \nservice of process is not valid.  Draughon v. Harnett Cty. Bd. of Educ., 166 N.C. App. \n449, 451 (2004); see Glover, 127 N.C. App. at 490. \n21. “Rule 4 . . . provides the methods of service of summons and complaint \nnecessary to obtain personal jurisdiction over a defendant[.]”  Grimsley v. Nelson, 342 \nN.C. 542, 545 (1996) (citation omitted) .  Thus, Rule  4 provides several specific \nmethods by which service may be properly achieved with respect to different types of \npersons and entities  or the State and its various municipalities .  N.C.G.S. §  1A-1, \nRule 4(j). \n22. Goodwin is a partnership.  Service upon a partnership using FedEx, a \ndelivery service, requires that the serving party deposit, “with a designated delivery \nservice authorized pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §  7502(f)(2) a copy of the summons and \ncomplaint, addressed to any general partner or to any attorney -in-fact or agent \nauthorized by appointment or by law to be served or to accept service of process in its \nbehalf[.]”  Id. Rule 4(j)(7)a.  \n23. Service on an individual , such as Strickland, is governed by a  similar \nprovision requiring the serving party to deposit , “with a designated delivery service \nauthorized pursuant to 26 U.S.C § 7502(f)(2) a copy of the summons and complaint, \naddressed to the party to be served, delivering to the address ee, and obtaining a \ndelivery receipt.”  Id. Rule 4(j)(1)d. \n24. Service in a manner authorized by Rule 4(j) is mandatory.  Guthrie v. Ray, \n293 N.C. 67, 69 (1977) (citation omitted) (“Where a statute provides for service of \nsummons . . . by designated methods, the specified requirements must be complied \nwith or there is no valid service.”).  Thus, a serving party must strictly comply with \nRule 4 in serving the summons and complaint.  Id.; Grimsley, 342 N.C. at 545.  Actual \nnotice is not a valid substitute for service that does not comply with Rule 4.  Stack v. \nUnion Regional Mem’l Med. Ctr., Inc., 171 N.C. App. 322, 328 (2005) (citing Guthrie, \n293 N.C. at 69) ; Roshelli v. Sperry, 57 N.C. App. 305, 307 (1982) (citations \nomitted) (“It is generally held that process must be issued and served in the manner \nprescribed by statute, and failure to do so makes the service invalid even though a \ndefendant had actual notice of the lawsuit.”). \nIII. ANALYSIS \n25. The record irrefutably discloses that, in attempting to serve the summonses \nand documents containing their counterclaims against Strickland and Goodwin, \nCounterclaim Plaintiffs used the FedEx Express Saver service.  ( Aff. Serv. 1.)   \nGoodwin and Strickland argue in support of the Motions pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5), \nthat FedEx Express Saver is a delivery service that does not comply with Rule 4 \nbecause it does not meet the definition of a “designated delivery service” as the term \nis used in Rule 4(j)(7)a. for Goodwin, or Rule 4(j)(1)d. for Strickland.  (See Br. Supp. \nGoodwin Mot. 9–10, ECF No. 183 [“Br. Supp. Goodwin Mot.”]; Br. Supp. BIOMILQ & \nStrickland Mot. 9–11, ECF No. 187 [“Br. Supp. BIOMILQ & Strickland Mot.”].)  The \nCourt agrees. \n26. By reference to and incorporation of 26 U.S.C. § 7502(f)(2), Rule 4 requires \nthat a party effecting service under subsections 4(j)(1)d. or 4(j)(7)a. use a designated \ndelivery service approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.  See 26 U.S.C. § 7502(f)(2) \n(providing that “the term ‘designated delivery service’ means any delivery service \nprovided by a trade or business if such service is designated by the  Secretary [of the \nTreasury] . . . .”).  The list of such services is found in IRS Notice 2016-30.  I .R.B. \nNo. 2016-18, at 265 (Rev. May 2 , 2016).  This list does not include FedEx Express \nSaver.  Id. \n27. As a threshold matter, in opposition to the Motions, Counterclaim Plaintiffs \nargue that Notice 2016-30 “is not properly before the [C]ourt.”  (Countercl. Pls.’ Br. \nOpp. Goodwin Mot. 10, ECF No. 205 [“Br. Opp. Goodwin Mot.”] ).  However, North \nCarolina courts and federal courts routinely take judicial notice of public filings by \nfederal agencies.  See, e.g., N. Carolina State Bar v. Talman , 62 N.C. App. 355, 364 \n(1983) (“[W]e take judicial notice of the regulations of the Internal Revenue \nService[.]”); Shore v. Charlotte -Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. , 412 F. Supp. 3d 568, 573 \n(M.D.N.C. 2019) (similar).  Here, the Court may properly , and does, take judicial \nnotice of IRS Notice 2016-30 and determines that FedEx Express Saver is not an \nenumerated designated delivery service in that Notice.  \n28. Counterclaim Plaintiffs  also argue that the services enumerated in IRS \nNotice 2016 -30 are illustrative of those permitted by 26 U.S.C. §  7502(f)(2), not \nexhaustive.  (Br. Opp. Goodwin Mot. 10.)  However, Counterclaim Plaintiffs provide \nno legal support to warrant expansion of the delivery services that may be utilized \nbeyond those expressly listed in IRS Notice 2016-30.  See Evans v. Diaz, 333 N.C. 774, \n779–80 (1993) (“Under t he doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, when a \nstatute lists the situations to which it applies, it implies the exclusion of situations \nnot contained in the list.”). \n29. Counterclaim Plaintiffs also argue that FedEx Express Saver “meets the \nminimum requirements under which the Secretary is authorized to designate” \ndelivery services, and therefore, this Court should deem the service of process upon \nStrickland and Goodwin as proper and legally effective .  (Countercl. Pls.’ Br. Opp. \nBIOMILQ & St rickland Mot. 6, ECF No. 194 [“Br. Opp. BIOMILQ & Strickland \nMot.”].)  In this regard, Counterclaim Plaintiffs focus the Court’s attention on the \nportion of Section 7502 that states:  \nThe Secretary may designate a delivery service . . . only if the Secretary \ndetermines that such service— \n \n(A) is available to the general public, \n(B) is at least as timely and reliable on a regular basis as the United \nStates mail, \n(C) records electronically to its data base, kept in the regular course of \nits business, or marks on the cover in which any item referred to in this \nsection is to be delivered, the date on which such item was given to such \ntrade or business for delivery, and \n(D) meets such other criteria as the Secretary may prescribe. \n \n26 U.S.C. § 7502(f)(2). \n30. Section 7502(f)(2) is clear that , in addition to the prerequisites set forth \nabove, a “designated delivery service” includes only those services that are actually \n“designated by the Secretary.”   26 U.S.C. §  7502(f)(2) (“For purposes of this \nsubsection, the term ‘designated delivery service’ means any delivery service provided \nby a trade or business if such service is designated by the Secretary for purposes of \nthis section.” (emphasis added)). \n31. In a rguing that the prerequi sites alone are sufficient, Counterclaim \nPlaintiffs attempt to eliminate one of the five mandatory conditions in the definition \nof “designated delivery service .”  ( See Br. Opp. BIOMILQ & Strickland Mot. 5 .)  \nWhere, as here, “the language of the statute is clear and is not ambiguous, we must \nconclude that the legislature intended the statute to be implemented according to the \nplain meaning of its terms.”  Lunsford v. Mills, 367 N.C. 618, 623 (2014) (citations \nomitted).  In addition, Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ interpretation directly conflicts with \nthe language of IRS Notice 2016-30, which states that “[o]nly the specific delivery \nservices enumerated in this list are designated delivery services for purposes of  \n§ 7502(f).  DHL Express, FedEx, and UPS are not designated with respect to any type \nof delivery service not enumerated in this list.”  I.R.B. No. 2016-18, at 265 (Rev. May \n2, 2016) ; see also  Herzog v. Comm ’r, 643 F. App’x 942, 943 –44 (11th Cir. 2016) \n(recognizing that FedEx Express Saver is not a designated delivery service under \n26 U.S.C. § 7502(f)(2)). \n32. Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ position relies not on the plain language of the law, \nbut rather on the factual assertion  that Goodwin and Strickland received actual \nnotice of the service of the summonses and pleadings upon them .6  However, actual \nnotice does not cure defective service.  Fulton v. Mickle, 134 N.C. App. 620, 624 (1999) \n(“Although defective service of process may sufficiently give the defending party \nactual notice of the proceedings, such actual notice does not give the court jurisdiction \nover the party.” (cleaned up)); Jones v. Trinity Highway Prods., LLC, 2021 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 741 , at **17  (2021) (unpublished) (quoting Fulton, 134 N.C. App. at 624);  \nBizrobe Trust by Doublebent, LLC v. InoLife Techs., Inc. , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 3, at \n*15–16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 9, 2019) (dismissing complaint when plaintiff failed to \ncomply with Rule 4 despite defendant actually receiving process). \n33. Counterclaim Plaintiffs further argue that the policy set forth in N.C.G.S. \n§ 1-75.1 should prevail over mechan ical application of the law.  (Br. Opp. Goodwin \nMot. 6;  Br. Opp. BIOMILQ & Strickland Mot. 4 –5.)  Section 1- 75.1 expresses the \nlegislative intent behind the statutes regarding jurisdiction, stating: “ [t]his Article \n \n6 It is not clear when  Goodwin had actual notice of the claims against it .  Though Goodwin \nadmits that it received the service package in its mailroom on 4 May 2023, it is unclear from \nthe papers when a person authorized by law to accept service became aware of the filings in \nthis matter. \nshall be liberally construed to the end that actions be speedily and finally determined \non their merits.”  N.C.G.S. § 1-75.1.  While Counterclaim Plaintiffs are indeed correct \nthat N.C.G.S. § 1-75.1 greatly liberalizes the grounds  for jurisdiction , they \nnonetheless incorrectly assert that the legislature’s intent was also to liberalize how \nservice might comport with Rule  4’s specific requirements .  In  fact, in Edwards v. \nEdwards, our Court of Appeals explained that Rule  4 and  N.C.G.S. § 1-75.1 are \ncomplementary to one another , with R ule 4’s requirements regarding service of \nprocess tightened to ensure that the defendant receives actual notice of the \ncontroversy.  13 N.C. App. 166, 169 (1971). \n34. Finally, Counterclaim Plaintiffs contend that a “rebuttable presumption” \nthat service was proper applies to their attempted service of process on Strickland \nand Goodwin.  However,  Counterclaim Plaintiffs admit that such a presumption \narises only “[o]nce proof of service is established[.]”  (Br. Opp. Goodwin Mot. 6 (citing \nGranville Med. Ctr. , 160 N.C. App. at 489) .)  Because Counterclaim Plaintiffs’ \nAffidavit of Service demonstrates that the method of service of process utilized by \nthem is defective, they cannot take advantage of any presumption of valid service.  \n(See Aff. Serv.)  Notably, the case Counterclaim Plaintiffs rely on for support concerns \nthe presumption found in Rule 4(j2)(2), which applies before a default judgment may \nbe ordered.  Granville Med. Ctr., 160 N.C. App. at 490–91.  This language is not found \nelsewhere in Rule 4. \n35. For the reasons discussed herein , Counterclaim Plaintiff s’ attempted \nservice on Strickland and Goodwin using FedEx Express Saver failed to comply with \nthe requirements of Rule 4.  As such, service was insufficient and warrants dismissal \nof the action against both Goodwin and Strickland. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n36. THEREFORE, the Court hereby GRANTS in part Goodwin’s Motion to \nDismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5), and GRANTS in part BIOMILQ and Strickland’s \nMotion to Dismiss to the extent that motion requests dismissal of claims against \nStrickland pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5). \n37. Having concluded that service on Goodwin and Strickland was insufficient \nunder the requirements of Rule 4, and that the actions against them should be \nDISMISSED without prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(5), the Court determines that \nit does not have jurisdiction to rule on Goodwin’s Motion to Dismiss and Strickland’s \nMotion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  Accordingly, \nthe Court DENIES as moot the remainder of Goodwin’s Motion to Dismiss and \nDENIES as moot BIOMILQ and Strickland’s Motion to Dismiss as it relates to \nStrickland. \n38. The Court otherwise DEFERS ruling on BIOMILQ and Strickland’s \nMotion to Dismiss to the extent BIOMILQ seeks dismissal of the Counterclaims \nagainst it pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  The Court will address the remainder of that \nmotion by separate order.  \n  \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 9th day of January, 2024. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L.
