  "raw_text": "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n22CVS009465-590 \n \nAIRTRON, INC., \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nBRADLEY ALLEN HEINRICH, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \n \nFINAL JUDGMENT \n \n1. In March 2024, the Court sanctioned Defendant Bradley Allen Heinrich by \nstriking his answer and entering a default judgment against him as to liability on \nPlaintiff Airtron, Inc.’s claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair or \ndeceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.  See Airtron, Inc. v. Heinrich, 2024 \nNCBC LEXIS 45 , at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 12, 2024)  (located at ECF No. 80).  \nFollowing that decision, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on 6 August 2024  to \ndetermine Airtron’s damages.  Heinrich represented himself at the hearing;  Airtron \nwas represented by counsel.  Having considered all the evidence, the Court now \nenters judgment as follows. \n2. Background.  Heinrich’s liability is established, and in connection with the \nentry of a default judgment, he is deemed to have admitted the allegations of Airtron’s \namended complaint.  See Hunter v. Spaulding , 97 N.C. App. 372, 377 (1990) (“A \ndefault judgment admits .  . . the allegations contained within the complaint  . . . .”).  \nThis short background, describing the nature of the case, will help set the table for a \ndiscussion of Airtron’s remedies. \nAirtron, Inc. v. Heinrich, 2024 NCBC 55. \n3. Airtron provides heating and air conditioning services.  Many of its \ncustomers are home construction companies in the Charlotte, North Carolina region.  \nIn serving its customers, Airtron’s employees often need to calculate the heating and \ncooling loads and corresponding volumetric flow rates for the rooms of a residence.  \nTo do so , they use a proprietary software template (the “Charlotte Template”)  that \nshortens the process by about an hour.  Then, using the load calculations, they select \nappropriate equipm ent and prepare design layouts to guide the installation.   The \nCharlotte Template, load calculations, and design layouts are Airtron’s trade secrets.  \n(See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35, 40, 46, 51, 53, 57–59, ECF No. 18.)   \n4. Heinrich was once the head of  American Builder Services, Inc. ’s HVAC \ndivision.  In that capacity, h e hired Logan Bentley, one of Airtron’s employees, to \nprovide load calculations for American Builder Services  starting in January 2022 .  \nBentley continued to work for Airtron while also  working for American Builder \nServices.  Airtron was unaware of this.   To prepare load calculations for American \nBuilder Services, Bentley used Airtron’s laptop, software, and Charlotte Template.  \nAirtron was unaware of this as well.  Bentley then sent the load calculations to \nHeinrich, who used them to perform work for American Builder Services’ customers, \nsome of which were also customers of Airtron.   Bentley quit his employment with \nAirtron in May 2022, and American Builder Services fired both Heinrich and Bentley \nin July 2022.  (See, e.g., Poccia Aff. ¶¶ 9, 26, 27, 33–36, 45, 47, 100, 103, 107, ECF No. \n87.1; Bentley Dep. 68:4 –69:1, 88:6 –8, 103:13 –104:1, 125:1 –127:7, ECF No. 87.1; \nHeinrich Dep. 63:4–15, 84:20–85:12, ECF No. 87.1.)  \n5. Airtron’s trade-secret and section 75-1.1 claims are both based on Heinrich’s \nmisappropriation of its trade secrets.  Airtron seeks to recover actual damages caused \nby Heinrich’s misconduct and to treble those damages under N.C.G.S. § 75-16.  It also \nseeks punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and injunctive relief. \n6. Actual Damages.   The owner of a trade secret  may recover “actual \ndamages” as “measured by the economic loss or the unjust enrichment caused by \nmisappropriation of a trade secret, whichever is greater.”  N.C.G.S. §  66-154(b).  \nAirtron argues that it suffered damages in the form of lost profits. \n7. As always, “[t]he burden of proving damages is on the party seeking them.”  \nOlivetti Corp. v. Ames Bus. Sys., Inc. , 319 N.C. 534, 547 (1987).   “Although absolute \ncertainty is not required, damages for lost profits will not be awarded based on \nhypothetical or speculative forecasts.”  Supplee v. Miller -Motte Bus. Coll., Inc. , 239 \nN.C. App. 208, 223 (2015) (citation and quotation marks omitted).   Airtron had to \nprove “with reasonable certainty” that it would have made profits but for Heinrich’s \nmisappropriation and what the am ount of those profits would have been.  Olivetti, \n319 N.C. at 547; see also Kitchen Lumber Co. v. Tallassee Power Co. , 206 N.C. 515, \n522 (1934) (“Where the profits lost by defendant’s tortious conduct, proximately and \nnaturally flow from his act and are reasonably definite and certain, they are \nrecoverable; those which are speculative and contingent, are not.”); Iron Steamer, Ltd. \nv. Trinity Rest., Inc., 110 N.C. App. 843, 847 (1993) (holding that plaintiff must “prove \nthat except for the [wrong], profits would have been realized”). \n8. Airtron has not carried this burden.  At best, Airtron’s evidence shows that \nsome of its customers (large homebuilders called Century, Meritage, and JP Orleans) \nretained American Builder Services for projects in certain residential communities  \nand that Heinrich used its trade secrets to carry out that work.  At no point, though, \nhas Airtron argued or offered evidence to show that Century, Meritage, or JP Orleans \nwould have retained it to handle  these projects  but for Heinrich’s bad acts.  \nConspicuously missing, for example, is any evidence that Airtron attempted to bid for \nthe projects or that American Builder Services underbid it for any project .  Nor has \nAirtron shown that it was the default or exclusive provider for any of the \nhomebuilders; rather, it concedes that all three regularly used the services of several \ncompanies.  (See also Bentley Dep. 189:18–24.) \n9. What’s more, there is substantial evidence that Century, Meritage, and JP \nOrleans would not have retained Airtron because Airtron had already turned down \nmany or all of the projects that American Builder Services eventually won.  Bentley \ntestified as much.  So did Heinrich.  And their testimony went unrebutted.  Airtron’s \ncorporate representative, Stephen Gruneisen, acknowledged that Airtron sometimes \nturns away work when its workload is too heavy and that 2022 was an exceptionally \nbusy year for HVAC companies.  But he was not familiar with the communities or \nprojects at issue and could not say whether Airtron had or had not turned down any \nproject that went to American Builder Services. \n10. Airtron is not entitled to lost profits simply because it and American Builder \nServices did work for the same customers.  It had the burden to show that Heinrich’s \nmisappropriation caused it to lose profits.  No evidence supports that conclusion.  And \nquite a bit of evidence tends to show  that Airtron either did not pursue or \naffirmatively turned away the very projects that it now says are the source of its lost \nprofits.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Airtron has not shown by a \npreponderance of the evidence that it would have realized profits but for Heinrich’s \nmisappropriation of its trade secrets.  See, e.g. , Olivetti, 319 N.C. at 546 –49 \n(overturning award o f lost profits because c laimant did not carry “its burden of \nshowing that it was damaged ”); Glover Constr. Co. v. Sequoia Servs., LLC , 2022 \nNCBC LEXIS 21, at *22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 15, 2022)  (concluding that plaintiff \ncould not “recover lost profits relating” to  a certain project because it “withdrew its \nbid before the contract was awarded”). \n11. Having “prevail[ed] on its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets,” \nAirtron is “entitled to an award of nominal damages even absent evidence of actual \ndamages.”  Am. Air Filter Co. v. Price, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *33 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJuly 10, 2018).  The Court therefore awards Airtron one dollar. \n12. Punitive Damages & Treble Damages.  In addition to actual damages, \nAirtron seeks punitive damages under section 66 -154(c) and treble damages under \nsection 75-16.  “A plaintiff is not precluded from seeking both punitive and treble \ndamages” but must make “an election between the two ” for any “actual recovery.”   \nHolloway v. Wachovia Bank & Tr. Co., N.A., 339 N.C. 338, 349 (1994). \n13. To be eligible to receive  punitive damages, Airtron had to prove “by clear \nand convincing evidence ” that “willful and malicious misappropriation exists .”  \nN.C.G.S. §§ 1D-15(b), 66 -154(c).  It has not done so .  No evidence suggests that \nHeinrich asked Bentley to obtain Airtron’s trade secrets or directed him to use \nAirtron’s equipment and the Charlotte Template to prepare load calculations.   \nBentley made that choice on his own.   Moreover, Heinrich credibly testified that he \ntold Bentley to stop using Airtron’s information once he learned about it.  Bentley did \nnot deny this.  (See Bentley Dep. 125:1–18, 126:2–8; Heinrich Dep. 84:15 –85:7.)  To \nbe sure, Heinrich continued to use the load calculations that Bentley sent, and he \ncould have and should have done more to put an end to the misappropriation .  But \nAirtron has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that his conduct amounts to \nwillful and malicious misappropriation. \n14. Regardless, the Court would exercise its discretion to deny punitive \ndamages even if Airtron were eligible to receive them .  See N.C.G.S. §  66-154(c) \n(allowing “the trier of fact” to “award punitive damages in its discretion”); see also, \ne.g., Watson v. Dixon, 132 N.C. App. 329, 333 (1999) (stating that whether  to award \npunitive damages “rests within the sound discretion” of the factfinder).  This is so for \nseveral related reasons.  First, one of the purposes of punitive damages is “to punish \na defendant for egregiously wrongful acts.”  N.C.G.S. § 1D-1.  This is not that sort of \ncase.  Heinrich’s conduct was inappropriate but not egregiously wrongful.  Second, \nAirtron has not carried its burden to show that it suffered actual economic loss.  See \nid. § 1D-35 (allowing trier of fact to consider “actual damages suffered by the \nclaimant”).  Third, no evidence suggests that Heinrich profited in any meaningful \nway from his misconduct.  American Builder Services fired him soon after this lawsuit \nbegan.  And Heinrich testified without rebuttal that he is currently unemployed, has \nvirtually no savings, and has no assets of real value.  See id. (allowing trier of fact to \nconsider “[w]hether the defendant profited from the conduct” and “[t]he defendant’s \nability to pay punitive damages”). \n15. It is true, as Airtron points out, that  Heinrich failed to comply with court \norders and his discovery obligations in this case.  But Airtron has already received its \nremedies for those matters: the Court sanctioned  Heinrich, and severely at that.  \nPunitive damages exist to punish egregiously wrongful conduct outside of court, not \nlitigation misconduct that can be, and has been, remedied through other means. \n16. Because Airtron is not entitled to punitive damages,  it need not make an \nelection between punitive damages and treble damages.   And because Airtron \nprevailed on its section 75-1.1 claim, “ judgment shall be rendered ” in its favor “for \ntreble the amount” of its damages.  N.C.G.S. § 75-16.  The Court therefore trebles its \naward of nominal damages and awards Airtron three dollars. \n17. Attorney’s Fees.  Airtron seeks to recover nearly $300,000 that it paid to \nits attorneys to pursue its claims against Heinrich .  Only when a defendant’s \nmisappropriation of trade secrets was “willful and malicious”  may a court “award \nreasonable attorneys’ fees.”  N.C.G.S. §  66-154(d).  Similarly, only when  the \ndefendant “willfully engaged in” an unfair or deceptive act or practice and then made \n“an unwarranted refusal ” to “resolve the matter” may a court “ allow a reasonable \nattorney fee.”  Id. § 75-16.1.  Having concluded that Heinrich’s conduct was not \nwillful, the Court denies the request for attorney’s fees under sections 66 -154(d) and \n75-16.1. \n18. In addition, the Court concludes that there was no unwarranted refusal by \nHeinrich to resolve this matter.  Over a year ago, Airtron offered to settle its claims \nfor $50,000.   Heinrich accepted that offer but failed  to m ake the first lump-sum \npayment and to sign a required confession of judgment.  The settlement agreement \nthen became null and void by its own terms.  Airtron views this as an unwarranted \nrefusal to settle.  At the hearing, though, Heinrich testified that he needed to obtain \na loan to pay the settlement amount but was un successful in that effort .  Heinrich \nalso testified, without rebuttal, that Airtron refused his request to let him pay the \nsettlement amount in smaller installments over time.  It is hard to see how Heinrich’s \nrefusal to pay money that he didn’t have was unwarranted —especially given that \nAirtron’s settlement demand exceeds the judgment that it has obtained.  For this \nreason as well, the Court denies the request for attorney’s fees under section 75-16.1. \n19. Injunctive Relief.  Finally, Airtron requests injunctive relief.  By statute, \n“actual or threatened misappropriation of a trade secret . . . shall be permanently \nenjoined upon judgment finding misappropriation for the period that the trade secret \nexists plus an additional period as the court may deem necessary under the \ncircumstances to eliminate any inequitable or unjust advantage arising fro m the \nmisappropriation.”  N.C.G.S. §  66-154(a).  Having entered a default judgment as to \nAirtron’s claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, the Court will grant injunctive \nrelief enjoining Heinrich from using those  trade secrets so long as they exist.  The \nCourt sees no reason to extend the injunction for an additional period or to enjoin the \nuse of any undefined confidential or proprietary information not amounting to a trade \nsecret. \n20. Conclusion.  For all these reasons, the Court ENTERS JUDGMENT for \nAirtron on its claims against Heinrich in the amount of $1.00, which shall be trebled \nfor an award in the total amount of $3.00.  Of this total amount, interest on the \nnominal damages award of $1.00 shall accrue at the legal rate from the date this \naction was commenced until the judgment is satisfied, as calculated by the Clerk of \nSuperior Court.  Interest on the remaining $2.00 shall accrue at the legal rate from \nthe date of entry of judgmen t until the judgment is satisfied, as calculated by the \nClerk of Superior Court. \n21. In addition, the Court DENIES Airtron’s requests for punitive damages and \nattorney’s fees. \n22. Finally, the Court  GRANTS Airtron’s request for injunctive relief ; \nENJOINS Heinrich from using or misappropriating Airtron’s trade secrets , as \nidentified in its amended complaint, (ECF No. 18),  for as long as they exist and \nremain trade secrets; and ORDERS Heinrich to delete or destroy any copies of the \ntrade secrets that remain in his possession, custody, or control. \n23. No claims or issues remain.  Accordingly, this is a fin al order disposing of \nall issues in this action. \n \n  \nSO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of August, 2024. \n \n \n       /s/ Adam M.
