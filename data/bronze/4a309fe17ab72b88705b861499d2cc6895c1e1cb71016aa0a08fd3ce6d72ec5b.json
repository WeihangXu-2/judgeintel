PHILLIPS, \n \n   Defendants. \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \n[Public]1 \n \n1. THIS MATTER  is before the Court on Defendants Metropolitan Life \nInsurance Company (“M LIC”) and MSI Financial Services, Inc. ’s (“MSI Financial”) \n(together, “ MetLife”) Motion for Summary Judgement (the “Motion”)  filed 22 \nDecember 2021.  (ECF No. 149 [the “Mot.”] .)2  Pursuant to Rule 56 of the North \n \n1 Recognizing that this Order and Opinion cites to and discusses th e subject matter of \ndocuments that the Court has allowed to remain under seal in this action, and out of an \nabundance of caution, the Court filed this Order and Opinion under seal on 2 November 2022.  \n(See ECF No. 194.)  On 11 November 2022, the parties no tified the Court that, after \nconferring, all parties agree there is no material in this Order and Opinion that requires \nsealing.  Accordingly, the Court now files this public version of this Order and Opinion. \n \n2 Defendant John D. Phillips (“Phillips”) is not a party to the Motion.  On 4 December 2020, \nPhillips filed a petition under Chapter  13 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the \nWestern District of North Carolina.  (Stay Order 1–2, ECF No. 133 [the “Stay Order”].)  The \nCourt, following notice from Phillips’ counsel, entered the Stay Order only as to Phillips on \n22 December 2020.  (Stay Order 3.)  Absent unusual circumstances, an automatic stay under \n11 U.S.C. § 362 only protects the debtor, not co-defendants.  See In re Robert F. Youngblood \nConstr. Co., 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 1214, at *4 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. March 22, 2012).  The Court \nprovided all  parties, including MetLife,  with the opportunity to file a motion seeking \nprotection on the basis of the automatic stay, but no such motion was filed with the Court .  \nAs a result , the action proceeded as to all other parties.   The Stay Order i s effective as to \nKelly v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2022 NCBC 70. \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rule(s)”) , MetLife requests this Court grant \nthe Motion as to all remaining claims asserted by Kelly because there are no genuine \nissues of material fact and it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.

Harrell and Tyler \nNullmeyer, for Defendant John Phillips. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \nI. INTRODUCTION \n3. This case arose out of an alleged Ponzi scheme operated by Charlotte, North \nCarolina businessman Richard C. Siskey (“Siskey”) for a number of years prior to his \ndeath on 28 December 2016.   Siskey was, for a period of time , a MetLife employee \nwho worked as a financial and investment advisor, securities broker, and insurance \nsalesman in MetLife’s Charlotte, North Carolina office.  Plaintiff John  K. Kelly \n(“Kelly”) engaged Siskey as a securities broker, investment advisor, and/or insurance \nagent.  Kelly also engaged Defendant John Phillips  (“Phillips”) in similar roles.  \nKelly’s claims against MetLife arise out of Siskey and Phillips’ conduct.  \n \nPhillips unless and until the Bankruptcy Court grants relief or otherwise disposes of the \nbankruptcy proceeding.  (Stay Order 2.) \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  “[T]o provide context for its ruling, the Court may state either \nthose facts that it believes are not in material dispute or those facts on which a \nmaterial dispute forecloses summary adjudication.”   Ehmann v. Medflow, Inc. , \n2017 NCBC 86, ¶ 22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017). \nA.  The Parties \n5. Kelly is a resident and citizen of Summerfield, Guilford County, North \nCarolina.  (First Am. Compl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 48 [“Am. Compl.”].) \n6. Defendant MLIC is a corporation organized under the laws of New York, \nwith its principal place of business located in New York, New York.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 7.)  \nMLIC has an office located in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina , and it is \nauthorized to do business in North Carolina as an issuer of life insurance policies and \nother financial services products.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 7.) \n7. Defendant MSI Financial  is a corporation organized under the laws of \nDelaware, with its principal place of business in Springfield , Massachusetts.  ( Am. \nCompl. ¶ 8.)  MSI Financial has an office in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶  8.)  MSI Financial is a subsidiary of MLIC  engaged in the sale of \nsecurities.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 8.)   \nB.  MetLife’s Connection to Phillips and Siskey \n8. Phillips began working for MetLife on 25  October 1999.  (Aff. John D. \nPhillips ¶ 1, ECF No. 148.6 [“Phillips Aff.”].)  After fourteen years, on 30 December \n2013, Phillips became an independent contractor permitted to sell authorized MetLife \nsecurities and investment products.  (Phillips Aff. ¶¶  2–3.)  Phillips terminated his \nrelationship with MetLife on 31 October 2015  but retained authority to service pre -\nexisting insurance-related business.  (Phillips Aff. ¶  4.)  As of 1 November 2015,  \nPhillips had been subject to no disciplinary action or investigation while working at \nMetLife.  (Aff. Gregory S. Williams ¶ 13, ECF No. 148.1 [“Williams Aff.”].) \n9. Siskey began working for MetLife in November 1999.  (Williams Aff. ¶ 14.)   \n10. In 2004, while an employee of  MetLife, Siskey signed a consent with the \nNational Association of Securities Dealers (the “NASD”) 3 agreeing to accept a fine \nand suspension of his license to sell securities  for two years as a result of failing to \nprovide “sufficient prior written notice” of participation in “private securities \ntransactions.”  (ECF No s. 148.10 , 148.11.)  Following the period of license \nsuspension20 September 2004 to 19 September 2006Siskey never regained his \nsecurities license.  (Williams Aff. ¶ 15; ECF No. 148.11.)  Because Siskey did not have \na license to sell securities, he  had no employment or other  contractual relationship \nwith MSI Financial after 20 September 2004.  (Williams Aff. ¶ 15.) \n11. MetLife filed a Form U5, and the NASD filed a Form U6 , each containing \ninformation about Siskey’s deregistration and the 2004 disciplinary action.  (Williams \nAff. ¶ 16.) \n12. Siskey remained an MLIC employee until 1 April 2011.  (Williams Aff. \nEx. G.)  On 4 April 2011, Siskey became a n independent contractor for MLIC.  \n \n3 The NASD was the predecessor to what is now known as FINRA, the Financial Industry \nRegulatory Authority, a government-authorized organization which oversees United States \nbroker-dealers.   \n(Williams Aff. Ex. H, 1 [“Independent Contractor Agreement”]. )  As an independent \ncontractor, Siskey was contractually required to keep “outside business ‘entirely \nindependent’ from his activities as a MetLife insurance broker,” and he agreed to stop \nusing the name “Wall Street Capitol” in his business activities.   (Williams Aff. ¶ 19 \n(quoting Williams Aff. Ex. I).)  On 13 December 2013, Siskey entered into an Affiliated \nBroker Contract with MLIC whereby Siskey remained an independent contractor for \nMLIC.  (Williams Aff. ¶ 20; see Williams Aff. Ex. J.) \n13. Siskey terminated his contract in November 2015 prior to being interviewed \nas part of an internal investigation concerning up to seventeen life insurance policies \nSiskey purchased on the lives of fourteen  of his individual business clients.  (Dep . \nAnthony E. Bundy 64:8 –65:6, ECF No. 186.1 [“Bundy Dep.”]; Bundy Dep. Exs.  Ex. \n1006, 2, ECF No. 186.2 [“Bundy Dep. Exs.”].) \n14. While performing in various capacities for MetLife, Siskey and Phillips \nworked together in the Wall Street Capitol office located at  Suite 400, 4521 Sharon \nRoad, Charlotte, North Carolina.  ( See ECF No. 148.5 [“WSC DBA”].)   Siskey and \nPhillips, along with other MetLife brokers and employees, worked in Suite 400 using \nthe trade name “Wall Street Capitol ” for MetLife business.  (WSC  DBA 8–9.)  The \nsign on the office door for Suite 400 read, “Wall Street Capitol an office of MetLife.”  \n(Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1010.)  This practice continued until 29 June 2016 , when the \nWall Street Capitol name was re-registered to five individuals, excluding Siskey and \nPhillips.  (WSC DBA 1–2.) \n15. Although Wall Street Capitol was a name associated with MetLife, MetLife \ncontends that emails from domains such as “wallstreetcapitol.com” and “wscap.com” \nare not associated with MetLife and that MetLife did not have access to, or possession \nof, emails sent to or from those domains.  (Williams Aff. ¶ 32.) \nC. Kelly’s Relationship with Siskey and Phillips \n16. Kelly first met Phillips in the spring of 2015 at a lunch at the Grandover \nResort in Greensboro, North Carolina.  (Phillips Aff. ¶  5; Dep. of John Kelly 36:20–\n36:24, 37:24–38:1, ECF No. 168 [“Kelly Dep.”].)  During his deposition, Kelly recalled \nthat Phillips was a financial advisor, but he did not recall details of their conversation \nor what investments were discussed at the meeting.  (Kelly Dep. 39:2–39:25.)  Phillips \nrecollected that they did not discuss MetLife products but  instead discussed Kelly’s \ninterest in i nvesting in Siskey’s companies.  (Phillips Aff. ¶¶  6–7.)  During that \nmeeting, Phillips recalled that Kelly specifically expressed interest in investing in \nTSI Holdings, LLC (“TSI”) and Siskey Capital, LLC.  (Phillips Aff. ¶ 8.) \n17. After their first meeting, Kelly and Phillips met at least six times between \n2015 and the end of 2016.  (Kelly Dep. 43:12– 43:15.)  At  least four or five of those \nmeetings occurred at the Wall Street Capitol office in Charlotte.  (Kelly Dep. 44: 12–\n44:25.) \n18. Kelly met Siskey in person on one occasion, in the reception area of the 4521 \nSharon Road building, where they discussed investments.  (Kelly Dep. 48:25–49:19, \n50:12–50:18.)  That is the only time  Kelly recalls meeting Siskey in person, one on \none, to discuss investments.  ( Kelly Dep. 52:25–53:2.)  Kelly also interacted with  \nSiskey when they attended  investment-related meetings , including one for Level \nBeauty, Inc., and another for an insurance company.  ( Kelly Dep. 53:18 –54:1.)  \nPhillips also attended those meetings.  (Kelly Dep. 55:6–55:16.) \n19. Kelly interacted with Siskey  socially when Kelly attended an event at \nSiskey’s home and the two discussed Siskey’s Corvettes.  (Kelly Dep. 47:13–48:18.) \nD.  Kelly’s Investments in Siskey-Related Entities \n20. Kelly initially invested in TSI Holdings, LLC (“TSI Holdings”)  and Stone \nStreet Partners, LLC (“Stone Street”) 4 in June 2015.  (Phillips Aff. ¶  10.)  Kelly \ninvested additional funds in TSI in July 2015, and in Stone Street in both July 2015 \nand September 2015.  (Phillips Aff. ¶ 12.)  Neither TSI Holdings nor Stone Street was \na MetLife branded securit y, or an investment offered by MetLife; they were not \ninvested through a MetLife account; and they were not held at MetLife.  (Phillips Aff. \n¶¶ 13, 15.) \n21. Between June 2015 and July 2016, Kelly also invested in Level Beauty, Inc. \n(“Level Beauty”), Kure Corp. (“Kure”), and Sharon Road Properties , LLC (“Sharon \nRoad Properties”) .  These investments were not MetLife branded securities or \ninvestments offered by MetLife , and they were not held at MetLife or invested \nthrough a MetLife account.  (Phillips Aff. ¶¶ 18–19, 23.) \n22. Kelly represented that he was a qualified and sophisticated investor,  (see, \ne.g., Kelly Dep. 86:1–86:5; 117:11–117:16), and that he understood the risk involved \nwith the investments, (see, e.g., Kelly Dep. 198:17–198:22). \n \n4 After Siskey died, Siskey Capital changed its name to Stone Street, LLC.  ( See Kelly Dep. \n146:23–146:25.)  The Court herein refers to the entity as Stone Street. \n23. Kelly’s investments in the above entities totaled approximately $885,227.  \n24. Kelly testified at his deposition  that MetLife knew Siskey was “stealing \nfrom his customers” and had MetLife  intervened, Kelly would never have invested.  \n(Kelly Dep. 283:7–283:21.) \n25. Kelly never received a statement of account or other documentation of his \ninvestments from MLIC, MSI Financial, or any  entity that was identified with \nMetLife.  (Kelly Dep. 311:19 –312:12.)  Kelly is also not on record with MetLife as \nhaving ever been a customer of MLIC, MSI Financial, or the MetLife organization \nmore broadly.  (Williams Aff. ¶  26.)  MetLife has no record of an insurance product, \nbrokerage account, or any other account held in Kelly’s name.  (Williams Aff. ¶  27.)  \nMetLife has no record of correspondence with Kelly, insurance applications in \nconnection with Kelly, account opening materials ass ociated with Kelly, or \ninformation that would otherwise identify Kelly to MetLife.  (Williams Aff. ¶ ¶ 28–\n31.) \ni.  TSI Holdings \n26. On 23 June 2015, Kelly invested $100,000 in TSI Holdings.  (Kelly Dep. \n171:13–171:22, 175:17–175:24.)  At the time  he invested, Kelly understood that TSI \nHoldings was an investment holding company.  (Kelly Dep. 171:23–172:4.)  Kelly and \nPhillips met at the Grandover Resort prior to the investment, where Phillips informed \nKelly that TSI Holdings was related to S tone Street .  (Kelly Dep. 172:5 –172:24, \n173:24–174:3.)  Phillips also told Kelly that the investment was “guaranteed” for a \n5% return in year one, a 5.5% return in year two, and a 6% return in year three with \na maturity date of 2018.  (Kelly Dep. 175:25–176:9, 183:13–183:24.)  \n27. On 20 November 2015, Kelly again invested in TSI Holdings.  (Kelly Dep. \n224:18–225:6.)  In total, Kelly invested approximately $305,227 in TSI Holdings.   \n(ECF No. 148.37.) \nii.  Stone Street \n28. Kelly invested $200,000 in S tone Street  on 23 June 2015 .  (Kelly Dep. \n109:14–110:1.)  Prior to investing, h e discussed th e investment in person with \nPhillips.  (Kelly Dep. 104:10–105:1.)  Phillips represented to Kelly that the average \nreturn on investments in Stone Street  was anywhere from thirty  to thirty-two \npercent.  (Kelly Dep. 209:14–209:21.)  On the offering memorandum, the investment \nis described as involving “a high degree of risk” and “speculative.”  (Kelly Dep. 114:20–\n115:9.)  Kelly was certain at his deposition that he looked over th e offering \nmemorandum when he received it, but he went forward with the investment because \nPhillips and Siskey “were running an operation involving MetLife, [and] that there \nwouldn’t be any fraud. ”  (Kelly Dep. 115: 16–116:7.)  Kelly ’s position is that Stone \nStreet was the same as MetLife because Wall Street Capitol  was registered as an \noffice of MetLife  and because of Siskey’s relationship with MetLife .  (Kelly Dep. \n121:21–122:16, 126:21–127:8.) \n29. Prior to  investing in Stone Street, Kelly received an investment  packet \ncontaining information about the entity  and its Management.  ( See Siskey Capital \nInvestment Packet, ECF No. 148.18 [“Stone St. Inv. Packet”].)  Siskey is listed in the \npacket as a principal of the Company , and the packet clearly discloses that he “has \nbeen the subject of various legal and administrative proceedings, none of which are  \n(sic) considered to be material to the operation of the Company.  Further information \nabout any of these matters will be provided upon request.”  (Stone St. Inv. Packet 22.) \n30. Kelly invested an addition al $130,000 in Stone Street  on 28 July 2015.  \n(Kelly Dep. 144:7–144:18.)  In total, Kelly invested about $330,000 in Stone Street.  \n(Kelly Dep. 103:23–104:1, 144:15–144:18.) \niii.  Level Beauty \n31. Kelly invested a total of $75,000 in Level Beauty.5  (Kelly Dep. 65:23–66:3.)  \nKelly invested in Level Beauty after a meeting attended by Siskey and a conversation \nwith Phillips.  (Kelly Dep. 59:20–60:19.)  Kelly could not identify any false statements \nmade to him about the Level Beauty investment.  (Kelly Dep. 61:20–63:1, 75:9–76:4.)6  \nAs of the  hearing on  the Motion on  9 September 2022 (the “Hearing”) , Kelly still \nowned the Level Beauty stock.  (See Kelly Dep. 63:6–63:9.) \niv.  Kure \n32. Kelly invested $75,000 in Kure on 19 September 2015.   (164:11–164:17.)  \nBefore deciding to invest in Kure, Kelly spoke with Phillips regarding the brand and \nthe products it would be offering.  (Kelly Dep. 157:3 –157:12.)  Kelly was influenced \nby Phillips’ excitement regarding the company’s plans for growth.  (Kelly Dep. 162:1–\n \n5 The date of Kelly’s investment in Level Beauty is not clear on the record before the Court, \nbut his Stock Certificate in the relevant shares is dated 17 January 2017.  (ECF No. 148.32.) \n \n6 Level Beauty later became YCBD, also referred to as cbdMD, which is now a publicly traded \ncompany.  (Kelly Dep. 63:10– 63:16, 67:22–67:24.)  Although  the name of the company has \nchanged, the Court refers to it as Level Beauty for purposes of this Order and Opinion. \n162:11.)  Kelly also spoke with Siskey, but Kelly did not recall when that meeting was \nor what Siskey said to influence his decision to invest in Kure.  (Kelly Dep. 161: 13–\n161:24.) \nv.  Sharon Road Properties \n33. Kelly invested $100,000 in Sharon Road Properties on 22 June 2016.  (Kelly \nDep. 250:4–250:17, 256:13–256:22.)  At the time he invested, Kelly thought he was \npurchasing an interest in a building he believed Siskey owned at 4521 Sharon Road \nin Charlotte, North Carolina, but Kelly was not sure what percentage of the building \nhe was purchasing.  (Kelly Dep. 250:18 –251:21.)  Kelly spoke with Phillips, but not \nwith Siskey, prior to investing.  (Kelly Dep. 251:22 –252:3.)  According to Kelly, \nPhillips informed Kelly that the investment would return eight percentfour percent \nin cash that Kelly would receive later , and four percent in equity.  Phillip also told \nKelly he had the ability to cash out at any time.  (Kelly Dep. 255:5–255:18.) \n34. Kelly neither reviewed financial statements  or appraisals valu ing the \nbuilding, nor did he review any leases or rent rolls regarding the building’s occupancy \nprior to investing.  (Kelly Dep. 253:23–254:10.) \nE.  Siske y’s Disciplinary History and MetLife’s Response \n35. In 2000, after working for MetLife for six months, Siskey was disciplined \nfor forging his wife’s signature on an annual NASD compliance meeting roster.  \n(Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1009.)  In a letter to Siskey from Leonard Bakal, MetLife’s Vice \nPresident and Compliance Director at the time, Siskey was informed that “Company \npolicy prohibits, under any circumstances, any individual from signing another \nindividual’s name to an attendance roster for any compliance meeting .  . . or any \nsimilar meeting . . . or Company document.”  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1009.)  Siskey was \nalso disciplined in that letter for reporting annuity sales as unsolicited when they \nwere in fact soli cited, which was against Company compliance rules because it \nconstituted an incorrect completion of client documents.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1009.)  \nBakal warned Siskey that “any future violations of federal securities laws, NASD \nrules or Company compliance procedures may subject [Siskey] to appropriate \ndisciplinary action by [MetLife]  and/or [the] NASD” and could result in penalties \ndeemed appropriate, “up to and including termination.”  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1009.) \n36. On or about March 2002, MetLife learned Siskey misrepresented in filings \nwith MetLife the true nature and extent of his involvement with the P remier Fund, \nLLC and Premier II, LLC.  ( MetLife’s Objs. Resps. Pls’ First Set Interrog . 27, ECF \nNo. 186.8 [“MetLife’s Resp. First Interrog .”].)  As a result of Siskey’s failure to \nproperly disclose his participation in outside business activities  (“OBAs”), MetLife \nissued a formal letter of censure and caution, ordering Siskey to wind-up the business \nof both entities.  (MetLife’s Resp. First Interrog. 27.) \n37. Siskey was again discipl ined in 2004  for improperly disclosing his OBAs , \n(see supra, ¶¶  10–12), resulting in Siskey consenting to a suspension of his NASD \nlicense and being placed on a Supervision Plan with MetLife on 19 April 2004, (ECF \nNos. 148.10, 148.11; Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 979). \n38. The Supervision Plan for Richard Siskey (the “Supervision Plan”) provided \nthat Gordon Silva  (“Silva”), MetLife’s General Securities Principal, w ould directly \nsupervise Siskey, as he was “located in the same office” as Siskey.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. \nEx. 979.)  Among other things, the Supervision Plan required Silva to: create and \nmaintain a supervision file for Siskey; review and approve all new business \napplications submitted by Siskey; hold and document meetings with Siskey to “review \nhis current marketing activity, prospecting, anticipated new business submissions \nand any pending new business under management review” ; review with Siskey  his \nOBA disclosures on a quarterly basis; and, notify the Compliance Director, Mr. Bakal, \nof any customer or regulatory complaints involving Siskey that were received by the \nagency.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 979.) \n39. The Supervision Plan was to remain in effect until otherwise modified or \nterminated by the MetLife compliance department.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 979.)   \nThere is no evidence before the Court to suggest th e Supervision Plan was ever \nmodified or terminated. \n40. In 2006, the MetLife compliance department  investigated a complaint \nalleging “unethical practices by Gordon Silva and Ric[k] Siskey” at the Wall Street \nCapitol office.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 982.)  MetLife’s investigation, beginning in June \n2006 and lasting until November 2006, concluded that  the allegations were without \nmerit because they could not be substantiated.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 979.) \n41. Siskey was investigated by MetLife again from December 2008 through \nApril 2009 after he submitted an updated OBA report that raised concerns.  (Bundy \nDep. Exs. Ex. 985.)  No formal discipline resulted from this investigation, but Siskey \nwas required to resubmit corrected OBA reports for the years 2008 and 2009.  (Bundy \nDep. Exs. Ex. 985.) \n42. On 1 March 2011, Siskey, Wall Street Capitol , LLC , and the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor (the “Department”) entered a Stipulation of Settlement (the \n“Settlement”) following an investigation into whether Siskey and/or Wall Street \nCapitol violated Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  \n(“ERISA”).  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 999.)  Under the Settlement, Siskey and Wall Street \nCapitol agreed to make several payments to entities and individuals in connection \nwith investments made in the Premier Fund, LLC and in Sharon Road Properties.  \n(Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 999.)  In exchange, the Department agreed not to initiate any \naction against Siskey and Wall Street Capitol in Federal District Court.  (Bundy Dep. \nExs. Ex. 999.) \n43. In 2015, MetLife began investigating the  life insurance policies Siskey  \npurchased on the lives of his individual business clients.   (See Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. \n1003, 1005.)  As e arly as 9 November 2015, MetLife’s Senior Fraud Investigator \nAnthony Bundy (“Bundy”) interviewed the individuals whose lives were insured by \nthe policies Siskey held.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1003.)  The 19 February 2016 Internal \nInvestigation Report that fol lowed indicated that Siskey resigned his broker \nappointment with the Company in November 2015 prior to being interviewed for the \ninvestigation.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1005.) \n44. Bundy recalled that he spoke with another MetLife investigator  around \nNovember 2015 and that investigator believed it “sounded like [Siskey’s actions were \nsimilar to] . . . the fact pattern of what [they] have seen in the past related to a Ponzi \nscheme.”  (Bundy Dep. 100: 2–100:20.)  When asked whether anyone else at MetLife \nhad taken any action to investigate  whether Siskey was operating a Ponzi scheme, \nBundy responded: \n[a]ll we had was a single comment by a customer that said if he had \nbeen, you know, reimbursed for his own losses, that’s all we had.  What \n[the other investigator] said to somebody else, I don’t know, but what we \ndidn’t have is enough to say that there was anything occurring. This was \nno more than a hunch, at best. \n \n(Bundy Dep. 101:4–101:21.) \n45. According to MetLife’s expert, “absent a customer complaint, it is generally \nvery difficult for insurance companies to discover insurance violations or misconduct.”  \n(Goodwin Expert Report ¶ 56, ECF No. 148.7 [“Goodwin Report”].)  Goodwin opined \nthat “MetLife conducted itself with appropriate due diligence regarding the matters \nidentified by [its security software,] and its subsequent investigation [of Siskey] in \n2015 and 2016.”  (Goodwin Report ¶ 67.)  Goodwin further opined that MetLife “had \nno obligation (or even the practical ability) to report the results of the investigation \n[into Siskey] to Mr. Kelly” given that Kelly was not a MetLife customer, held no \nMetLife policy or account, and did not otherwise have a relationship with MetLife.  \n(Goodwin Report ¶ 75.) \n46. According to Phillips, Kelly never asked him about Siskey’s legal history or \nany history Siskey had with regulators.  (Phillips Aff. ¶ 26.) \nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n47. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motion. \n48. On 3 May 2018, Kelly initiated this action by filing his Complaint alleging \nclaims against MLIC, MSI Financial, and Phillips. 7  ( See ECF No . 4.)  The First \nAmended Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) was filed on 26 September 2018.  (Am. \nCompl.) \n49. Kelly included 9 purported claims for relief in the Amended Complaint: (1) \nfraud; (2) constructive fraud;  (3) violations of the North Carolina Securities  Act \n(“NCSA”); (4) negligent misrepresentation; (5) professional negligence; (6) negligence; \n(7) unfair and deceptive  trade practices (UDTP) pursuant to N.C.G.S. §  75-16; (8) \nvicarious liability; and (9) punitive damages.  (See Am. Compl.) \n50. The Court disposed of several of these claims in Aldridge v. Metro. Life Ins. \nCo. (“Aldridge I”) , holding that Kelly lacked standing under Rule  12(b)(1) to assert \nthe claims directly against MetLife for “fraud, constructive fraud, and negligent \nmisrepresentation” based on Kelly’s investments in TSI Holdings and Sharon Road \nProperties.  Aldridge I, 2019 NCBC 49, ¶ 7, 134D (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 15, 2019). \n51. The Court disposed of several additional claims in Aldridge v. Metro. Life \nIns. Co. (“Aldridge II”)  under Rule 12(b)(6).  See Aldridge II, 2019 NCBC 81 (N.C. \n \n7 Kelly was originally joined by four other plaintiffs who are no longer parties to this action.  \nTwo plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice in October 2020, and the \nremaining two dismissed their claims with prejudice in January 2021.  (ECF Nos. 121, 135–\n36.)  There was also a fourth defendant in this matter, and all claims against that defendant \nwere dismissed without prejudice on 31 October 2018.  (ECF No. 54.) \nSuper. Ct. Dec. 31, 2019).  The following claims against MetLife were dismissed: (1) \nfraud by affirmative misrepresentation based on respondeat superior; (2) constructive \nfraud; (3) negligent misrepresentation under a direct theory of liability; (4) claims \narising under the NCSA; (5) negligent supervision related to Phillips; (6) the UDTP \nclaims; and (7) the standalone claim for punitive damages.  Id. at ¶ 246(D).  The Court \nalso dismissed Kelly’s claims against Phillips for fraud , constructive fraud, and \nsecurities fraud under the NCSA.  Id. \n52. The Motion was filed on 22 December 2021.  Following full briefing, t he \nCourt held the Hearing  at which all parties to the Motion  were present and \nrepresented by counsel.  \n53. After the Hearing, counsel for Kelly was permitted to file a correction to the \nrecord to remedy a mistake in the filing of his response to the Motion.  (ECF Nos. 190, \n192.)  In addition, p ursuant to the Court ’s Order, Plaintiff was permitted to file \nExhibit 11 to Kelly’s Deposition.  (See ECF No. 193.) \n54. The Motion is now ripe for resolution. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n55. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c).  “A ‘genuine issue’ is \none that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, \n83 (2000). \n56. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact, and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \nHensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp. , Inc., 193 N.C. App. 561, 563 (2008).  The movant \nmay make the required showing by proving that “an essential element of the opposing \nparty’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an \naffirmative defense, or by showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot \nproduce evidence to support an essential element of her claim.”  Dobson, 352 N.C. at \n83 (citations omitted). \n57. “Once the party seeking summary judgment  makes the required showing, \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784–85 \n(2000). \n58. The Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83.  However, the nonmovant  \nmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of their pleading, but \ntheir response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must \nset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If \n[the nonmovant] does not so respond, summary judgment, if \nappropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant]. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(e). \nV. ANALYSIS \n59. Four of Kelly’s claims remain against MetLife: (1) direct liability for fraud \nby omission or concealment as to Kelly’s investments in Stone Street and Level \nBeauty;8 (2) negligent supervision of Siskey as to the Stone Street and Level Beauty \ninvestments;9 (3) negligent misrepresentation under a theory of respondeat superior  \nbased on Siskey and Phillips’s alleged negligent misrepresentations; and (4) vicarious \nliability under a theory of respondeat superior based on Phillips’ professional \nnegligence. \nA.  Direct Liability for Fraud by Omission or Concealment \n60. “Where a fraud claim arises by concealment or nondisclosure of material \nfacts, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant(s) ‘had a duty to disclose material \ninformation to [the plaintiff], as silence i s fraudulent only when there is a duty to \nspeak.’ ”  Aldridge II, 2019 NCBC 81, ¶ 172 (citing Lawrence v. UMLIC-Five Corp., \n2007 NCBC 20, ¶ 34 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 18, 2007)). \n61. Fraud claims based on omission(s) require a plaintiff to allege: \n(1) the relati onship between plaintiff and defendant giving rise to the \nduty to speak; (2) the event that triggered the duty to speak or the \ngeneral time period over which the relationship arose and the fraud \n \n8 The Amended Complaint alleges this claim as to MetLife, contend ing that Kelly “suffered \nactual harm as a result of misrepresentations and concealment of material facts by JD \nPhillips [and MetLife] in the form of the loss of [his]  investments in the Ponzi Entities and \nother fraudulent entities.”  (Am. Compl. ¶  259.)  The term “Ponzi Entities” was defined as \nincluding: WSC Holdings, LLC, SouthPark Partners, LLC, Siskey Industries, LLC, Sharon \nRoad Properties, LLC , and TSI Holdings, LLC .  (Am. Compl. ¶  60.)  As stated herein, the \nclaims as to Sharon Road Properties and TSI Holdings have been  dismissed.  No “other \nfraudulent entities” are defined in the Amended Complaint.  There is no reference in the \nAmended Complaint to Kure which would cause the Court to include it in the analysis of this \nclaim, and no party argues that Kelly’s investment in Kure was the result of fraud by \nomission or concealment on the part of MetLife ; thus, the Court does not address the Kure \ninvestment as to this claim. \n \n9 In Aldridge I, the court determined that Kelly lacked standing to assert claims for negligent \nsupervision with respect to the investments in Sharon Road Properties and TSI Holdings.   \nAldridge I, 2019 NCBC 49, at ¶ 125–27.  As stated in the preceding footnote, because no party \nargues that this claim applies to the Kure investment, the Court does not address the Kure \ninvestment as to this claim. \noccurred; (3) the general content of the information that was  withheld \nand the reason for its materiality; (4) the identity of those under a duty \nwho failed to make such disclosures; (5) what the defendant gained from \nwithholding the information; (6) why the plaintiff's reliance on the \nomission was reasonable and detrimental; and (7) the damages the fraud \ncaused the plaintiff. \n \nLee v. McDowell, 2020 NCBC 74,  ¶ 40 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 14, 2020) (citing Island \nBeyond, LLC v. Prime Cap. Grp., LLC , 2013 NCBC 51, *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 30, \n2013)) (internal marks omitted). \n62. A duty to disclose arises in three situations: \n(1) there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties to the \ntransaction; (2) a party has taken affirmative steps to conceal material \nfacts from the other; or (3) one party has knowledge of a latent defect in \nthe subject matter of the negotiations about which the other party is \nboth ignorant and unable to discover through reasonable diligence. \nAldridge II, 2019 NCBC 81, at ¶ 173 (internal marks omitted).  Even in the absence \nof a duty to speak , “it is well- established that once a party chooses to speak, that \nparty then ‘has a duty to make a full and fair disclosure of facts concerning the \nmatters on which he chooses to speak.’  ”  Id. (citing Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. \n130, 139 (1974)). \n63. MetLife contends that Kelly has failed to forecast evidence establishing \nthat it concealed Siskey’s disciplinary history from him.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. \nJ. 15, ECF No. 152 [“Br. Supp. Mot.”] .)  MetLife argues that the undisputed facts \nshow that Kelly was not a MetLife customer , MetLife was unaware of Kelly , and \nMetLife did not know that he was relying on its alleged silence.  Therefore, MetLife \ncontends, it owed him no legal duty.  (Br. Supp. Mot. 16.) \n64. Further, MetLife argues that, even if a duty to speak  existed, the \nundisputed facts indicate that Kelly was alerted to Siskey’s disciplinary history by \nStone Street’s disclosures but failed to conduct minimal due diligence.   (Br. Supp. \nMot. 16; see ECF 148.18.)  Accordingly, even if the Stone Street disclosure was not \nenough to alert Kelly to Siskey’s disciplinary history, MetLife’s position is that Kelly’s \nreliance is not reasonable because  he failed to make any independe nt investigation \nor demonstrate that he was prevented from doing so.  (Br. Supp. Mot. 17.) \n65. Kelly argues that he has established that “MetLife had actual knowledge of \nthe Ponzi scheme in 2015 when [Kelly] invested with Siskey and Phillips at MetLife’s \nWall Street Capitol Office. ”  (Pl.’s Resp. Opp.  Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 7, ECF No. 160 \n[“Pl.’s Br. Opp.”].)   Kelly relies on deposition testimony from Bundy, as well as  \nevidence that Siskey was placed under the  Supervision Plan by MetLife .  (Pl.’s Br. \nOpp. 7–8.)  Kelly argues that it is “untenable” for MetLife  to argue that it had no \nknowledge of the fraud perpetrated upon him.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp. 8.) \n66. Kelly further contends that this Court can “presume” reliance if an alleged \nomission is material.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp. 8.)  He further contends that a question of fact \nremains as to whether “ in 2015 and 2016 MetLife knew whether Rick Siskey[,] a \ncriminal[,] was defrauding Wall Street Capitol customers who though t they were \ninvesting with MetLife.”   (Pl.’s Br. Opp. 8.)  However, in making this argument, \nPlaintiff fails to cite to evidence in the record to support his claim. \ni.  MetLife had no duty to speak \n67. Here, the evidence is uncontroverted that MetLife did not have a fiduciary \nrelationship with Kelly, did not take affirmative steps to conceal material facts from \nKelly, and did not  have “knowledge of a latent defect in the subject matter of the \nnegotiations about which the other party [was] both ignorant and unable to discover \nthrough reasonable diligence.”  Aldridge II, 2019 NCBC 81, at ¶ 173.  Consequently, \nMetLife had no duty to speak. \n68. A fiduciary relationship is generally described as arising when “there has \nbeen a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound \nto act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing \nconfidence.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651 (2001).  “Fiduciary relationships are \nreadily apparent, for example, in the relationship of spouses, attorney and client, and \ntrustee and beneficiary[.]”  Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 367 N.C. 363, 367 (2014) \n(internal citations omitted).  MetLife did not know who Kelly was, or that Kelly had \na financial relationship with Siskey.  Similarly, Kelly never received any documents \nor communication from MetLife to indicate that his investment in Stone Street and \nLevel Beauty were MetLife products.  In short, the undisputed facts do not give rise \nto a fiduciary relationship between Kelly and MetLife. \n69. Similarly, given that MetLife was unaware of Kelly, it could not have taken \naffirmative steps to conceal material facts about Level Beauty or Stone Street from \nKelly, even if it knew such information. \n70. Further, there is no evidence in the record establishing that MetLife knew \nof a defect concerning Kelly’s investments in Stone Street and Level Beauty that \nKelly could not have discovered through reasonable diligence.   Even if MetLife was \naware of Siskey’s disciplinary history and suspicious of hi s outside business \ntransactions prior to its investigation of him in November 2015, MetLife had no duty \nto speak to a non-client who was considering non-MetLife investments in July 2015.  \nKelly’s belief that his investments in Stone Street and Level Beauty  were MetLife \nproducts, by itself, does not give rise to a duty on MetLife’s part to speak.   \nii.   Kelly cannot show reasonable reliance \n71. Even if there were a duty to speak on the part of MetLife, fraud by omission \nrequires that the plaintiff’s reliance on  the omission be both  “reasonable and \ndetrimental.”  See Lee, 2020 NCBC 74, at ¶  40.  Reasonable reliance must be shown \nto make a case for actionable fraud.  See Myers & Chapman, Inc. v. Thomas G. Evans, \nInc., 323 N.C. 559, 568–71 (1988). \n72. Assuming Kelly were able to show reliance on an omission by MetLife—and \nhe has not on the record before the Court—his reliance must be reasonable.  “Reliance \nis not reasonable when the party ‘could have discovered the truth of the matter \nthrough reasonable diligence, but failed to investigate.’ ” Brewer v. Grue, 2020 NCBC \n59, ¶ 11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 28, 2020) (citing Sullivan, 158 N.C. App. at 26). \n73. When investing in Stone Street, Kelly received an investment packet \ncontaining information about the entity  and its Management.  ( See Stone St. Inv. \nPacket.)  Siskey is listed as one of  the principals of the Company , accompanied by a \ndisclosure that he  “has been the subject of various legal and administrative \nproceedings, none of which are (sic) considered to be material to the operation of the \nCompany.  Further information about any of these matters will be provided upon \nrequest.”  (Stone St. Inv. Packet 22.) \n74. The same notice is not included in the TSI Holdings investment packet.  \n(See TSI Holdings Investment Packet at Kelly 438, ECF No. 148.19.) \n75. Kelly’s $200,000 investment in Stone Street was one of his first in the \nSiskey-related entities and occurred on 23 June 2015.  He was given information that \nSiskey was involved in “legal and administrative proceedings.”  If those matters were \nmaterial to Kelly’s decisi on to invest in  Stone Street, Kelly could have, and should \nhave, inquired further to obtain information about Siskey’s past.  Instead, Kelly failed \nto make any further investigation.  Having so decided, Kelly cannot now argue that \nhe reasonably relied on any alleged omission by MetLife. \n76. Defendants have shown that, on the r ecord before the Court, there are no \nremaining genuine issue s of material fact  to be decided and they are entitled \njudgment with respect to this claim as a matter of law.  Accordingly, Kelly’s claim for \nfraud by omission or concealment is DISMISSED. \nB.  Direct Liability for Negligent Supervision of Rick Siskey \n77. Our Supreme Court has held that “[n]o legal duty exists [for negligence by \nan employer to a third party] unless the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable and \navoidable through due care.”  Stein v. Asheville City Bd. Of Educ., 360 N.C. 321, 328 \n(2006).  \n78.  More recently , in Keith v. Health -Pro Home Care Servs. , our Supreme \nCourt reaffirmed that an employer may, in certain circumstances, be liable to third-\npersons as a result of the negligence or intentionally wrongful conduct of an employee \nor independent contractor.  See 381 N.C. 442 (2022).  Relying on Medlin v. Bass and \nLittle v. Omega Meats I, Inc., the Court declared that: \nwhen a plaintiff alleges an employer negligently hired, retained, or \nsupervised an employee, and seeks recovery from the employer for \ninjury caused by the employee, the Medlin elements for negligent hiring \nand the Little nexus requirement for duty must be satisfied to show a \nnegligence claim in this context.  . . . Therefore, to survive a motion for \ndirected verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict for their \nnegligence claims, the Keiths had to present evidence to support each \nelement set forth in Med lin and to support a nexus between the \nemployment and the injury as required by Little. \n \nId. at 462–63 (citing Medlin v. Bass, 327 N.C. 587 (1990) ; Little v. Omega Meats I, \nInc., 171 N.C. App. 583 (2005)). \n79.  The Medlin Court held that to succeed on a claim for negligent supervision, \na Plaintiff must prove: \n(1) The specific negligent act on which the action is founded .  . . (2) \nincompetency, by inherent unfitness or previous specific acts of \nnegligence, from which incompetency may be inferr ed; and (3) either \nactual notice to the master of such unfitness or bad habits, or \nconstructive notice, by showing that the master could have known the \nfacts had he used ordinary care in ‘oversight and supervision,’ .  . .; and \n(4) that the injury complained of resulted from the incompetency proved. \n \nMedlin, 327 N.C. at 591; Keith, 381 N.C. at 451.  \n80.  In addition, Plaintiff must satisfy the Little “nexus proof requirement ,” \nmeaning that there must be a sufficient nexus between the employment relationship \nof the employer and the tortfeasor, on the one hand, and the injury alleged to have \nbeen visited on the plaintiff, on the other hand, to provide proof that the injury for \nwhich compensation is sought was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant-employer. \n81. In Little, the Court of Appeals listed three factors to be considered by the \ntrial court when determining if there is such a nexus: (1) whether plaintiff and the \ntortfeasor employee/independent contractor were both in places where each had a \nright to be when the wrongful act occurred; (2) whether the plaintiff met the \nemployee/independent contractor as a direct result of the employment; and (3) \nwhether the employer received some benefit, even if only potential or indirect, from \nthe meeting of the employee and the plaintiff.  Little, 171 N.C. App. at 587–88; Keith, \n381 N.C. at 452. \n82.  However, a plaintiff need not prove all three factors.  In Keith, the Supreme \nCourt determined that the Court of Appeals in the case before it had “erred by reading \nLittle to have ‘identified three specific elements that must be proven,’ and by declining \n‘to hold employers liable for the acts of their employees under the doctrine of negligent \nhiring or retention when any of [the] three factors was not proven.’ ”  Keith, 381 N.C. \nat 454.  \n83.  This Court interprets the Supreme Court’s discussion of the Little factors \nin Keith to mean that although trial courts should consider all three Little factors in \ndetermining whether a sufficient nexus exists, plaintiffs are not required to prove all \nthree elements in every case.  Rather, th e Court interprets the Supreme Court’s \ndirective to mean only that it must consider the three factors flexibly when  \ndetermining whether there is evidence to prove reasonable foreseeability.10 \n84. Adjudged by this standard, the Court concludes that Kelly has failed to \ncome forward with sufficient evidence to create a jury issue with respect to the Little \nnexus requirement.  Simply put, the relationship between Kelly, as customer, on the \none hand, and Siskey, as broker, on the other hand, had nothing to do with the \nMetLife Defendants. \n85. It is true that a  number of acts by Siskey during his time as an employe e \nof, and then independent contractor for , MLIC demonstrated his incompetency and \nprovided MetLife with notice that he was unfit, including: (1) Siskey’s discipline for \nforging his wife’s signature in 2000, (2) Siskey’s misrepresentation of his involvement \nwith the Premier Fund, LLC and Premier II, LLC in 2002, ( 3) the NASD license \nsuspension in 2004 as a result of improperly reporting OBAs, (4) the OBAs report and \ninvestigation in 2008, (5) Siskey’s settlement with the Department of Labor in 2011, \nand (6) Siskey holding life insurance policies on the lives of his business clients and \npaying the premiums on those policies.  \n86. However, even if Kelly could forecast evidence to satisfy Medlin , he is \nunable to meet the Little nexus requirement and, without it, he cannot establish \nforeseeability.  Of the three factors discussed in Little, only one is present here: Kelly \nand Siskey were each presumably in places where they individually had a right to be \n \n10 The Court also interprets the Supreme Court’s decision in Keith to stand for the proposition \nthat it is irrelevant whether the third-party tortfeasor is an employee of the defendant or an \nindependent contractor. \nwhen the negligent supervision of Siskey by MetLife allegedly occurred.  Kelly cannot, \nhowever, show that (1) he met Siskey as a direct result of his employment with \nMetLife, or that (2) MetLife received some benefit, even if only potential or indirect, \nfrom Siskey’s interactions with Kelly. \n87. First, Kelly did not meet Siskey as a result of his employment with MetLife.  \nThe evidence in the record demonstrates that Kelly first met with Phillips, not Siskey, \nin June 2015 to discuss the relevant investments.  Phillips and Kelly did not discuss \nMetLife products.  Further, Kelly invested i n Stone Street  (and potentially Level \nBeauty) before visiting the Wall Street Capitol office in Charlotte, meaning that Kelly \ncannot rely on that bei ng an office of MetLife to argue that there was a causal \nconnection. \n88. Further, MetLife received no benefit from the meeting of Siskey and Kelly.  \nWhile MetLife received a portion of the funds from Siskey selling insurance for MLIC \nas an independent contractor, Siskey never sold any such policy, or any other MetLife \nproduct for that matter, to Kelly.  Further, Stone Street and Level Beauty  were not \npublicly traded securities, and they were not sold by MetLife.  This is further \nevidenced by the fact that MetLife has no records of Kelly or of a relationship between \nKelly and Siskey. \n89. Even though one of the three Little factors is met, it does not lead logically \nto a conclusion that MetLife should have foreseen the harm alleged here.  Thus, the \nCourt finds that Kelly has not presented evidence to  establish a prima facie  case of \nnegligent supervision, and Kelly’s claim for negligent supervision is DISMISSED. \nC.  Vicarious Liability Claims \n90. Kelly’s two remaining cla ims each seek to hold MetLife vicariously liable \nunder respondeat superior for (1) negligent misrepresentations made by Siskey and \nPhillips in investment or account statements, and (2) Phillips’ professional \nnegligence. \n91. As a preliminary matter, both neglig ence claims fail because the record \nevidence before the Court is  that, at least since 2013,  Siskey and Phillips were \nindependent contractors for MetLife. \n92. The doctrine of respondeat superior generally allows an employer to be held \nvicariously liable for tortious acts committed by an employee acting within the scope \nof his employment.  Creel v. N.C. HHS, 152 N.C. App. 200, 203 (2002).  “Fundamental \nto the application of the doctrine of respondeat superior is the requirement that there \nbe an employer-employee relationship between the parties.”  Id.  “[A]n employer may \nbe held vicariously liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for a tortious act \ncommitted by an ‘employee’ but not [those ] committed by an ‘independent \ncontractor.’ ” Creel, 152 N.C. App. at 204 (citing Vaughn v. Dept. of Human Resources, \n296 N.C. 683, 686 (1979)). \n93. An employer’s “vicarious liability for the torts of his agent depends on the \ndegree of control retained by the principal over the details of the work as it is being \nperformed.  The controlling principle is that vicarious liability arises from the right \nof supervision and control.”  Vaughn , 296 N.C. at 686.  When the employer retains \nthe right to control and direct the “manner in which the details of the work are to be \nexecuted and what the [worker] shall do as the work progresses” there is an employer-\nemployee relationship.  Hayes v. Board of Trustees, 224 N.C. 11, 15 (1944).  However, \nwhen a worker “contracts to do  a piece of work according to his own judgment and \nmethods, and without being subject to his employer except as to the result of the \nwork,” that person is an independent contractor.  Id. \n94. On 4 April 2011, Siskey executed the MetLife Unified Brokerage Associate \nAgreement (the “UBA Agreement”).  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1000.)  The first page of \nthe UBA Agreement provides that Siskey is “an independent contractor and not an \nemployee of MetLife or its subsidiaries or affiliates.  None of the terms of this \nAgreement shall be construed as creating an employer- employee relationship [.]”  \n(Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1000, 1.)  While MetLife retained the authority to select and \nprice the insurance policies Siskey was permitted to sell, MetLife’s UBA Agreement \notherwise permitted Siskey to solicit and sell insurance policies according to his own \njudgment and methods.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1000, 2.) \n95. Siskey also executed the MetLife Affiliated Broker Contract on 30 \nDecember 2013.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1022, 7.)  The Affiliated Broke r Contract \nfurther bolsters the Court’s conclusion that Siskey was an independent contractor, as \nSiskey was permitted to “determine the time, place and manner for solicitation of \napplications for Products” and was responsible for “maintaining and operating his . . . \nown offices” as he saw fit.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1022, 1.)  Siskey was not required to \nwork a set number of hours, or on any particular days.  (Bundy Dep. Exs. Ex. 1022, \n1.)  Thus, even if under the 2011 UBA Agreement Siskey was not an independ ent \ncontractor, he certainly was under the 2013 Affiliated Broker Contract.  Thus, Siskey \nwas an independent contractor with MetLife at all relevant times that he interacted \nwith Kelly , and MetLife cannot be responsible for Siskey’s allegedly negligent \nmisrepresentations. \n96. All record evidence before the Court demonstrates that Phillips was also an \nindependent contractor for MetLife.   On 30 December 2013, Phillips became an \nindependent contractor permitted to sell authorized MetLife products.  (Phillips Aff. \n¶¶ 2–3.)  Phillips understood that he was permitted to sell  products authorized by \nMetLife, but that he was otherwise free to determine the time, place, and manner of \nhis work.  (See Phillips Aff. ¶ 3.)  Phillips terminated his relationship with MetLife \non 31 October 2015 but retained authority to service his pre-existing accounts.  \n(Phillips Aff. ¶ 4.)  Thus, Phillips was an independent contractor with MetLife at all \nrelevant times that he intera cted with Kelly, and MetLife cannot be responsible for \nPhillips’ allegedly negligent misrepresentations or professional negligence. \n97. Therefore, MetLife cannot be held vicariously liable under  the doctrine of \nrespondeat superior because Siskey and Phillips w ere both independent contractors \nat the time any alleged negligence occurred in relation to their communication and \nbusiness with Kelly. \n98. Even assuming, arguendo, that Siskey and Phillips were not independent \ncontractors, the remaining two claims also fail on other bases. \ni.  Negligent Misrepresentation on a Theory of Respondeat \nSuperior \n99. This Court determined in Aldridge I that Kelly lacked standing to assert a \ndirect claim for negligent misrepresentation against the MetLife  Defendants.  \nAldridge I , 2019 NCBC 49, at ¶¶ 121–22.  The only remaining claim is one for \nvicarious liability on a theory of respondeat superior for the actions of Siskey and \nPhillips, specifically that Siskey and Phillips sent Kelly “fraudulent investment \nstatements regarding Ke lly’s Wall Street Capit ol investments.”  Aldridge II, 2019 \nNCBC 81, at ¶ 193. \n100. “The tort of negligent misrepresentation occurs when a party justifiably \nrelies to his detriment on information prepared without reasonable care by one who \nowed the relying party a duty of care.”  Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 367 N.C. 363, \n369 (2014).  Under well-settled North Carolina law, \na breach of duty giving rise to a claim for negligent misrepresentation \nhas been defined as: “[o]ne who, in the course of his business, profession \nor employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary \ninterest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their \nbusiness transactions, [and thus] is subject to liability for pecuniary loss \ncaused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he \nfails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or \ncommunicating the information.” \n \nAldridge II, 2019 NCBC 81, at ¶ 188 (quoting Simms, 140 N.C. App. at 534).  “The \nrequirement of justifiable reliance is derived from Restatement § 552(1), providing \n‘liability for pecuniary loss caused to [the plaintiff] by their justifiable reliance upon \nthe information.’ ”  Brinkman v. Barrett Kays & Assocs., P.A., 155 N.C. App. 738, 742 \n(2003) (alteration in original) (quoting Raritan River Steel Co. v. Cherry, Bekaert & \nHolland, 322 N.C. 200, 206 (1988), rev’d on other grou nds, 329 N.C. 646 (1991)). \nJustifiable reliance is analogous to reasonable reliance in fraud actions.  Marcus Bros. \nTextiles, Inc. v. Price Waterhouse, LLP , 350 N.C. 214, 224 (1999).   “Reliance is not \nreasonable if a plaintiff fails to make any independent investigation, or fails to \ndemonstrate he was prevented from doing so.”  Arnesen v. Rivers Edge Golf Club & \nPlantation, Inc., 368 N.C. 440, 449 (2015) ( internal marks and citations omitted).  \n“Whether a party’s reliance is justified is generally a question for the jury, except in \ninstances in which the facts are so clear as to permit only one conclusion. ”  Dallaire, \n367 N.C. at 369 (internal marks omitted). \n101. First, MetLife owed Kelly no duty.  As stated herein at Paragraphs 6 7–70 \nPlaintiff points to no evidence in the record that supports a finding that MetLife knew \nKelly, or that it knew anything about the  investments he made between June 201 5 \nand June 2016.  As stated herein, MetLife had no duty to speak to a non-client it did \nnot know who was considering non- MetLife investments through an independent \ncontractor to the company. \n102. Further, Kelly cannot demonstr ate reasonable reliance because  he failed \neither to make an independent investigation or demonstrate that he was prevented \nfrom doing so.  See Arnesen, 368 N.C. at 449; Martin Communs., LLC v. Flowers, 2021 \nNCBC 21, ¶¶ 40–44 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 31, 2021) (dismissing plaintiff’s negligent \nmisrepresentation claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) because there were no allegations \nthat plaintiff attempted to investigate the veracity of defendants’ statements or \nobtain access to information held by defendants).  While uncovering  \nmisrepresentations in investment statements is no doubt  difficult, there is no \nindication that Kelly tried.  There is nothing to suggest that he made pertinent \ninquiries or sought outside advice about his investments.  In fact, the eviden ce \nindicates that Kelly did not consult with an accountant or any other kind of advisor \nprior to or after investing , even though he did have an accountant.  (Kelly Dep. \n192:23–193:3.) \n103. To the extent that Kelly believed his investments were related to or held by \nMetLife, there is no evidence that Kelly ever called, emailed, or otherwise \ncommunicated with MetLife to confirm this assumption , and there is nothing in the \naccount statements or other paperwork he received indicating any affiliation between \nhis investments and MetLife.  Kelly also did not communicate with MetLife about the \nbalance of his investments, or request to speak with another financial advisor about \nthe funds in his investment accounts.  Because Kelly puts forth no evidence that he \nmade inq uiry or was prevented from doing so, he has failed to demonstrate the \njustified reliance necessary to support a negligent misrepresentation claim.  See \nDallaire, 367 N.C. at 370. \n104.  Under these circumstances, Kelly’s claim for negligent misrepresentation \nis DISMISSED.  \nii.  Professional Negligence on a Theory of Respondeat Superior \nas to Phillips \n105. “A claim of professional negligence requires evidence that the defendant \nhad a duty to conform to a certain standard of care . . . and that a breach of that duty \nproximately caused injury.”  Potts v. KEL, LLC, 2019 NCBC 60, ¶ 13 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nSept. 27, 2019).  Our courts have consistently held that a duty arises where one \nperson, in the course of their  business or profession, provides investment advice to \nanother with the knowledge that their  advice will be relied upon.  See Howell v. \nFisher, 49 N.C. App. 488, 494–96 (1980). \n106. “A claimant is required to establish the standard of care for a professional \nnegligence claim through expert testimony ‘ where the common knowledge and \nexperience of the jury is [not] sufficient to evaluate compliance with a standard of \ncare[.]’ ”  Comput. Design & Integration, LLC v. Brown, 2018 NCBC 128, ¶ 153 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Dec. 10, 2018) (quoting Frankenmuth Ins. v. City of Hickory, 235 N.C. App. \n31, 35 (2014))  (internal marks omitted) .  Determining w hether a party failed to \nprovide accurate financial statements and failed to maintain proper books and \nrecords requires expert testimony.  Id. at ¶ 158.  “Without evidence of the applicable \nstandard of care,  [the] plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie claim for \nprofessional negligence.”  Crescent Univ. City Venture, LLC v. AP Atl., Inc. , 2019 \nNCBC 46, ¶ 222 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 8, 2019) (internal marks omitted). \n107. Here, Kelly argues that  he does not need an expert to explain “ that a \nMetLife financial representative should not suggest he invest in an entity like TSI \nHoldings, LLC which conducted no business and served no function whatsoever other \nthan Rick Siskey’s massive Ponzi scheme.”  (Pl.’s Br. Opp. 11.)  Kelly does not cite to \nany case law or evidence in the record to support that argument. \n108. MetLife argues that Kelly lacks the expert testimony necessary to establish \nthe professional negligence claim  because none of Kelly’s experts  offers an opinion \nabout Phillips or the standard of care that applied to him .  (Br. Supp. Mot. 28–29.)  \nWithout evidence of the applicable standard of care, MetLife argues that Kelly cannot \nestablish a prima facie claim for professional negligence.  (Br. Supp. Mot. 29.) \n109. The Court agrees with MetLife .  Kelly’s expert Sander Ressler (“Ressler”) \nopined only on matters concerning Siskey’s actions and the alleged failure by MetLife \nto supervise him appropriately.  (See ECF No. 186.7.)  Kelly indicated the existence \nof a second expert report from Robert Lawson dated 1 June 2021, (see ECF No. 186), \nbut Plaintiff did not submit that report  for the Court’s review , and it does not \notherwise appear as a part of the record before the Court. \n110. Without an expert to provide evidence of the applicable standard of care, \nPlaintiff’s claim for professional negligence  must fail.  Accordingly,  the claim for \nprofessional negligence is DISMISSED. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n111. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS the Motion.  Each of \nPlaintiff’s remaining claims is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice.  \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 14th day of November, 2022. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
