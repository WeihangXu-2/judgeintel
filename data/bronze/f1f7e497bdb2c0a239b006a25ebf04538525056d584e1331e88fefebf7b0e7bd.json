The \nOpposition relies heavily on the notion that designation involves a matter of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  This widely held perception is based in part on the \nCourt’s past use of terms like “jurisdiction,” “removal,” and “remand” in its rules \nand prior orders.   \n {2} The Court takes this opportunity to clarify both that the Business \nCourt is not a court of separate jurisdiction and how the Court interprets the \nstatutory mandates for designating a case as a mandatory complex business case.   \n {3} For reasons explained below, the Court defers its further consideration \nof the Opposition pending CFA’s consideration of this Order.  \nBell, Davis & Pitt, P.A. by Alan M. Ruley and Andrew A. Freeman for \nPlaintiff Composite Fabrics of America, LLC. \n \n Nexsen Pruet, PLLC by Peter A. Santos and Jonathan E. Schulz for \n Defendants Edge Structural Composites, Inc. and British Racing Imports & \n Track Services, Inc. \nGale, Chief Judge. \n \n \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n {4} This lawsuit arises from an agreement between CFA and Defendant \nEdge Structural Composites, Inc. (“Edge, Inc.”), dated January 29, 2014 \n(“Agreement”).  Under the Agreement, Edge, Inc. agreed to introduce CFA to \nprospective customers, and CFA agreed to pay a fee or royalty to Edge, Inc. for net \nsales to customers governed by the Agreement.  The parties contemplated that some \nCFA customers would use proprietary data developed and owned by Edge, Inc. to \nobtain a certification of code compliance known as an ICC-ES report.  A \ndisagreement exists about, among other things, whether Edge, Inc. should be paid \ncommissions on CFA’s sales to certain customers. \n {5} CFA filed a Verified Complaint (“First Complaint”) against Edge, Inc. \nas the sole defendant on August 14, 2015, in the superior court of Alexander \nCounty, North Carolina.  On September 25, 2015, Edge, Inc. removed the case to \nthe United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.  The \ncase was remanded on November 12, 2015. \n {6} CFA filed its First Amended Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) on \nDecember 17, 2015, against Edge, Inc., British Racing Imports & Track Services, \nInc. (“BRITS”), and Edge Structural Components, LLC (“Edge LLC”).   \n {7} Edge, Inc. and BRITS filed a Notice of Designation (“NOD”) on \nJanuary 8, 2016, certifying that this lawsuit qualifies as a mandatory complex \nbusiness case involving material issues of intellectual-property law and trade-\nsecrets law under subsections 7A-45.4(a)(5) and 7A-45.4(a)(8) of the North Carolina \nGeneral Statutes.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4(a)(5), (8) (2015).  No counterclaim had \nbeen made when the NOD was filed. \n {8} Chief Justice Mark Martin designated the case as a mandatory \ncomplex business case on January 11, 2016, and the case was assigned to this Court \nlater that day. \n {9} CFA timely filed its Opposition on January 13, 2016, asserting that \nthis lawsuit does not involve material issues relating to the ownership or use of \neither intellectual property or trade secrets.  Thus, CFA concludes that the Court \n \n \nlacks “jurisdiction” over this lawsuit.  (Opp’n to NOD 2 n.1 (quoting Clements v. \nClements ex rel. Craige, 219 N.C. App. 581, 586, 725 S.E.2d 373, 377 (2012)).)  CFA \nnotes, however, that it “would not be opposed to proceeding in the Business Court if \nthis action did in fact meet the jurisdictional requirements.”  (Opp’n to NOD 2 n.1; \nsee also Reply Supp. Pl.’s Opp’n to NOD (“Reply”) 1, 13.) \n {10} Edge, Inc. and BRITS filed an Answer and Counterclaims on January \n21, 2016.1  Edge, Inc., as the sole counterclaimant, asserts counterclaims against \nCFA for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, \nfraud, and unfair and deceptive trade practices.2    \n {11} Edge, Inc. and BRITS filed a Response in Support of Business Court \nDesignation on January 28, 2016.  Their argument in favor of designation draws \nfrom claims in both the Amended Complaint and the counterclaims.3  \n {12} The parties have each submitted briefs on the issue of designation, and \nthe Opposition is now ripe for ruling.  \nII. PROCEDURAL ISSUES REGARDING DESIGNATION \n {13} This case was designated and assigned to the Business Court based on \nthe NOD, which certifies that the case qualifies as a mandatory complex business \ncase under section 7A-45.4(a).  Mandatory designations are distinct from \ndiscretionary designations and are governed by statutory time periods, which this \nCourt has applied strictly.  These time limitations do not apply when a party seeks \na “discretionary” request from the senior resident superior court judge to the Chief \nJustice of the North Carolina Supreme Court under Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of \nPractice for the Superior and District Courts (“General Rules” or “Rule(s)”).  \n                                                 \n1 Edge, Inc. and BRITS note that Edge LLC has not been served with process in this lawsuit and \nthat Edge LLC has not conducted business since it ceased its operations in 2014 and subsequently \ndissolved in 2015.  (NOD 1 n.1; Answer and Countercls. 1 n.1.)   \n \n2 Edge, Inc. and BRITS also filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion to Strike on January 21, 2016.  \nThese motions are not pertinent to the Court’s ruling on the Opposition. \n \n3 The Court uses the terms “designation” and “Business Court designation” in this Order to mean \n“mandatory complex business cases” under N.C. Gen. Stat. §  7A-45.4.   \n \n \nFurther, a mandatory designation lies only for cases that involve material issues \nwithin the defined categories specified in section 7A-45.4.  A case may qualify for \ndiscretionary assignment to the Business Court under Rule 2.1 if the case does not \nqualify for mandatory designation under the statute but involves certain other \nfactors.  See, e.g., BCR 3.2. \n{14} The primary issues raised by the Opposition in this case involve \nwhether the subject matter of the particular facts and claims of this lawsuit meet \nthe requirements for mandatory designation based on subsections 7A-45.4(a)(5) or \n(a)(8), and whether the Court can look to the counterclaims as well as the Amended \nComplaint to make that determination. \nA. Use of a Counterclaim to Support Designation  \n{15} The Court begins its discussion by noting that Edge, Inc. relies on the \nmandatory designation procedure of section 7A-45.4, which provides that a party \nwho seeks to designate a case based on a pleading asserted against it must file a \nnotice of designation within thirty days of the service of that pleading.  The statute \nalso requires that a party who seeks to base designation on its own pleading must \nfile a notice of designation contemporaneously with that pleading.   \n{16} Here, Defendants’ filings rely on both CFA’s Amended Complaint and \nEdge, Inc.’s counterclaims.  Edge, Inc. no longer had the right to designate the case \nbased on the First Complaint, as the NOD was filed substantially later than thirty \ndays after service of the First Complaint.  The NOD was timely only because the \nAmended Complaint added a new party that joined in the NOD within thirty days \nof being served with the Amended Complaint.  Obviously, the NOD did not rest on \nany counterclaim, because no counterclaim had been filed.     \n{17} The Court disagrees with CFA’s suggestion that a counterclaim can \nnever be the basis for designation under section 7A-45.4.  Section 7A-45.4(a) \nprovides that “[a]ny party may designate [a case] as a mandatory complex business \ncase” if the case falls within certain subject-matter categories.  N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 7A-45.4(a).  Section 7A-45.4(c) states that a notice of designation shall be filed by \n \n \n“[a] party designating an action as a mandatory complex business case.”  Id. \n§ 7A-45.4(c).  Section 7A-45.4(d) separately provides that the notice of designation \nshall be filed by any of the following: \n(1) By the plaintiff, the third-party plaintiff, or the petitioner for \njudicial review contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint, \nthird-party complaint, or the petition for judicial review in the \naction.  \n \n(2) By any intervenor when the intervenor files a motion for \npermission to intervene in the action. \n \n(3) By defendant or any other party within 30 days of receipt of \nservice of the pleading seeking relief from the defendant or party. \n \n(4) By any party whose pleading caused the amount in controversy \ncomputed in accordance with G.S. 7A-243 to equal or exceed five \nmillion dollars ($5,000,000) contemporaneously with the filing of \nthat pleading. \nId. § 7A-45.4(d). \n \n{18} The text of section 7A-45.4(d) does not expressly include “counterclaim \nplaintiffs” or “counterclaims.”  The Court interprets “plaintiff or third-party \nplaintiff” and “complaint” or “third-party complaint” in subsection 7A-45.4(d)(1) to \ninclude counterclaim plaintiffs and counterclaims.  See id. § 7A-45.4(d)(1).  \nLikewise, “defendant or any other party” includes the party against whom the \ncounterclaim is being asserted.  Id. § 7A-45.4(d)(3).  In the instance where a \ncounterclaim is the basis for designation, for purposes of applying section 7A-45.4, \nthe counterclaimant would be the “plaintiff,” and the party against whom the \ncounterclaim is being asserted would be the “defendant,” who then has a right to \noppose designation within thirty days of service of the counterclaim.  See id. \n§ 7A-45.4(d)(1), (3). \n {19} Thus, a party may use its counterclaim as the basis for a notice of \ndesignation.  See, e.g., Order Denying Defendant’s Opposition to Designation, \nRS&M Appraisal Servs., Inc. v. Alamance County, No. 09 CVS 1961 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Feb. 18, 2010) (“But for these two counterclaims, the Court would not have \n \n \njurisdiction.”).  However, if a counterclaimant wishes to rely on the opposing party’s \ncomplaint as well as its own counterclaim as a basis for mandatory designation, the \nnotice of designation would need to be filed within thirty days of service of the \ncomplaint and contemporaneously with the counterclaim.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 7A-45.4(d)(3).   \n {20} The Court construes section 7A-45.4 to provide that a party who has \nthe right to seek mandatory designation based on a pleading that has been served \nupon it but who does not exercise that right within the statutory time period loses \nthe right to seek mandatory designation and cannot later renew their right to \ndesignation by filing a counterclaim.     \n {21} A different rule applies where a counterclaim is the first pleading to \nraise a material issue that falls within a category that qualifies for mandatory \ndesignation under section 7A-45.4(a).  In that case, as long as the new pleading is \nnot being made for an improper purpose, if the party pursues mandatory \ndesignation, the statutory time requirements for seeking designation are measured \nby the new pleading.  See BCR 3.1(b).4 \n {22} Here, Edge, Inc. filed its NOD within thirty days of being served with \nthe Amended Complaint but before it filed its counterclaims.  Whether this case \ninvolves material issues within the scope of section 7A-45.4(a) must therefore \ndepend on the allegations in the Amended Complaint.     \n {23} The Court is not required, however, to completely disregard Edge, \nInc.’s counterclaims.  For example, the Court can consider the counterclaims to \ninform it of whether CFA’s claims necessarily include material issues that fall \nunder subsections 7A-45.4(a)(5) or (a)(8).  See Cornerstone Health Care, P.A. v. \nMoore, No. 15 CVS 604, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *7 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 22, \n2015) (noting that the Court’s consideration of whether a case qualifies as a \nmandatory complex business case “historically [has not been] confined to the actual \ncauses of action asserted in a complaint, but has also examined the underlying \n                                                 \n4 Again, these strict, statutory-based time requirements do not apply to Rule 2.1 designations.  \n \n \nfactual allegations”); Order on Opposition to Designation of Action as Mandatory \nComplex Business Case, Union Corrugating Co. v. Viechnicki¸ No. 14 CVS 6240, \nslip op. at 2 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 9, 2014). \nB. Business Court Rule 3.2 Does Not Provide an Independent Basis for \nMandatory Designation \n{24} Business Court Rule 3.2 directs any party who files a notice of \ndesignation to not only describe how the case falls within one or more categories of \nsection 7A-45.4, but to further identify factors that demonstrate why the Business \nCourt is the appropriate venue for that case.  The origins of that rule precede the \nadvent of mandatory designation.  The Business Court Rules were adopted in 2000 \nand amended in 2006.  The Business Court Rules supplement the North Carolina \nRules of Civil Procedure and the General Rules.  Prior to 2000, the Court consisted \nof only one special superior court judge, and a case could be designated as a complex \nbusiness case only through discretionary assignment by the Chief Justice.  In 2006, \nthe number of special superior court judges assigned to hear complex business cases \nwas expanded, and the method for mandatory designation under section 7A-45.4 \nwas enacted.  The mandatory designation procedure and the classification of cases \nwithin such designation was amended in 2014.   \n{25} The factors in Business Court Rule 3.2 are useful in managing and \nassigning cases among the Business Court judges and may be useful in resolving \nrequests for discretionary assignments.  But these factors do not provide a stand-\nalone basis for mandatory designation.  For a case to be certified as a mandatory \ncomplex business case, the pleading upon which designation is based must raise a \nmaterial issue that falls within one of the categories specified in section 7A-45.4. \nC. Business Court Designation Does Not Raise Issues of Subject-Matter \nJurisdiction  \n{26} Litigants often refer to the Business Court’s “jurisdiction.”  This is \npartly a result of the Court’s own terminology in its past orders and in its current \nrules, which are presently under consideration for revision.  Thus, the Court \n \n \nappreciates why CFA would be led to present a position that is based on notions of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  But, the Business Court is not a court of separate \njurisdiction.   \n{27} The Court is merely an administrative division of the superior court in \nthe General Court of Justice.  A Business Court judge is a special superior court \njudge who is assigned cases that originate from counties across the state.  Just as a \nspecial superior court judge may be assigned to matters in any of those counties, \nwhen a Business Court judge is assigned to a case that has been designated as a \ncomplex business case, whether by a mandatory or discretionary assignment, he is \ncommissioned to preside over that entire case until its conclusion, and he proceeds \nwith the same jurisdiction and authority as any other superior court judge who may \nbe commissioned to hear matters in that case.  See Am. Mech., Inc. v. Bostic, Nos. \nCOA15-385, COA15-422, COA15-525, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 130, at *13–14 (N.C. \nCt. App. Feb. 2, 2016) (“The Business Court is a special superior court and its orders \nare, therefore, ‘order[s] of a superior . . . court rendered in a civil action’ . . . .” \n(alteration in original) (emphasis omitted) (quoting N.C. R. App. P. 3(a))); Sony \nEricsson Mobile Commc’ns USA, Inc. v. Agere Sys., Inc., No. 06 CVS 17673, 2007 \nNCBC LEXIS 28, at *7 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 27, 2007) (“[T]he Business Court is not \na court of jurisdiction or venue.”), aff’d, 195 N.C. App. 577, 583, 672 S.E.2d 763, 768 \n(2009).   \n{28} A Business Court judge is vested with authority over a case as soon as \nthe case is assigned to him by order of the Chief Justice.  Subject-matter jurisdiction \nis measured by the nature of the claims in the case, not by the judge to whom it has \nbeen assigned.  The case remains venued in the county of origin, and remains in \nthat county whether or not the case is designated as a complex business case, and \nwhether or not such designation may be later withdrawn.  Designation does not \n“remove” the case, and withdrawing a designation because of an opposition does not \nconstitute a “remand.”  The case has never left its county of origin.  \n \n \n \n \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n{29} CFA states that it “would not be opposed to proceeding in the Business \nCourt if this action did in fact meet the jurisdictional requirements, but [that it] is \nalso mindful of the maxim that ‘subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by \nconsent or waiver and a court cannot create it where it does not already exist.’”  \n(Opp’n to NOD 2 n.1 (quoting Clements, 219 N.C. App. at 586, 725 S.E.2d at 377); \nsee also Reply 1 (“Composite Fabrics is not opposed to proceeding in the Business \nCourt if this action does in fact meet the jurisdictional requirements set forth in \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4 . . . .”).)  In light of these statements, the Court invites \nCFA to reexamine its election to oppose designation after considering this Order.   \n {30} The Court does not intend to foreclose CFA’s choice to pursue \nopposition, as it has a clear right to do so.  CFA is requested to advise the Court \nwithin ten days of the date of this Order whether it wishes to further pursue its \nOpposition. \n{31} The time within which CFA must file its response to Defendants’ \nMotion to Strike and Motion to Dismiss is held in abeyance pending further Court \norder. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 5th day of February, 2016. \n \n \n \n /s/ James L.
