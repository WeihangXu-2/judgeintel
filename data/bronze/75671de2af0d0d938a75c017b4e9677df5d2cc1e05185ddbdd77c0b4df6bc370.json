NDCO, LLC, 2019 NCBC 67. \n \n \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nPENDER COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 446 \n \nPENDER FARM DEVELOPMENT, \nLLC, \n \n Plaintiff and  \nCounterclaim   \nDefendant,  \n \nv. \n \nNDCO, LLC, \n \n Defendant, Counterclaim  \nPlaintiff, and Third-\nParty Plaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nRAIFORD TRASK, III, \n \nThird-Party Defendant. \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON NDCO, \nLLC’S MOTION PURSUANT TO \nRULE 56(d) \n \n1. THIS MATTER  is before the Court on Defendant/Counterclaimant and \nThird-Party Plaintiff NDCO, LLC’s (“NDCO”) motion under Rule 56(d) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rule(s)” or “North Carolina Rule(s)”), filed on \nOctober 8, 2018  (the “Rule 56(d) Motion”) .  ( See ECF No. 88.)  NDCO ’s Rule 56(d) \nMotion is brought in connection with its motion for summary judgment, (ECF No. \n88), which came on for hearing before the Court on September 18, 2019 along with \nseparate motions for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant \nPender Farm Development, LLC (“PFD”) and Third-Party Defendant Raiford Trask, \nIII (“Trask”) (together, “PFD/”Trask”), (ECF Nos. 90, 92)  (all three summary \n \n \njudgment motions hereinafter, the “Cross -Motions”).  In t he Rule 56(d) Motion , \nNDCO requests that the Court examine the pleadings and evidence before it on the \nCross-Motions and ascertain what material facts exist without substantial \ncontroversy and what facts are actually and in good fa ith controverted .  In the \ninterests of judicial efficiency, the Court enters this Order and Opinion on NDCO’s \nRule 56(d) Motion separately and prior to its written order and opinion on the Cross-\nMotions. \nWyrick Robbins Yates & Ponton LLP, by Benjamin N. Thompson and \nSamuel A. Slater, for Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant Pender Farm \nDevelopment, LLC and Third-Party Defendant Raiford Trask, III.  \n \nShipman & Wright, LLP, by Gary K. Shipman and James T. Moore, for \nDefendant/Third-Party Plaintiff NDCO, LLC.  \n \nRobinson, Judge.  \n \nI. INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n2. This case arises out of a dispute between the two members of a limited \nliability company, Pender 1164, LLC (“Pender  1164”), that was formed for the \npurpose of owning and developing approximately 1,164 acres of real property located \nin Pender County, North Carol ina.  The business relationship between PFD and \nNDCO, which each own a fifty-percent interest in Pender 1164, is governed by a First \nAmendment to and Restatement of Operating Agreement of Pender 1164, LLC (the \n“Amended Operating Agreement”) .  This Amended Operating Agreement, and the \nobligations of the parties with respect to the development of the property owned by \nPender 1164, is at the heart of the parties’ dispute. \n \n \n3. The Rule 56(d) Motion is brought in connection with the Cross-Motions and \nseeks an order that narrows the issues for trial in the event that this case is not \nsummarily adjudicated based on the Cross -Motions.  In order for the Court to \nproperly undertake the process requested by NDCO, the Court entered a Briefing \nOrder on January 24, 2019 requiring NDCO to file a list of all material facts NDCO \ncontends exist without substantial controversy, with citations to the record.  (Briefing \nOrder ¶ 6(a), ECF No. 126 [“ Briefing Order”].)  The Briefing Order also required \nPFD/Trask to file any response to NDCO’s list of uncontroverted facts within twenty-\nthree (23) days setting forth whether they agreed with NDCO’s assessment of the \nuncontroverted facts, and if not, wh at PFD/Trask contend the record shows as to \nwhich material facts are actually and in good  faith controverted.  (Briefing Order ¶ \n6(b).)    \n4. Thereafter, on February 23, 2019, NDCO filed a Statement of \nUncontroverted Facts, (ECF No. 127), which cited to documents in the record that \nhad been stricken by the Court, ( see ECF No. 99).  The Court, the refore, entered a \nsubsequent order on March 11, 2019 requiring NDCO to refile on or before April 10, \n2019 a revised statement of uncontroverted facts with record citations to documents \nproperly before the Court.  (See ECF No. 134.)   \n5. In compliance with the  Court’s March 11, 2019 Order, on April 10, 2019, \nNDCO filed its Revised Statement of Uncontroverted Facts.  (ECF No. 136.)  On May \n7, 2019, PFD/Trask filed their Responses to NDCO LLC’s Revised Statement of \nUncontroverted Facts.  (ECF No. 137.)  After several delays, the Court held a hearing \n \n \non the Cross-Motions and the Rule 56(d) Motion on September 18, 2019, at which all \nparties were represented by counsel.  The 56(d) Motion is ripe for determination. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n6.  In the event that summary judgment is not rendered on a whole case, the \ntrial court may  nonetheless narrow the issues for trial  by setting forth in an order \nwhich material facts are undisputed in the record and therefore deemed established \nfor trial.  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(d).  Specifically, Rule 56(d) provides: \nIf on motion under this rule judgment is not rendered upon the whole \ncase or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at the \nhearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence \nbefore it and by interrogating counsel, shall if practicable ascertain what \nmaterial facts exist without substantial controversy and what material \nfacts are actually and in good faith controverted. It shall thereupon \nmake an order specifying the facts that appear wit hout substantial \ncontroversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or \nother relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings \nin the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified \nshall be deemed established.  \n \n7. Because Rule 56(d) is  triggered by the filing of a motion for summary \njudgment, and notwithstanding Rule 56(d)’s use of the term “without substantial \ncontroversy[,]” the normal summary judgment standards apply .  See State ex rel. \nEdmisten v. Challenge, Inc. , 71 N.C. App. 575, 579, 322 S.E.2d 658, 660 (1984)  \n(considering a motion brought pursuant to Rule 56(d) and stating that the burden is \non the moving party).  The purpose of Rule 56(d) “is to reduce the issues in a case to \navoid a protracted trial on undisputed facts[.]”  G. Gray Wilson, North Carolina Civil \nProcedure Vol. II, § 56-14 (3d ed. 2007).  Notwithstanding that the burden is on the \nmoving party to demonstrate which facts are uncontroverted , the nonmoving party \n \n \ncannot show that a  fact “is in good faith controverted” by a broad, declarative \nstatement to that effect without reference to the record.  See Challenge, Inc., 71 N.C. \nApp. at 579–80, 322 S.E.2d at 660–61.   \n8. Rule 56(d) is a rarely used device in our trial courts.  Wilson, supra, at § 56-\n14 (“[T]he procedure involved is so cumbersome that it is rarely utilized by the trial \nbench.  Trying to get counsel to concede areas of the case that are not in dispute is a \ndifficult if not unrealistic task.”)  As a result, there is very li ttle case law in North \nCarolina guiding the trial court as to the role it must play in deciding a motion under \nRule 56(d).   \n9. Nonetheless, at least one appellate court decision, State ex. rel. Edmisten v. \nChallenge, Inc., serves as a useful guide for a trial court confronted with a party’s \nrequest under Rule 56(d).  In Challenge, the plaintiff moved for  partial summary \njudgment on certain issues and also requested that the trial court ascertain what \nmaterial facts existed without substantial controversy under Rule 56(d).  Id. at 577–\n78, 322 S.E.2d at 659.  The trial court initially denied both motions but specified that \nthe denial of the Rule 56(d) motion was without prejudice.  Id. at 578, 322 S.E.2d at \n659.   \n10. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a written motion setting forth thirty-three (33) \nseparate material facts which it believed were uncontroverted.  Id.  At the hearing on \nthe motion, the defendant s asserted that twenty -one (21) of the plaintiff’s \n“uncontroverted” facts were actually in controversy but failed to provide explanation \nor record citations to support their position .  Id.  The trial court ordered the \n \n \ndefendants to supplement their response to the plaintiff’s motion with information as \nto which portions of  each matter they contended were converted.   Id. at 578, 322 \nS.E.2d at 660.  The defendants complied with the trial court’s order, and based upon \nthe information provided by the parties, the trial court entered an order finding that \nall statements of facts listed in the plaintiff’s Rule 56(d) motion were uncontroverted \nand deemed established for purposes of trial.  Id.   \n11. The Challenge defendants appealed, arguing , in part,  that the trial court \nerred by ordering the defendants to submit documents to the court rebutting the \nplaintiff’s list of uncontroverted facts.  Id. at 578–79, 322 S.E.2d at 660.  On appeal, \nthe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s ruling, concluding that, in order for the \ntrial judge to “perform his duty under Rule 56(d),” he properly asked the defendants \nto “come for th and provide the [trial] court information as to which portion of each \nmatter is in good faith controverted .”  Id. at 579, 322 S.E.2d at 660.  The Court of \nAppeals noted that the trial court’s directive did not require the defendants to assume \nany burden of proof or produce additional evidence, but merely gave the defendants \nan opportunity to further assert which facts were actually controverted, which in turn \nallowed the trial court to reach a rul ing consistent with Rule 56(d).  Id. at 579–80, \n322 S.E.2d at 660–61. \n12. Challenge therefore instructs that, under Rule 56(d), trial courts may order \na moving party to prepare a statement of uncontroverted facts, and thereafter provide \nthe nonmoving party an opportunity to respond to that statement .  The trial court \nthen has the benefit of the parties’ arguments as to any facts each side claims to be \n \n \nuncontroverted, thereby assisting the trial court in narrow ing the issues for trial, if \npossible.  \n13. The Court also finds instructive federal court treatment of Federal Rule \n56(g), which contains language similar to North Carolina Rule 56( d) and provides a \nsimilar opportunity for the court to narrow issues before trial.1  Federal Rule 56(g) \nprovides: “[i]f the cour t does not grant all the relief requested by the motion  [for \nsummary judgment], it may enter an order stating any material fact —including an \nitem of damages or other relief—that is not genuinely in dispute and treating the fact \nas established in the case.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(g).  \n14. The Advisory Committee  Notes on the 2010 Amendments to the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure make clear that this subsection: \napplies when the court does not grant all the relief requested by a motion \nfor summary judgment. It becom es relevant only after the court has \napplied the summary-judgment standard carried forward in subdivision \n(a) to each claim, defense, or part of a claim or defense, identified by the \nmotion. Once that duty is discharged, the court may decide whether to \napply the summary-judgment standard to dispose of a material fact that \nis not genuinely in dispute. \n[. . .] \nIf it is readily apparent that the court cannot grant all the relief \nrequested by the motion, it may properly decide that the cost of \ndetermining whether some potential fact disputes may be eliminated by \nsummary disposition is greater than the cost of resolving those disputes \nby other means, including trial. Even if the court believes that a fact is \nnot genuinely in dispute it may refrain from ordering t hat the fact be \ntreated as established. The court may conclude that it is better to leave \nopen for trial facts and issues that may be better illuminated by the trial \nof related facts that must be tried in any event. \n                                                 \n1 While this Court is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or their \ninterpretation, the North Carolina Court of Appeals has “long held that federal decisions \ninterpreting the federal rules [of Civil Procedure] are persuasive when interpreting similar \nstate rules.”  Tetra Tech Tesoro, Inc. v. JAAAT Tech. Servs., LLC, 250 N.C. App. 791, 797–98, \n794 S.E.2d 535, 539 (2016). \n \n \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(g), Notes of Advisory Committee on 2010 Amendments to Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure (Advisory Committee Notes) (emphasis added).   \n15. Federal Rule 56(g), like North Carolina Rule 56(d), “was intended to avoid \na useless trial of facts and issues over which there was never really any controversy \nand which would tend to confuse and complicate a lawsuit.”   Flexible Lifline Sys. v. \nTollenaere (In re Tollenaere), 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 4780, at *8 (Bankr. D.S.C. Oct. 10, \n2012) (quoting Lies v. Farrell Lines, Inc. , 641 F.2d 765, 769 n. 3 (9th Cir. 1981) ).  \nNotwithstanding this goal, the Committee Notes expressly contemplate that \nsometimes the costs associated with summary disposition may, in fact, be greater \nthan allowing the entire case to proceed to trial.  The refore, the decision whether to \ngrant relief pursuant to Federal Rule 56(g) is firmly within the trial court’s discretion. \n16. In light of these principles, the Court considers NDCO’s Rule 56(d) Motion \nunder a discretionary standard.  \nIII. ANALYSIS \n \n17. As an initial matter, the Court acknowledges that the Court’s consideration \nof the Rule 56(d) Motion only becomes necessary if the Court concludes that summary \njudgment is inappropriate.2  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(d) (“If on motion under this rule \njudgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is \nnecessary, the court . . . shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist without \n                                                 \n2 Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand admissions on file, together  with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \nissue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c). \n \n \nsubstantial controversy . . . .”).  In addition to the Court’s consideration of NDCO’s \nRule 56(d) Motion at the September 18, 2019 hearing in this matter, it also considered \nand heard oral argument from counsel on the Cross-Motions.   \n18. Based upon the briefs and materials submitted by the parties, the \narguments of counsel, and the matters of record properly considered by the Court on \nthe Cross-Motions brought pursuant to Rule 56, the Court concludes that there are \ngenuine issues of material fact as to each issue before the Court on the Cross-Motions, \nand therefore summary adjudication of any of the parties’ claims is inappropriate at \nthis time.  The Court intends to detail its reasoning and conclusions on the Cross -\nMotions in a separate order and opinion .  However, in the interests of judicial \nefficiency, the Court enters this Order and Opinion on the Rule 56(d) Motion to assist \ncounsel in their preparation for trial.     \n19. Upon receipt of NDCO’s Rule 56(d) Motion, the Court first gave NDCO, as \nthe movant, the opportunity to prepare a statement of facts that they contended \nexisted without controversy.  Thereafter, the Court gave PFD/Trask the opportunity \nto respond to NDCO’s statement of facts and supplement  the record where it \ndisagreed with NDCO’s recitation.  This procedure was implemented to assist the \nCourt in its understanding of what facts were considered to be “material” to the issues \npresented in this litigation and which of those material facts were not in good faith \ncontroverted.  \n20. The record in this case is voluminous.  Independent of their arguments on \nthe Cross-Motions, the parties submitted over 2,500 pages of documents f or the \n \n \nCourt’s consideration of the Rule 56(d) Motion.  NDCO’s Revised Statement of \nUncontroverted Facts contains a list of 239 purported facts with corresponding record \ncitations.  PFD/Trask provided a response to each of these facts, indicating where \nthey agreed with NDCO’s assessment and where they disagreed, with corresponding \nrecord citations in support of that contrary position.  The Court’s undertaking here, \ntherefore, is much more expansive than  the assessment of the thirty -three (33) \narguably disputed facts that were before the trial court in Challenge.  Nonetheless, \nthe Court considers each of NDCO’s 239 facts , and PFD/Trask’s responses thereto, \nand concludes that the following facts exist without substantial controversy.   In \nmaking these determinations, the Court does not find a fact to be uncontroverted if \nthe Court concludes there is cognizable evidence of record contrary to NDCO’s \ncontention.3  \nIV. MATERIAL FACTS THAT EXIST WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL \nCONTROVERSY4 \n \n21. Pender 1164 is a limited liability company, organized and existing under \nthe laws of the State of North Carolina,  that was created for the purpose of owning \nand developing 1,164 acres of real property in Pender County, North Carolina (the \n                                                 \n3 NDCO has also asked the Court to find as “uncontroverted” provisions  in various \nagreements between the parties and other related non-parties.  The Court declines to add the \ncontents or provisions of any agreement as an uncontroverted fact, as these documents speak \nfor themselves and, to the extent they are relevant to the issues and otherwise admissible, \nthe agreements may be introduced as exhibits at trial.   \n \n4 In an order on a motion for summary judgment, North Carolina law is clear that “the trial \ncould should not make findings of fact, which are decisions upon conflict ing evidence.”              \nA-S-P Associates v. Raleigh, 38 N.C. App. 271, 275, 247 S.E.2d 800, 803 (1978) (reversed on \nother grounds).  Instead, pursuant to Rule 56(d), the trial court is entitled to set forth a list \nof undisputed material facts.  Id. This list is limited, therefore, to those facts that the parties \nagree are uncontroverted or the record otherwise discloses are not in dispute.   \n \n \n“Pender 1164 Project”).  (Trask Aff. ¶ 5, ECF No. 43 .)  PFD and NDCO each own a \nfifty percent (50%) ownership interest in Pender 1164.  (Trask Aff. ¶ 5, ECF No. 43.)     \n22. Trask is a real estate developer in the Wilmington area.  (Trask Aff. ¶ 3, \nECF No. 43.)  His experience developing real estate began in 2005.  (Trask Dep. 11:9–\n13, ECF No. 110.10.)  Trask’s 2011 website advertised that Trask offered a “full range \nof development services,” including development, pro -formas, analysis, marketing, \nand rezoning.  (Trask Dep. 46:1–47:3, ECF No. 110.10.) \n23. With regard to what eventually became known as Pender 1164, Trask was \nfirst approached by Steven Shuttleworth (“Shuttleworth”) about being involved in a \ndevelopment project.  (Trask Dep. 66:25 –68:4, ECF No. 110.10.)  Shuttleworth had \nbeen a part of a group that had owned 1800 acres of property in Pender County, which \nconsisted of the 1164 acres now owned by Pender 1164.  (Shuttleworth Dep. 12:4–19, \nECF No. 100.11.) \n24. The property owned by Pender 1164 was more hydrologically complex than \nTrask’s previous projects.  (Trask Dep. 102:7–18, ECF No. 100.10.) \n25. Shuttleworth’s group had performed environmental assessments  on the \nproperty, with a belief at the time of the original master plan  that a total of 2400 \nunits/lots could be obtained from the 1800 acres.  (Shuttleworth Dep. 60:9–14, ECF \nNo. 100.11.)   \n26. Trask agreed to advance “soft costs” for the Pender 1164 Project .  (Trask \nDep. 71:22–72:9, ECF No. 100.10.)   \n \n \n27. During the “due diligence” period set forth in the Joint Venture Agreement, \nTrask realized that the costs of development would be more expensive than \nanticipated and he did not want to “pay any cash out of [his] pocket.”  (Trask Dep. \n69:5–71:23, ECF No. 100.10.)   \n28. Trask did not instruct Shuttleworth to inform Mike Cook or any member of \nthe Land Bank group that the structure of the deal had to change because of his \nbeliefs regarding increased costs.  (Trask Dep. 141:24–142:9, ECF No. 100.10.) \n29. There are no written communications in the  period after the execution of \nthe Joint Venture Agreement, and prior to the execution of either the original \nOperating Agreement or the Amended Operating Agreement, that demonstrates any \nbelief on Trask’s part that there were going to be significant incre ases in the \ndevelopment costs.  (See Trask Dep. 143–44, 148–49, ECF No. 100.10.)  \n30. Trask undertook a re design of the proposed project in the Spring of 2015.   \n(Trask Dep. 105:24–106:23, ECF No. 100.10.) \n31. When construction of the first phase was placed out f or bid, Trask was \ninformed that the cost of construction was “extremely high, say $10,000 a lot over \nwhat we needed to be.”  (Trask Dep. 106:7–13, ECF No. 100.10.) \n32.  Between the execution of the Amended Operating Agreement and 2015, no \nmention was made by T rask of any need for development financing.  ( Trask Dep. \n227:10–19, ECF No. 100.10.) \n33. Shuttleworth, after the execution of the Joint Venture Agreement and prior \nto the execution of the original Operating Agreement, had communicated with the \n \n \nLand Bank Group that the estimated development cost per lot was approximately \n$20,000.  (Shuttleworth Dep. 82:5–83:7, ECF No. 100.11.) \n34. The purpose of the Development Agreement, which was between PFD as \nDeveloper and Pender 1164 as Owner, and was signed by Trask, was to set forth \nPFD’s obligations under the Operating Agreement and is the “separate agreement” \nwith Pender 1164 referenced in the original Operating Agreement and Amended \nOperating Agreement.  (Trask Dep. 177:21 –178:6, ECF No. 100.10 ; Development \nAgreement, ECF No. 64.1.) \n35. Trask never provided NDCO with a copy of the Development Agreement \nuntil after the lawsuit was filed.  (Trask Dep. 178:19–22, ECF No. 100.10.) \n36. Trask provided a copy of the Development Agreement to prospective lenders \nfrom which PFD sought financing.  (Trask Dep. 180:1–17, ECF No. 100.10.) \n37. Trask instructed Shuttleworth to work with the owners of the adjacent 664 \nacres to incorporate that adjacent 664 acres into the Joint Venture.  (Trask Dep. \n124:3–12, ECF No. 100.10.) \n38. Shuttleworth sent an email to Mark Holm and Sandy Christian on August \n6, 2013, in which Shuttleworth explained his understanding of the concept under \nwhich Trask was then operating and attached both a letter addressed to Mark Holm \nand a “Joint Venture Overview.”  (Ex. C to NDCO’s List of Exhibits, ECF No. 64.3.) \n39. Trask was copied on Shuttleworth’s August 6, 2013 email.  (Ex. C. to \nNDCO’s List of Exhibits, ECF No. 64.3.) \n \n \n40. How the entitlement and development expenses were going to be paid was \na material provision of the Operating Agreement.  (Trask Dep. 125:8–14, ECF No. \n100.10.) \n41. Trask never made contact with Sandy Christian to correct anything that \nhad been represented by Shuttleworth in his August 6, 2013 email.  (Christian Dep. \n67:5–8, ECF No. 100.12.) \n42. After discussions with Trask  and receipt of the proposed Amended \nOperating Agreement, Mark Holm told Sandy Christian and her father, Al Eide, that \nhis understanding of the agreement was that the  land w ould be developed by a \ndeveloper, Trask Development.  As the property was developed and the property was \nsold, the developer would receive its costs back first, then the remaining net proceeds \nwould be paid fifty percent to the developer and fifty percent to the landowners.  \n(Holm Dep. 34:22–35:13, ECF No. 100.13.) \n43. Shuttleworth’s underst anding of the concept under which Trask was \noperating pursuant to the Operating Agreement was that Trask was to pay all the \ndevelopment and entitlement costs, be reimbursed for them, and then everything was \nto be split 50/50.  (Shuttleworth Dep. 86:1–5, ECF No. 100.11.) \n44. Trask never informed Sandy Christian that Trask/PFD would have no \nobligation to pay for any entitlement and development expenses .  (Christian Dep. \n70:12–19, ECF No. 100.12.)  \n45. From and after the execution of the Amended Operating Agreement  and \nuntil the Spring of 2016, Trask paid for the entitlement and development services \n \n \nand provided quarterly reports to NDCO.  ( See Quarterly Reports, Ex. H to NDCO’s \nIndex of Exhibits in Support of MSJs, ECF No. 100.9.)    \n46. No mention had been made in any  of the Quarterly Reports provided by \nTrask that moving forward with the development was contingent upon Trask being \nable to obtain a loan and secure that loan with as much of Pender 1164’s property as \na bank may require.  ( See Quarterly Reports, Ex. H to NDCO’s Index of Exhibits in \nSupport of MSJs, ECF No. 100.9.)    \n47. Trask considered moving the Waste Water Treatment Facility to an \nadjacent property.  (Trask Dep. 160:3–23, ECF No. 100.10.)   \n48. Trask represented to NDCO that there were liability and costs asso ciated \nwith the SGI ponds.  (Christian Dep. 43:25–44:6, ECF No. 100.12.) \n49. Trask’s understanding of the provisions of the Amended Operating \nAgreement allowed him to pursue other opportunities.  (Trask Dep. 153:3 –15, ECF \nNo. 100.10.)  \n50. Trask informed NDCO that  there was no cost recovery for the property \ntransferred to Pluris for the construction of the Waste Water Treatment Facility.  \n(Trask Aff. ¶ 42, ECF No. 43.) \n51. On April 28, 2015, Craig Muhl, on behalf of the Land Bank Group, gave \nTrask permission to make contact with Stockmens Bank in regard to the development \nloan.  (Ex. E to Alexander Aff., ECF No. 95.6.) \n \n \n52. On January 19, 2016, Trask emailed Rob ert M. Alexander at Stockmens \nBank about subordination.  (Ex. B to Muhl Aff., ECF No. 100.2 .)  That same day, \nRobert M. Alexander responded. (Ex. H to Alexander Aff., ECF No. 95.9.)      \n53. Trask informed South State Bank that he had been approached by a group \nof investors that had purchased the property owned by Pender 1164, and he had \npartnered together with them, and his responsibility was to develop the lots.  (Aiken \nDep. 66:5–19, ECF No. 100.14.) \n54. Trask informed South State Bank that the group offered Trask fifty percent \nownership in Pender 1164, provided that Trask develop the land and that South State \nBank, therefore, assumed that Trask had an obligation to develop the lan d in \nexchange for his fifty percent ownership.  (Aiken Dep. 88:4–89:24, ECF No. 100.14.) \n55. When Trask sought a loan from South State Bank, he mad e the specific \nrequest that the borrower be PFD.  (Ex. C to NDCO’s Index of Exhibits in Support of \nMSJs, ECF No. 100.4.) \n56. Trask informed South State Bank that the Stockmens Bank would not \nagree to be paid after South State Bank was paid in full.   (Aiken Dep. 90:12–92:11, \nECF No. 100.14.) \n57. Regardless of that knowledge, the South State Bank commitment letter was \ngoing to require that to be the case.  (Aiken Dep. 92:21–22, ECF No. 100.14.) \n58. On April 27, 2016, Mike Cook informed Trask that the commitment letter \nrequired South State Bank to receive all proceeds until paid in full prior to Stockmens \nBank’s receipt of anything and informed Trask that he did not see how Stockmens  \n \n \nBank would sign off on this arrangement.  (Ex. 23 to PFD/Trask’s Index of Exhibits \nin Support of their MSJ, ECF No. 92.23.)   \n59. In the spring of 201 6, Trask had a telephone conversation with Sandy \nChristian and Mark Holm about the South State Bank loan proposal.  (Christian Dep. \n72:14–73:6.) \n60. South State Bank required an appraisal with a maximum appraised value \nof sixty-five percent loan to value for its loan.  (Aiken Dep. 35:13–14, ECF No. 100.14.) \n61. South State Bank knew that the proposed Blake Farm project was the \nlargest single-family residential project that Trask had been involved in, which was \none of the reasons it required Raiford Trask, Jr.  to guarantee the loan.  (Aiken Dep. \n43:1–13, ECF No. 100.14.) \n62. There is no mention in any agreement with NDCO of any requirement that \nStockmens Bank subordinate the lien of its Deed of Trust .  (Trask Dep. 76:24–78:3, \nECF No. 100.10.) \n63. On June 16, 2016, Trask submitted a letter to Mike Cook  regarding the \nPender 1164 Project.  (Ex E. to Compl., ECF No. 2.) \n64. Trask could have obtained financing for PFD without using Pender 1164’s \nproperty as collateral, but Trask stated it was “outside of our risk/earnings ratio to  \ndo so.”  (Ex. F to Compl., ECF No. 2.) \n65. The cost-sharing associated with the construction of Blake Farm Boulevard \nwas a source of disagreement between Trask, Mike Cook, and Sandy Christian. \n(Trask Dep. 27:4–18, ECF No. 100.10.) \n \n \n66. For approximately one year a fter the declaration of the deadlock, Trask \nkept developing the property owned by Pender 1164.  (Trask Dep. 165:13 –16, ECF \nNo. 100.10.) \n67. After Trask’s declaration of a deadlock, beginning in October of 2016, Trask \nsought financing from Bank of North Carolina.  (Williard Dep. 47:10–48:11, ECF No. \n100.15.)  \n68. Trask informed Bank of North Carolina that he was seeking a loan to \ndevelop 88 lots, 50 undeveloped lots, and Blake Farm Boulevard . (Williard Dep. \n59:10–16, ECF No. 100.15.) \n69. Trask provided construction budg ets, and those budget projections \nappeared to be reasonable to Christopher Williard.  (Williard Dep. 138:22 –25, ECF \nNo. 100.15.) \n70. Trask informed Christopher Williard of NDCO’s problem with Bank of \nNorth Carolina’s collateral requirements .  (Williard Dep. 59 :23–60:6, ECF No. \n100.15.) \n71. Christopher Williard was aware that NDCO had problems with there being \nno cost -sharing of Blake Farm Boulevard.  (Williard Dep. 59:23 –60:6, ECF No. \n100.15.) \n72. The proposal provided by Bank of North Carolina required 139 acres of \ncollateral, more than the area that would be under development.  (Williard Dep. 80:6–\n13, ECF No. 100.15.) \n \n \n73. On or about October 31, 2016, Bank of North Carolina provided a loan term \nsheet naming PFD (not Pender 1164) as the borrower.  (Williard Dep. 81:12–14, ECF \nNo. 100.15.) \n74. As of October 31, 2016 , Trask/PFD had $555,027.00 in entitlement and \ndevelopment expenses advanced on the Pender 1164 Project.  (Williard Dep. 97:13 –\n19, ECF No. 100.15.) \n75. Bank of North Carolina’s primary source of repayment for a loan was to be \nPender 1164’s property and the sale thereof, and not the resources of Trask, as a \nborrower.  (Williard Dep. 106:4–22, ECF No. 100.15.) \n76. Trask has never contributed the property that comprises the access to \nPender 1164, but  stated that it was a value secured for the benefit of Pender 1164.  \n(Trask Dep. 130:7–131:7, ECF No. 100.10.) \n77. The access to Pender 1164 is not currently a capital contribution of PFD.  \n(Trask Dep. 130:10–12, ECF No. 100.10.) \nV.      CONCLUSION \n78. THEREFORE, based upon the Court’s exercise  of the mandate of Rule \n56(d), and without determining their relevance or admissibility, the foregoing \nmaterial facts exist without substantial controversy  and are deemed established for \npurposes of the trial of this matter .  Except as expressly set forth above, all other \npurported material facts are actually and in good faith controverted.    \n \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 6th day of November, 2019.   \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n \n "
