THIS MATTER is before the Court on the filing of Defendant Trustees of \nGaston College’s (“Defendant” or “Gaston College” ) Motions to Dismiss Amended \nComplaint (the “Motions”) in three related but unconsolidated actions.  The Motions \nwere filed in the following three cases: Vernon v. Trustees of Gaston College , \n(23 CVS 3059; Gaston Cnty. ) (the “Vernon Action”), ( Vernon, ECF No. 29 [“Vernon \nMot.”]); Archie v. Trustees of Gaston College, (23 CVS 3149; Gaston Cnty.) (the “Archie \nAction”), ( Archie, ECF No. 18 [“Archie Mot.”]); and Eppes v. Trustees of Gaston \nCollege, (23 CVS 3383; Gaston Cnty.) (the “Eppes Action” ; with the Vernon Action \nand Archie Action, the “Actions”), (Eppes, ECF No. 17 [“Eppes Mot.”]).1 \n2. Pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of \nCivil Procedure (the “Rule(s)”), Defendant seeks dismissal of each of the three actions \nin their entirety.  Because the Motions raise the same legal issues an d similar legal \narguments, the Court considers the Motions together. \n3.

This action arises out of a reported data breach in 2023 at Gaston College, \na North Carolina higher education institution.  As a result of the data breach incident, \nthe named plaintiffs ’ private information was potentially compromised.  Following \ntheir respective receipt of data breach notice letters from Gaston College, the named \nplaintiffs each separately initiated a purported class action lawsuit to recover  from \nthe college for its alleged failure to safeguard confidential personal information. \n5. The Motions presently pending  before the Court raise fundamental issues \nregarding whether the three related cases may proceed in this Court, given concerns \nabout sovereign immunity and whether Defendant waived that immunity.  \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n6. The Court does not make findings of fact on the Motions.  Rather, the Court \nrecites the allegations asserted in the  Amended Complaints that are relevant to the \nCourt’s determination of the Motions. \nA. The Parties \n7. Plaintiff Chasity Vernon (“Vernon”) is an individual resident of this State.  \n(Vernon, First Am. Verified Compl. ¶ 17, ECF No. 22 [“Vernon, Am. Compl.”].) \n8. Plaintiff Ludenia Archie (“Archie”) is a n individual  resident of Shelby, \nNorth Carolina.  ( Archie, First Am. Class Action Compl. ¶  15, ECF No. 8 [“ Archie, \nAm. Compl.”].) \n9. Plaintiff Shaquasia Eppes (“Eppes”; with Vernon and Archie, “Plaintiffs”)  \nis an individual resident of Dallas, North Carolina .  (Eppes, First Am. Class Action \nCompl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 12 [“Eppes, Am. Compl.”].) \n10. Plaintiffs are each former Gaston College  students.  ( See Vernon , Am. \nCompl. ¶ 78; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 16; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6, 47.) \n11. Defendant is a higher education institution—a public community college—\nwith its principal place of business at 201 Highway U.S. 321 South in Dallas, North \nCarolina.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶  18, 22; see Archie, Am. Compl. ¶  31; Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 7.) \nB. Defendant’s Website and Alleged Purchase of Insurance \n12. Plaintiffs each allege that Defendant maintains a website, \nhttp://www.gaston.edu, which includes a privacy policy.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25–\n26; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 52–53; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 16–17.)  The privacy policy \nstates that it “governs the manner in which Gaston College collects, uses, maintains \nand discloses information collected from users” of the website and “applies to the Site \nand all products and services offered by Gaston College.”  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶ 26; \nArchie, Am. Compl. ¶ 53; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶ 17.) \n13. Plaintiffs allege that t he privacy policy informs website users of the \nfollowing: \nWe may collect personal identification information from Users in a \nvariety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Site, \nor fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, \nfeatures or resources we make available on our Site.  Users may be \nasked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone \nnumber, credit card information, and social security number. \n \n(Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  26; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶  53; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶  17.)  The \nprivacy policy further states that,  \n[b]y using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this policy.  If you do \nnot agree to this policy, please do not use our Site.   Your continued use \nof the Site following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed \nyour acceptance of those changes. \n \n(Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶ 26; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 53; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶ 17.)  \n14. Plaintiffs allege that the privacy policy further states, “[w]e [Gaston] adopt \nappropriate data collection, storage and processing practices, and security measures \nto protect  against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of \npersonal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored \non our  Site.”  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶ 27; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶  54; Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 18.) \n15. Plaintiffs each allege that Defendant assumed “legal and equitable duties” \nby obtaining, collecting, using, and deriving a benefit from Plaintiffs’ private \ninformation and that Defendant knew or should have known that it was responsible \nfor protecting that information from unauthorized disclosure.  (Vernon, Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 29, 52; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 56, 71, 79; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶ 21.) \n16. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant purchased a cybersecurity \ninsurance policy.  ( Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  31; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶  58; Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 45.)  Based on the Minutes of the Gaston College Board of Trustees Meeting \ndated 23 January 2023, attached to each of the Amended Complaints, Plaintiffs allege \non information and belief that the insurance policy covers the claims brought by them \nin the  Actions.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  31; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶  58; Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 45.) \nC. The Data Breach at Issue \n17. Plaintiffs each allege that Gaston College suffered an unauthorized access \nto its computer syste ms in February 2023.  ( Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  80; Archie, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 60; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶  11.)  Gaston College allegedly became aware of \nsuspicious activity within its compute r systems on 22 February 2023 and, after an \ninvestigation, determined that an unauthorized party accessed certain sensitive files \nbetween 21–22 February 2023 (the “Data Breach”).  ( Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 5, 33; \nArchie, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4, 60; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3, 11.)  \n18. Plaintiffs each further allege that on or about 26 August 2023 they received \na Notice of Security Incident letter (the “Notice(s)”) from Defendant informing them \nof the Data Breach.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶ 79; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 20; Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 51, Ex. 1.)  The Notices informed Plaintiffs that their private information \nwas compromised during the Data Breach.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  79; Archie, Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 20, 63; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, 51.) \n19. Vernon was informed that her “name, Social Security number, driver’s or \nstate license number, date of birth [,] student record information, and student \nidentification number[,]” was compromised.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶ 79.)  Defendant \noffered Vernon one year of free credit monitoring services in the Notice.  (Vernon, Am. \nCompl. ¶  81.)  As a result of the incident, Vernon alleges that she “anticipates \nspending considerable time and money on an ongoing basis to try to mitigate and \naddress the many harms caused by the Data Breach.”  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶ 91.) \n20. Archie was  similarly informed that her  “name, Social Security number, \nstudent record information, and student identification number,” was compromised in \nthe Data Breach.  (Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 20.)  Archie alleges that she was also offered \none year of free credit monitoring services.  (Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 22.)  As a result of \nthe Data Breach, Archie alleges that she has spent considerable time verifying the \nlegitimacy and impact of the breach, exploring credit monitoring and identify theft \ninsurance options, self -monitoring her accounts with heightened scrutiny, and \nseeking legal counsel regarding her options for remedying or mitigating the effects of \nthe Data Breach.  (Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 24.)  Archie contends that she lost the benefit \nof the bargain she made with Defendant because she “overpaid for services that were \nintended to be accompanied by adequate dat a security but were not.”  ( Archie, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 27.) \n21. Eppes was informed  that her personal identifying information “was \nimproperly accessed and obtained by unauthorized third parties.”  ( Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 51.)  Eppes alleges that  she signed up for the one-year credit monitoring \nservice offered by Defendant in the Notice and obtained a credit report from Equifax.  \n(Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶ 52.)  Eppes is continuing to analyze other options and alleges \nthat she has spent significant time dealing with the aftermath of the Data Breach.  \n(Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶ 52.) \n22. Plaintiffs each allege that Defendant breached its obligations owed to them \nby negligently and recklessly failing to properly maintain and safeguard Plaintiffs’ \nprivate information stored in Defendant’s computer and network  systems.  (Vernon, \nAm. Compl. ¶¶  53–54; see Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 9, 93 –94; Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 30, 32.) \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n23. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motions. \n24. The Vernon Action was initiated on 8 September 2023 on the filing of the \nComplaint, (Vernon, ECF No. 3), and was designated and assigned to the undersigned \non 13 October 2023 , (Vernon, ECF Nos. 1 –2).  On 12 November 2023, Defendant \nmoved to dismiss the Complaint.  (Vernon, ECF No. 15.)   \n25. On 5 December 2023, Vernon filed the First  Amended Class Action \nComplaint (“Vernon Amended Complaint”) as of right.   (See Vernon, Am. Comp l.)  \nDefendant subsequently filed its Motion to Dismiss the Vernon Amended Complaint \non 22 December 2023, seeking dismissal of the Vernon Action in full.  ( See Vernon, \nMot.) \n26. The Archie Action was initiated on 15 September 2023 with the filing of the \nComplaint, (Archie, ECF No. 3), and was designated and assigned to the undersigned \non 27 October 2023, (Archie, ECF Nos. 1–2).  On 16 November 2023, Defendant moved \nto dismiss Archie’s Complaint.  (Archie, ECF No. 6.) \n27. On 7 December 2023, Archie filed her First Amended Complaint (“Archie \nAmended Complaint”) as of right.  (See Archie, Am. Compl.)  Defendant subsequently \nfiled its Motion to Dismiss the Archie Amended Complaint  on 5 January 2024.  (See \nArchie, Mot.) \n28. The Eppes Action was the last -filed action with the Complaint being filed \non 4 October 2023  and one month thereafter was designated and assigned to the \nundersigned.  (Eppes, ECF Nos. 1–3.) \n29. As in the Vernon Action and the Archie Action, when Defendant moved to \ndismiss Eppes’s Complaint, (Eppes, ECF No. 6), Eppes filed the First Amended Class \nAction Complaint  (“Eppes Amended Complaint ”; with the Vernon Amended \nComplaint and Eppes Amended Complaint, the “Amended Complaints”) as of right \non 14 December 2023, (Eppes, Am. Compl.).  Defendant subsequently filed its Motion \nto Dismiss the Eppes Amended Complaint on 16 January 2024.  (Eppes, Mot.) \n30. In each of the Actions, Plaintiffs allege claims for: (1) breach of contract ;2 \n(2) breach of implied contract;3 and (3) unjust enrichment.4  In addition to those three \ncore claims, Archie and Vernon each allege claims for negligence and negligence per \nse.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 158–93; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 95–121, 133–45.)  Eppes \nalleges additional claims for declaratory judgment and violation of the North Carolina \nUnfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 et seq. (“UDTPA”).  (See \nEppes, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 104–24.) \n31. The Motions were filed in December 2023 and January 2024.  Following full \nbriefing on the Motions, the Court held a hearing on the Motions on 17 April 2024 at \nwhich all parties in the Actions were represented through counsel.  ( Vernon, ECF \nNo. 38; Archie, ECF No. 27; Eppes, ECF No. 26.) \n32. The Motions are now ripe for resolution. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n33. Defendant brings the Motions under Rules 12(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6), and, \nas noted above, seeks dismissal of the Actions based largely on its sovereign immunity \ndefense. \n34. “In North Carolina, the appropriate rule for consideration of a motion to \ndismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity is somewhat unsettled.”  Johnson Bros. \n \n2 (See Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶  122–32; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶¶  146–56; Eppes, Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 76–86.) \n \n3 (See Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶  133–45; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶¶  122–32; Eppes, Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 87–94.) \n \n4 (See Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶  146–57; Archie, Am. Compl. ¶¶  157–66; Eppes, Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 95–103.) \nCorp. v. City of Charlotte , 2024 NCBC LEXIS 32 , at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, \n2024) (citations omitted).  “Our Court of Appeals, however, recently determined that \n‘[issues of sovereign immunity] should be classified as [issues] of personal jurisdiction \nunder Rule 12(b)(2).’ ”  Id. at *11 (modifications in original) (quoting Torres v. City of \nRaleigh, 288 N.C. App. 617, 620 (2023)).  The Court therefore construes the Motions \nfor dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds as an issue of personal jurisdiction \nunder Rule 12(b)(2) and applies the appropriate standard of review for motions under \nthat Rule. \n35. Where, like here,  \nneither party submits evidence [on personal jurisdiction], the \nallegations of the complaint must disclose jurisdiction although the \nparticulars of jurisdiction need not be alleged.  The trial judge must \ndecide whether the complaint contains allegations that, if taken as true, \nset forth a sufficient basis for the court ’s exercise of personal \njurisdiction. \n \nParker v. Town of Erwin , 243 N.C. App. 84, 96  (2015) (cleaned up) (quoting Banc of \nAm. Sec., LLC v. Evergreen Int’l Aviation, Inc., 169 N.C. App. 690, 693–94 (2005)). \n36. To the extent Defendant seeks dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds \nunder Rule 12(b)(6), the standard of review is the same as the analysis the Court \nconducts under Rule 12(b)(2)  when neither party presents evidence of personal \njurisdiction.  See Atl. Coast Conf. v. Clemson Univ. , 2024 NCBC LEXIS 92 , at **11 \nn.45 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 10, 2024) ; see also Farmer v. Troy Univ. , 382 N.C. 366, \n369–70 (2022) (reviewing a motion to dismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity \nunder Rules 12(b)(2) and (b)(6)). \n37. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \nreviews the allegations in the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs.  See Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, Inc., 370 N.C. 1, 5 (2017).  The \nCourt’s inquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint .  . . \nare sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal \ntheory[.]”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. 669, 670  (1987).  The Court \naccepts all well -pleaded factual allegations in the relevant pleading as true.  See \nKrawiec v. Manly, 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018). \n38. Our Supreme Court has observed that “[i]t is well -established that \ndismissal pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6) is proper when ‘(1)  the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals \nthe absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3)  the complaint discloses \nsome fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.’  ”  Corwin v. British Am. \nTobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoting Wood v. Guilford Cnty., 355 N.C. 161, \n166 (2002)). \nV. ANALYSIS \n39. There are three general issues that the Court must consider in its \ndetermination of the Motions: (1) does Defendant have sovereign immunity protecting \nit from potential liability for the wrongdoing alleged by Plaintiffs; (2) if so, was there \na waiver of that immunity in whole or in part; and (3) if there has been a waiver, have \nPlaintiffs sufficiently stated a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  The Court addresses \neach of these issues in turn. \nA. Sovereign Immunity \n40. Defendant argues that, as a public institution, it is entitled to sovereign \nimmunity from suit absent a finding of waiver by this Court.  ( Vernon, Br. Supp. \nMot. 8–9, ECF No. 30 [“Vernon, Br. Supp.”]; Archie, Br. Supp. Mot. 8–9, ECF No. 19 \n[“Archie, Br. Supp.”]; Eppes, Br. Supp. Mot. 8–9, ECF No. 18 [“Eppes, Br. Supp.”].)  \nPlaintiffs generally do not dispute that , as a general proposition,  Defendant is \nentitled to sovereign immunity because it is a public institution.  (Vernon, Br. Opp’n \nMot. 3, ECF No. 34 [“ Vernon, Br. Opp.”]; Archie, Br. Opp’n Mot. 3, ECF No.  23 \n[“Archie, Br. Opp.”]; Eppes, Br Opp’n Mot. 3, ECF No. 22 [“Eppes, Br. Opp.”].) \n41. “It is a fundamental rule of law that the State is immune from suit unless \nit expressly consents to be sued[,]” Zimmer v. N.C. Dep’t of Transp., 87 N.C. App. 132, \n134 (1987) (citation omitted), “or upon its waiver of immunity, and that this immunity \nis absolute and unqualified ,” Guthrie v. N.C. State Ports Auths ., 307 N.C. 522, 534 \n(1983) (emphasis in original). \n42. Here, Plaintiffs’ allegations in the  Amended Complaint s admit that \nDefendant is a public education institution.  (See Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  22; Archie, \nAm. Compl. ¶  49; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶  7.)  As a result, the Court determines that \nGaston College is a state institution entitled to immunity from suit unless it expressly \nor impliedly consents to suit or otherwise waive s this immunity.  See Chastain v. \nArndt, 253 N.C. App. 8, 13–15 (2017) (treating Gaston College and its governing body, \nthe Board of Trustees, as entitled to sovereign immunity).  \nB. Waiver of Immunity \n43. The parties dispute (1) whether Gaston College waived sovereign immunity \nor otherwise consented to suit, and (2) if there was waiver, the scope of such waiver.  \nThe Court addresses each issue in turn below.  \n1. Unjust Enrichment  \n44. Before more fully addressing the parties’ waiver arguments, the Court first \nbriefly addresses Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment  claims.  Plaintiffs argue that their \nclaims are based upon a contract implied in law .  (Vernon, Br. Opp. 10; Archie, Br. \nOpp. 9; Eppes, Br. Opp. 10 .)  Defendant contends that the  State has sovereign \nimmunity from such a claim .  (Vernon, Br. Supp. 13 –14; Archie, Br. Supp. 13–14; \nEppes, Br. Supp. 13–14.) \n45. Defendant is correct.  Unjust enrichment, a claim “based upon a quasi \ncontract or a contract implied in law[,]” is not based upon an actual agreement.  Paul \nL. Whitfield, P.A. v. Gilchrist , 348 N.C. 39 , 42 (1998).  “Only in the absence of an \nexpress agreement of the parties will courts impose a quasi contract or a contract \nimplied in law in order to prevent an unjust enrichment.  We will not imply a contract \nin law in derogation of sovereign immunity. ”  Id. (citation omitted).   An unjust \nenrichment claim alleged against an arm of the State is barred by sovereign \nimmunity, Eastway Wrecker Serv. v. City of Charlotte, 165 N.C. App. 639, 643 (2004), \nbecause the State only waives its immunity when it expressly enters into a valid \ncontract, Smith v. State, 289 N.C. 303, 320 (1976). \n46. The Court therefore GRANTS in part the Motions and DISMISSES \nPlaintiffs’ respective claims for unjust enrichment with prejudice. \n2. The UDTPA Claim \n47. The Court also observes that Eppes alleges a claim for  violation of the  \nUDTPA.  The UDTPA applies only to claims against a “person, firm, or corporation[.]”  \nN.C.G.S. § 75-16.  State institutions are creatures of the sovereign and, as such, are \nneither a “person, firm, [n]or corporation” under the UDTPA.  See Sperry Corp. v. \nPatterson, 73 N.C. App. 123, 125 (1985) (“The consumer protection and antitrust laws \nof Chapter 75 of the General Statutes do not create a cause of action against the State, \nregardless of whether sovereign immunity may exist.”).). \n48. Eppes has not stated a claim against the State for which relief may be \ngranted.  The Court therefor e GRANTS in part the Motions and DISMISSES \nEppes’s claim for violation of the UDTPA with prejudice. \n3. Waiver by the State Tort Claims Act \n49. The State Tort Claims Act, N.C.G.S. §  143-291 et seq., is one example of a \npermitted and intentional waiver of sovereign immunity .  Through its enactment, \n“the General Assembly partially waived the sovereign immunity of the State to the \nextent that it consented that the State could be sued for injuries”  arising out of the \nState’s negligence.  Zimmer v. N.C. Dep’t of Transp. , 87 N.C. App. 132, 134 (1987).  \nHowever, it is well -settled that “[j]urisdiction to hear such claims [is] vested in the \nIndustrial Commission.”  Id.; Guthrie, 307 N.C. at 536. \n50. Archie and Vernon each allege claims for negligence and negligence per se.  \nFurther, Eppes’s claim for declaratory judgment sounds in tortious conduct—namely \nthat Defendant owed her a legal duty and that it breached that duty by failing to \nemploy reasonable measures for data security.  (Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 108, 113.) \n51. All tort claims against North Carolina community colleges are subject to \nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the North Carolina Industrial Commission, as expressly \nprovided in the Sta te Tort Claims Act .  See N.C.G.S. § 143-291(a) (“Community \ncolleges and technical colleges shall be deemed State agencies for purposes of this \nArticle.”). \n52. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s purchase of insurance pursuant to \nN.C.G.S. §  115D-24 indicated acknowledgement of potential liability and  that \nDefendant is  therefore precluded from raising a sovereign immunity defense.  \n(Vernon, Br. Opp . 2–4; Archie, Br. Opp. 6–7; Eppes, Br. Opp. 2, 7–9.)  However, a \nwaiver analysis on the basis of the purchase of insurance is irrelevant as to Plaintiffs’ \ntort claims because this Court lacks jurisdiction over those claims, Chastain, 253 N.C. \nApp. at 14–15, and they must proceed in the North Carolina Industrial Commission. \n53. Therefore, as to Plaintiffs’ tort claims, including the claims for negligence, \nnegligence per se, and declaratory judgment, the Court hereby GRANTS in part the \nMotions and those claims are hereby DISMISSED without prejudice so that \nPlaintiffs may bring those claims in the Industrial Commission, as appropriate. \n4. Waiver by Contract: The Breach of Contract Claims \n54. The remaining claims for consideration are Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of \ncontract and alternative claims for breach of implied in fact contract. \n55. Defendant argues that the contract claims fail as a matter of law.  ( See \nVernon, Br. Supp. 15; Archie, Br. Supp. 15; Eppes, Br. Supp. 17.)  Defendant contends \nthat the breach of contract claims are simply negligence claims in disguise and that \nPlaintiffs’ allegations in the Amended Complaints are conclusory and fail to plead the \nexistence of a valid contract.  (See Vernon, Br. Supp. 15–22; Archie, Br. Supp. 15–22; \nEppes, Br. Supp. 17–25.) \n56. In response, Plaintiffs contend that  they have sufficiently  alleged the \nrequired elements for breach of an express and  implied contract.  ( See Vernon, Br. \nOpp. 11–17; Archie, Br. Opp. 10–14; Eppes, Br. Opp. 11–16.)  \n57. When the State “ ‘enters into a valid contract, [it] implicitly consents to be \nsued for damages on the contract in the event [that] it breaches . . . .’ ”  Gilchrist, 348 \nN.C. at 42 (quoting Smith, 289 N.C. at 320). \n58. The Court considers Plaintiffs’ breach of contract and breach of implied in \nfact contract claims separately. \ni. Breach of Express Contract \n59. “The elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) [the] existence of a \nvalid contract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. \nApp. 19, 26 (2000) (citation omitted).  “As our Court of Appeals has noted, ‘[o]ur \nsystem of notice pleading means the bar to plead a valid contract is low.’ ”  Atl. Coast \nConf. v. Bd. of Trs. of Fla. State Univ., 2024 NCBC LEXIS 53, at **48 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Apr. 4, 2024) (modification in original) (quoting Lannan v. Bd. of Governors of \nUniv. of N.C., 285 N.C. App. 574, 596 (2022), writ allowed, 384 N.C. 37 (2023)). \n60. Here, Plaintiffs ’ allegations are substantially similar , if not near ly \nidentical, with respect to their breach of contract claims.  Plaintiffs allege that they \neach entered into a valid and enforceable contract through which they paid money to \nDefendant in exchange for services .  ( Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  123; Archie, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 147; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶  77 (specifying that the agreement was “for \neducational and other services”).)  Plaintiffs further allege that the contract included \npromises by Defendant to secure, safeguard, and not disclose Plaintiff s’ personal \nidentifying or private information.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  123; Archie, Am. \nCompl. ¶ 147; Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶ 77.) \n61. Consistent with our State’s caselaw concerning the relative ease of pleading \na claim for breach of contract, Plaintiffs’ allegations are enough to sufficiently plead \nthe existence of an express contract. \n62. Plaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged breaches of that contract.  Plaintiffs \nallege that Defendant did not secure, safeguard , and/or keep private Plaintiff s’ \nprivate information, \"and therefore Defendant breached its contracts with Plaintiff[s] \n. . . .”  ( Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  127; see also Archie, Am. Compl. ¶  151; Eppes, Am. \nCompl. ¶  81.)  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant, “allowed third parties to \naccess, copy, and/or exfiltrate Plaintiff [s’] . . . Private Information without \npermission.  Therefore, [Defendant] breached the Privacy Policy with \nPlaintiff[s] . . . .”  ( Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶  128; see also  Archie, Am. Compl. ¶  152; \nEppes, Am. Compl. ¶ 82.) \n63. As a result, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that they had a contract with \nDefendant Gaston College and that Defendant breached that contract.  The Motions \nare therefore DENIED as to Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of express contract. \nii. Breach of Implied in Fact Contract \n64. In the alternative, Plaintiffs also alleged claims for breach of implied \ncontract.  To plead breach of an implied in fact contract, Plaintiffs must allege  offer, \nacceptance, and consideration.  Lannan, 285 N.C. App. at 596–97.  “A valid contract \nmay be implied in light of the conduct of the parties and under circumstances that \nmake it reasonable to presume the parties intended to contract with each other.”  Se. \nCaissons, LLC v. Choate Constr. Co., 247 N.C. App. 104, 113 (2016) (cleaned up); Atl. \nCoast Conf., 2024 NCBC LEXIS 53, at **53–54.  This requires a consideration of “the \ncircumstances, conduct, acts or relations of the parties, showing a tacit \nunderstanding.”  Lannan, 285 N.C. App. at 592. \n65. Plaintiffs fail to allege one or more of the required elements for breach of \nan implied in fact contract. \n66. Vernon alleges that, through the provision of higher learning and \neducational services, Defendant “knew or should have known” that it must protect \nVernon’s private information.  (Vernon, Am. Compl. ¶¶  135–36.)  However, t his \nallegation does not describe an offer and Vernon does not specify what the offer was.  \nWhile Vernon goes on to adequately plead acceptance and consideration, ( Vernon, \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 137–38), she cannot overcome her failure to adequately plead an offer \nfrom Defendant.  To be clear, while Vernon alleges that she intended and understood \nthat Defendant would adequately safeguard her information, she wholly fails to \nallege that Defendant understood or offered the same.  Thus, Vernon has failed to \nallege an unspoken or implicit understanding. \n67. Next, Eppes generally alleges that she provided her personal information \nto Defendant and thus entered into an implied contract whereby Defendant agreed \nto safeguard that information and notify Eppes if her data was breached or otherwise \ncompromised.  ( Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶  88.)  Eppes fails to specify that there was an \noffer and an acceptance of that offer.   Thus, even reading this in the light most \nfavorable to her, it is not clear to the Court what precisely Eppes offered to Defendant \nwhereby it agreed to safeguard her information.   Eppes also alleges that “Gaston \n[College] required Plaintiff . . . to provide and entrust [her private information] as a \ncondition of obtaining services.”  ( Eppes, Am. Compl. ¶  90.)  These allegations, even \nread in the light most favorable to Eppes, are not enough.   The Court is unable to \nparse out what the offer was, who made that offer, and who may have accepted that \noffer. Thus, Eppes has failed to allege a tacit understanding because the Court cannot \ndetermine what the understood terms of the agreement are.  \n68. Finally, Archie alleges that  “through its course of conduct,”  she and \nDefendant entered into an implied contract.  (Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 123.)  She alleges \nthat Defendant solicited and invited her to provide her personal identifying \ninformation to Defendant and that Archie accepted that offer and provided her \ninformation to Defendant.  (Archie, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 125–26.)  Archie has not, however, \npleaded consideration.  The closest allegation that the Court could locate was Archie’s \nallegation that she provided her information to Defendant in exchange for its \nprotection.  (Archie, Am. Compl. ¶ 129.)  This is not valid consideration, as there has \nbeen no exchange of promises  or value , and it would not pass even the lenient \nstandard announced in Lannan. \n69. The Court  therefore GRANTS in part  the Motion s and DISMISSES \nPlaintiffs’ breach of implied in fact contract claims with prejudice.5 \nVI. CONCLUSION \n70. THEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS in \npart and DENIES in part the Motions as follows: \na. The Motions are GRANTED in part as to Plaintiffs’ claims for unjust \nenrichment and breach of implied in fact contract.  Those claims are \nDISMISSED with prejudice.  The Motions are further GRANTED in part \nas to Eppes’s UDTPA claim and that claim is DISMISSED with prejudice. \nb. The Motions are GRANTED in part as to Plaintiffs’ claims for  \nnegligence, negligence per se, and declaratory judgment.  As a result, those \nclaims are DISMISSED without prejudice to their refiling with the North \nCarolina Industrial Commission. \n \n5 Notwithstanding the Court’s conclusions that this claim should be dismissed, “[t]he decision \nto dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the discretion of the trial court[.]”  First \nFed. Bank v. Aldridge, 230 N.C. App. 187, 191 (2013).   The Court concludes, in the exercise \nof its discretion, that dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of implied in fact should be \nwith prejudice. \nc. The Motions are otherwise  DENIED, leaving only Plaintiffs ’ \nrespective claims for  breach of express contract  to proceed through \ndiscovery. \n71. As a result, the Court hereby lifts the stay on case management in the \nActions.  The parties’ counsel shall conduct a Case Management Meeting , pursuant \nto Business Court Rule 9,  on or before 20 September 2024  and file their Case \nManagement Report within fifteen days thereafter. \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 21st day of August, 2024. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
