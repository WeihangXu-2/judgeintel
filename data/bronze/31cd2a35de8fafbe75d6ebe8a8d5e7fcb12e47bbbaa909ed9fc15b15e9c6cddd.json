Siskey. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n3. This dispute arises out of an alleged fraudulent scheme carried out by \nRichard C. Siskey (“Siskey”) with the assistance of the Smiths.  The Court previously \nrecited in detail the factual allegations surrounding this purported scheme in its 22 \nDecember 2020 Order and O pinion on Defendant Carolina Beverage Group, LLC’s \n \n1 On 1 April 2020, the Court adopted a consolidated case caption with the  Merrell action \ndesignated as the “Master File” for the four cases.  (Strack, ECF No. 49.)  The order did not \nformally consolidate the cases pursuant to Rule 42, (see Strack, ECF No. 49), but the parties \nagreed in the Case Management Plan to coordinat e certain discovery matters and motions \npractice, (Merrell, ECF No. 25; Strack, ECF No. 34). \nmotion to dismiss in Strack, Merrell, and Cochrane.2  See, e.g., Merrell v. Smith, 2020 \nNCBC LEXIS 150, at *2–14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 22, 2020).  The Court further recited \nmany factual details relevant t o the Motions in its 13 December 2022 Order and \nOpinion on Plaintiffs’ Motions for Summary Judgment in Strack, Merrell, Cochrane, \nand Short.  See Merrell, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 155, at **1 n.1.3 \n4. This Opinion concerns seven claims brought by the Plaintiffs, former \nmembers of Carolina Beverage Group, LLC f/k/a Carolina Beer and Beverage \n(“CBB”), against the Smiths: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) fraud by omission and \nconcealment; (3) fraud in the inducement; (4) North Carolina securities fraud; \n(5) constructive fraud; (6) civil conspiracy; and (7) negligent misrepresentation. \nII. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n5. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  “[T]o provide context for its ruling, the Court may state either \nthose facts that it believes are not in material dispute or those facts on which a \nmaterial dispute forecloses summary adjudication.”  Ehmann v. Medflow, Inc. , \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 88, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017) ; see also  Hyde Ins. \nAgency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp. , 26 N.C. App. 138, 142 (1975) (encouraging the \n \n2 Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against Defendant Carolina Beverage Group, \nLLC with prejudice on 22 December 2021.  ( Cochrane, ECF No. 147; Merrell, ECF No. 137; \nStrack, ECF No. 192; Short, ECF No. 18.) \n \n3 Given the overlap in facts between the Motions and the motions before the Court in Merrell \nv. Smith, due to much of the same conduct being at issue in the Motions now before the Court, \nseveral facts from Merrell v. Smith are re -stated herein.  See 2022 NCBC LEXIS 155 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Dec. 13, 2022). \ntrial court to articulate a summary of the relevant evidence of record to provide \ncontext for the claims and the motion(s)). \nA. The Parties \n6. The plaintiffs in the Merrell matter are Carl E. Merrell, Craig S. Miller, \nWanda E. Miller, Robert J. Nastase, Lyle Ranson, and Jeanette Ranson (together, \nthe “Merrell Plaintiffs”).4  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6, 8, 10–11, Merrell, ECF No. 24.)5 \n7. The plaintiffs in the Strack matter are Pamela Boileau, Carolyn Crozier, \nthe Estate of Thomas J. Crozier, Jr., 6 Rita Dilling, Mallory Johnson, Kent Kalina, \nRoy Lynam, Dallas Pendry, Jr., Jeffrey A. Strack, Penny N. Strack, and James C. \nWilson (together, the “ Strack Plaintiffs”).  (Second Am. Comp l. ¶¶  8–10, 12 –17, \nStrack, ECF No. 33.) \n8. The plaintiffs in the Cochrane matter are Jeff Cochrane and Gary \nCochrane, as administrators of the Estate of Ralph N. Cochrane.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶  1, \n8, Cochrane, ECF No. 7.) \n \n4 Plaintiff Robert J. Nastase died on 13 March 2022.  ( Merrell, ECF No. 167.)  However, an \nexecutor has not been substituted for Mr. Nastase in this matter.  (See Merrell, ECF No. 179, \nat 2.)  The failure by counsel to substitute a representative for the decedent is not a basis for \nthe Court’s grant of summary judgment as set forth herein. \n \n5 Given the lengthy record, the Court cites to the Official Record with both the ECF Nos. and \nthe Record Exhibit numbers, where feasible, as follows, (ECF Nos. [  ] – [ ], R. Ex. [ ]).  \nDocuments submitted by the parties are always cited with the case name, (Case Name, ECF \nNo. [ ], R. Ex. [ ]).  To the extent a document has been filed in more than one of these matters, \nor multiple documents substantiate the same fact or issue, the Court cites only to one filing  \nfor brevity. \n \n6 Plaintiff Thomas J. Crozier, Jr. died on 13 September 2021.  ( Strack, ECF No. 243, ¶ 1.)  \nPursuant to a motion filed 28 March 2022, the Court ordered that Carolyn B. Crozier, as the \nExecutor of the Estate of Thomas J. Crozier, Jr., be substituted for Thomas J. Crozier, Jr. as \nPlaintiff.  (Strack, ECF Nos. 241, 243 at ¶ 3.) \n9. The plaintiff in the Short matter is Charles D. Short (“Short”).  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 8, Short, ECF No. 11.) \n10. The Court refers to the Merrell , Strack, Cochrane, and Short  plaintiffs \nherein as “Plaintiffs” when referencing them jointly. \n11. Defendant Mike Smith is the co-founder and former CEO of CBB.  (Second \nAm. Compl. ¶ 18, Strack, ECF No. 33.) \n12. Defendant Jennifer Smith was an employee of CBB and is married to Mike \nSmith.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 19, Strack, ECF No. 33.) \n13. CBB is a privately held North Carolina corporation with its principal office \nlocated at 110 Barley Park Lane, Mooresville, NC 28115.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 14, \n32, Merrell, ECF No. 24.)  CBB was originally engaged in beer brewing and bottling, \nselling its products in grocery stores across North and South Carolina.  (Merrell, ECF \nNo. 138.56, R. Ex. 67.) \n14. Siskey was a financial advisor for many  Plaintiffs.  (Second Am. Compl. \n¶ 46, Merrell, ECF No. 24.)  He was investigated by the FBI in 2015 and 2016, and it \nultimately discovered that five corporate entities incorporated by Siskey were part of \na Ponzi scheme operated by him .  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶  88–91, Merrell, ECF No. \n24.) The government filed suit against  Siskey in December 2016, shortly before he \ncommitted suicide on 28 December 2016.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 90–91, Merrell, \nECF No. 24.) \nB. Events Leading up to the Plaintiffs’ CBB Unit Sales \n15. CBB filed its Articles of Organization with the North Carolina Secretary of \nState on 24 September 1997.  (Articles of Organization, Merrell , ECF No. 138.36, R. \nEx. 9.)  CBB was organized by Mike Smith and  John Stritch, CBB’s co -founder and \nPresident, as a manager-managed LLC.  (Merrell, ECF No. 138.36, R. Ex. 9.) \n16. Mike Smith at all times held more than 50% of the membership and voting \ninterest in CBB.  (CBB Private Placement Memo 22, Merrell, ECF No. 138.56, R. Ex. \n67 [“CBB PPM”].)  The Membership Interest Transfer Ledger of CBB shows that on \n15 September 2000, Mike Smith received 52 units in original issue, and John Stritch \nreceived 9 units .  ( Merrell, ECF No. 139.14, R. Ex. Mike -13 [“CBB Unit Ledger” ].)  \nMike Smith owned the 52 units in CBB until the company’s merger in 2010. \n17. In 2000, Mike Smith asked Siskey, an insurance salesman and investment \nadvisor, to help him raise capital for CBB.  (Dep. James M. Smith 94:12–95:3, 96:17–\n100:17, Merrell, ECF No. 138.2, R. Ex. Smith-1 [“M. Smith Dep.”].)  Mike Smith and \nSiskey agreed that Siskey would circulate a Private Placement M emorandum \n(“PPM”) for CBB to introduce potential investors to CBB’s business and to it s \nmanagers, Mike Smith and John Stritch.  ( See M. Smith Dep. 94:20 –95:1, 107:3–\n112:10; CBB PPM 20.)  As part of this agreement, Siskey became a member of CBB \non 15 September 2000 by purchasing 5 units at a discounted rate.  (Merrell, ECF No. \n156.26, R. Ex. 15; M. Smith. Dep. 97:11–19.)  Siskey thereafter sold these units over \ntime.  ( See CBB Unit Ledger  1 , 8, 10  ( Membership Interest Transfer Ledger \ndemonstrating that in 2003, some of Siskey’s units were redeemed by CBB  and the \nremainder were sold to members of CBB).) \n18. The CBB PPM provided that CBB could issue up to 100 units and that one \nunit was equal to a one percent (1%) membership interest in the company.  (CBB \nPPM 21.)  Through the PPM, CBB offered to sell a minimum of 15 units and a \nmaximum of 27.5 units to investors, or between 15% and 27.5% of the company.  (CBB \nPPM, App. VI, 2.) \n19. Investment in CBB w as limited to Accredited Investors , who attested, as \nrequired by the CBB S ubscription Agreement, that they could make their own \n“informed investment decisions,” and th ey had “such knowledge and experience in \nfinancial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks \nof an investment in the company.”  (CBB Subscription Agreement 3, Merrell,  ECF \nNo. 138.132, R. Ex. 304 [“Subscription Agt.”].)  The CBB Subscription Agreement also \nrequired investors to certify they received, read, and understood the CBB Operating \nAgreement and the CBB PPM .  ( Subscription Agt. 3.)   Each Plaintiff did so .  ( See, \ne.g., Cochrane, ECF No. 148.51, R. Ex. 68; Strack , ECF No. 191.105, R. Ex. 195; \nMerrell, ECF Nos. 138.67, R. Ex. 107, 138.92, R. Ex. 233.) \n20. Plaintiffs purchased  units in CBB between 23 January 2001 and 22 \nSeptember 2003.  (Merrell, ECF No. 138.32, R. Ex. Smith-31.)  In 2001, the purchase \nprice for one unit of CBB was $100,000 and a half (.5) unit was $50,000.  ( Merrell, \nECF No. 138.32, R. Ex. Smith-31.)  The price to purchase units changed in subsequent \nyears.  ( See, e.g. , Merrell, ECF No. 138.32, R. Ex. S mith-31 (chart containing \ninformation regarding Plaintiffs’ unit purchases, distributions, and unit sales, \nshowing, for example, that Kent Kalina purchased a half (.5) unit in 2003 for \n$54,500).) \n21. On 16 December 2003, Siskey sold the last of the units he th en owned (.25 \nunits) to Plaintiff Roy Lynam.  (Strack , ECF No. 191.267, R. Ex. 823; CBB Unit \nLedger 10.) \n22. The Smiths were married in 2004.  (Aff. Jennifer Smith ¶ 16, Merrell, ECF \nNo. 140, R. Ex. 2 [“J. Smith Aff.”].)  Jennifer Smith never purchased units i n CBB, \nnor was she ever a member or manager of CBB.  (Aff. Mike Smith ¶ 5, Merrell, ECF \nNo. 139, R. Ex. 1 [“M. Smith Aff.”]; J. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 3, 12–13.)  Rather, Jennifer Smith \nwas a 1099 contract employee paid on an hourly basis, and she worked “as -needed” \ndepending on the projects she was assigned.  (J. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 4–5.)  Jennifer Smith’s \nprimary work for CBB included (1) redesigning CBB’s logo and website to reflect its \nshift away from brewing and bottling company beer brands  into a manufacturer for \nother beverage companies, and (2) assisting with ministerial correspondence to CBB \nmembers via mail, email, or phone regarding “reminders and logistics for Company \nmeetings, end -of-year tax forms [,] and occasionally tracking member mailings or \nresponses.”  (J. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 8–9.) \n23. Neither CBB, its managers , nor Jennifer Smith represented to CBB  \nmembers that Jennifer Smith had any corporate authority.  (M. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 21, 31; \nJ. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 10–14.) \nC.  Relevant Provisions of the CBB Operating Agreement \n24. Section 4.1 of the CBB 2000 Operating Agreement 7 (the “Operating \nAgreement”) provided that Mike Smith and Jo hn Stritch would be the managers of \nCBB.  (Am. Restated Operating Agreement of CBB 5, Merrell , ECF No. 138.57, R. \nEx. 70 [“2000 Op. Agt.”].)  Section 4.2 provided that the managers “shall manage and \ncontrol the business and affairs of the Company to the best of their ability and shall \nuse their best efforts to carry out the purposes of the Company as set forth herein.”  \n(2000 Op. Agt. 5.) \n25. There were restrictions on the authority of managers, and CBB members \nhad certain information rights, including the right to access the company’s “financial \nbooks, records and documents during normal business hours” and to make copies of \nthem upon reasonable notice to CBB.  (2000 Op. Agt.  7, §  4.4, 9 –10, §  5.2.)  The \nOperating Agreement also permitted members to request “information regarding the \nstatus of the business and the financial condition of the Company” and “such other \ninformation regarding the affairs of the Company as is just and reasonable.”  (2000 \nOp. Agt. 10, § 5.2.) \n26. Further, Section 4.7 of the Operating Agreement provided that “any \nMember or Manager may engage independently or with others in other business \n \n7 The 2000 Operating Agreement was amended in 2003 and again in 2007.  (See Merrell, ECF \nNo. 139.3, R. Ex. Mike-2.)  The only change in the 2003 amendment relevant to the Motions \nwas to change the percentage ownership required to approve a sale of units by a member \nfrom unanimous written member approval to 65% written member approval.   (See Merrell, \nECF No. 139.3, R. Ex. Mike -2.)  Therefore, the Court cites herein to the 2000 Operating \nAgreement or the 2007 Operating Agreement, unless otherwise referencing the changed \nlanguage from the 2003 amendment. \nventures of every nature and description even if competitive with the business of the \nCompany.”  (Am. Restated Operating Agreement of CBB 8, Merrell, ECF No. 138.71, \nR. Ex. 116 [“2007 Am. Op. Agt.”]; 2000 Op. Agt. 9.) \nD.  Communication Between Mike Smith and Siskey \n27. On 11 December 2006, Mike Smith emailed Siskey stating that he was \n“being approached by an investment group seeking to purchase [CBB].”  He further \nadvised Siskey: “I’ll keep you posted . . . I’m certainly not in a rush as the best is yet \nto come for [CBB].  Word on the street is we have the Cap Can deal.  This franchise \nis worth about 6-7 million net profit annually.”\n8  (Merrell, ECF No. 138.39, R. Ex. 24 \n[“2006 Email”].)  In his email to Siskey, Mike Smith did not identify the potential \nbuyer of CBB, indicate any proposed terms , or give the timing for a possible sale of \nthe company.  (See 2006 Email.)  T he record is devoid of evidence  regarding such \ninformation at the time the December 2006 email was sent. \n28. Three months later, on 12 March 2007, Mike Smith and John Stritch sent \na letter to CBB members (“March 2007 Letter”) informing them of the upcoming \nannual meeting to be held on 29 Mar ch 2007.9  (Merrell, ECF No. 138.61, R. Ex. 94 \n[“Mar. 2007 Ltr.”].)  The letter contained updates regarding CBB’s financial \n \n8 The Cap Can line was part of an agreement  between CBB and Rexam for CBB to install \nand put into production a new bottling line, the contract for which was signed by Mike Smith \non 28 March 2007 and by Rexam on 17 April 2008.  (M. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 33(o), 109, Merrell, \nECF No. 139, R. Ex. 1.) \n \n9 Jennifer Smith sent an email on 2 March 2007 to the “Partner[s]” of CBB informing them \nof the 29 March 2007 annual meeting.  (Strack, ECF No. 191.77, R. Ex. 93.)  The email stated \nthat a “formal letter and invitation to the meeting from CEO, [Mike] Smith a nd President, \nJohn Stritch will be coming to you via mail.”  (Strack, ECF No. 191.77, R. Ex. 93.) \nperformance and noted a two -year sales increase of 400% from $5.6 million in 2005 \nto $24 million in 2007 due to a new can line , which was being utilized to 100% \ncapacity.10  (Mar. 2007 Ltr. 1–2; Aff. M. Smith ¶ 33(k) (describing the 2005 company \nsales).)  The letter further informed members that an additional bottling line, the Cap \nCan line,  would be installed in November 2007, which would create  a separate \nrevenue stream for the company.  (Mar. 2007 Ltr. 2.) \n29. On 1 Oct ober 2007, Mike Smith and John Stritch sent a letter to CBB \nmembers (“October 1 Letter”) providing a report on CBB’s mid-year performance, an \nupdate on building expansion, and an evaluation of next steps for the business.  \n(Merrell, ECF No. 138.64, R. Ex. 104 [“Oct. 1 Ltr. ”].)  In relevant part, the letter \ninformed members that net income for the first half of 2007 was $5 million as \ncompared to just over $2 million for the same period in 2006.  (Oct. 1 Ltr.  1.)  The \nletter estimated that net income for 2007 would exceed $7 million but that “further \ndistribution of earnings is speculative at best[.]”  (Oct. 1 Ltr.  1.)  The letter also \nprovided that CBB was expanding its plant at a cost of $4.2 million and investing in \nnew equipment at a  price of $6.5 million, $4 million of which was financed by a \npackaging supplier.  (Oct. 1 Ltr. 2.)  Finally, the letter stated that CBB would “begin \ndue diligence regarding a potential sale of the company” within the “next twelve \nmonths” but that “[a]ny p otential sale of the company at this point is truly \nspeculative.”  (Oct. 1 Ltr. 3.) \n \n10 By 2006, contract packaging work, such as can ning and bottling lines, were showing the \ngreatest growth for CBB, with the addition of more can production lin es as the company’s \nplan for future growth.  (Merrell, ECF No. 138.128, R. Ex. 292.) \n30. In or around October 2007, Mike Smith made CBB’s corporate counsel, \nWishart, Norris, Henninger & Pittman P.A. (“Wishart Norris”), aware that Siskey \nhad knowledge of a possible sale of the company and was in the process of purchasing \nmembership interests in CBB from investors who lacked this information.   (Merrell, \nECF No. 138.38, R. Ex. 23 [“Oct. 3 Ltr.”].) \n31. On 3 October 2007, Wishart Norris  hand-delivered a letter to Siskey \n(“October 3 Letter”) warning him that it is unlawful “to omit .  . . a material fact in \nconnection with the purchase or sale of any security.”  (Oct. 3 Ltr. 1.)  The letter also \nwarned Siskey that if he had knowledge regarding CBB and “its future plans, \nincluding plans to sell[,]” then he must share that knowledge with the CBB members \nwhose units he intended to buy.  (Oct. 3 Ltr. 1.)  Further, the letter stated that Mike \nSmith would withhold his consent from transfers of any interests in CBB until “all \nmembers of the company” were made aware of management’s plans.  (Oct. 3 Ltr.  2.)  \nThe letter stated that the firm and Mike Smith “believe that this action is prudent \ngiven the possible liability that may be incurred .  . . if any more sales of interests \noccur without all parties having knowledge of all the relevant information.”  (Oct. 3 \nLtr. 2.) \n32. Following the October 1 and 3 Letters, CBB did not authorize any \nagreements to sell CBB units until 15 October 2007.  (See Strack, ECF Nos. 191.131, \nR. Ex. 266, 191.247, R. Ex. 696; Merrell , ECF No. 138.55, R. Ex. 66.)   None of the  \nPlaintiffs sold their CBB units to Siskey prior to his receipt of the October 3 Letter. \n33. Plaintiffs thereafter sold their CBB units to Siskey between 15 Oc tober \n2007 and 27 March 2008.  ( See, e.g., Strack, ECF Nos. 191.131, R. Ex. 266, 191.224, \nR. Ex. 531, 191.247, R. Ex. 696; Merrell, ECF No. 138.55, R. Ex. 66.) \nE.  Amendments to the CBB Operating Agreement and Plaintiffs’ Unit \nSales \n \n34. While the CBB Operating Agreement provided two methods for members \nto sell their units,  Plaintiffs sold their units to Siskey using the “Consent” method, \npursuant to Sections 7.1(c)(i) and 7.1(e) of the Operating Agreement.  (2000 Op. Agt. \n16–18.)  The Consent method permitted members to transfer units to an individual \nwith the “prior written consent” of members holding , in the aggregate, at least 65% \nof the percentage interest held by all CBB members.  (2000 Op. Agt.  § 7.1(c)(i); see \nalso Cochrane, ECF No. 166.29, R. Ex . 542  (demonstrating the change  from \nunanimous approval to 65% approval).)  Members giving approval for such transfers \nsigned Consent to Transfer of Membership Interest documents (“Consent \nAgreements”), whi le the members selling their unit(s) signed an Assignment and \nPurchase Agreement (“APA(s)”) that demonstrated assent to the transaction and \nnamed the purchaser .  ( See, e.g. , Strack, ECF No. 191.2 47, R. Ex. 6 96 (showing \nPamela Boileau’s executed APA).) \n35. Eleven plaintiffs sold their CBB units to Siskey between 15 October 2007 \nand 1 3 December 2007: James Wilson, Carl Merrell, Pamela Boileau, Jeffrey and \nPenny Strack, Kent Kalina, Carolyn Crozier, Thomas J. Crozier, Jr., Ralph N. \nCochrane,11 and Roy Lynam.  ( Strack, ECF Nos. 191.67, 191.131, 191.185, 191.187, \n191.203–204, 191.247, 191.269; Merrell, ECF No. 138.107; Cochrane, ECF No. \n148.124.) \n36. Amendments to the CBB Operating Agreement were proposed by Mike \nSmith and John Stritch on 26 October 2007.  (2007 Am. Op. Agt. 30.)  A letter sent by \nCBB on 27 October 2007 informed its members of the proposed changes to the \nOperating Agreement.  ( Merrell, ECF No. 138.70, R. Ex. 115 [“Oct. 27 Ltr. ”].)  Of \nrelevance here, the proposed amendments  would allow majority ra ther than \nunanimous member approval to amend the Operating Agreement , and majority \nrather than 65% member approval to properly permit the sale of a member’s \nownership units.  (Oct. 27 Ltr.; 2007 Am. Op. Agt. 14, § 7.1(c)(i).) \n37. The required u nanimous member approval was obtained for the 2007 \namendments on 18 December 2007, and the amendments were effective as to all unit \ntransfers, or other member activity, on  and after that date .  (Written Consent 2, \nMerrell, ECF No. 138.97, R. Ex. 243; All Written Consents, Merrell, ECF No. 138.104, \nR. Ex. 256.) \n38. The remaining nine plaintiffs sold their units to Siskey after  the 2007 \namendments became effective: Mallory Johnson, Robert Nastase, Rita Dilling, Lyle \nand Jeanette Ranson, Craig and Wanda Miller, Charles Short, and Dallas Pendry, \n \n11 Following the sale of his unit s, Thomas J. Crozier Jr. died, and his wife Carolyn  Crozier \nwas substituted as the executor of his estate.  In addition, Mr. Cochrane died after the sale \nof his units and his sons Jeff Cochrane and Gary Cochrane were named executors of his \nestate. \nJr.  (Strack, ECF Nos. 191.75, 191.224, 191.229; Merrell, ECF Nos. 138.58, 138.109–\n110, 138.184; Short, ECF No. 36.85.) \n39. No Plaintiff contacted the Smiths prior to selling their units to Sis key, \nexcept for Dallas Pendry, Jr.12  On one occasion, Dallas Pendry called CBB requesting \n“information about earnings distribution[.]”  (M. Smith Dep. 74:21–75:3.)  Mr. Pendry \n \n12 Jennifer Smith affirmed that she never spoke to nor rec alls any substantive conversation \nwith any Plaintiff.  She “ was never authorized to communicate substantively with CBB \nmembers nor did [she] ever do so.”  (J. Smith Aff. ¶ 11; see also Dep. Jeanette Ranson 18:14–\n19:19, Merrell, ECF No. 138.18, R. Ex. Smith -17 [“J. Ranson Dep .”].)  Moreover, the record \ncontains numerous instances of similar testimony  indicating plaintiffs did not rely on the \nadvice of the Smiths.  For example:  \n \nJeanette Ranson, when asked if she considered asking Mike Smith, Jennifer Smith, or CBB \nfor any information that might guide her decision to sell her units, testified “No.”  (J. Ranson \nDep. 20:24–21:12.)  Regarding both Ms. Ranson and her husband Lyle Ranson’s decisions to \nsell, Ms. Ranson stated that she, her husband, and Siskey helped determine her decision to \nsell her membership interest in CBB.  (J. Ranson Dep. 21:25–22:10.) \n \nWanda Miller testified that she spoke to Mike Smith at some point when she was a member \nof CBB but could not remember when or what about.  (Dep. Wanda Miller 21:13–23:1, Merrell, \nECF No. 138.15, R. Ex. Smith-14 [“W. Miller Dep.”].)  Ms. Miller never met Jennifer Smith, \nnor did they ever speak to one another, but Ms. Miller saw Jennifer Smith once while at the \nSpeedway Club in Charlotte, North Carolina.  (W. Miller Dep. 23:2–24:1.) \n \nShort testified that he did not recall any conversations with Jennifer Smith about the \nbusiness of CBB, nor did he ever ask the Smiths or anyone else about the contents of the \nOctober 1 Letter prior to selling his units.  (Dep. Charles David Short 76:3–6, 106:23–107:18, \nMerrell, ECF No. 138.20, R. Ex Smith-19 [“Short Dep.”].)  Instead, Short stated that he was \nrelying on “information about the [CBB] investment” provided to him by Siskey.  (Short Dep. \n107:12–18.)  When Short decided to sell his CBB units, he did not ask for any information \nfrom the Smiths, or CBB.  ( Short Dep. 141:15–142:1.)  In fact, Short, like many Plaintiffs, \nhad never met nor spoken with Jennifer Smith.  (Short Dep. 143:24–144:4.) \n \nExamples of similar testimony by Plaintiffs are numerous.  (See also Dep. Jeffrey Strack  \n79:3–21, Merrell, ECF No. 138.21, R. Ex. Smith-20 (stating he never met the Smiths, never \ncommunicated with them via email or another indirect means,  and had “no personal \nknowledge of any oral statements they made about [CBB]” ); Dep. Robert J. Nastase 113:2–\n13, Merrell,\n ECF No. 138.16, R. Ex. Smith-15 (stating that he never spoke to the Smiths, and \n“I don’t know them at all”).) \n \nstated at his deposition that he call ed CBB before he sold his shares , and that he \nreceived a call back with information, but that he did not follow up with additional \nquestions.  ( Dep. Dallas Pendry, Jr. 200:10 –203:4, Merrell, ECF No. 138.17 , R. Ex. \nSmith-16.) \n40. Siskey purchased a total of 12.75 units from Plaintiffs between 15 October \n2007 and 27 March 2008 for approximately $3,180,000.00.  (Merrell, ECF No. 138.32, \nR. Ex. Smith-31; see CBB Unit Ledger.) \nF.  The Ultimate Sale of CBB \n41. Almost three years after Plaintiffs sold their units to Siske y, on 27 May \n2010, CBB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger which resulted in a \nsubstantial restructuring of CBB, effectively merging CBB with Southern Belle \nMerger Sub, LLC on 6 August 2010.  (M. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 129–30, 133.)  The transaction \nproduced significant payments to CBB members.  In exchange for surrendering their \nunits, members received a pro rata share of the merger consideration and dividends.  \n(M. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 129(e), 133.) \n42. As a result of his ownership, Siskey received approximately $22,158,642.18 \nfrom CBB between 2009 and 2013.13  (See Second Am. Compl. ¶ 132, Strack, ECF No. \n33.) \n \n13 In addition to his purchases from Plaintiffs, Siskey purchased an additional 3 units.  As a \nresult, at the time of the merger Siskey owned a total of 15.75 units of CBB.  (See CBB Unit \nLedger.) \nG. Procedural History \n43. The procedural history relevant to the Motions is set forth  in this Court’s \n13 December 2022 Order and Opinion in Merrell v. Smith , which is  incorporated \nherein by reference.  See Merrell, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 155 , at **14–15.  Simply put, \nafter the completion of extensive discovery, pursuant to the Court’s Case \nManagement Orders, the Smiths filed the Motions. \n44. Following full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motions and related \nmotions on 25 and 26 August 2022 (the “Hearing”), at which all parties to the Motions \nwere present and represented by counsel. \n45. The Motions are ripe for resolution. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \n46. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c).  “A ‘genuine issue’ is \none that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, \n83 (2000).   “Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion and means more than a scintilla or \na permissible inference[.]”  DeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co. , 355 N.C. 672, 681 (2002) \n(cleaned up). \n47. The moving party “bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of \na genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, \n579 (2002) .  The movant may make the required showing by proving that “an \nessential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at \ntrial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense, or by showing through discovery \nthat the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of \nher claim.”  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83 (citations omitted). \n48. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the r equired showing, \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784–85 \n(2000). \n49. The Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83.  However, the nonmovant  \nmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of their pleading, but \ntheir response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must \nset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If \n[the nonmovant] does not so respond, summary judgment, if \nappropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant]. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(e). \nIV. ANALYSIS \n50. The Smiths argue that summary judgment is proper against Plaintiffs on \nall remaining claims : (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) fraud by omission and \nconcealment; (3) fraud in the inducement ; ( 4) constructive fraud; ( 5) negligent \nmisrepresentation; (6) North Carolina securities fraud; and (7) civil conspiracy. \n51. Plaintiffs allege that Mike Smith provided Siskey with insider information \nin the December 2006 email, which disclosed to Siskey but not Plaintiffs that at least \none interest ed buyer approached CBB  seeking to purchase it.  Plaintiffs, many of \nwhom were Siskey’s investment clients , allege that Siskey sought to purchase their \nunits in CBB because of this insider information.  Siskey allegedly convinced each of \nthem to sell their CBB units by intentionally omitting the inside information so that \nhe could profit from the impending sale  of CBB.  Further, Plaintiffs allege that the \nSmiths assisted Siskey by facilitating the Plaintiffs’ unit sales and approving those \ntransactions. \nA. Breach of Fiduciary Duty \n52. The Smiths argue that Plaintiffs ’ claims for breach of fiduciary duty fail \nbecause neither Mike Smith nor Jennifer Smith owed them any fiduciary duty.  \n(Mots. 1–2, Merrell, ECF No. 141 [“Mots.”].)  The Smiths also argue that these claims \nfail because Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that, but for the Smiths’ conduct, they \nwould not have sold their interest in CBB.  (Br. Supp. Mots. 31–32, Merrell, ECF No. \n142 [“Br. Supp. Mots.”].)  CBB disclosed the relevant facts regarding its plans to sell \nthe company , and CBB’s profits  in the October 1 Letter, but Plaintiffs  ultimately \nchose to s ell their units for reasons  unrelated to the information disclosed in the \nOctober 1 Letter, including concerns about CBB’s debt from the installation of a new \ncanning line, and the prospects of CBB.  (Br. Supp. Mots. 32.) \n53. “To establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must show that: \n(1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) the defendant breached that \nfiduciary duty; and (3) the breach of fiduciary duty was a proximate cause of i njury \nto the plaintiff.”  Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, 339 (2019). \n1. Mike Smith \n54. As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs do not allege that Mike Smith ’s status \nas a m anager of CBB gives rise to a ny fiduciary duty  to other members , nor do \nPlaintiffs allege or properly plead a breach of fiduciary duty to the company through \na derivative action .  (See Strack, ECF No. 33;  Merrell, ECF No. 24; Cochrane, ECF \nNo. 7; Short, ECF No. 11.)  However, in response to the Motions, Plaintiffs now argue \nthat as a manager of CBB Mike Smith had control over CBB pursuant to Section 4.2 \nof the Operating Agreement and therefore owed Plaintiffs fiduciary duties.  (See Pls. \nResp. Mots. 3, Merrell, ECF No. 161 [“Opp’n Br.”].) \n55. “[M]anagers of a limited liability company  . . . owe a fiduciary duty to the \ncompany, and not to individual members.”  Kaplan  v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. \nApp. 469, 474 (2009) .  “  ‘[W]here it is alleged that managers have breached [their \nfiduciary] duty, the action is properly maintained by the LLC rather than any \nindividual member.’ ”  Barefoot v. Barefoot, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 8, at **24 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Feb. 2, 2022) (quoting Kaplan, 196 N.C. App. at 474) (cleaned up).  There are no \nderivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty by Mike Smith for harm to CBB, and \ntherefore, to the extent Plaintiffs claim a breach of fiduciary duty on that basis, those \nclaims are DISMISSED. \n56. Next, Plaintiffs argue that as the majority member of CBB, Mike Smith \nowed them a fiduciary duty, which  he breached.   ( Opp’n Br. 9 –10.)  “The North \nCarolina Limited Liability Company Act does not create fiduciary duties among \nmembers.  As a general rule, members of a l imited liability company are like \nshareholders in a corporation in that members do not owe a fiduciary duty to each \nother or to the company.”  Emrich Enters. v. Hornwood, Inc. , 2022 NCBC LEXIS 19, \nat **42 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 15, 2022) (cleaned up).  Rather, “ ‘[t]he rights and duties \nof LLC members are ordinarily governed by the company’s operating agreement, not \nby general principles of fiduciary relationships. ’ ”  Id. (quoting Strategic Mgmt. \nDecisions v. Sales Performance Int’l , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *10–11 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Aug. 7, 2017)). \n57. However, in some circumstances, “a holder of a majority interest who \nexercises control over the LLC owes a fiduciary duty to minority interest members.”  \nVanguard Pai Lung, LLC v. Moody , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *17 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJune 19, 2019) (citations omitted).  This Court in Vanguard specified several actions \nwhich, if taken by a majority member , indicate an exercise of control potentially \nsufficient to create a fiduciary duty, including: (1) managerial control over a board of \ndirectors or other managers; (2) the ability to dissolve the company; (3) the ability to \ndeclare bankruptcy; and (4) the ability to amend the operating agreement without \napproval from other members.  Id. at *19–21.  The exercise of control through any of \nthese actions weigh in favor of the majority member owing minority members a \nfiduciary duty.  Id. at *21.  “Thus, when the operating agreement confers controlling \nauthority on the majority member, [the majority member] owes a duty not to use [his] \ncontrol to harm the minority, assuming no other provision disclaims such a duty.”  Id. \n58. “ ‘The scope of this exception [to the general proposition that members of an \nLLC owe no fiduciary duties to other members], borrowed from precedents governing \ncorporations, remains unsettled’  and ‘this Court has cautioned against a broad \napplication because of the fundamental differences between LLCs and corporations.’ ”  \nBennett v. Bennett , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 19, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 15, 2019) \n(quoting Strategic Mgmt. Decisions, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *11).  Courts have \nroutinely refused to extend precedents borrowed from corporations to LLCs because \nminority members have a much greater ability to negotiate for protections in the \noperating agreement.  See, e.g. , Bennett, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 19, at *20; Fiske v. \nKieffer, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 22, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 9, 2016); Island Beyond, \nLLC, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 48, at *15.  “[O]nly when one party figuratively holds all the \ncards -- all the financial power  or technical information, for example -- have North \nCarolina courts found that the special circumstance of a fiduciary relationship has \narisen.”  Kaplan, 196 N.C. App. at 475. \n59. The Smiths contend  that Mike Smith did not owe fiduciary duties to the \nPlaintiffs, arguing that prior to the 2007 Operating Agreement, he had no actual \ncontrol because he could not act unilaterally or contravene the Operating Agreement.  \n(Br. Supp. Mots. 13–14.)  Further, even after the 2007 Operating Agreement became \neffective, the Smiths argue that Mike Smith could not have been a fiduciary because \nhe could n either act unilaterally regarding “information dissemination ,” nor act \nunilaterally to effect unit transfers since those required the cooperation and approval \nof Plaintiffs to complete the Consent Agreements and APAs.  (Br. Supp. Mots. 14.) \ni. Plaintiffs’ Sales Before the 2007 Amendments \n \n60. Under the 2003 amendments to the 2000 Operating Agreement, the Court \nconcludes based on the uncontradicted evidence of record that Mike Smith did not \nhave control over CBB .  First, Mike Smith did not dominate CBB’s other manager, \nJohn Stritch, as the Operating Agreement restricted the authority of its managers, \nrequiring certain actions to have either (1) unanimous member approval, or (2) 75% \nmember approval.  Further, each manager was permitted to take the same actions \nlisted under Section 4.2 of the Operating Agreement––neither had more control than \nthe other.  The record also indicates CBB did not have a board of directors.14  Finally, \nMike Smith did not have the exclusive ability to dissolve the company, (see 2000 Op. \nAgt. 11, § 6.1), and he did not have the ability to unilaterally amend the Operating \nAgreement, as unanimous approval from CBB members was required, ( see 2000 Op. \nAgt. § 9.9).15 \n61. While Mike Smith was the majority member of CBB when the first eleven \nPlaintiffs sold the ir units, he did not hold all the financial power or technical \ninformation of CBB, and in fact Plaintiffs were able to access CBB’s financial books, \nrecords, and documents, as well as make copies of those documents , so long as \n \n14 The record indicates that CBB had an executive committee with at least a CEO, President, \nand Vice President.  (Dep. Shannon Marie Hilton 40:16–41:21, Merrell, ECF No. 159.4, Pls.’ \nIndex Ex. 13.)  The record also indicates that Mike Smith was the Chief Executive Officer of \nCBB, and John Stritch was President .  However, the record does not mention a board of \ndirectors, who those directors were, bylaws, if there were meetings of a board, or if there were \nmeeting minutes.  Thus, the evidence in the record is insufficient to create a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact on whether there was a board of directors of CBB.  \n \n15 The CBB Operating Agreement did not address the ability to declare bankruptcy. \nreasonable notice was given to the company.  (2000 Op. Agt. 7, § 4.4, 9–10, § 5.2.)  In \naddition, Mike Smith did not have the exclusive ability to permit Plaintiffs to sell \ntheir ownership interests in CBB ––not only did each Plaintiff have to execute their  \nAPA’s, but Mike Smith also could not unilaterally execute the Consent Agreements \nbecause 65% written member approval was required. \n62. Prior to the effective date of the 2007 Operating Agreement, Mike Smith , \nas the majority member, could not exercise control over CBB members under any of \nthe Vanguard factors, and he did not unilaterally approve the first group of plaintiffs’ \nunit sales.  The uncontested evidence shows that Mike Smith did not owe a fiduciary \nduty to those Plaintiffs who sold prior to the effect ive date of the 2007 Operating \nAgreement. \n63. Therefore, the Court concludes that plaintiffs James Wilson, Carl Merrell, \nPamela Boileau, Jeffrey and Penny Strack, Kent Kalina, Carolyn Crozier, \nindividually and as the executor of the Estate of Thomas J. Crozier, Jr., Jeff Cochrane \nand Gary Cochrane, as administrators of the Estate of Ralph N. Cochrane, and Roy \nLynam’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty fail as a matter of law, and the ir claims \nfor breach of fiduciary duty are hereby DISMISSED. \nii. Plaintiffs’ Sales After the 2007 Amendments \n64. After the 2007 Operating Agreement was approved and effective,  Mike \nSmith could unilaterally approve Plaintiffs’ unit sales as  the sole signatory  on the \nConsent Agreements, and he could act alone to amend the Operating Agreement.  \nHowever, the plain language of  Section 4.7 provided that “any Member or Manager \nmay engage independently or with others in other business ventures of every nature \nand description even if competitive wit h the business of the Company.”  (2007 Am. \nOp. Agt. 8.)  The language of Section 4.7  is evidence that members of  CBB did not \nowe the company a fiduciary duty of loyalty , and the  Operating Agreement did not \notherwise provide for any fiduciary or fiduciary -like duties among members and, in \nfact, is reasonably interpreted to renounce such duties.   See Bennett, 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 19, at *16 –17 (where provisions in the  operating agreement “disclaim \nfiduciary or fiduciary-like duties on the part of members or managers[,]” it is evidence \nsupporting a conclusion that no fiduciary duties were owed). \n65. Even if Mike  Smith owed fiduciary duties to the later selling plaintiffs, \nPlaintiffs have not come forward with substantial evidence to show that Mike Smith \nbreached any fiduciary duty. \n66. Plaintiffs contend Mike Smith breached his fiduciary duty by : (1) omitting \nknown facts concerning the sale of CBB and  providing inside information regarding \nthat sale to Siskey ; and (2) ratifying Plaintiffs’ unit sales to Siskey after allegedly \nenabling those transactions.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 359, Strack, ECF No. 33.) \n67. First, each Plaintiff as a member of CBB had the authority to negotiate for \nprotections in the CBB Operating Agreement.  Each Plaintiff who specifically ratified \nthe 2007 amendments thereby approved the sale of CBB units with only 51% member \napproval, if using the Cons ent method.  Mike Smith, who at all times held 52  units \nin CBB, was thereafter permitted to unilaterally approve unit sales , given his 52% \nownership.  Therefore, the argument that Mike Smith breached a fiduciary duty owed \nto Plaintiffs simply by performing an act which compli ed with the CBB Operating \nAgreement is insufficient to create a jury issue as to this point.  Plaintiffs ratified the \n2007 amendments, thereby negotiating away their protections under the Operating \nAgreement.  Further, Plaintiffs have cited  no evidence indicating an agreement \nbetween Mike Smith and Siskey  sufficient to establish a conspiracy .  (See infra  \nPart IV.G.)  Thus, Plaintiffs’ contention that Mike Smith breached a fiduciary duty \nowed to them by ratifying the Plaintiffs’ unit sales to Siskey necessarily fails. \n68. Plaintiffs’ remaining contention is that Mike Smith breached his fiduciary \nduty by omitting known material facts concerning the sale of CBB but  shared that \ninformation with Siskey, which proximately caused Plaintiffs to sell their units. \n69. “An omitted fact is material  if there is a substantial likelihood that  a \nreasonable [member] would consider it important in deciding how to vote.”  \nEhrenhaus v. Baker, 216 N.C. App. 59, 88 (2011)  (citations omitted).  Under t his \nstandard, “there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted \nfact would h ave been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly \naltered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.”  Id. (citations omitted). \n70. The record is clear that a possible sale of CBB was disclosed to Plaintiffs in \nthe October 1 Letter prior to the sale of any Plaintiffs’ units to Siskey.  As a result, if \nthere was any omission of information by Mike Smith to  Plaintiffs, Mike Smith \ncomplied with any fiduciary duty he may have owed them by ultimately disclosing \nthis information prior to the sale by Plaintiffs of their CBB unit(s) to Siskey.   \n71. Further, the information allegedly omitted by Mike Smith was immaterial \nto Plaintiffs’ decision s to sell their units. 16  There is uncontradicted evidence that \nPlaintiffs relied on statements made by Siskey, not by Mike Smith, in choosing to sell \ntheir units.  (See supra note 12.)  Rather, the substantial evidence indicates  many \nPlaintiffs do not recall asking the Smiths or anyone else about the contents of the \nOctober 1 Letter prior to selling their units. \n72. The nine plaintiffs who sold under the 2007 Operating Agreement knew or \nreasonably should have known CBB was beginning to pursue  a potential sale, given \nthat over two months had passed since the October 1 Letter was sent .  If this \ninformation was material to Plaintiffs ’ decision to sell, they each had ample \nopportunity to ask Mike Smith , or other agents of CBB, about the potential sale or \nthe contents of the October 1 Letter but did not do so. \n73. Mere general interest expressed to Mike Smith by an unidentified potential \npurchaser, without specifics as to possible terms of a transaction , is not the type of \ninformation that must necessarily be disclosed by CBB management to all members.  \n \n16 As to the information in the  December 2006 email to Siskey, t here is no record evidence \nbefore the Court  of who the investment group was, or  that any “approach” turned into an \noffer to purchase CBB at any time between 11 December 2006 and January 2009.  ( See M. \nSmith Aff. ¶¶ 111, 117.)  Rather, the record before the Court shows that there was no pending \nsale in 2007 and 2008, but that CBB engaged an investment banking firm which drafted a \nconfidential information memorandum used to market CBB for sale in late 2008.  (M. Smith \nAff. ¶¶ 111, 113, 115.)   \n \nThe CBB sale process was stopped in or around  January 2009 and resumed in September \n2009 when CBB updated the confidential information memorandum, and thereafter received \nits first interested buyer s.  (M. Smith A ff. ¶ 127.)  Therefore, the uncontradicted evidence \nshows that the December 2006 email was wholly immaterial, given that it was speculative \ninformation at a time where no buyer was identified.  The record indicates there was no \n“pending sale” of CBB in 2007 and 2008 because “no buyer had made any indication of any \nintention to even discuss a purchase of CBB[.]”  (M. Smith Aff. ¶ 111.) \nTo the extent such information sho uld have been disclosed, the October 1 L etter to \nall members provided concrete information that CBB was moving toward a sale of the \ncompany, which belies Plaintiffs’ argument that Mike Smith attempted to control \nCBB in a manner harmful to members .  See Finkel v. Palm Park, Inc. , 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 38, at *29 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 11, 2019) (“[E]vidence of financial \ntransparency strongly belies any contention that [defendant] attempted to dominate \nor control [plaintiff].”) ; see also Lockerman v. S . River Elec. Membership Corp., 250 \nN.C. App. 631, 639 (2016) (holding no dominion and control because plaintiffs were \nsufficiently on notice regarding the information at issue, and that information was \navailable to plaintiffs at any time).   Rather, Mike Smith’s disclosure is indicative of \nhis transparency with members.  See Finkel, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 38, at *29. \n74. The Court concludes, therefore, that even if Mike Smith owed Plaintiffs a \nfiduciary duty, Plaintiffs have failed to show Mike Smith breached that duty or that, \nif he did breach a duty, it proximately caused Plaintiffs  an injury.  Accordingly, the \nCourt concludes that the Motions, with respect to plaintiffs Mallory Johnson, Robert \nNastase, Rita Dilling, Lyle and Jeanette Ranson, Craig and Wanda Miller, Charles \nD. Short, and Dallas Pendry, Jr. ’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty against Mike \nSmith, should be and therefore are GRANTED.  As a result, Plaintiffs’ claims against \nMike Smith for breach of fiduciary duty are hereby DISMISSED. \n2. Jennifer Smith \n75. The broad parameters of fiduciary duties have been “specifically limited in \nthe context of employment situations.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 652 (2001).  \n“Where an employee is neither an officer nor a director, extraordinary circumstances \nare necessary to impose a fiduciary duty arising out of the employment relationship.”  \nSe. Air Charter, Inc. v. Stroud , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. \n17, 2015) (citing Dalton, 353 N.C. at 652).  These “extraordinary circumstances” occur \nwhen “the employer [is] subjugated to the improper influences or domination of his  \nemployee[.]”  Dalton , 353 N.C. at 652 ; consider Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head & \nEngquist Equip., L.L.C., 2002 NCBC LEXIS 2, at **22 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 10, 2002) \n(finding no fiduciary duty because employee’s “substantial discretion with respect to \nthe day-to-day, ‘nuts and bolts’ operation” did not constitute domination and influence \nover employer), and Austin Maint. Constr., Inc. v. Crowder Constr. Co., 224 N.C. App. \n401, 410  (2012) ( finding no fiduciary duty because “ any confidence that [p] laintiff \nreposed in [employee] consisted of nothing more than relying on him to competently \nperform his assigned duties.”). \n76. Here, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that Jennifer Smith was never \na member of CBB, nor was she a manager, officer, or director.  Jennifer Smith was a \ncontract employee whose interactions with the Plaintiffs were  routine and \nministerial.  (J. Smith Aff. ¶¶ 7–9.)  The undisputed evidence also indicates that CBB \ndid not represent to members that Jennifer Smith had any corporate authority, nor \nis there evidence to suggest that she exerted any improper influence or domination \non CBB.  Rather, the record is clea r that Jennifer Smith ’s authority was limited to \nthe ministerial tasks which CBB relied on her to complete competently.  The fact that \nshe at times sent emails to members regarding the date of an annual meeting, for \nexample, is unremarkable given that it was a n administrative task assigned as one \nof her regular duties. \n77. Therefore, the Court concludes that Jennifer Smith, as an employee, did not \nowe the Plaintiffs, as members of CBB, a  fiduciary relationship.  A ccordingly, the \nMotions are GRANTED as to  Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary  duty claims against \nJennifer Smith and therefore those claims are DISMISSED. \nB. Fraud by Omission and Concealment \n78. “Where a fraud claim arises by concealment or nondisclosure of material \nfacts, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant(s) ‘had a duty to disclose material \ninformation to [plaintiff], as silence is fraudulent only when there is a duty to speak.’ ”  \nAldridge v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *102 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. \n31, 2019) (quoting Lawrence v. UMLIC-Five Corp., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *8 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. June 18, 2007)). \n79. Fraud claims based on omission(s) require a plaintiff to show: \n(1) the relationship between plaintiff and defendant giving rise to the \nduty to speak; (2) the event that triggered the duty to speak or the \ngeneral time period over which the relationship arose and the fraud \noccurred; (3) the general content of the information that was withheld \nand the reason for its materiality; (4) the identity of those under a duty \nwho failed to make such disclosures; (5) what the defendant gained from \nwithholding the information; (6) why the plaintiff's reliance on the \nomission was reasonable and detrimental; and (7) the damages the fraud \ncaused the plaintiff. \n \nLee v. McDowell, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 121, at *20–21 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 14, 2020) \n(citing Island Beyond, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 48, at *18–19) (internal marks omitted). \n80. A duty to disclose arises in three situations: \n(1) there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties to the \ntransaction; (2) a party has taken affirmative steps to conceal material \nfacts from the other; or (3) one party has knowledge of a latent defect in \nthe subject matter of the negotiations about which the other party is \nboth ignorant and unable to discover through reasonable diligence. \n \nAldridge, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *103 (internal marks omitted); see also Harton \nv. Harton, 81 N.C. App. 295, 298 ( 1986) (“The two remaining situations in which a \nduty to disclose exists arise outside a fiduciary relationship, when the parties are \nnegotiating at arm ’s length”).  Even in the absence of a duty to speak, “it is well -\nestablished that once a party chooses to speak, that party then ‘has a duty to make a \nfull and fair disclosure of facts concerning the matters on which he chooses to speak.’ ”  \nAldridge, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *103 (citing Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. 130, \n139 (1974)) (emphasis in original). \n1. Jennifer Smith \n81. Plaintiffs allege Jennifer Smith was “aware” of Siskey’s “fraudulent \npurchases” and that she was “in a position to communicate the information to the \nPlaintiffs and owed the Plaintiffs a duty to do so.”  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 385, Strack, \nECF No. 33.)  Plaintiffs argue this gave rise to a duty to disclose. \n82. Based on the allegations in their complaints, the Court concludes Plaintiffs \nbelieve Jennifer Smith had a duty to disclose because she “has taken affirmative steps \nto conceal material facts from the[m.]”\n17  Aldridge, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *103 \n \n17 Even if Plaintiffs attempted to argue that Jennifer Smith owed them a fiduciary duty, and \ntherefore she owed them a duty to disclose, the Court has concluded that as an employee \nJennifer Smith did not owe members of CBB a fiduciary relationship.  Therefor e, such an \nargument would fail for the same reason Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claims fail as to \nJennifer Smith. \n(internal marks omitted) .  However, Plaintiffs have failed to forecast any evidence \ndemonstrating that Jennifer Smith , a CBB employee and non -member, knew about \nSiskey’s intent to purchase Plaintiffs’ membership units  or that Siskey failed to \nprovide relevant information to Plaintiffs .  Further, this argument necessarily fails \nbecause Plaintiffs and Jennifer Smith were not engaging in a negotiation such that \nany affirmative steps to conceal material information could have been taken.  See \nHarton, 81 N.C. App. at 298. \n83. Therefore, the Court concludes  that Jennifer Smith  did not  owe the \nPlaintiffs a duty to disclose.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims for fraud by omission and \nconcealment against Jennifer Smith are DISMISSED. \n2. Mike Smith \n84. Plaintiffs allege Mike Smith owed them a fiduciary duty as “the majority \ncontrolling shareholder” of CBB,  that he was allegedly “responsible for officially \nexecuting the fraudulent transfers” to Siskey, and therefore “in fact held all the cards \nto allow the transfers to take place.”  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 384, Strack, ECF No. 33.)  \nPlaintiffs argue this set of facts gave rise to a duty to disclose. \n85. The Court has concluded that some Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of fiduciary \nduty fail as a matter of law .  Therefore, any claims for  fraud by omission and \nconcealment based on that underlying duty also fail.  (See supra ¶¶ 54–63.) \n86. Plaintiffs’ claims for fraud by omission and concealment  also fail because \nPlaintiffs have not come forth with evidence of an omission  or, if there was an \nomission, any evidence of that omission’s materiality .  In response to the Moti ons, \nPlaintiffs argue that the Smiths provided Siskey with information about CBB which \nwas not shared with Plaintiffs, and that such information prompted Siskey to \npurchase the Plaintiffs’ ownership interest s.  ( Opp’n Br. 11.)  However, in making \nthis argument, Plaintiffs make no citation to the record, and instead indicate that \nalleged inside information was provided to Siskey, without stating what that \ninformation was.  (Opp’n Br. 11.) \n87. Plaintiffs allege in their complain ts that Mike Smith’s December 2006 \nemail to Siskey stating that he was “approached by an investment group seeking to \npurchase [CBB]” was a material fact that Mike Smith had a duty to inform Plaintiffs \nof, including any other information provided to Siskey,  before processing their unit \nsale documents.   (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶  388–89, Strack, ECF No. 33.)  Plaintiffs \nargue this information was “affirmatively concealed” by the Smiths.  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 390, Strack, ECF No. 33.) \n88. The undisputed evidence before the Court, however, shows that Mike Smith \ndisclosed and discussed the subject of  CBB’s potential sale in the October 1 Letter .  \nThe letter provided that CBB was beginning “due diligence regarding a potential sale \nof the company” within the “next twelve mo nths[.]”  (Oct. 1 Ltr. 3.)  Plaintiffs have \nfailed to identify any evidence in the record showing other material information Mike \nSmith may have disclosed to Siskey , or other material information Siskey received \nfrom Mike Smith that Plaintiffs did not receive.  (See supra note 16 (discussing the \nDecember 2006 email and its lack of materiality to Plaintiffs’ decisions to sell their \nCBB units).) \n89. Because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the omission by Mike Smith \nof a material fact, the Court need not address additional arguments  raised by the \nparties.  Defendants have met their burden of demonstrating that proof of an \nessential element of this claim is missing, and Plaintiffs have failed to come forward \nwith evidence demonstrating that a genuine issue of material fact remains for trial .  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs ’ fraud by omission and concealment claims against Mike \nSmith are DISMISSED. \nC. Fraud in the Inducement \n90. “ ‘The essential elements of fraud [in the inducement] are: (1) [ a f]alse \nrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, \n(3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage \nto the injured party.’ ”  Media Network, Inc. v. Long Haymes Carr, Inc., 197 N.C. App. \n433, 453 (2009) (quoting Rowan Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 332 N.C. 1, 17 \n(1992)).  “[A]ny reliance on alleged false representations must be reasonable.  \nReliance is not reasonable where the plaintiff could have discovered the truth of the \nmatter through reasonable diligence, but failed to investigate.”  Cobb v. Pa. Life Ins. \nCo., 215 N.C. App. 268, 277 (2011) (citations omitted). \n91. Here, Plaintiffs allege that  the Smiths concealed material information by  \n(1) failing to inform them that an investment group was seeking to purchase CBB , \nand (2) failing to disclose  ongoing negotiations concerning a possible deal with Red \nBull.  (See Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 412–14, Strack, ECF No. 33.) \n92. However, Mike Smith disclosed substantially the same information to both \nSiskey and Plaintiffs.  The December 2006 email from Mike Smith to Siskey  stated \nmerely that he was “being approached by an investment group seeking to purchase \n[CBB]” and that CBB had secured “the Cap Can deal.”18  (2006 Email; see supra note \n16.)  In comparison, the October 1 Letter informed Plaintiffs  that CBB would “begin \ndue diligence regarding a potential sale of the company” within the “next twelve  \nmonths” but that “[a]ny potential sale of the company at this point is truly \nspeculative.”  (Oct. 1 Ltr. 3.)  While Plaintiffs did not receive this information at the \nsame time as Siskey, the same material facts were ultimately disclosed to them prior \nto Plaintiffs’ unit sales to Siskey.  Therefore, even if the time between the disclosure \nto Siskey and the disclosure to Plaintiffs was sufficient to constitute concealment, \nwhich it is not, Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence that the alleged concealment \nproximately caused their unit transfers. \n93. Furthermore, the uncontradicted evidence indicates that the Red Bull \nnegotiations did not begin until after Plaintiffs sold their units.  (M. Smith Aff. \n¶¶ 120–21 (stating that no discussions or negotiations with Red Bull began before \nOctober 2008, and that the first meeting with Red Bull did not occur until around \nDecember 2008); see also Merrell, ECF No. 139.21, R. Ex. Mike -20 (providing the 15 \nDecember 2008 Red Bull Presentation for members). )  Therefore, these claims also \n \n18 While Plaintiffs do not allege this as a basis for their fraud  in the inducement claims, the \nCap Can deal was also disclosed to memb ers in both the March 2007 Letter and October 1 \nLetter to all members, providing in relevant part, that an additional bottling line would be \ninstalled in November 2007, which would create a separate revenue stream for the company, \nand that it would be one of only three facilities in the country with this type of modernized \nproduction site for resealable aluminum cans.  (Mar. 2007 Ltr. 2; Oct. 1 Ltr. 2.) \nfail.  There is  simply no evidence of  false represent ations or conceal ment by the \nSmiths because such evidence could not have existed at the time Plaintiffs sold their \nunits.   As a result, Plaintiffs’ fraud in the inducement claims fail because Plaintiffs \nhave not forecast evidence that the Smiths falsely represented or concealed material \nfacts. \n94. The Plaintiffs’ fraud in the inducement claims also fail because there is no \nevidence that the Smiths had a n intent to deceive Plaintiffs.  To the contrary, the \nrecord indicates that Mike Smith took precautions to protect Plaintiffs from an \ninformational disadvantage in the event they bought or sold units.  The record is clear \nthat in or around October 2007, Mike Smith informed CBB’s corporate counsel at \nWishart Norris of Siskey’s potential knowledge of a sale of the Company and of his \nintent to purchase units.  The resulting October 1 and 3 Letters corrected the possible \nasymmetry in information between Siskey and the Plaintiffs by disclosing that CBB \nwas preparing itself for a possible sale of the company during the next twelve months.  \nAfter providing this information, Mike Smith and other CBB members waited until \nOctober 15, two weeks after the October 1 Letter was sent to members, to sign any \nConsent Agreements approving some Plaintiffs’ unit sales to Siskey.  Against this \nfactual backdrop, Plaintiffs have come forward with no record evidence to support a \nfinding that the Smiths intended to deceive Plaintiffs. \n95. Finally, Plaintiffs have failed to present evidence indicating they could not \nhave discovered the truth of the matter through reasonable diligen ce.  Rather, t he \nevidence before the Court  discloses that, even after receiving the October 1 Letter,  \nPlaintiffs made no investigation or substantive inquiries of the Smiths  or CBB \nregarding any offers to purchase CBB, negotiations with a potential buyer, or other \ndealings relevant to each Plaintiffs’ decision to sell.  Given their failure to investigate, \nPlaintiffs’ claims also fail because the record does not contain evidence indicating that \nreliance on the alleged concealment was reasonable. \n96. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ fraud in the inducement claims against Mike Smith \nand Jennifer Smith are hereby DISMISSED. \nD. Constructive Fraud \n97. “In order to survive a motion for summary judgment on [a] claim for \nconstructive fraud, plaintiffs [a]re required to forecast evidence showing: ( 1) a \nrelationship of trust and confidence; (2) that the defendant took advantage of that \nposition of trust in order to benefit himself[;] and (3) that the plaintiff was as a result \ninjured.”  Strickland v. Lawrence, 176 N.C. App. 656, 663 (2006) ; see also Morgan v. \nTurn-Pro Maint. Serv., LLC , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 5, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 15, \n2020). \n98. First, Plaintiffs allege that Jennifer Smith, as an employee of CBB who \ncommunicated company information to members, owed a fiduciary duty to the \nPlaintiffs.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 467, Strack, ECF No. 33.)  Given that the Court has \nalready concluded Jennifer Smith owed no such duty to the Plaintiffs, the Court also \nconcludes that based on the evidence of record, no relationship of trust and confidence \nexisted between Plaintiffs and Jennifer Smith.  See White v. Consol. Planning, Inc. , \n166 N.C. App. 283, 294 (2004) (“The primary difference between pleading a claim for \nconstructive fraud a nd one for breach of fiduciary duty is the constructive fraud \nrequirement that the defendant benefit himself .”).  As a result, Plaintiffs’ claims for \nconstructive fraud against Jennifer Smith are hereby DISMISSED. \n99. Next, Plaintiffs contend that, as the majority member of CBB, Mike Smith \nwas in a relationship of trust and confidence with them.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 464, \nStrack, ECF No. 33.)   However, even if Plaintiffs establish the first element of the \nconstructive fraud claims, those claims against Mike Smith fail because Plaintiffs do \nnot show “through undisputed evidence [that Mike Smith] benefited himself through \nhis [alleged] misconduct.”  Morgan, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 5, at *25. \n100. Plaintiffs allege that the Smiths received financial incentives, lavish \nvacations, and other gifts from Siskey as a result of their misconduct .  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 84, 485, Strack, ECF No. 33.)   However, the Smiths argue that they did \nnot benefit from the Plaintiffs’ unit sales to Siskey, and in fact there is no evid ence \nthat the Smiths even sought to benefit from those transactions.  (Br. Supp. Mots. 19.) \n101. The uncontradicted evidence shows that the  relationship between Siskey \nand Mike Smith, and the favors or other indirect benefits allegedly flowing from \nSiskey to Mike Smith, are unrelated to the alleged misconduct.  Plaintiffs argue that \nmeals, events, and a $250 monetary donation to the Smiths’ son’s school, were \nreceived by the Smiths in exchange for enabling Siskey to purchase Plaintiffs’ CBB \nunits.  ( See Dep. Jennifer Smith 83:21 –84:13, 87:13 –88:9, 91:16– 92:8, 102:19– 25, \nMerrell, ECF No. 159.1 [“J. Smith Dep.”].)  However, this evidence is insufficient to \nestablish that the Smiths received financial incentives, lavish vacations, and gifts \nfrom Siskey as a result of the alleged misconduct.  Instead, Plaintiffs’ unit sales are \ndistinct from any incidental benefit the Smiths may have received because of  their \nfriendship with Siskey .  Plaintiffs have failed to offer any evidence in the record \nsufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mike Smith obtained \na benefit from his alleged misconduct. \n102. Therefore, the Court conclude s that Plaintiffs’ constructive fraud claims \nagainst Mike Smith fail because Plaintiffs have not forecast evidence that Mike \nSmith obtained any benefit from his alleged breach of fiduciary duty .  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs’ constructive fraud claims against Mike Smith are hereby DISMISSED. \nE. Negligent Misrepresentation \n103. “It has long been held in North Carolina that ‘the tort of negligent \nmisrepresentation occurs when (1) a party justifiably relies (2) to his detriment (3) on \ninformation prepared without reasonable care (4) by one who owed the relying party \na duty of care.’ ”  Simms v. Prudential Life Ins. Co. of Am. , 140 N.C. App. 529, 532 \n(2000) (quoting Raritan River Steel Co. v. Cherry, Bekaert & Holland , 322 N.C. 200, \n206 (1988)).  To succeed on such a claim, “[a] plaintiff must show that the defendant \nowed a duty to provide ‘complete and accurate information’ and that such duty was \nbreached before a negligent misrepresentation claim will lie.”  Martinez v. Reynders, \n2013 NCBC LEXIS 31, at **15–16 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 10, 2013)  (quoting Simms, \n140 N.C. App. at 533). \n104. Plaintiffs allege that, prior to the sale of their CBB units, the Smiths were \nnegligent when providing information to  them, and as a result made negligent \nmisrepresentations to them.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶  494, Strack, ECF No. 33.)   The \ninformation Plaintiffs allege was misrepresented is the same as argued by Plaintiffs \nin support of their fraud in the inducement claim.   Further, Plaintiffs contend that \nthey “actually and justifiably relied on the information provided by Mike Smith, \nJennifer Smith and [CBB] to their detriment in deciding whether to sell their [units.]”  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 505, Strack, ECF No. 33.) \n105. As a preliminary matter, there is no evidence to support a contention that \nJennifer Smith, as an administrative employee of C BB, owed members individually \na duty of care.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ negligent misrepresentation claims against Jennifer \nSmith fail as a matter of law. \n106. Further, Plaintiffs have come forward with no evidence to create a jury \nissue as to  justifiable reliance.  “ A party cannot establish justified reliance on an \nalleged misrepresentation if the party fails to make reasonable inquiry regarding the \nalleged statement.”  Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 367 N.C. 363, 369 (2014) (citing \nPinney v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 146 N.C. App. 248, 256 (2001) (“It has also been \nheld that when a party relying on a misleading representation could have discovered \nthe truth upon inquiry, the complaint must [show] that he was denied the opportunity \nto investigate or that he  could not have learned the true facts by exercise of \nreasonable diligence.”)). \n107. Plaintiffs have produced no evidence suggesting they made reasonable \ninquiry into the alleged misrepresentations by the Smiths.  See State Props., LLC v. \nRay, 155 N.C. App. 65, 73 (2002) (“Reliance is not reasonable if a plaintiff fails to \nmake any independent investigation”).   As stated herein, CBB information was \navailable to members upon request, pursuant to the Operating Agreement.  The \nrecord additionally discloses that no Plaintiff made inquiry of the Smiths or CBB \nregarding any of the matters claimed to have been misrepresented to them. \n108. As discussed above , several Plaintiffs testified that they did not rely on \nstatements made by the Smiths  when selling their units  and may have even \ndisregarded any statements by the Smiths when deciding to sell their units .  For \nexample, plaintiff Robert Nastase’s statement was that, when selling his CBB units, \nhe “just relied on what [Siskey] told  [him].”  ( Dep. R obert Nastase 41:24– 42:16.)  \nPlaintiffs have failed to come for ward with evidence that they made reasonable \nindependent investigation or were denied the opportunity to investigate these \nmatters. \n109. Therefore, the facts in this case permit only the conclusion that Plaintiffs \ndid not justifiably rely on any alleged negligent misrepresentations by the Smiths.   \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ negligent misrepresentation claims against the Smiths are \nDISMISSED. \nF. North Carolina Securities Fraud \n110. Plaintiffs assert a claim for securities fraud against the Smiths pursuant to \nN.C.G.S. §§ 78A-56(b1) and (c)(2) for allegedly aiding Siskey’s purchase of the \nPlaintiffs’ CBB units.  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Mike Smith, acting as alter \nego of CBB, violated N.C. G.S. § § 78A-12(1), (5), and §  78A-56(b1) by (1) aiding \nSiskey’s purchase of CBB units,  (2) “reporting to the Plaintiffs’ IRA custodian the \nvalue of their [units] in an amount that allowed Rick Siskey to make \nmisrepresentations to [members] ,” and  (3) permitting Siskey to “use company \nletterhead to communicate with [members]”  with the knowledge that Siskey was \npurchasing Plaintiffs’ CBB units.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶  431, Strack, ECF No. 33.)  \nFurther, Plaintiffs allege that Jennifer Smith, acting as an employee of CBB, violated \nN.C.G.S. §§ 78A-12(1), (5), and § 78A-56(c)(2) by assisting Mike Smith in the alleged \nmisconduct and thus “contributing substantial assistance” to Siskey.  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 433, Strack, ECF No. 33.) \n111. Defendants contend that , even if the evidence before the Court might \nsomehow satisfy the proof requirements for such a claim,  Plaintiffs’ securities fraud \nclaims are barred by the statute of limitations.  (Br. Supp. Mot s. 52–53.)  The Court \nagrees. \n112. The statute of limitations for securities fraud actions is gover ned by  \nN.C.G.S. § 78A-56(f): \n(f) . . . No person may sue under this section for any other violation of \nthis Chapter more than thr ee years after the person discovers facts \nconstituting the violation, but in any case no later than five years after \nthe sale or contract of sale,  except that if a person who may be liable \nunder this section engages in any fraudulent or deceitful act that \nconceals the violation or induces the person to forgo or postpone \ncommencing an action based upon the violation[ (the “Concealment \nException”)], the suit may be commenced not later than three years after \nthe person discovers or should have discovered that the act was \nfraudulent or deceitful. \n \n113. As this Court explained in Aldridge v. Metropolitan Life Insurance \nCompany, the North Carolina Securities Act (the “NCSA”) creates  \na private right of action for persons injured from the sale of securities or \nthe rendering of investment advice.   Generally, the suit must be \ninitiated within five years following the sale or the rendering of the \ninvestment advice regardless of when the plaintiff discovered the \nviolation.  However, where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant acted \nfraudulently or deceitfully in concealing a violation of the NCSA or \nNCIAA, a discovery rule applies, and the five -year limitation does not \nnecessarily bar the plaintiff’s ability to bring the claim. \n \nAldridge, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *54–55. \n114. The last sale by any of the Plaintiffs in these actions was by Dallas Pendry, \nJr., who executed his APA on 25 March 2008 and whose Consent Agreement was \nsigned on 27 March 2008.  (Strack, ECF No. 191.224, R. Ex. 531.)  Therefore, Plaintiffs \nhad to bring  their securities fraud claims no later than April 2013.   The Merrell, \nStrack, and Cochrane lawsuits were each initiated in late 2019, and the Short lawsuit \nwas initiated in 2021.\n19  Therefore, even in the light most favorable to all Plaintiffs, \nthe statute of limitations bars an action for securities fraud. \n115. Additionally, Plaintiffs have come forward with no evidence to support \napplication of the C oncealment Exception provided in N.C .G.S. §  78A-56(f).  That \nexception would toll the statute of limitations if the Smiths engaged “ in any \nfraudulent or deceitful act t hat conceal [ed] the violation” or induced Plaintiffs “ to \nforgo or postpone commencing an action based upon the violation.”  N.C.G.S. § 78A-\n56(f).  Accordingly , the Court conclude s that Plaintiffs’ securities fraud claims are \n \n19 Merrell was filed on 8 November 2019, (Merrell, ECF No. 2), Strack on 14 November 2019, \n(Strack, ECF No. 3), and Cochrane on 12 December 2019, (Cochrane, ECF No. 3).  The Short \naction was initiated on 20 September 2021, (Short, ECF No. 3), after voluntarily dismissing \nwithout prejudice a previous action initiated on  20 December 2019, ( Short v. Smith, 2019 \nCVS 23856, ECF No. 3). \nbarred by the  five year  statute of limitation s in N.C.G.S. §  78A-56(f).  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs’ securities fraud claims against the Smiths are DISMISSED. \nG. Civil Conspiracy \n116. “The elements of a civil conspiracy are: (1) an agreement between two or \nmore individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act in an unlawful way; \n(3) resulting in injury to plaintiff inflicted by one or more of the  conspirators; and \n(4) pursuant to a common scheme.”  Strickland v. Hedrick, 194 N.C. App. 1, 19 (2008) \n(internal marks omitted).  “Sufficient evidence of the agreement must exist to create \nmore than a suspicion or conjecture in order to justify submission  of the issue to a \njury.”  Boyd v. Drum, 129 N.C. App. 586, 592 (1998) (citations omitted). \n117. It is well established that \n[t]here is no independent cause of action for civil conspiracy.  Only where \nthere is an underlying claim for unlawful conduct can a plaintiff state a \nclaim for civil conspiracy by also alleging the agreement of two or more \nparties to carry out the conduct and injury resulting from that \nagreement. \n \nToomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. App. 462, 483 (2002) (citations omitted). \n118. Plaintiffs allege that Mike Smith, Jennifer Smith, and Siskey agreed that \n“Siskey would offer and purchase the Plaintiffs’ [units] of [CBB] in order to cash in \non distributions to [members]” and that “Siskey would provide financial and other \nincentives to Mike and Jennifer Smith  in exchange for their acquiescence and \nassistance[.]”  (Second Am. Compl. ¶  484, Strack, ECF No. 33.)   Plaintiffs argue, \ntherefore, that the Smiths and Siskey conspired to commit securities fraud.  (Second \nAm. Compl. ¶ 262, Merrell, ECF No. 24.) \n119. However, each of the Plaintiffs’ underlying claims against the  Smiths fail \nas a matter of law, and therefore summary judgment has been granted and the claims \ndismissed.  Accordingly, there are no remaining underlying claim s of unlawful \nconduct to support the civil conspiracy claim.  See Toomer, 155 N.C. App. at 483. \n120. The civil conspiracy claims also fail for the standalone reason that  the \nPlaintiffs have not offered evidence that the Smiths entered into any agreement with \nSiskey to accept financial incentives in exchange for facilitating or improperly aiding \nSiskey’s purchase of the Plaintiffs’ CBB units.  A civil conspiracy must be shown \nbeyond mere suspicion or conjecture in order to justify submission to a jury.  The \nPlaintiffs only argument in opposition to the Motions on  this point is the conclusory \nstatement that “[s]ubstantial evidence exists to show the Smiths engaged in a \nconspiracy ‘deal’ with Rick Siskey,” including a citation to Jennifer Smith’s \nDeposition.20  (Opp’n Br. 18.) \n121. Therefore, the Court conclude s that the Smiths have met their burden on \nsummary judgment to establish that a crucial element of Plaintiffs’ claims for civil \nconspiracy fails as a matter of law, and Plaintiffs have  failed to forecast evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations or contentions, showing that \n \n20 Plaintiffs cite  Jennifer Smith’s deposition testimony, addressing email communication \nbetween the Smiths and Siskey on 5 September 2008.  (J. Smith Dep. 94:16–97:17; see also \nJ. Smith Dep. Ex. 60.)  The 5 September 2008 email, sent by Jennifer Smith to Mike Smith \nand Siskey, states “Mike says he’s busting his a** on this deal for you[.]”  (J. Smith Dep. Ex. \n60.)  The evidence before the Court demonstrates that the word “deal” was used to mean a \n“potential sale of the company ,” and therefore Plaintiffs’ reliance on the email, which was \nsent after all Plaintiffs sold their shares to Siskey, is not enough to demonstrate an agreement \nto engage in an unlawful act as to the Plaintiffs.  Rather, it amounts only to a suspicion, and \nthere is no other evidence offered by Plaintiffs for the Court to conclude otherwise. \nthey can at least establish a prima facie case at trial.  Accordingly, the Plaintiffs’ civil \nconspiracy claims against the Smiths are hereby DISMISSED. \nV.      CONCLUSION \n122. THEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Motions.  \nAll remaining claims raised by Plaintiffs against  Defendants Mike Smith and \nJennifer Smith are hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 11th day of January, 2023. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
