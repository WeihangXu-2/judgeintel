Jolly, Esq. and Elizabeth L. \nKing, Esq., for Defendants Milton R. Hardison and Hardison & Chamberlain \nCPA’s PA. \n \nBrooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard LLP, by Gary S. Parsons, \nEsq. and Jessica Thaller -Moran, Esq. , for Defendants James A. MacDonald \nand The MacDonald Law Firm, PLLC.  \nMcGuire, Judge. \nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1. This action arises out of an ownership dispute regarding t hree North \nCarolina limited liability companies : Judges Road Industrial Park, LLC (“Judges \nRoad”), Carolina Coast Holdings, LLC (“CCH”), and Parkway Business Park, LLC \n(“Parkway”) (collectively, “the Chisum/Campagna LLCs” or “the LLCs”).  \n2. Plaintiff Dennis Chisum, Rocco J. Campagna (“Rocco”), and Richard J. \nCampagna (“Richard” ; collectiv ely, Rocco and Richard are referred to as “the \nCampagnas”) formed each of the Chisum/Campagna LLCs in the mid -to-late 1990s \nfor the purpose of developing and managing commercial properties and particularly \ncommercial rental properties.  (Verified Compl., ECF No. 1, at ¶ 21.)  Plaintiff, Rocco, \nand Richard each contributed capital and received ownership interest s in the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs.  (Id. at ¶ 25.)  Plaintiff’s original ownership stake in the \n \n \nChisum/Campagna LLCs was as follows:  33.333% ownership i n Judges Road; \n33.333% ownership in CCH; and 16.667% ownership in Parkway.  (Id. at ¶ 16.) \n3. Defendant James A. MacDonald is an attorney who practices with the \nMacDonald Law Firm, PLLC (collectively, James A. MacDonald and the MacDonald \nLaw Firm, PLLC are referred to as “MacDonald”).  MacDonald provides legal counsel \nto the Chisum/Campagna LLCs and to Plaintiff individually.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 17 –18, 22–\n23.) \n4. Hardison p rovides professional accounting services to each of the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs.  (Id. at ¶ 24.) \n5. Plaintiff alleges that MacDonald and Hardison assisted the Campagnas \nin an unlawful scheme to “oust” Plaintiff from the Chisum/Campagna LLCs by \nextinguishing Plaintiff’s ownership interests in and transferring Plaintiff’s interests \nin the LLCs to the C ampagnas.  (ECF No. 1 , at ¶¶ 1–2.)  The alleged scheme was \ncarried out from 2007 until early 2016 through a series of unnecessary, “sham” capital \ncalls, transfers of assets, and other improper financial transactions  involving the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs.  (Id. at ¶¶ 29–124.) \n6. Plaintiff alleges that Hardison participated in the scheme to extinguish \nPlaintiff’s membership interests in the Chisum/Campagna LLCs as follows: \n7. In May 2011, the Campagnas informed Hardison that CCH had \nassessed a capital call of  $63,500 against Plaintiff to pay off the balance of a loan \ntaken out by CCH , but for which Plaintiff was not responsible .  ( Id. at ¶ ¶ 49–65.)  \nHardison requested copies of the Chisum/Campagna LLC s Operating Agreements \n \n \nbecause he was  concerned about whether  it was appropriate for the Campagnas to \nassess a capital call individually against Plaintiff.  (Id. at ¶ 65.) \n8. On July 8, 2011 the Campagnas, MacDonald, and Hardison met to \ndiscuss the elimination of Plaintiff’s interest in CCH.  (ECF No. 1, at ¶ 66.)  The \n“parties in attendance decided [ ] Hardison should reflect the loss of [Plaintiff]’s \ninterest in CCH” on Plaintiff’s 2010 IRS Form K -1 for CCH.  (Id. at ¶ 67.)  Plaintiff \nreceived the Form K-1 in October 2011.  (Id. at ¶ 68.)   \n9. Hardison deducted $63,500 from Plai ntiff’s capital account in CCH, \nleaving over $10,000 remaining in Plaintiff’s capital account.  Hardison determined \nthat the remaining $10,000 “should be ‘forfeited’ to the Campagnas” and reflected \nsuch forfeiture on CCH’s tax documents.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 71 –72.)  The forfeiture of \nmembership interest is not permitted under the CCH Operating Agreement.  (Id. at \n¶ 75.)  \n10. In June 2012 Hardison wrongfully advised Judges Road, Rocco, and \nRichard that Plaintiff’s interest had been diluted to the point that he had no \nremaining equity in the Judge s Road.  (ECF No. 1, at ¶ 74.)  Hardison knew that \nextinguishing Plaintiff’s interest in Judges Road would “cause significant damage” to \nPlaintiff.  (Id. at ¶ 76.)  \n11. In the summer and fall of 2012 , the Campagnas transferred all or \nsubstantially all of the assets of CCH to themselves and to another entity they own, \nThe Camp Group, LLC.  (Id. at ¶ 101.)  Hardison reviewed the closing statements for \nall of these transfers.  (Id.)  \n \n \n12. On January 18, 2013, Hardison assisted the Campagnas’ transfer of all \nor substantially all of the assets of Parkway to themselves through the Camp Group.  \n(ECF No. 1, at ¶ 104.)   \n13. Between April 15, 2014 and September 15, 2014 , the Campagnas told \nHardison that they believed Plaintiff was no longer a member o f Judges Road.  ( Id. \nat ¶ 96.)  Hardison prepared and filed tax documents reflecting that Plaintiff no \nlonger had a membership interest in Judges Road despite “knowing this information \nwas not correct or supported by [Judges Road’s] books and financial records.”  (Id. at \n¶ 97.) \n14. Hardison has “treated [Plaintiff] as a non -member of Judges Road and \nParkway since October of 2014.”  (Id. at ¶ 110.) \n15. At unspecified times, Hardison has reviewed “excessive management \nfees” and personal expenses paid to the Campagnas by the Chisum/Campagna LLCs \nand has “classified them as loans.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 47–48.) \n16. On July 19, 2016 , Plaintiff filed suit against the Campagnas in the \nSuperior Court of New Hanover County in Chisum v. Campagna, No. 2016-CVS-2419 \n(hereinafter “the Campagna Lawsuit”). (ECF No. 1, at ¶ 125.)  The original complaint \nin the Campagna L awsuit did not make derivative claims on behalf of the  \nChisum/Campagna LLCs against the Campagnas, and did not contain claims against \nMacDonald or Hardison.  \n17. On August 2, 2016, Plaintiff’s counsel, on behalf of Plaintiff, sent letters \nto Judges Road, CCH, and Parkway  (the “Demand Letters”).  ( Id. at ¶ 130; Aff. of \n \n \nJames A. MacDonald, ECF No. 24.1 , at ¶¶ 2 –7, Attachments I, II, and III.)   The \nDemand Letters demanded that the LLCs make available to Plaintiff for inspection \nand copying books and records  of the respective LLCs.  The Demand Letter s also \naccused the Campagnas of selling Judges Road’s “primary asset” without Plaintiff’ s \nconsent, attempting to oust Plaintiff from the  Chisum/Campagna LLCs, using the \nLLCs’ assets for their “personal benefit,” and converting LLC property to themselves.  \n(ECF No. 24.1, at Attachments I, II, and III. )  The Demand Letters demanded that \neach of the LLCs “institute an action on its own behalf against Rocco Campagna and \nRichard Campagna, asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, \nunfair and deceptive trade practices, constructive trust, and any other claims which \nmay be appropriate as a result of their fraudulent capital  calls, personal use [of the \nLLC’s] property, and attempts to dissolve [Plaintiff]’s ow nership interest in [the \nLLCs].”  (Id.)  The Chisum/Campagna LLCs did not respond to the Demand Letters.  \n(ECF No. 1, at ¶ 130.) \n18. Plaintiff alleges that he learned through discovery  in the Campagna \nLawsuit that MacDonald and Hardison were  involved in “a conspiracy with the \nCampagnas to oust [Plaintiff] from the [Chisum/Campagna] LLCs.”  (ECF No. 1, at \n¶ 127.)  On February 8, 2017 Plaintiff filed an amended complaint stating derivative \nand individual claims against MacDonald and Hardison for breach of fiduciary duty, \nconstructive fraud, professional negligence, civil conspiracy, unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices, and punitive damages.  \n \n \n19. In the Campagna Lawsuit, on March 13, 2017 Hardison filed motions to \ndismiss.  On April 6, 2017, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed without prejudice his claim \nfor constructive fraud against Hardison. On July 7, 2017, Plaintiff voluntarily \ndismissed without prejudice all remaining claims against Hardison prior to the \nCourt’s decisions on the motions to dismiss.  \n20. On July 21, 2017, Plaintiff filed the Verified Complaint in this action . \nThe Verified Complaint attempts to state derivative c laims on behalf of the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs, and direct, individual claims by Plaintiff, against Hardison \nfor breach of fiduciary duty ( ECF No. 1 , at ¶¶ 143 –48, “ Third Claim for Relief ”); \nprofessional negligence ( Id. at ¶¶  149–53, “ Fifth1 Claim for Relief ”); and  civil \nconspiracy (Id. at ¶¶ 154–59, “Sixth Claim for Relief”).   \n21. On October 12, 2017, Hardison filed the Motions to Dismiss.  On \nDecember 21, 2017 Plaintiff filed a brief in opposition to the Motions.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp. \nto Hardison’s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 32.)  Hardison did not file a reply brief.  The \nCourt held a hearing on the Motions, and they are now ripe for disposition. \nII. ANALYSIS  \n22.  Hardison moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s derivative claims pursuant to \nNorth Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) (hereinafter “Rule(s)”) on the grounds \nthat Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue those claims because he has not made the pre-\nsuit demand on the Chisum/Campagna LLCs required by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D-8-01 \n                                            \n1 In the Verified Complaint, the fourth claim raised is incorrectly labeled as the “Fifth Claim \nfor Relief, and the fifth claim is incorrectly labeled as the “Sixth Claim for Relief.”   \n \n \n(hereinafter “G.S.”).  (ECF No. 23, at pp. 1–2.)2  In support of the  motion, Hardison \nhas filed the Affidavit of James A. MacDonald, with the Demand Letters attached as \nexhibits.  (ECF No. 23.1, at Attachments 1, 2, and 3.)  Hardison also seeks dismissal \nof Plaintiff’s individual clai ms for breach of fiduciary duty,  professional negligence, \nand civil conspiracy under Rule 12(b)(6).  (ECF No. 21.) \n23. “If a party does not have standing to bring a claim, a court has no subject \nmatter jurisdiction to hear the claim.”  Estate of Apple v. Commercial Courier Express \nInc., 168 N.C. App. 175, 177, 607 S.E.2d 14, 16 (2005).  “Standing concerns the trial \ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore properly challenged by a Rule \n12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.”  Fuller v. Easley, 145 N.C. App. 391, 395, 553 S.E.2d 43, \n46 (2001) (citations omit ted); see also, Aubin v. Susi , 149 N.C. App. 320, 324, 560 \nS.E.2d 875, 878  (2002) (“Standing is a ne cessary prerequisite to a court’ s proper \nexercise of subject matter jurisdiction.”).  “A motion to dismiss for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction is not viewed in the same manner as a motion to dismiss for failure \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Tart v. Walker, 38 N.C. App. 500, \n502, 248 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1978).  A court may consider matters outside the pleadings \nin determining whether su bject matter jurisdiction exists.  Id.; see also, Keith v. \nWallerich, 201 N.C. App. 550, 554, 687 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2009). \n24. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \n                                            \n2 Alternatively, Hardison moves for dismissal of the derivative claims under Rule 12(b)(6), \ncontending that Plaintiff does not  properly plead the derivative claim s.  For the reasons \nstated below in section II. A.,  the Court does not need to address H ardison’s alternative \ngrounds for dismissal of the derivative claims. \n \n \ntrue, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some \nlegal theory, whether properly labeled or not.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 N.C. \nApp. 669, 67 0, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).   Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports \nplaintiff’s claim; (2)  when the complaint reveals on its face the absence of fact \nsufficient to make a good claim; [or] (3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint \nnecessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 \nS.E.2d 222, 224 (1985).  Otherwise, “a complaint should not be dismissed for \ninsufficiency unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff is entitled to no relief under \nany state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.”  Sutton v. Duke, 277 \nN.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) (emphasis omitted).   \n25. The Court construes the complaint liberally and accepts all allegations \nas true.  Laster v. Francis , 199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009).  \nHowever, the Court is not required “to accept as true allegat ions that are merely \nconclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.” Good Hope \nHosp., Inc. v. N.C. HHS, Div. of Facility Servs. , 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d \n873, 880 (2005)  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) .  “[T]he trial court \ncan reject allegations that are contradicted by the documents attached, specifically \nreferred to, or incorporated by reference in the complaint.”  Laster, 199 N.C. App. at \n577, 681 S.E.2d at 862.  \n26. The Court will first address the derivati ve claims, and then address \nPlaintiff’s individual claims. \n \n \nA. Derivative claims \n27. Hardison first argues that the derivative claims in the Verified \nComplaint should be dismissed for lack o f subject matter jurisdiction.  Hardison \ncontends that the Demand Letters do not meet the requirements of G.S. § 57D -8-\n01(a), which provides, in pertinent part, that \n[A] member may bring a derivative action if th e following \nconditions are met: \n . . .  \n(2) The member made written demand on the LLC to take \nsuitable action, and either (i) the LLC notified the member \nthat the member’s demand was rejected, (ii) 90 days have \nexpired from the date the demand was made, or (iii) \nirreparable injury to the LLC would result by waiting for \nthe expiration of the 90-day period. \n \nG.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2). \n \n28. Hardison contends that the Demand Letters do not contain a sufficiently \nparticular request for the LLCs to bring an action against Hardison.  Hardison argues \nthat the Demand Letters describe, and seek corporate action by the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs regarding, only alleged unlawful conduct of the \nCampagnas, and do not mention  any conduct of , or seek action against, Hardison.  \n(Hardison’s Br. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss Deriv. C laims, ECF No. 24 , at pp. 1 –8.)    \nPlaintiff concedes  that the Demand Letter s do not ask for any action against \nHardison, but contends that “ the subject matter of the claims that Mr. Chisum \nwanted the LLCs to bring was abundantly clear,” and the Demand Letters “permitted \nthe Chisum/Campagna LLCs to assess their rights and obligations in connection with \n \n \nthe alleged freeze -out, the capital calls, and the s ale of the Judges Road property.”  \n(Pl.’s Br. Opp. Hardison Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 32, at pp. 8, 9.) \n29. “By its very nature, a derivative action requires that the [member] \nbringing s uch an action have proper  standing to bring the action.”  Anderson v. \nSeascape at Holden Plantation, LLC , 241 N.C. App. 191, 203, 773 S.E.2d 78, 87 \n(2015).  “ The challenge to the adequacy of any pre -suit demand is, inter alia , a \nchallenge to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over the derivative claims.”  Petty \nv. Morris, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 67, at *4 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 16, 2014).   In order to \nhave standing to bring derivative claims, a plaintiff must have made a proper \ndemand.  Miller v. Burlington Che m. Co. LLC , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *26  (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Jan . 27, 2017) ; see also, G.S. § 57D -8-01.  The purpose o f the demand \nrequirement is to  \n[A]llow[ ]  the corporation the opportunity to remedy the \nalleged problem without resort to judicial action, or, if the \nproblem cannot be remedied without judicial action, to \nallow the corporation, as the true beneficial party, the \nopportunity to bring suit first against the alleged \nwrongdoers.   \nBridges v. Oates , 167 N.C. App. 459, 467 -68, 605 S.E.2d 685, 691  (2004) ( citation \nomitted). \n30. The pre -suit demand required by section 57D -8-01(a) “ must be made \nwith sufficient clarity and particularity to permit the corporation . . . to assess its \nrights and obligations and determine what action is in the best interest o f the \ncompany.”  Miller, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *29 ( quoting Garlock v. Hilliard , 2000 \nNCBC LEXIS 6, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 22, 2000)).   \n \n \n[T]he Court must [ ] determine whether the Demand Letter \nconstituted a proper demand to take suitable action so as  \nto satisfy the demand requirement.   In so doing, the Court \nmust compare the derivative claims asserted in a \ncomplaint against the specific demands a plaintiff  has \nmade prior to filing suit.   \nId. at *30 (quotation marks omitted).  \n31. The Court has compared the derivative claims raised in the Verified \nComplaint with the Plaintiff’s demands for suitable action in the Demand Letters.  \nAs an initial matter, the claims in the lawsuit involve different parties than the \nparties identified in the Demand Letters.  T he derivative claims in this lawsuit  \n(relevant to the Motions to Dismiss)  are brought against Hardison.  The Demand \nLetters do not allege, or even suggest, that Hardison or any other party outside of the \nCampagnas participated in any wrongdoing.  The Demand Letters do not request that \nthe Chisum/Campagna LLCs investigate the conduct of, or potential claims against, \nHardison or other parties.  Finally, the Demand Letters expressly demand only that \nthe LLCs file  suit against Rocco and Richard , and do not ask that the LLCs bring \nlegal action against any other parties. \n32. A comparison of the causes of action  raised against Hardison in the \nVerified Complaint against the claims discussed in the Demand Letters yields similar \nresults.  In the Verified Complaint, Plaintiff alleges claims for professional negligence \nand civil conspiracy against Hardison.  The Demand Letters do not suggest that any \nof the conduct about which Plaintiff complains involved professional negligence, let \nalone negligence by Hardison.  Rather, the Demand Letters make clear that Plaintiff \nalleges the Campagnas intentionally took actions to extinguish his  ownership \n \n \ninterests and otherwise improperly benefitted themselves through their operation of \nthe Chisum/Campagna LLCs.  In addition, the D emand Letters do not suggest that \nthe Campagnas conspired with anyone  or obtained assistance from any parties \noutside of the Chisum/Campagna LLCs in engaging in the alleged misconduct.  \n33. Plaintiff also raises a derivative claim in this lawsuit against Hardi son \nfor breach of fiduciary duty.  While the Demand Letters clearly allege that the \nCampagnas breached fiduciary duties, they do not claim that Hardison breached any \nduties towards the Chisum/Campagna LLCs. \n34. Plaintiff contends that he only learned about Hardison’s involvement in \nthe Campagnas’ misconduct through discovery in the Campagna Lawsuit , but does \nnot explain why he did not make another demand on the Chisum/Campagna LLCs \nonce he learned of Hardison’s alleged conduct .  T he allegat ions in the Verified \nComplaint also establish that Plaintiff was aware that Hardison was the accountant \nfor the Chisum/Campagna LLCs for years prior to filing this lawsuit .  Plaintiff does \nnot explain why he could not have asked the Chisum/Campagna LLCs to investigate \nwhether the LLCs’ outside accountants reviewed financial records that would have \nexposed the Campagna’s actions in the Demand Letters. \n35. The Court concludes that , under the facts alleged in this case,  the \ndemand that the Chisum/Campagna LLCs take action against Rocc o and Richard \nCampagna did not provide the Chisum/Campagna LLCs with a sufficiently clear and \nparticular demand for suitable action, as required by G.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2), regarding \nclaims against Hardison.  See, e.g., Miller, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at * 31–35 (directly \n \n \ncomparing the language of the demand letter against the allegations supporting each \nclaim of the complaint, and holding that the general demand that the defendant LLC \n“take suitable action” in response to alleged injuries was insufficient t o provide the \nplaintiff standing to later bring the derivative claims as alleged).   \n36. Hardison’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s derivative claims pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing should be GRANTED, and the derivative claims \ndismissed WITHOUT PREJUDICE.   \nB. Individual Claims \n37. Hardison seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s individual claims for breach of \nfiduciary duty, professional negligence, and civil conspiracy  under Rule 12(b)(6) .  \nHardison moves for dism issal on the grounds , inter alia, that: Plaintiff’s claims in \nthis action are  barred by the two dismissal rule in Rule 41(a)(1) ; Plaintiff’s direct, \nindividual claims fail because Plaintiff has not alleged facts that would bring his \nclaims under the exceptions as articulated in  Barger v. McCoy Hillard &  Park, 346 \nN.C. 650, 658, 488 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1997) ; and Plaintiff fails to allege the existence \nof a civil conspiracy involving Hardison .  The Court will address these grounds for \ndismissal in turn. \ni. The two dismissal rule does not bar Plaintiff’s lawsuit \n38. Hardison argues that Rule 41(a)(1)  bars Plaintiff from br inging this \nlawsuit because the voluntary dismissal  of the c laim for constructive fraud , and \nsubsequent voluntary dismissal of t he remaining claims , against Hardison  in the \nCampagna Lawsuit constitute two dismissals for purposes of the “two dismissal” rule.  \n \n \n(Hardison’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 22 , at pp. 5 –8.)  Plaintiff contends \nthat the two dismissal rule applies only to dismissals of two separate actions, and not \nto separate dismissals of claims brought in one single action.  (ECF No. 32, at pp. 6–\n7.) \n39. Rule 41(a)(1)provides in pertinent part as follows: \n[A]n action or any claim therein may be dismissed by the \nplaintiff without order of court (i) by filing a notice of \ndismissal at any time before the plaintiff rests his case, \n. . . . Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or \nstipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that \na notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the \nmerits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in \nany court of this or any other state or of the United States, \nan action based on or including the same claim. \n \n40.  The two -dismissal provision in  Rule 41(a)(1)  demonstrates “the \nlegislature[’s] inten[t] that a second dismissal of an action asserting claims based \nupon the same transaction or occurrence as a previously dismissed action would \noperate as an adjudication on the merits and bar a third action based upon the same \nset of facts.”  Dunton v. Ayscue, 203 N.C. App.  356, 358, 690 S.E.2d 752, 753 ( 2010) \n(quoting Richardson v. McCracken Enterprises., 126 N.C. App. 506, 509, 485 S.E.2d \n844, 846, disc. review denied as to additional issues , 347 N.C. 269, 493 S.E.2d 745 \n(1997), aff’d per curiam, 347 N.C. 660, 496 S.E.2d 380 (1998)).  \n41. In the Campagna Lawsuit , Plaintiff brought derivative and individual \nclaims against Hardison for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, professional \nnegligence, civil conspiracy, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and punitive \ndamages.  Plaintiff subsequently voluntarily dismissed , without prejudice,  the \n \n \nconstructive fraud claim against Hardison  in the Campagna Lawsuit .  On July 7, \n2017, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, the remaining claims against \nHardison in the Campagna Lawsuit.  In other words, Plaintiff dismissed the claims \nhe made against Hardison in the Campagna Lawsuit once, albeit in two separate \npleadings, and dismissed his action against Hardison in the Campagna Lawsuit only \nonce.  C.f.,  Hopkins v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 111 N.C. App. 179, 182, 432 S.E.2d 142, 144 \n(1993). \n42. In Hopkins, the plaintiff filed an  initial action  against two separate \ndefendants; Ciba-Geigy Corp. and Lebanon Chemical Corporation.  Id.  The plaintiffs \nthen filed two separate notices of voluntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1), the \nfirst dismissing Lebanon Chemical and the second dismissing Ciba-Geigy.  Id.  Once \nthe two dismissals were filed, “plaintiffs had dismissed their entire first action.”  Id.  \nWhen the plainti ffs filed a second lawsuit against Ciba -Geigy based on the same \nclaims, Ciba-Geigy argued that the separate dismissals of the two defendants in the \nfirst lawsuit barred the plaintiffs’ lawsuit pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1).  Id.  The Court \nof Appeals rejected the defendants’ argument, holding: \nThe two -dismissal rule, however, applies only when th e \nplaintiff has twice dismissed an action based on or \nincluding the same claim.  Here, plaintiffs dismissed their \nfirst action only once. Accordingly, the two -dismissal rule \ndoes not apply in this case. Consequently, plaintiffs' \nvoluntary dismissal of their claim against defendant Ciba-\nGeigy did not constitute an adjudication on the merits \npursuant to Rule 41(a)(1) and plaintiffs were not barred \nfrom bringing this action. \nId. (emphasis in original; internal citation omitted). \n \n \n43. While Hopkins involved the dismissals of separate parties  within the \nsame first lawsuit , and not dismissals of separate claims, the principle is the same \nwhen applied to separate dismissals of all of  the claims against Hardison in the \nCampagna Lawsuit.  The action against Hardison has previously been dismissed only \nonce.  The two dismissal rule does not apply to this action. \n44. Hardison’s reliance on the holding in Richardson v. McCracken \nEnterprises, Inc. in support of its position is misplaced.  In Richardson, the plaintiff \nvoluntarily dismissed a Franklin County lawsuit, and then voluntarily dismissed a \nseparate Wake County lawsuit, against the same defendant . Both lawsuits alleged \nclaims arising from the contamination to the plaintiff’s property caused by the \ndefendant, but alleged different causes of action.  The Court of Appeals held that two-\ndismissal rule in Rule 41(a)(1) barred the plaintiff’s attempt to sue the defendant a \nthird time  because the two dismissed actions were “based upon the same core of \noperative facts relating to the contamination of plaintiffs’ property, and all of the \nclaims could have been asserted in the same cause of action.”  Richardson v. \nMcCracken Enters., 126 N.C. App. 506, 509, 485 S.E.2d 844, 846–47 (1997).  \n45. The facts in Richardson are distinguishable from the facts in this case.  \nIn Richardson, the plaintiff filed two separate lawsuits, or actions, against the same \ndefendant arising from the same alleged wrong, and volunt arily dismissed both of \nthose actions.  H ere, Plaintiff’s action against Hardison arising from Hardison’s \nalleged breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and participation in a conspiracy has \nbeen dismissed only once .  Considering the context of the Richardson decision and \n \n \nthe plain language of the statute, the Court concludes that the two-dismissal rule was \nnot designed to apply to cases like this one, in which individual claims  against a \ndefendant are dismissed one time  by separate voluntary dismissals with in a single \naction, and then brought again as a separate action in a new lawsuit. \nii. Plaintiff does not allege grounds that would permit him to \npursue direct, individual claims for breach of fiduciary duty \nor professional negligence against Hardison  \n \n46. Plaintiff makes direct, individual claims against Hardison for breach of \nfiduciary duty  and professional negligence based on nearly identical allegations .   \nPlaintiff alleges that Hardison breached fiduciary duties and was negligent by:  \n“participating in and  facilitating[:]” the “ sham capital calls [;]” the improper \nassessments of capital calls against Plaintiff; and “declar[ing] that [Plaintiff] was no \nlonger a member of the Chisum/Campagna LLCs” (ECF No. 1 , at ¶¶ 146(a) and (b); \nsee also, 151(a), (b), and (c)); “participating in and facilitating the attempt to freeze \n[Plaintiff] out of the Chisum/Campagna LLCs by . . . providing incorrect information \nto and wrongly advising Judges Road” that Plaintiff “had no remaining equity” in the \nLLCs (Id. at ¶¶  146(c), 1 51(c)); preparing Form K -1s that “improperly reflect[ed] \n[Plaintiff]’s ownership interes ts in” the Chisum/Campagna LLCs  (Id. at ¶¶ 146(g) –\n(h), ¶¶ 151(f)–(h)); and “participating in and facilitating” the improper transfers and \nsale of assets of the Chisum/C ampagna LLCs to the Campagnas and entities \ncontrolled by them (Id. at ¶¶ 146(d) and (e), 151(d) and (e)).  Plaintiff also alleges that \nHardison breach ed fiduciary duties by “[d]irecting that [Plaintiff]’s ownership \n \n \ninterest in CCH be forfeited to the Campa gnas in violation of the CCH Operating \nAgreement.”  (Id. at ¶ 146(f).) \n47. Hardison contends that Plaintiff does not have grounds to bring the \nindividual claims because he has not alleged Hardison owed him a special duty nor \nthat Plaintiff suffered separate and distinct injury.  (ECF No. 32, at pp. 16–17 (citing \nBarger, 346 N.C. at 658, 488 S.E.2d at 219).)  \n48. Generally, a shareholder of a corporation “cannot pursue individual \ncauses of action for wrongs or injuries to the corporation.”  Miller, 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n6, at *13  (citing Barger, 346 N.C. at 658, 488 S.E.2d at 219).  However, there are two \nexceptions to the general rule “(1) where there is a special duty, such as a contractual \nduty, between the wrongdoer and the shareholder, and (2) where the shareholder \nsuffered an injury separate and distinct from that suffered the corporation and the \nother shareholders.”  Id. (hereinafter, the “Barger exceptions”).  \n49. The Barger exceptions offer litigants who have suffered an injury in \ntheir individual capacity as a result of the actions of a third party two different, \nindependent paths for maintaining a direct claim belonging to the corporation.  See, \ne.g., Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 143, 749 S.E.2d 262, 269 (2013) (“Thus, we next \nconsider whether plaintiffs can recover under the special duty or unique personal \ninjury exception ” (emphasis added)).  The Barger exceptions have been applied to \nmembers of limited liability companies.  Miller, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *12–14; see \nalso, e.g., Dawson v. Atlanta Design Assocs., Inc. , 144 N.C. App. 716, 719 –20, 551 \nS.E.2d 877, 879 –80 (2001) (applying the Barger exceptions to limi ted liability \n \n \ncompanies); Levin v. Jacobson , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 111, at *13 –15 n.4 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Dec. 7, 2015) (“Although it originally discussed fiduciary duties in the context of \ncorporations, Barger and its progeny apply equally to LLCs.”).  \n50. Preliminarily, Plaintiff concedes that “ his claims that the Campagnas \ndiverted assets, cash, and corporate opportunities from the Chisum/Campagna LLCs \nto outside entities are properly derivative claims ,” and that he cannot maintain \nindividual claims for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence against \nHardison based on those allegations  (ECF No. 32, at p. 11.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s \ndirect, individual claims for professional negligence a gainst Hardison arising from \nalleged improper transfers or sales of Chisum/Campagna LLCs’ assets, or diversions \nof corporate opportunities,  alleged in paragraphs 146(d) and (e), and 151(d) and (e) \nof the Verified Complaint must be dismissed. \n51. Plaintiff’s r emaining claims against Hardison for breach of fiduciary \nduty and professional negligence arise from Hardison’s alleged participation in the \nCampagnas’ efforts to extinguish Plaintiff’s ownership interest in the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs.  Plaintiff contends that he may pursue direct, individual \nclaims against Hardison because the claims “involve a special duty to Mr. Chisum \nand/or harm to him that is distinct from any harm caused to the LLC as a whole.”  \n(ECF No. 32, at p. 11.)   However, the facts alleged in th e Verified Complaint fail  to \nsupport Plaintiff’s contention. \n52. As an initial matter, Plaintiff has not alleged facts that would support a \nclaim that Hardison owed a special duty to Plaintiff individually.  Plaintiff alleges \n \n \nthat “as the accountant . . . for the Chisum/Campagna LLCs . . . [Hardison] owed a \nfiduciary duty to Mr. Chisum, as one of the three members of the Chisum/Campagna \nLLCs.”  (ECF No. 1 , at ¶ 145. )  This is simply incorrect.  In North Carolina the \nrelationship between an accountant and a clie nt is  not per se  fiduciary in nature.  \nE.g., Harrold v. Dowd, 149 N.C. App. 777, 784, 561 S.E.2d 914, 919 (2002) (“We have \nfound no case stating that the relationship between accountant and client is  per \nse fiduciary in nature.”).  \n53. In order to plead a fiduciary relationship arising from an accountant -\nclient relationship a plaintiff  must “allege circumstances sufficient to show that a \nfiduciary relationship existed between the parties.”   Id. at 784, 561 S.E.2d 920.   \nIn general terms, a fiduciary relati on is said to exist \n[w]herever confidence on one side results in superiority and \ninfluence on the other  side; where a special confidence is \nreposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound \nto act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of \nthe one reposing the confidence.  \nKing v. Bryant, 369 N.C. 451, 464, 795 S.E.2d 340, 34 9 (2017) (internal citation and \nquotation marks omitted).  “[I]t is not sufficient for plaintiff to allege merely that \ndefendant had won his trust and confidence and occupied a position of dominant \ninfluence over him. . . . It is necessary for plaintiff to allege f acts and \ncircumstances . . . which created the relation of trust and confidence.”  Terry v. Terry, \n302 N.C. 77, 83, 273 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1981).   \n54. Plaintiff does not allege that Hardison provide d Plaintiff with personal \naccounting services , only that Hardi son was the Chisum/Campagna LLC s’ \naccountant.  Plaintiff has not alleged any facts or circumstances that suggest the \n \n \ncreation of a relationship of trust and confidence such that Hardison owed Plaintiff a \nfiduciary duty in his role as a member of the Chisum/Campagna LLCs.  \n55. Plaintiff also argues that a special duty arose because “[Hardison] had \na longstanding relations hip with both the LLCs and with [Plaintiff], and the acts \ncomplained of arose directly out of that close, confidential relationship.”  ( ECF No. \n32, at p. 15.)  Plaintiff, however, has not pleaded any facts that support the allegation \nthat he had  a “close, confidential relationship” with Hardison .  To the contrary, \nPlaintiff does not allege that he ever had any direct communications, or any contact, \nwith Hardison.  Rather, Plaintiff simply alleges that Hardison prepare d certain \ndocuments that Plaintiff  subsequently received, or provided advice to the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs regarding Plai ntiff’s interests in the LLCs  that Plaintiff \nsubsequently learned about. \n56. Finally, Plaintiff appears to argue that Hardison may have breached \nfiduciary duties and a duty of care owed to Plaintiff by withholding unspecified \n“information” from Plaintiff and “sending false K -1s to” Plaintiff.  (ECF No. 32, at \np. 15.)  These arguments are not supported by pleaded facts.  Plaintiff was a member, \nand not a manager, of the Chisum/Campagna LLCs, and Plaintiff does not allege facts \nthat would support that Hardison had a duty to disclose information to Plaintiff.   In \naddition, Plaintiff does not allege that Hardison sent the form K -1s to him, but only \nthat he “received” the K -1s from an unsp ecified source.  (ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 68, 98.)   \nEven if the Court assumes Hardison sent the K -1s to Plaintiff,  Plaintiff does not \n \n \nexplain how this would impose fiduciary obligations on Hardison , and does not \nprovide any legal support for such a proposition.   \n57. The Court is not required to accept Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations that \nhe had a confidential relationship with Hardison  or that Hardison owed Plaintiff a \nfiduciary duty.  Plaintiff does not allege that Hardison owed him a special duty, and \nPlaintiff cannot assert direct, individual claims for breach of fiduciary duty or \nprofessional negligence under the special duty Barger exception. \n58. Plaintiff also contends that he may pursue direct, individual claims  \nbecause he suffered an injury separate  from the  injury suffered by the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs and its other members.  Plaintiff, however, does not allege \nthat the Chisum/Campagna LLCs or their members suffered any injury , or have \nclaims arising, from the efforts to extinguish his ownership interests.   \n59. In order to sustain a direct, individual claim under the separate injury \nexception, it is essential that Plaintiff allege that the Chisum/Campagna LLCs or the \nother members of the LLCs suffered an injury from Hardison’s alleged breach of \nfiduciary duty or ne gligence that would give  rise to a claim belonging to  the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs. Chisum v. Campagna, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 102, at *22–23 \n(N.C. Super. Court Nov. 7, 2017); see also, Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 219 \n(holding that a  shareholder may bring a direct, individual claim for injuries to the \nshareholder’s corporation where “the injury suffered by the shareholder is separate \nand distinct from the injury sustained by the other shareholders or the corporation \nitself”);  Piazza v. Kirkbride, 785 S.E.2d 695, 713, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 371, at *51 \n \n \n(2016) (“Here, the [p]laintiffs’ claim is not brought as a derivative action, but is \nbrought because they suffered individual injury distinct from the injury sustained by \nthe corporation itself.” ).  The Barger exceptions allow a member to pursue claims \nbelonging to  the limited liability company against a third party.  Where the \ncompany and its other members have suffered no injury, and the corporation has no \nclaim against the third party for the alleged wrong, a plaintiff cannot establish a \nseparate and distinct injury.    Plasman v. Decca Furniture (USA), Inc. , 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 80, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 21, 2016) (Noting that it is a “well-established \nrule that shareholders . . . generally may not bring individual actions to recover what \nthey consider their share of  the damages suffered by the corporation .”) ( emphasis \nadded; quotation omitted). \n60. Plaintiff does not allege that the Chisum/Campagna LLCs or the \nCampagnas were injured by the attempts to extinguish Plaintiff’s membership \ninterests in the LLCs.  In fact, Plaintiff concedes that “the incorrect information Mr. \nHardison provided to the Chisum/Campagna LLCs regarding [Plaintiff]’s ownership \ninterest only resulted in harm to [Plaintiff], not the Chisum/Campagna LLCs ,” and \nthe “sham capital calls . . . only harmed [Plaintiff]” and “did not affect the value of \nthe LLCs.”  (ECF No. 32 , at p. 12  (emphasis added ).)  This  concession is fatal to \nPlaintiff’s attempt to bring direct, individual claims against Hardison based on these \nallegations.  Since Plaintiff has not alleged, or argued, that the Chisum/Campagna \nLLCs or the Campagnas suffered injuries as a result of Hardison’s breach of fiduciary \nduty or negligence related to the  attempts to eliminate Plaintiff’s membership \n \n \ninterests, his direct, individual claims for breach of fiduciary duty and professional \nnegligence must be dismissed.  \n61. Hardison’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s individual claim s for breach of \nfiduciary duty and professional negligence against Hardison should be GRANTED. \niii. Plaintiff has properly pleaded that Hardison was part of a \ncivil conspiracy \n \n62. Plaintiff also alleges that Hardison p articipated in a  civil conspiracy.  \n(ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 154–59.)  “It is well established that ‘there is not a separate civil \naction for civil  conspiracy in North Carolina.’”   Plasman, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 80, at \n*33  (quoting Esposito v. Talbert & Bright, Inc. , 181 N.C. App. 742, 747, 641 S.E.2d \n695, 698 (2007)).  In order to properly plead a civil conspiracy, a complaint must allege \n“(1) an agreement between two or more individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do \na lawful act in an unlawful way; (3) resulting in injury to plaintiff inflicted by one or \nmore of the conspirators; and (4) pursuant to a common scheme.”   Elliott v. Elliott , \n200 N.C. App. 259, 264, 683 S.E.2d 405, 409 (2009) (emphasis added).   \nIn civil  conspiracy, recovery must be on the basis of \nsufficiently alleged wrongful overt acts.   The charge \nof conspiracy itself does nothing more than associate the \ndefendants together and perhaps liberalize the rules of \nevidence to the extent that under proper circumstances the \nacts and conduct of one might be admissible against all.  \nShope v. Boyer , 268 N.C . 401, 405, 150 S.E.2d 771, 773 –774 (1966); see also , \nGoRhinoGo, LLC v. Lewis , 2011 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 9, \n2011) (“Having joined the conspiracy, [two individual defendants] became exposed to \nliability with [co-defendant] and any other co-conspirators for damages caused by any \nact in furtherance of the common scheme.”). \n \n \n63. Plaintiff alleges that the Campagnas, MacDonald, and Hardison  \nconspired “ to unlawfully extinguish [Plaintiff]’s mem bership interests in the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs, tra nsfer all Chisum/Campagna LLCs [ sic] assets to” the \nCampagnas, and “dissolve each of the Chisum/Campagna LLCs .”  ( ECF No. 1, at \n¶ 155.)  Plaintiff further alleges that the Campagnas, MacDonald, and Hardison  \ncommitted unlawful acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.  (Id. at ¶¶ 157–58.)  Finally, \nPlaintiff alleges that he has suffered damages as result of the conspiracy.   (Id. at \n¶ 159.) \n64.  Hardison argues that Plaintiff cannot maintain a claim for civil \nconspiracy because the other claims against Hardison fail, and because Plaintiff has \nnot sufficiently alleged an agreement between Hardison and the other D efendants.  \n(ECF No. 32, at pp. 14–15.)  Hardison’s first argument is incorrect.  The dismissal of \nthe claims against Hardison for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence \ndoes not bar him from liability for damages resul ting from the other conspirator s’ \nacts.  Shope, 268 N.C. at 405, 150 S.E.2d at 774 (“To create civil liability for conspiracy \nthere must have been an overt act committed by one or more of the conspirators \npursuant to the scheme and in furtherance of the objective ” (quotation omitted). ).  \nHere, Plaintiff has alleged t hat co -conspirators MacDonald and the Campagn as \ncommitted unlawful overt acts  to extinguish Plaintiff’s membership interests in the \nChisum/Campagna LLCs that resulted in injury to Plaintiff.   \n65. The allegations regarding Hardison’s knowledge of and agreement to the \nalleged conspiracy are somewhat contradictory.  Plaintiff alleges that Hardison knew \n \n \nabout the scheme and participated in and facilitated certain actions in support of the \nconspiracy.  (See e.g., ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 48, 64, and 76.)  Other allegations, however, \nsuggest that Hardison raised concerns about the attempts to extinguish Plaintiff’s \ninterest in CCH, and raised questions about when Hardison first learned about the \nscheme.  (ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 65, 95 and 96.) \n66. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that at this stage of the case, Plaintiff \nsufficiently pleads that Hardison knew of and agreed to the scheme to eliminate \nPlaintiff’s membership interests in the Chisum/Campagna LLCs, and that Hardison \nperformed lawful actions in furtherance of that scheme and/or can be held liable for \nthe alleged unlawful acts performed by MacDonald and the Campagnas.  Accordingly, \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s individual claim for civil conspiracy should \nbe DENIED.  \n \n  \n \n \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s \nclaims against Hardison from the Verified Complaint is GRANTED, in part, and \nDENIED, in part, as follows: \n1. Hardison’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s derivative claims for \nlack of standing is GRANTED, and the derivative claims are \ndismissed WITHOUT PREJUDICE.   \n2. Hardison’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s individual claim  for \nbreach of fiduciary duty is GRANTED.   \n3. Hardison’s motion to dismiss  Plaintiff’s individual claim for \nprofessional negligence is GRANTED.   \n4. Hardison’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s individual claim for civil \nconspiracy is DENIED.   \n \n     SO ORDERED, this 18th day of April, 2018. \n \n  /s/ Gregory P. McGuire  \nGregory P.
