PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n {2}  The present action was filed in the Mecklenburg County Superior Court \non February 29, 2008.  The Plaintiff in the caption was stated as Revolutionary \nConcepts, Inc., a North Carolina Corporation, 1 however, numbered paragraph 1 of \nthe Complaint identified Revolutionary Concepts, Inc. as a Nevada corporation.  \nThe North Carolina corporation the same day dismissed an action it had begun a \nmonth earlier in Mecklenburg County.  At oral argument, Plaintiff’s counsel \nstipulated that the present action should be deemed to have been initially filed by \nthe Nevada corporation, which on February 29, 2008 was the assignee of the patent \npreviously owned by the North Carolina corporation.  During the pendency of this \naction, on August 29, 2008 the two corporations merged with the Nevada \ncorporation as the surviving entity.  Plaintiff contends that on the date of the \nmerger, it became the successor to the rights of the North Carolina corporation, \nsuch that the North Carolina corporation should be deemed to have re-filed the \nearlier action within the one-year savings provision of Rule 41, or alternatively that \nit should be allowed to amend the Complaint with relation back.   \n{3}  The matter was designated as a Complex Business Case by Order of \nChief Justice Sarah Parker on February 29, 2008 and first assigned to Chief \nBusiness Court Judge Ben F. Tennille by Order dated March 5, 2008, and \nreassigned to the undersigned following Judge Tennille’s retirement.   \n{4}  Revolutionary Concepts, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (“RCI-NC”) \nfiled a professional negligence action in the Mecklenburg County Superior Court in \nJanuary 2007 alleging the same acts of negligence now asserted in this action (the \n“Initial Action”).  RCI-NC voluntarily dismissed its action without prejudice \n                                                 \n1  The Complaint also included Ronald Carter (“Mr. Carter”) as an individual Plaintiff.  This court \ndismissed his claims by its March 9, 2010 Order. \n \npursuant to Rule 41 on February 29, 2008. 2  No subsequent action was filed by RCI-\nNC prior to its August 29, 2008 merger into RCI-NV. \n{5}  Also on February 29, 2008, Revolutionary Concepts, Inc., a Nevada \nCorporation (“RCI-NV”) filed its Complaint asserting rights as an assignee of the \npatent in question as a result of an assignment from the inventor, Mr. Carter.  \n(Compl. ¶ 11).  On this date, RCI-NC remained as a separate corporation. 3  \n {6}  On May 16, 2008, Defendants moved to dismiss the corporate action by \nRCI-NV for lack of subject matter jurisdiction asserting that the claims arise under \n28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) of the patent laws and therefore fall within the exclusive \njurisdiction of the federal courts.  Defendants also moved to dismiss the separate \nindividual claims of Mr. Carter for lack of standing because he had assigned all of \nhis patent rights.  By Order dated March 9, 2010, Judge Tennille dismissed Mr. \nCarter’s individual claims but denied the motion to dismiss the corporation’s claims \nfinding that they are governed by state law.  Defendants appealed.  The Court of \nAppeals affirmed by Order dated July 5, 2011.   \n {7}  Following remand, on October 5, 2011, Defendants filed two motions for \nsummary judgment.  The first motion was filed on behalf all Defendants (“Joint \nMotion”) challenging Plaintiff’s claims for malpractice, failure to supervise, \nrespondeat superior, and misappropriation of funds.  Defendants assert that at the \n                                                 \n2  Legal malpractice claims are subject to a three (3) year statute of limitations.  See  N.C.  G EN . STAT . \n§ 1-15(c) (2011).  The one-year “savings provisions” of Rule 41 extended RCI-NC’s deadline to re-file \nthe Initial Action through and including February 29, 2009.  N.C.  G EN . STAT . § 1A-1, Rule 41 (2011).  \n  \n3   Plaintiff RCI-NV did not allege that either RCI-NC or Mr. Carter assigned to it any malpractice \nclaim that either may have had as of February 29, 2008.  Any such effort would have raised issues as \nto whether a right to bring a professional negligence claim is assignable, an issue not yet squarely \naddressed by the North Carolina appellate courts, but which right would assuredly be challenged \nunder general principles precluding assignment of personal tort claims.   See Charlotte-Mecklenburg \nHosp. Auth. v. First of Ga. Ins. Co. , 340 N.C. 88, 91, 455 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1995), rehearing denied , \n340 N.C. 364, 458 S.E.2d 186 (1995) (indicating that the assignment of personal torts “gives the \nassignee control of the claim and promotes champerty.  Such a contract is against public policy and is \nvoid”); see also Horton v. New South Ins. Co. , 122 N.C. App. 265, 269, 468 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1996) \n(indicating that bad faith refusal to settle insurance claim, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious \nbreach of contract claims based on contractual relationship are unassignable); see also Investors \nTitle Ins. Co. v. Herzig , 330 N.C. 681, 689, 413 S.E.2d 268, 272 (1992) (indicating that assignment of \npersonal tort claims “would wreak havoc by creating a market for claims of a personal nature”).  The \ncourt need not reach the issue in this case.  \ntime this action for professional negligence was instituted, the real party in interest \nfor any such claim was not RCI-NV, but RCI-NC, the Defendants’ client at the time \nof the acts complained of, and that the action is now time-barred because RCI-NC \nfailed to re-file its action prior to February 29, 2009, one year following RCI-NC’s \nRule 41 dismissal.  The second motion (“Individual Motion”) was filed on behalf of \nGreg N. Clements (“Clements”) and Christopher L. Bernard (“Bernard”) based on \nthe limitation of liability provision of N.C.  Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-30.  The motions have \nbeen fully briefed, the Court heard oral argument, and the motions are now ripe for \ndisposition.  Although a grant of the Joint Motion would resolve the case, \nDefendants request that the court rule as well on the Individual Motion to facilitate \na complete appellate review. \n \nII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n {8}  The court does not make findings of fact when ruling upon a motion for \nsummary judgment, but rather determines whether the record discloses facts which \nare not in material dispute or the omission of facts that cannot be supplied which \ndictate that the claims should be dismissed as a matter of law.  It is, however, \nappropriate that the court delineate those undisputed facts or lack of facts which \nthe record discloses in order to provide context for the court’s ruling on the motion.  \nSee Hyde Ins. Agency v. Dixie Leasing Corp. , 26 N.C. App. 138, 215 S.E.2d 162 \n(1975).  The following recited facts are either not disputed by the record, or if \ncontested, are accepted and construed in favor of Plaintiff.  \n {9}  Plaintiff RCI-NV is a Nevada corporation with a principal place of \nbusiness in Matthews, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  RCI-NC was a North \nCarolina corporation.  RCI-NC and RCI-NV remained separate corporations until \nAugust 29, 2008, when RCI-NC merged into RCI-NV leaving RCI-NV as the \nsurviving entity post-merger.  \n {10}  Defendant Clements Walker PLLC (“CW”) is a North Carolina \nprofessional limited liability company with a principal place of business in \nMecklenburg County, North Carolina.  CW was formerly known as Dougherty \nClements Law Group PLLC and Clements & Hofer PLLC.   \n {11}  Defendant F. Rhett Brockington (“Brockington”) is an individual who, at \nthe time of the conduct complained of, was employed by CW as a patent agent.  \nBrockington is registered to practice before the Untied States Patent and \nTrademark Office (“USPTO”) but is not a licensed attorney.  \n {12}  Defendants Ralph H. Dougherty (“Dougherty”), Clements, and Bernard  \nmaintain their principal place of business in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North \nCarolina.  Each are licensed North Carolina attorneys who are registered or \nlicensed to practice before the USPTO.   \n {13}  Mr. Carter is the inventor named in an October 9, 2003 application (the \n“Application”) for a United States Patent entitled “AUTOMATED AUDIO VIDEO \nMESSAGING AND ANSWERING SYSTEM.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 9−10.)    \n {14}  In August 2003, Mr. Carter retained CW to prepare and file  \nthe Application.  (Compl. ¶ 20.) \n4   After presenting Mr. Carter with a standard fee \nagreement, the firm filed the Application with the USPTO according to its usual \nprocedures.  (Compl. ¶¶ 21−22.)  As part of the Application, Mr. Carter requested \nthat the firm file a Nonpublication Request (the “Request”) pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § \n122, so that the Application would not be published by the USPTO until after it was \nissued as a patent.  (Compl. ¶ 23.)  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 122, an applicant must \nrescind the Request and notify the USPTO within forty-five (45) days of any foreign \npatent filing.  (Compl. ¶ 23.)   \n {15}  On July 19, 2005, Mr. Carter and RCI-NC asked CW and Brockington \n5  \nto prepare and file an application for international patent rights (the “PCT  \n                                                 \n4   Defendants contend that any attorney-client relationship was only with Mr. Carter individually.  \nThey acknowledge that for purposes of summary judgment, the court must assume that an attorney-\nclient relationship existed with RCI-NC; however, Defendants indicate that Plaintiff has made no \nargument and points to no evidentiary record establishing that the Defendants were ever asked to \nundertake legal representation of RCI-NV which had retained separate counsel.   \n \n5   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Dougherty was the attorney responsible for supervising the \nactions of Brockington related to the Application and PCT Application.   \nApplication”) pursuant to procedures established by the Patent Cooperation Treaty \nand corresponding United States law.  (Compl. ¶ 24.)  RCI-NC paid CW three- \nthousand-six-hundred dollars ($3,600.00) for the preparation and filing of the PCT \nApplication.  (Compl. ¶ 25.)  \n {16}  Thereafter, CW prepared, and Mr. Carter signed, paperwork for the \nPCT Application naming RCI-NC as applicant and Mr. Carter as the inventor; but \nthe PCT Application was never filed by either CW, Brockington, or Dougherty.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 25−26.)  Despite the failure to file the PCT Application, on September \n15, 2005, Brockington filed a form with the USPTO rescinding the previous Request \ncausing the Application to be published by the USPTO on December 29, 2005.  \n(Compl. ¶ 27.)  Plaintiff alleges foreign patent rights were then lost.   \n {17}  On July 17, 2006, Mr. Carter assigned his entire right, title, and interest \nin the Application to RCI-NV.  (Compl. ¶ 11.) \n {18}  Plaintiff contends that Defendants’ failure to file the PCT Application \nprior to publication of the domestic Application was an act of professional \nnegligence which precludes Plaintiff from satisfying the “absolute public novelty” \nrequirement necessary for a successful patent application in many foreign countries \nincluding the European Union and Japan.  (Compl. ¶ 29.)   \n {19}  At the time this action was filed, RCI-NV was the assignee of the patent \nand had rights to prosecute the patent.  RCI-NC and Mr. Carter no longer had such \nrights.    \n {20}  The Complaint indicates that the primary acts alleged to constitute \nprofessional negligence occurred prior to the patent assignment. \n {21}  The Complaint does not assert requests or payment for services by the \nDefendants from RCI-NV after the date of the assignment. \n {22}  The Complaint does not allege that any attorney-client relationship \nexisted between Defendants and RCI-NV prior to the date of the assignment. \n \n \n \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n {23}  Pursuant to Rule 56(c), a party is entitled to summary judgment “if the \npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together \nwith affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \nand that any party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.  G EN . STAT . § \n1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2011).  The moving party bears the initial burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, which may be met by \nproving that an essential element of the opposing party’s claim is non-existent.  \nDeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co. , 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002).  If \nthe movant successfully makes such a showing, the burden shifts to the nonmovant \nto present specific facts establishing the presence of a genuine factual dispute for \ntrial.  Lowe v. Bradford , 305 N.C. 366, 369−70, 289 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1982).   \n \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nA.  The Joint Motion \n {24}  The Joint Motion contends that: (1) any professional negligence claim \nmust have been presented by RCI-NC, the real party in interest; (2) the Initial \nAction presenting that claim was voluntarily dismissed on February 29, 2008; (3) \nRCI-NV did not have standing to assert and did not assert professional negligence \nclaims owned by Carter or RCI-NC when filing the present action on February 29, \n2008; (4) RCI-NC failed to reassert its claim for professional negligence prior to \nFebruary 29, 2009 when such claim became time-barred; and (5) even if RCI-NV \nsucceeded to RCI-NC’s claims by operation of law as a result of the August 29, 2008 \nmerger, it succeeded only to such pending actions that had been instituted by RCI-\nNC, and RCI-NV cannot now claim that the present action instituted prior to the \nmerger to enforce RCI-NV’s rights as a patent assignee was converted into an action \nto enforce claims owned by RCI-NC but not asserted by RCI-NC prior to the merger.    \n{25}  Plaintiff contends that the Joint Motion exalts form over substance and \nthat either the Complaint in the present action should be amended pursuant to \nRule 15 to specify that it is being continued to enforce rights owned by RCI-NC, \nwith such amendment relating back to the date of original filing, or alternatively \nthat the court should determine that RCI-NV, as of the date of the merger, became \nthe real party in interest pursuant to Rule 17 to assert claims formerly owned by \nRCI-NC, and construe the Complaint such that RCI-NC should be deemed to have \nre-filed its professional negligence claim before February 29, 2009, within Rule 41’s \none-year savings provision without the necessity of a new action. \n{26}  The Parties do not dispute that had RCI-NC itself brought a second \naction prior to the August 29, 2008 merger, then such action would properly \ncontinue after August 29, 2008 and could do so in the name of either corporation.  \nThe question presented here is instead whether an action brought prior to the \nmerger by the merger successor can legitimately be claimed to have been an action \nby the predecessor company which had not itself brought such an action.   \n {27}  Under Rule 17, “[e]very claim shall be prosecuted in the name of the real \nparty in interest.”  N.C.  G EN . STAT . § 1A-1, Rule 17(a) (2011).   \n {28}  RCI-NC filed the Initial Action in its own name before voluntarily \ndismissing the Complaint on February 29, 2008.  Pursuant to Rules 41, RCI-NC’s \nclaim was then barred unless it was re-filed on or before February 29, 2009.  N.C.  \nG EN . STAT . § 1A-1, Rule 41 (2011).    \n {29}  RCI-NC did not itself re-file the action within one (1) year of the \ndismissal.  Accordingly, RCI-NC’s suit is time-barred unless the action by RCI-NV \nfiled in its own name pre-merger can be considered to have become an action by \nRCI-NC as of the date of the merger.   \n {30}  The undisputed evidence indicates that RCI-NC had no title, right, or \ninterest in the Application as of February 29, 2008, the date on which RCI-NV filed \nthis action.  The undisputed evidence is that: (1) the July 17, 2006 agreement \nassigns all of Mr. Carter’s right, title, and interest in the Application to RCI-NV, not \nRCI-NC; (2) Mr. Carter’s sworn deposition testimony indicates that he intended to \nassign his right, title, and interest in the Application to RCI-NV, and that no person \nor entity other than RCI-NV ever received assignment of the Application (Dep. of \nRonald E. Carter (“2nd Carter Dep.”) 81:16−82:5, May 25, 2010); and (3) RCI-NC \nand RCI-NV were separate corporations until the August 2008 merger, which \noccurred almost six (6) months after the filing of the Complaint.      \n {31}  “[I]n the event of a merger between two corporations, the surviving \ncorporation succeeds by operation of law to all the rights, privileges, immunities, \nfranchises and other property of the constituent corporations, without the necessity \nof a bill of sale, or other form of assignment.”  Econo-Travel Motor Hotel Corp. v. \nTaylor , 301 N.C. 200, 204, 271 S.E.2d 54, 58 (1980) (citation omitted).  N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 55-11-06(a)(4) indicates that post-merger, “[a] proceeding pending by or \nagainst any merging corporation may be continued as if the merger did not occur or \nthe surviving corporation may be substituted in the proceeding for a merging \ncorporation whose separate existence ceases in the merger.”  N.C.  G EN . STAT . § 55-\n11-06(a)(4) (2011).   \n {32}  If RCI-NC had been the Plaintiff in this action, the suit would properly \ncontinue after the merger irrespective of whether the surviving entity was \nsubstituted as a party.  However, such an action brought by RCI-NC prior to the \nmerger could not have properly asserted rights in the patent or Application because \nthose rights had been assigned to RCI-NV.  Likewise, RCI-NV does not claim it had \nbeen assigned RCI-NC’s tort claims.  Presumably, these facts animated RCI-NC’s \ndismissal of its action on February 29, 2008 and the separate filing by RCI-NV that \nsame day.  Those two actions also suggest that the intent was to concentrate on the \npatent rights which had been assigned, and to prosecute those rights by RCI-NV, \nthe real party in interest.  RCI-NV now seeks to have the action construed as the \nprofessional negligence claim it could not have asserted on February 29, 2008.  It \ndid not itself establish an attorney-client relationship with Defendants; it seeks now \nto rely on the professional relationship between Defendants and RCI-NC and acts \nwhich were complete prior to February 29, 2008.  Plaintiff seeks to invert N.C. Gen. \nStat. 55-11-06(a)(4).  It argues that as of the time of the merger, an action brought \nin the name of RCI-NV pre-merger was converted by the merger into an action by \nRCI-NC.  The court is unaware of any legal authority to support this argument.   \n {33}  Plaintiff contends that if this result did not arise by operation of law, the \ncourt should then, in fairness and equity, allow RCI-NV now to amend the \nComplaint from one asserting rights of RCI-NV as assignee, which were the only \nrights RCI-NV could have asserted at the time the Complaint was filed, to a \nComplaint asserting rights by RCI-NC which RCI-NC had not brought, and to have \nsuch amendment be effective as of February 29, 2008.  \n{34}  During oral argument, Plaintiff made an oral Motion to Amend the \nComplaint pursuant to Rule 15 (“Rule 15 Motion”) to cure the “technical defect” and \nto have the amendment relate back.  Under Rule 15(c), an amendment relates back \nto the time of the original pleading “unless the original pleading does not give notice \nof the transactions, occurrences, or series of transactions or occurrences, to be \nproved pursuant to the amended pleadings.”  N.C.  G EN . STAT . § 1A-1, Rule 15(c) \n(2011).  Here, the Complaint clearly alleges that patent rights had been assigned to \nand were now being asserted by RCI-NV as assignee. (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 10, 11, 32, 39.)  \nThe Complaint gives no fair notice that the suit was intended rather to be a re-filing \nof the professional negligence claim by RCI-NC which had been dismissed that \nsame day. 6   Even if the court were to now allow RCI-NV to amend its Complaint to \nassert rights previously owned by RCI-NC, such amendment should not relate back, \nand RCI-NC’s claims for professional negligence would remain time-barred. \n {35}  Plaintiff’s oral Rule 15 Motion is DENIED. \n {36}  Plaintiff’s Rule 17 argument is similarly unavailing.  At the time this \naction was filed, RCI-NV was the real party in interest for any claims based on the \nJuly 17, 2006 assignment agreement while RCI-NC was the real party in interest \nfor any tort claims arising out of the attorney-client relationship that existed \nbetween the Defendants and RCI-NC which had not been assigned.  RCI-NV \nstipulated that it brought the present action in its own name as assignee.  Even \nthough RCI-NV post-merger become a proper party to bring tort claims that had \nbeen owned by RCI-NC, it did not, in fact, bring them prior to February 29, 2009 \n                                                 \n6   RCI-NC and Mr. Carter could have but did not request that their Complaint in the Initial Action \nbe amended to join claims by RCI-NV as assignee.   \nwhen they became time-barred.  The mere act of the merger does not equate to the \nfiling of an action by or on behalf of RCI-NC.  Stated otherwise, the mere fact that \nRCI-NV might have by the merger become the real party in interest to assert the \ntort claims does not mean that the merger itself was the actual exercise of the right \nto bring those claims.  RCI-NV could have but did not bring an action based on \nthose tort claims and they became time-barred on February 29, 2009.    \n {37}  Defendants’ Joint Motion for summary judgment is then GRANTED. \n \nB.  The Individual Motion \n {38}  Clements and Bernard separately seek summary judgment dismissing \nthe claims against them for malpractice, failure to supervise, and respondeat \nsuperior asserting that they are protected from liability under N.C. Gen. Stat. § \n57C-3-30.  They also seek summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claim for \nmisappropriation of funds asserting that they did not personally receive the \nallegedly misappropriated funds or play any role in the manner in which the funds \nwere used. 7    \n {39}  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-30 provides, in pertinent part: \nA person who is a member, manager, director, executive, or any \ncombination thereof of a limited liability company is not liable for the \nobligations of a limited liability company solely by reason of being a \nmember, manager, director, or executive and does not become so by \nparticipating, in whatever capacity, in the management or control of \nthe business.  A member, manager, director, or executive may, \nhowever, become personally liable by reason of that person’s own acts \nor conduct.  \n \nN.C. \n G EN . STAT . § 57C-3-30 (2011). \n {40}  Plaintiff’s theory of liability is predicated upon Clements’ and Bernard’s \nfailure to detect and supervise the activities of Brockington in filing or failing to file \ndocuments associated with the Application and PCT Application.  The critical \n                                                 \n7  At oral argument and in its Response Brief in Opposition to Defendants’ Second Motion for \nSummary Judgment, Plaintiff conceded that neither Clements nor Bernard received any of the funds \nalleged to have been misappropriated and that those claims should be dismissed.   \ninquiry then is whether Clements’ and Bernard’s failure to supervise Brockington \ncan be considered their “own acts or conduct” within the meaning of the statute. \n {41}  The Court of Appeals was called upon to decide a similar issue in Babb \nv. Bynum & Murphrey , 182 N.C. App. 750, 643, S.E.2d 55, cert. denied , 362 N.C. \n233, 659 S.E.2d 434 (2008).  In Babb , the plaintiff sought to impose personal \nliability on a member of the defendant law firm based on his alleged failure to \ndetect the felonious activities of his colleague and failing to supervise a paralegal.  \nIn finding that such a failure to act does not satisfy the “own acts or conduct” \nrequirement of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-30, the court held the duty created by the \nstatute does not impose an affirmative obligation to investigate the actions of others \nin the firm absent actual knowledge of the wrongdoing, and that the plaintiff had \nfailed to offer evidence demonstrating the individual defendant’s knowledge of the \nwrongdoing.  Babb , 182 N.C. App. at 753, 643 S.E.2d at 57; see Spaulding v. \nHoneywell Int’l, Inc. , 184 N.C. App. 317, 646 S.E.2d 645 (2007) (finding no \nindividual liability for the LLC’s acts where plaintiff failed to allege any acts by the \nindividual member and the member did not undertake an independent duty to \nguarantee worker safety at the LLC’s plant).   \n {42}  Here, Plaintiff has similarly failed to offer evidence demonstrating (1) \nthat Clements or Bernard were on notice that Brockington was in need of \nsupervision; or (2) that Clements or Bernard were assigned or accepted \nresponsibility for supervising Brockington in Dougherty’s absence.  The absence of \nsuch evidence is fatal to Plaintiff’s claims against Clements and Bernard.   \n {43}  Because Plaintiff has failed to allege that Clements’ and Bernard’s own \nacts or conduct contributed to the alleged malpractice, there is no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact, and the Individual Motion for summary judgment is GRANTED.      \n \nV.  CONCLUSION \n {44}  For the reasons stated, the two motions for summary judgment are \nGRANTED.
