Plaintiff Revel XP, LLC, (“Revel”) contends that GameDay breached a \nmarketing agreement between the parties by ceasing to pay Revel  for its marketing \nRevel XP, LLC v. Never Forget Brands, LLC, 2022 NCBC 39. \n \n \nservices.  GameDay moves to dismiss Revel’s claims against it, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) \nof the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“the Rule(s)”) on the grounds that \nGameDay is not subject to personal jurisdiction in North Carolina. \n4. The parties have each submitted briefing and evidence in the form of \naffidavits and exhibits in support of and in opposition to GameDay’s Motion.  The Court \nheld a hearing on 15 June 2022.  Having considered all relevant matters, the Court \nfinds the following facts by a preponderance of the evidence and makes the following \nconclusions of law. \nII. FINDINGS OF FACT \n5. Revel is a North Carolina Limited Liability Company with its principal place \nof business in Winston-Salem North Carolina, which hosts, staffs and promotes events \nfor professional and collegiate sports  fans.  (Machosky Aff. ¶¶ 29 –32, ECF No. 19.)  \nRevel contracts with collegiate and professional sports teams for the right to host and \nstaff special events, including tailgate parties, and Revel grants sponsorship rights to \nvendors looking to promote their brands at these events.  (Machosky Aff. ¶¶ 14–17, ECF \nNo. 19.)  \n6. Revel is owned in majority by Teall Sports & Entertainment, LLC, which in \nturn is owned and managed by Teall Capital, based in Winston-Salem, with offices at \n500 West Fifth Street (Suite 1200), Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  (Machosky Aff. ¶¶ \n8–12.) \n \n \n7. GameDay is a South Carolina Limited Liability Company with its principal \nplace of business in Charleston, South Carolina.   (David Aff. ¶ 5, ECF No. 9.4.)   \nGameDay markets, distributes, and sells vodka and related products.  (David Aff. ¶ 5.) \n8. GameDay has licensure agreements and partnerships with collegiate and \nprofessional sports teams in the states of South Carolina, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, \nNew York, Louisiana, Maryland, and Colorado.  (See David Aff. ¶ 6.)  GameDay does \nnot have any partnerships, licensure agreements, affiliations, or agreements with any \ncollege or professional sports entities in North Carolina.  (David Aff. ¶ 7.)   \n9. GameDay is not registered to do business in North Carolina, does not have a \nlicense to sell liquor in North Carolina, and does not maintain any physical location or \nown real property in North Carolina.  (Nieves Aff. ¶¶ 31–34, ECF No. 9.5; David Aff. ¶ \n32.) \n10. Revel’s Director of Business Development, Glenn Gronkowski (“Gronkowski”) \ninitiated contact with GameDay  in February 2021 after seeing GameDay Vodka \nbillboards in Tampa, Florida while traveling there for the Super Bowl.  (Machosky Aff. \n¶¶ 43, 46–48.)  Gronkowski messaged Ray Horal (“Horal”), GameDay’s Chief Sales \nOfficer, via LinkedIn on 18 February 2021 and said that Revel’s services “might be a \ngreat way for [GameDay] to be a part of our platform and drive additional sales at ‘game \ndays’ across America.  Would love to discuss further if interested.”  (Machosky Aff. Ex. \nA., ECF No. 19.1.) \n11. Horal followed-up on 19 February 2021 and provided a n 85 -page “Brand \nDeck” to Gronkowski and explained that GameDay was “deep into the planning process \n \n \nof a rather disruptive 2021 GameDay Tailgate Tour that’ll run throughout FL, GA, SC, \nTX, LA, CO, MD, & numerous other markets. ”  (Def.’s Ex. 3, ECF No. 9.3 [“Horal \nEmail”].) \n12. From February 2021 through 3 March 2021, Revel employee AJ Machosky \n(“Machosky”) engaged in  exploratory discussions with  GameDay employees Horal, \nCharles Nieves (“Nieves”) , and Giuliana Rossi (“Rossi”) regarding a potential \nrelationship between Revel and GameDay.  (Machosky Aff. ¶¶ 53–56.) \n13. All negotiations between Revel and GameDay took place remotely via phone \ncalls and videoconferences.  (David Aff. ¶ 14.)  None of the participants in these \nconversations were physically located in North Carolina  except as described in \nparagraph 17 infra.  (David Aff. ¶ 13.) \n14. On 4 March 2021 , Horal sent Machosky a 30-page presentation (the \n“GameDay Pitch Deck”) created by GameDay, which discussed a potential marketing \npartnership between Revel and GameDay.  (Machosky Aff. ¶ 56, Machosky Aff. Ex. D, \nECF No. 19.4 [“GameDay Pitch Deck”].) \n15. Page 10 of the GameDay Pitch Deck is titled “Distribution Roadmap” and \ncontains a list of U.S. markets in which GameDay intended to begin distributing its \nvodka.  (See GameDay Pitch Deck 10.)  North Carolina is the first state GameDay listed \nfor the year 2022.  (See GameDay Pitch Deck 10.) \n16. Page 11 of the GameDay Pitch Deck, titled “Partnership Roadmap,” contains \na list of collegiate and professional sports organizations with which GameDay sought to \nestablish partnerships during each year from 2021–23.  (See GameDay Pitch Deck 11.)  \n \n \nDuke University, located in Durham, North Carolina, is listed as a partner for the year \n2023.  (See Pitch Deck 11.) \n17. On 24 March 2021, Machosky participated in a videoconference with Horal \nand Rossi and presented Revel’s proposal for a marketing agreement with GameDay \n(the “24 March Zoom Call”).  (Machosky Aff. ¶ 62.)  Machosky, although a resident of \nMichigan, was in Charlotte, North Carolina during the 24 March Zoom Call because he \nwas involved in one of Revel’s Topgolf Live events taking place at Charlotte’s Bank of \nAmerica Stadium.  (Machosky Aff. ¶ 64–65.)  During the 24 March Zoom Call, Machosky \npresented a pitch deck prepared by Revel (the “Revel Pitch Deck”)  to GameDay \nrepresentatives. (Machosky Aff. Ex. E, ECF No. 19.5 [“Revel Pitch Deck”].) \n18. Page 3 of the Revel Pitch Deck contains a map of Revel’s existing collegiate \nand professional sports partnerships, including four universities in North Carolina.   \n(Revel Pitch Deck 3.)   During the presentation, Horal indicated to Machosky that \nGameDay wished to expand into North Carolina.  (Machosky Aff. ¶ 74.)      \n19. Following the 24 March Zoom Call, Revel and GameDay, with the assistance \nof legal counsel, exchanged drafts of a proposed written marketing agreement.  \n(Machosky Aff. ¶ 76.) \n20. On 20 May 2021, the parties finalized  the terms of a written marketing \nagreement (the “Agreement”), which was signed by Machosky on behalf of Revel and by \nZach David on behalf of GameDay.  (Machosky Aff. ¶ 80 ; Marketing Agreement 1, 9 \n[“Agrmt.”].)  The Agreement was executed by  use of DocuSign, and none of the \nsignatories were located in North Carolina at the time of execution.  (David Aff. ¶ 14.) \n \n \n21. The Agreement , in its opening paragraph, identifies Revel as a North \nCarolina limited liability company.  (Agrmt. 1.) \n22. The Agreement commenced on 20 May 2021 and is set to expire on 30 June \n2025.  (Agrmt. ¶ 2.) \n23. The Agreement states that “[t]his Agreement shall be governed by and \ninterpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without application of \nits conflicts of laws provisions.”  (Agrmt. ¶ 25.) \n24. The Agreement requires GameDay to make periodic  payments to Revel.  \nGameDay is to “submit each payment by check, wire transfer, or Quickbooks invoice \npayment.  If [GameDay] pays by check, then [GameDay] should send the check, together \nwith an invoice identifying this Agreement, to the below remittance address, unless and \nuntil [Revel] directs otherwise.”  (Agrmt. ¶  5.)  The provided remittance address for \ncheck payments is a Winston-Salem, North Carolina address which corresponds with \nRevel’s principal place of business.  (See Agrmt. ¶ 5.) \n25. Under the Agreement, Revel is to develop and oversee tailgate parties at \nsporting events featuring GameDay products.  As a part of its performance under the \nAgreement, “[Revel] is responsible for providing, transporting, maintaining, setting up, \ntaking down and replacing all equipment and physical assets used at Events and that \nare used to provide Marketing Activities.”  (Agrmt. ¶ 10(a).)  \n26. GameDay is to make scheduled payments to Revel.  In addition, t he \nAgreement requires that GameDay and Revel enter into written Statements of Work \n(“SOWs”), which set forth “the scope and value of the Marketing Activities to be \n \n \nprovided by [Revel] to [GameDay].”  (Agrmt. 10–12.)  A form SOW is attached to the \nAgreement as Exhibit B , and requires the title, date, location of the event, the \nmarketing activities to take place, the value of the marketing activities, and any \nadditional provisions related to the event.  (Agrmt. 13.)  Each SOW stated in the opening \nparagraph that Revel is “a North Carolina limited liability company.”  (Strickland Aff. \n¶ 10, ECF No. 21.) \n27. Pursuant to the Agreement, Revel assigned Kasey Strickland (“Strickland”), \na Revel employee, to be a dedicated staff member to effectuate GameDay’s events, \nmarketing and promotional activities.  (David Aff. ¶ 21, Strickland Aff ¶ 7.) \n28. Strickland was located in Alabama at all times relevant to the A greement, \nand along with Machosky, generated all SOWs.  (David Aff. ¶ 23.)  \n29. Strickland was responsible for implementing activities and services described \nin SOWs, including coordinating physical set -ups, third-party vendors, and catering \nservices at events under the Agreement.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 12.) \n30. Exhibit D to the Agreement, titled “Revel XP Properties,” includes a list of \ncollegiate and professional sports entities with which Revel has an existing relationship.  \nThese include the University of North Carolina, North Carolina State University, and \nWake Forest University, all located in North Carolina.  (Agrmt. 15.) \n31. No events or signed SOWs arising out of the Agreement expressly called for \nhospitality services, activities or events to be performed or take place in North Carolina.  \n(David Aff. ¶ 18.) \n \n \n32. No events for which SOWs were prepared and executed ever occurred in \nNorth Carolina. (Nieves Aff. ¶ 23.) \n33. Charles Nieves (“Nieves”), GameDay’s Vice President of Marketing and \nprimary point of contact with Revel regarding the Agreement, claims that he was never \ninformed that any North Carolina-made product or North Carolina vendor was to be \nused in conjunction with the Agreement, Event, or SOW-related activity.  (Nieves Aff ¶ \n25.) \n34. Beginning in July 2021, GameDay asked Strickland to procure a variety of \nbranded items with GameDay’s logos and designs to be used at events hosted or \nsponsored by GameDay under the Agreement , including drink coolers, photo -op \nbackdrops, and carafes.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 27.)  Strickland and other Revel employees \nidentified Symphonix Solutions of Charlotte, North Carolina (“Symphonix”) as a vendor \nthat could provide these items.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 27.)  On 13 August 2021, Strickland, \nthrough email, introduced Nieves to Symphonix employees.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 29.)  \nNieves then communicated directly with Symphonix and discussed GameDay’s need for \nphoto backdrops which Symphonix could provide.  (Strickland Aff. Ex. E, ECF No. 21.5.)  \nThe Symphonix employees with whom Nieves communicated  had email signatures \nidentifying that Symphonix is located in Charlotte, North Carolina.  (See Strickland Aff. \nEx. E.)  Following Nieves’s direct communication with Symphonix, on 28 September \n2021, Nieves and Machosky executed SOW No. 39 authorizing the purchase of branded \ndrink coolers from Symphonix.  (Strickland Aff. Ex. B, ECF No. 21.2 [“SOW No. 39.”].)  \nOn 5 October  2021, Nieves and Machosky executed SOW No. 44  authorizing the \n \n \npurchase of carafes from Symphonix.  (Strickland Aff. Ex. C, ECF No. 21.3.)  GameDay \nalso asked that Revel obtain branded umbrellas, which Revel sourced from US \nUmbrellas in Durham, North Carolina (“US Umbrellas”)  and which the parties \nmemorialized in a SOW.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 32.) \n35. On 5 August 2021, Nieves and Machosky executed SOW No. 19. (Strickland \nAff. Ex. A., ECF No. 21 [“SOW No. 19”].)  SOW No. 19 reflects the design and purchase \nby Revel of branded canvas tent tops for GameDay to use at events it intended to \nsponsor under the Agreement.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 13.)  One of the tent tops was co-\nbranded with GameDay and the University of South Carolina.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 15.)  \nRevel does not have a warehouse in South Carolina and requested that the University \nof South Carolina tent top be delivered to Revel in Winston -Salem, North Carolina \ninstead.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 15.)  Upon receipt of the tent top in Winston-Salem, Revel \nshipped the tent top from Winston -Salem to a third -party tent company in South \nCarolina for future use at events in that state.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 16.)  The SOW \nindicates on page one that the University of South Carolina tent top was to be shipped \nto Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  (SOW No. 19 at 1.) \n36. On 6 October 2021, GameDay published a variety of images and written \nmaterial on its website and social media pages in honor of Nationa l Coaches’ Day, \nwriting that “we wanted to highlight some of the most impactful coaches from some \nof our partners.”  (Charbonneau Aff. Exs . A –C, ECF Nos. 22.1 –22.3 (emphasis \nadded).)  Duke University’s Mike Krzyzewski is the first coach listed and profiled on \nGameDay’s webpage.  (Charbonneau Aff. Ex. B.) \n \n \n37. GameDay made four regular payments to Revel under the Agreement.  (See \nHill Aff. Ex. B, ECF No. 20.2 [“Revel Invoices”].)  Revel billed GameDay by submitting \ninvoices which directed GameDay to submit payment to Revel in Winston-Salem.  (Hill \nAff. ¶ 33.)  The first invoice was sent to GameDay  on 1 July 202 1 in the amount of \n$500,000, the second invoice was sent to GameDay on 1 September 2021 in the amount \nof $225,000, the third invoice was sent to GameDay on 1 October 2021 in the amount of \n$225,000, and the fourth invoice was sent to GameDay on 1 November 2021 in the \namount of $225,000.  (Revel Invoices 1 –4.)  GameDay paid each of these invoices , \ntotaling $1,175,000, in 2021 by remitting a series of Automated Clearing  House \npayments to Revel’s BB&T bank accounts.  (Hill Aff. ¶ 32.) \n38. GameDay refused to pay further invoices beginning with the 1 December \n2021 invoice in the amount of $225,000.  (Hill Aff. ¶ 33.) \n39. In addition, GameDay has not paid Revel for more than $100,000 of services \nprovided by third parties that Revel coordinated at GameDay’s request.  (Hill Aff. ¶ 43.) \n40. On 31 December 2021, GameDay sent a letter, addressed to Revel, by e-mail \nto Machosky and in paper-copy to Revel’s Winston-Salem office.  In the letter, GameDay \nalleged that Revel was in breach of the Agreement  and that GameDay intended to \nterminate the Agreement.  (Machosky Aff. ¶¶ 89–91; Machosky Aff. Ex. G.)  This lawsuit \nfollowed. \n \n \nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n41. On 21 January 2022, Revel filed its Complaint.  (ECF No. 3.)  On 28 February \n2022, this matter was designated to the North Carolina Business Court and assigned \nto the undersigned.  (See Designation Or., ECF No. 1, Assignment Or., ECF No 2.) \n42. On 1 April 2022, GameDay filed the Motion. \n43. The Motion has been fully briefed and the Court held a hearing on the Motion \non 15 June 2022 at which all parties were represented by counsel.  (See Not. of Hearing, \nECF No. 25.) \n44. The Motion is ripe for determination. \nIV. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW1 \n45. “When a defendant challenges the court's jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2), the \nburden falls on the plaintiff to establish that grounds for assertin g [personal] \njurisdiction exist.”  AYM Techs., LLC v. Rodgers, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 14, at *6 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 9, 2018); see also Filmar Racing, Inc. v. Stewart, 141 N.C. App. 668, 671 \n(2001) (“The burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that \ngrounds exist for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”) \n46. “In a case where, as here, ‘both parties submit competing affidavits . . . and \nthe trial court holds a hearing on personal jurisdiction, the trial court should consider \nthe matter as if an evidentiary hearing had occurred.’ ”  Quidore v. Alliance Plastics, \nLLC, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 63 at *4 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 19, 2020) (quoting AYM Techs., \n \n1 Any findings of fact that are more appropriately deemed conclusions of law are incorporated \nby reference into the Court’s analysis and conclusions of law.  See Sheffer v. Rardin, 208 N.C. \nApp. 620, 624 (2010) (providing that the appellate court will treat  findings of fact that are \n“more properly designated” as conclusions of law as such for the purposes of an appeal).   \n \n \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 14, at *6–7).  “In such circumstances, the trial court must ‘act as a \nfact-finder, and decide the question of personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the \nevidence[.]’ ” Parker v. Town of Erwin, 243 N.C. App. 84, 97 (2015) (quoting Deer Corp. \nv. Carter, 177 N.C. App. 314, 322 (2006)). \n47. Notwithstanding the fact that this Court is to find facts from the evidence \npresented, there is little dispute between the parties about the relevant facts, as \ndiscussed in paragraphs 5–40 supra.  Rather, the dispute between the parties centers \non the legal effect of those facts.  \n48. In North Carolina, determining whether personal jurisdiction exists is a \n“two-step analysis.” Beem USA LLLP v. Grax Consulting, LLC, 373 N.C. 297, 302 \n(2020).  “First, jurisdiction over the defendant must be authorized by N.C.G.S. § 1-\n75.4 — North Carolina’s long-arm statute.  Second, if the long-arm statute permits \nconsideration of the action, exercise of jurisdiction must not violate the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” Id.  \n49. “[B]ecause North Carolina's long-arm statute has been interpreted to allow \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction to the fullest extent allowed under the due \nprocess clause, the two-step analysis collapses into one inquiry.”  Worley v. Moore, \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 15, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 28, 2017). \n50. For a court to exercise personal jurisdiction, “there must be sufficient \nminimum contacts between the nonresident defendant and our state such that the \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.”  Skinner v. Preferred Credit, 361 N.C. 114, 122 (2006) (quoting Int'l Shoe Co. \n \n \nv. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As our \nSupreme Court explained in Beem: \nPersonal jurisdiction cannot exist based upon a defendant’s “random, \nfortuitous, or attenuated” contacts with the forum state, Walden v. \nFiore, 571 U.S. 277, 286 (2014) (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475), \nbut rather must be the result of “some act by which the defendant \npurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within \nthe forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its \nlaws,” Skinner, 361 N.C. at 133 (quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. \n235, 253 (1958)). As such, a defendant's contacts with the forum state \nmust be such that a defendant \"should reasonably anticipate being haled \ninto court there.” World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. \n286, 297 (1980); see also Skinner, 361 N.C. at 133 (“A crucial factor is \nwhether the defendant had reason to expect that he might be subjected \nto litigation in the forum state.”). \n \n373 N.C. at 303 (cleaned up). \n51. There are two types of personal jurisdiction: general (or “all-purpose”) \njurisdiction and specific (or “case-based”) jurisdiction.  See Beem, 373 N.C. at 303 \n(citing Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 126-27 (2014)).  General jurisdiction \napplies where the defendant’s “affiliations with the State are so ‘continuous and \nsystematic’ as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.” Goodyear \nDunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011) (quoting Int'l Shoe, \n326 U.S. at 317).  Specific jurisdiction focuses on “the relationship among the \ndefendant, this State, and the cause of action.” Tom Togs, Inc. v. Ben Elias Industries \nCorp., 318 N.C. 361, 366 (1986).  “There must be some act by which the defendant \npurposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum \nstate, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.”  A.R. Haire, Inc. v. St. \nDenis, 176 N.C. App. 255, 260, (2006) (citing Dillon v. Numismatic Funding Corp., \n \n \n291 N.C. 674, 679 (1977)).  “In determining minimum contacts, the court looks at \nseveral factors, including: (1) the quantity of the contacts; (2) the nature and quality \nof the contacts; (3) the source and connection of the cause of action with those \ncontacts; (4) the interest of the forum state; and (5) the convenience to the \nparties.”  Id. (citation omitted).  “These factors are not to be applied mechanically; \nrather, the court must weigh the factors and determine what is fair and reasonable \nto both parties.  No single factor controls; rather, all factors must be weighed in light \nof fundamental fairness and the circumstances of the case.” Id. (cleaned up). \n52. GameDay contends that it is not subject to either general or specific \njurisdiction in this Court.   Revel concedes that GameD ay is not subject to general \njurisdiction in this Court , arguing instead that GameDay is subject to specific \njurisdiction pursuant to GameDay’s alleged breach of the Agreement. Therefore, the \nCourt analyzes the facts and law only as they relate to specific jurisdiction. \n53. The Supreme Court of the United States has long held that the Due Process \nClause does not preclude a state court from entering a judgment binding on a \ncontracting party when “ the suit was based on a contract which had substantial \nconnection with that [s]tate.” McGee v. Int’l Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 223 (1957).   \n54. There is no mechanical test for determining jurisdiction between \ncontracting parties. Toshiba Global Commerce Sols., Inc. v. Smart & Final Stores \nLLC, 2022-NCSC-81 ¶ 10.  The inquiry does not turn on “the place of contracting or \nof performance,” nor can “an individual’s contract with an out -of-state party \nalone . . . automatically establish sufficient minimum contacts in the other party’s \n \n \nhome forum[.]”  Burger King Corp v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 478 (1985) (emphasis \nin original) .  Instead, courts  are to  consider the parties’ “ prior negotiations  and \ncontemplated future consequences , along with  the terms of the contract and the \nparties’ actual course of dealing.”  Toshiba Global Commerce Sols., Inc, 2022-NCSC-\n81 ¶ 10 (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 479). \n55. Weighing all of  the evidence, the Court concludes that  the parties’ actual \ncourse of dealing and contemplated future consequences demonstrate that the \nAgreement has  a substantial connection with North Carolina  and therefore  the \nexercise of jurisdiction over GameDay comports with due process.2  \nA. Prior Negotiations \n56. Revel’s pre-contract dealings with GameDay d id not make clear  that \nGameDay knew it was availing itself of the privilege of doing business in North \nCarolina.  All of Revel’s primary points of contact  were located outside of North \nCarolina.  Gronkowski, who first solicited GameDay, was located in Texas.  Machosky \nand Strickland, with whom GameDay generated SOWs, were located in Michigan and \nAlabama, respectively.  GameDay hosts events nationwide and has employees located \nnationwide, and the negotiations took place almost entirely outside of North Carolina. \n57. However, these facts alone do not determine whether the Agreement has a \nsubstantial connection with North Carolina.  A s both Burger King  and Toshiba \n \n2 The Court of Appeals has recently issued several opinions discussing the type of intentional \ncontact necessary to support a finding of minimum contacts  comporting with due process .  \nSee Troublefield v. AutoMoney, Inc., 2022-NCCOA-497; Wall v. AutoMoney, Inc.,  2022-\nNCCOA-498; Hundley v. AutoMoney, Inc., 2022-NCCOA-489; Leake v. AutoMoney, Inc., 2022-\nNCCOA-490. \n \n \n \ndemonstrate, the fact that pre-contract negotiations occur outside the forum state is \nnot alone determinative of  jurisdiction.  In Toshiba, the fact that negotiations took \nplace remotely between employees located in California and Texas did not preclude a \nfinding that the contract had a substantial connection with North Carolina.  Toshiba \nGlobal Commerce Sols., Inc. v. Smart & Final Stores LLC , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 151 , \nat *3–4, 13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 23, 2020).  And in Burger King, the Supreme Court \nof the United States likewise  held that there was sufficient evidence that the \ndefendant knew he was affiliating with an entity from the forum state even though \nthe defendant’s dealings were principally with representatives outside the forum  \nstate.  See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 480, 487. \n58. Further, while initial discussions between the parties may not have focused \non North Carolina as a jurisdiction with significant relationships to the parties’ \nundertaking, by the time the parties began negotiating a written agreement, it \nbecame clear that  the agreement had significant ties to  North Carolina.  ( See \nparagraphs 59–60 infra.) \nB. Contemplated Future Consequences \n59. The record makes clear that GameDay intended to begin doing business in \nNorth Carolina during the term of the Agreement.  As GameDay’s “Partnership \nRoadmap” and “Distribution Roadmap” clearly show, GameDay hoped to establish a \npresence in North Carolina during the span of the Agreement and form a partnership \nwith Duke University by 2023.  (GameDay Pitch Deck 10–11.)  GameDay published \non its website and circulated on social media posts featuring Coach Mike Krzyzewski \n \n \n(“Coach K”), Duke University’s nationally known men’s basketball coach.  GameDay, \nperhaps jumping the gun, errantly categorized Duke University in its publications as \none of its “partners.”  (Charbonneau Aff. Exs. A–C.)  GameDay knew that Revel had \nestablished relationships with universities in North Carolina and expressly told Revel \nthat GameDay intended to enter this state.  (Machosky Aff. ¶ 74.)      \nC. Terms of the Agreement \n60. The Agreement put GameDay on notice that Revel was headquartered in \nNorth Carolina and that GameDay was expected to regularly send payments into \nNorth Carolina.  The opening paragraph of the Agreement states plainly that Revel \nis a North Carolina limited liability company, (Agrmt. 1), and paragraph five \ncontains Revel’s Winston-Salem, North Carolina billing address to which GameDay \nwas directed to submit payments by check.  (Agrmt. ¶ 5).  Each form SOW \ngenerated under the Agreement also identifies Revel as a North Carolina limited \nliability company.  (See Agrmt. Ex. B.)  The Agreement is silent as to the place of \nperformance of the duties under the contract, leaving those to be determined by \neach successive SOW.  However, the Agreement’s 4-year term, spanning from May \n2021 to June 2025 indicates that the parties would, as GameDay represented to \nRevel in pre-contract discussions, inevitably expand into North Carolina during the \nlifetime of the Agreement.  (See GameDay Pitch Deck 10–11.) \n61.  The agreement has a Delaware choice-of-law provision.  (Agrmt. ¶ 25.)  \nThis factor does not favor the exercise of jurisdiction, but neither does it weigh \nstrongly against jurisdiction given that neither party is organized under Delaware \n \n \nlaw or based in Delaware.  See Tejal Vyas, LLC v. Carriage Park LP, 166 N.C. App. \n34, 41 (2004) (“[C]hoice of law clauses are not determinative of personal jurisdiction \n. . . .”). \nD. The Parties’ Actual Course of Dealing \n62. Revel obtained, at GameDay’s request, certain branded goods for GameDay \nfrom North Carolina vendors.  Revel argues that the knowing approval by GameDay \nof such purchases by Revel  demonstrates purposeful availment  from GameDay.  \nGameDay responds that  it did not specifically request, nor did it know,  that goods \nwould be procured from North Carolina vendors, and therefore GameDay’s requests \nfor goods under the Agreement  do not constitute purposeful availment of North \nCarolina. \n63. Our Supreme Court has recognized that, “regular contractual performance \nof a contractual obligation . . . is relevant [to a determination of personal jurisdiction] \neven if the location of the performance is not dictated by the contract.”  Toshiba Glob. \nCom. Sols., Inc. v. Smart & Final Stores LLC, 2022-NCSC-81 ¶ 22.   \n64. Revel had a contractual obligation under the parties’ agreement to provide \nand transport  all equipment and physical assets used for events and marketing \nactivities.  (Agrmt. ¶ 10(a).)  Pursuant to this obligation, Revel was repeatedly asked by \nGameDay to procure tailgating equipment: branded coolers, tents, umbrellas, photo \nbackdrops, and mor e; many of these products were procured from North Carolina \nvendors.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 27.)  While GameDay apparently did not initially know that \nthe products were sourced from North Carolina vendors, GameDay was put on notice \n \n \nthat Revel was using North Carolina suppliers to fulfill GameDay’s requests in August \n2021.  On 13 August 2021, Strickland put Nieves in direct contact with Symphonix, a \ncompany based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 29.)  Nieves explained \nthat GameDay need ed photo backdrops and requested a quote from Symphonix.   \n(Strickland Aff. Ex. E.)  In so doing, GameDay endorsed the prospect of continuing to \nsource products from a North Carolina vendor under the Agreement.   The record \ncontains no evidence tending to show that GameDay objected to the use of Symphonix \nor other North Carolina vendors .  I nstead, following Nieves’s co nversation with \nSymphonix, GameDay repeatedly approved and pa id Revel for multiple orders of \nbranded goods sourced from Symphonix.  (Strickland Aff. ¶ 30.)   \n65. It is undisputed that the Agreement and SOWs were not drafted or signed \nin North Carolina and that the SOWs never requested marketing activities to be \nperformed in North Carolina.  (Parlor Aff. ¶¶ 15, 20 –21, ECF No. 9.6 .)  However,  \nGameDay knowingly contracted with a North Carolina company  for a period of four \nyears, during which time GameDay intended to enter North Carolina and make use \nof Revel’s existing connections there.   From 1 July 2021 to 1 November 2021, \nGameDay also sent regular, periodic payments  totaling over one million dollars  to \nRevel in North Carolina .  Knowing that Revel used North Carolina vendors , \nGameDay continued to  request and pay for branded goods  from North Carolina \nvendors, voiced no objection to Revel’s  use of such  vendors, and directly  \ncommunicated with one of those vendors — Symphonix. \n \n \n66. Although this is a close case, the parties’ contemplated future consequences \nand actual course of dealing  support a determination that the Agreement has  a \nsubstantial connection with the State of North Ca rolina and therefore, the exercise \nof jurisdiction over GameDay  comports with due process .  As such, the Court \nconcludes that it has personal jurisdiction over GameDay. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n67. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES the Motion.  \n \n SO ORDERED, this the 25th day of July, 2022. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
