Uhl, pro se. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \n \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \n1. On April 18, 2013, Velleros, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) initiated this lawsuit by filing a \nComplaint against Taren J. Patterson (“Patterso n”), Thomas C. Uhl (“Uhl”), and Fletcher \nClark Johnston (“Johnston”) (Patterson, Uhl, and  Johnston are collecti vely referred to as \n“Defendants”).  Plaintiff’s action was designated as No. 13 CVS 5834 by the Clerk of Superior \nCourt of Wake County. In its Complaint, Plai ntiff pursues the follow ing claims for relief \n(“Claim(s)”): First Claim for Relief: Declarat ory Judgment; and Second Claim for Relief: \nMotion for TRO and Preliminary Injunction.  In substance, Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks a \ndeclaration by this Court that Defendants’ ac tions at a shareholder meeting in April 2013 \nwere of no effect and did not succeed in replacing the incumbent members of Plaintiff’s Board \nof Directors with Defendants. \n2. On April 25, 2013, this Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”).  \nThe TRO restrained and prohibited a ll Defendants and their agents from, inter alia : \namending or repealing Plaintiff’s Bylaws; taking any action with respect to the sale, lease, or \nexchange of Plaintiff’s property and assets; causing the issuance or transfer of stock; \nremoving or replacing directors, employees, or officers; and contracting on behalf of Plaintiff.1  \n                                                            \n1 Order on Mot. for TRO and Prelim. Inj. (Apr. 25, 2013). \n \n \nOn May 15, 2013, this Court converted the TRO into a Preliminary Injunction containing the \nsame prohibitions.2  At the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion, counsel for Plaintiff made an oral \nmotion to convert the Preliminary Injunction to a Permanent Injunction. \n3. On July 25, 2013, Johnston filed an Answer and Counterclaim. 3 Johnston’s \nCounterclaim seeks a Declaratory Judgment from th is Court that Plaintiff is not entitled to \nthe relief sought in the Complaint and that Defendants are the duly elected Board of \nDirectors for Velleros, Inc.  \n4. Despite receiving multiple extensions of time from the Court in which to \nanswer or otherwise respond to Plaintiff’s Complaint, Taren J. Patterson and Thomas C. Uhl \nnever filed a responsive pleading. On September 3, 2013, the Court issued an entry of default \nagainst Patterson and Uhl pursuant to Rule 55(a).\n4 \n5. In November 2013, Plaintiff moved for sanctions against the Defendants for \nfailure to respond to Plaintiff’s interrogatories or requests for production of documents.5 The \nsanctions motion sought an order prohibiting De fendants from relying on any evidence that \nshould have been produced in response to Plaintiff’s discovery requests and requiring \nDefendants to pay Plaintiff’s costs for bringing  the sanctions motion. In response to this \nmotion, this Court entered an order requiring Johnston to respond to any discovery requests \non or before January 10, 2014, and holding the remainder of the sanctions motion in \nabeyance.6   \n                                                            \n2 Order Granting Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (May 15, 2013). \n3 Def. Johnston Ans. & Countercl. \n4 Entry of Default Against Def. Patterson & Uhl (Sept. 3, 2013). \n5 Pl.’s Mot. Sanctions (Nov. 14, 2013). Plaintiff’s interrogatories and requests for documents were \nserved on Defendants on May 24, 2013. Id. \n6 Am. Order Mot. Sanctions (Dec. 13, 2013). \n \n \n6. On November 27, 2013, Plaintiff filed th e Plaintiff’s Motion.  The Plaintiff’s \nMotion seeks a default judgment against Patterson and Uhl and summary judgment against \nDefendant Johnston. \n7. On December 20, 2013, Patterson (who by this point had obtained counsel) filed \na brief opposing the Plaintiff’s Motion.7  Patterson argued that, despite the entry of default \nand the resulting admission of all allegations in the Complaint, the allegations in the \nComplaint were “insufficient to support judgment in [Plaintiff’s] favor.”\n8  Neither Patterson \nnor any other Defendant filed any evidence in opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion to Summary \nJudgment. \n8. On January 10, 2014, Johnston filed a Motion to Amend Answer and Include \nThird Party Complaint (the “Johnston Motion ”). The Johnston Motion contends that the \noriginal Answer was filed “on extremely short notice,” evidently due to Johnston’s prior belief \nthat the other Defendants had retained counsel on his behalf, and that Johnston had \nconducted additional investigation since filing his original Answer that warranted the filing \nof an amended Answer and Third-Party Complaint.  \n9. On February 4, 2014, Defendant Johnsto n filed a Rule 11 Motion asserting \nthat Plaintiff’s counsel signed all filings in violation of Rule 11. This Court subsequently \ngranted Plaintiff’s motion to defer a responsive filing to the Rule 11 Motion until thirty days \nafter the resolution of the merits in this matter.9  \n                                                            \n7 In the Case Management Order, this Court specified that all three Defendants would be treated as \none party for purposes of briefing and discovery. Case Management Order (Sept. 3, 2013) at 4. Thus, \nin light of Defendant Patterson’s brief, the Court will not treat Plaintiff’s Motion as unopposed by \nany Defendant. \n8 Patterson’s Opp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Patterson Br.”) 3. \n9 Order on Mot. Defer R. 11 Proceedings (Dec. 11, 2014). \n \n \n10.   To date, Defendant Uhl individually has not filed any pleadings or otherwise \nappeared in this case. 10 Defendant Patterson has submitted no filings other than his \nopposition to Plaintiff’s Motion.11  The Court granted counsel for Patterson permission to \nwithdraw prior to the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion.12 \n11. Both Plaintiff’s Motion and the Johnston Motion have been briefed and are ripe \nfor determination.  On January 15, 2015, the Co urt held a hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion. \nPlaintiff was represented by counsel at the hearing. Johnston appeared on behalf of himself, \nbut Patterson and Uhl did not appear at the hearing.  At the hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel made \nan oral motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nThe Court considers the following facts in reaching its conclusion.13  \n12. Plaintiff is a closely-held Delaware corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in North Carolina. 14 Plaintiff has adopted a set of amended corporate bylaws (the \n“Bylaws”).15 \n                                                            \n10 It is the Court’s understanding based on representations at the hearing on the Summary \nJudgment Motion that all three Defendants were represented by counsel at one point, and that \nDefendant Uhl may have participated in a mediation in some capacity. \n11 Notice of Appearance (Sept. 3, 2013); Def. Patterson’s Opp. Mot. Summ. J. & Default J. of Pl. (Dec. \n20, 2013). \n12 Order on Mot. Withdraw (Jan. 13, 2015). \n13 A court does not make findings of fact in ruling upon a motion for summary judgment. However, \nthe court may summarize material facts that do not appear to be at issue and which justify the \njudgment. Hyde Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142 (1975). Because the \nCourt has entered default against Defendants Patterson and Uhl, all facts alleged by Plaintiff in its \nComplaint are deemed uncontested for purposes of ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion as to Patterson and \nUhl. Baxter v. Jones, 14 N.C. App. 296, 312 (1972) (internal citations omitted). This includes the \nexhibits attached to and incorporated by the Complaint. See, e.g., Weaver v. St. Joseph of the Pines, \nInc., 187 N.C. App. 198, 204 (2007) (“If, however, documents are attached to and incorporated within \na complaint, they become part of the complaint.”).  \n14 Compl. ¶ 1; Exh. D to Compl. (“Bylaws”) I; Aff. Of Danny L. Parker (“Parker Aff.”) ¶ 3. \n15 Parker Aff. ¶ 27; Bylaws. \n \n \n13. Patterson and Uhl are minority shareholders and former employees of \nPlaintiff.16 Together, they own 40% of Plaintiff’s co mmon stock, but no preferred stock.  \nOverall, Patterson and Uhl own approximately 34% of Plaintiff’s stock.17 Patterson, a citizen \nand resident of Dallas, Texas, was a member of Plaintiff’s Board of Directors for part of \n2008.18 Uhl is a citizen and resident of San Diego, California.19 \n14. Johnston is a citizen and resident of Dallas, Texas.20 He does not own stock in \nPlaintiff, nor does he have any presen t or prior affiliation with Plaintiff. 21 He is a licensed \nattorney in the state of Texas.22 \n15. In December 2012, Patterson and Uhl, through Johnston, threatened Plaintiff \nwith litigation and began to make allegations of wrongdoing by Plaintiff’s Board of Directors \nand CEO. 23 \n16. Defendants Patterson and Uhl submitted a demand to Plaintiff for a special \nstockholder meeting on or about December 18, 2012. The demand described the purpose of \nthe special meeting as “election or removal of any director or directors; vacancy or vacancies; \namendment, alteration, modificati on or repeal to or of any bylaw of [sic] bylaws; or other \ncorporate governance matter.”24 In spite of multiple requests from Plaintiff for Patterson and \nUhl to provide further specifics about the purpose of the special meeting, they did not do so.25 \n17. On March 19, 2013, CEO Danny Parker (“Parker”) sent a Memorandum to all \nof Plaintiff’s stockholders. The Memorandum stated:  \n                                                            \n16 Compl. ¶¶ 2-3; see Exh. A to Parker Aff.

No nominations for directors or other proposals were submitted by the April 2, \n2013 deadline.27 \n19. On April 4, 2013, Plaintiff sent the shareholders a Notice of annual and special \nmeetings of stockholders to be held on April 16, 2013. The formal Notice listed Danny Parker, \nRichard Speers, and David LeClaire as nomi nees for Plaintiff’s Board of Directors. 28  The \nNotice also stated that the Special Meeting wo uld be held on April 16, 2013, but that since \nPlaintiff had not received any proposals by the April 2 deadline, there would be no proposal \nvoted on at the special meeting.29  \n20. The Annual Meeting was held as scheduled on April 16, 2013, and commenced \nat 7:00 p.m.30 The Corporate Secretary confirmed at the Annual Meeting that a quorum was \npresent.31 Per the Bylaws, Parker, as CEO and Chai rman of the Board, presided over both \nthe Annual and Special Meetings.32 \n                                                            \n26 Exh.

Holders of all of “the shares of capital stock issued, outstanding, and entitled \nto vote were present in person, or represented by proxy,” at the Annual Meeting.33 Present in \nperson at the meeting were individuals hold ing 43.7% of Plaintiff’s outstanding stock. 34  \nPatterson and Uhl were not present in person , but were represented by a proxy, Fred \nFarzanegan (“Farzanegan”). At the Annual Meetin g, a majority of Plaintiffs’ stockholders, \nand all stockholders except Patterson and Uh l, voted Danny Parker, Richard Speers, and \nDavid LeClaire to the Board of Directors.35  All of the stockholders except for Patterson and \nUhl voted for Parker, Speers, and LeClaire.36 \n22. The Special Meeting commenced at 7:23 p.m., immediately after the Annual \nMeeting ended.37 There is no allegation in the Complaint, nor any evidence in the record, that \nany stockholders or their proxies did not atte nd the Special Meeting.  Individuals holding \n43.7% of Plaintiff’s outstanding stock were present at the Special Meeting in person. 38  \nParker, in his capacity as Chairman, indicated that no proposals would be considered at the \nSpecial Meeting, because none had been submitted prior to the April 2, 2013, deadline, but \nthat each stockholder would have the opportuni ty to address the Board and their fellow \nstockholders for ten minutes.\n39 \n23. Despite Parker’s statement, Farzanegan read a series of purported proposals \n(“Proposal(s)”) on behalf of Patterson and Uh l.  The Proposals were to: (1) repeal any \namendments to the Bylaws adopted by the Bo ard of Directors; (2) amend the Bylaws to \nauthorize only stockholders to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors; (3) remove incumbent \n                                                            \n33 Parker Aff. ¶ 17. \n34 Second Aff. of Parker (“Second Parker Aff.”) ¶ 5. \n35 Compl. ¶ 37; Parker Aff. ¶ 18. \n36 Id. \n37 Compl. ¶ 38. \n38 Second Parker Aff. ¶ 5. \n39 Compl. ¶ 38; see Parker Aff. ¶¶ 20, 21, 22. \n \n \nDirectors for cause, as applicable; (4) remove incumbent Directors without cause; and (5) elect \nDefendants Johnston, Patterson, and Uhl to fill any and all existing vacancies.40  There were \nno vacancies on Plaintiff’s Board of Directors at the time.41 \n24. No vote was called or taken by the Chairman on the Proposals, but Farzanegan \npurported to cast Patterson’s and Uhl’s vote in support of each Proposal.42 None of the other \nstockholders present in person or by proxy cast votes regarding the Proposals.43  \n25. On April 17, 2013, Johnston sent an e-mail to all of Plaintiff’s stockholders and \nits corporate legal counsel. In the e-mail, Johnston asserted that the Proposals were “adopted \nby the vote of the holders of a majority of th e shares entitled to vote and represented at a \nmeeting at which quorum was present.” Johnston opined that, due to various technical \ndeficiencies with certain classes of Plainti ff’s stock and the limited proxy solicited by \nmanagement, Patterson and Uhl, through their Proxy, comprised the requisite percentage of \nshares needed to adopt the Proposals. Johns ton further asserted that  Defendants, as the \npurported newly-elected Board of Directors, intended to “take action, as [they] deem \nnecessary or appropriate under the facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, \nby issuing such notices and releases and initiating such legal proceedings and \ncommunications as so determined.”\n44  \n26. Plaintiff subsequently initiated this lawsuit, seeking a declaration that \nDefendants’ actions were invalid and preventing Defendants from taking any action as the \npurported Board of Directors. \nDISCUSSION \n                                                            \n40 Compl. ¶¶ 40-41; Exh.

For purposes of this Opinion, the Motions before the Court are the Johnston \nMotion and Plaintiff’s Motion.45 The Court will first address the Johnston Motion. \n \n \nThe Johnston Motion \n28. Johnston filed his Motion to Amend Answer and Include Third-Party \nComplaint on January 10, 2014, roughly six months after filing his Answer, three months \nafter the close of discovery, and over two months after Plaintiff filed its Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  \n29. The Johnston Motion contends that the amendment is necessary because, \ninter \nalia, Johnston’s initial Answer was “filed on extremely short notice after Johnston learned \nthat the other Defendants had failed to engage  or retain North Carolina counsel and being \nled to believe that replacement North Carolina counsel had been retained to represent all of \nthe Defendants,” and Johnston had conducted furth er investigation since filing his original \nAnswer that he believed to merit filing his Amendment. \n30. The Johnston Motion does not seek to amend Johnston’s answers to the \nallegations in the Complaint or any affirmative defenses raised in his original Answer.  \nInstead, the motion purports to amend the counterclaim raised in Johnston’s Answer, and to \nadd third-party claims against at least 49 third-party defendants.  Johnston attached \napproximately 400 pages of exhibits to the proposed amended answer. The proposed amended \nanswer contains 770 numbered paragraphs of alle gations with titles like “Bogus Disclaimer \nof Bogus Directors,” “Unambiguous terminol ogy for Dishonest and Incompetent North \nCarolina Attorneys,” “Certain Arguendo Alte rnative/Hypothetical Delaware Corporation \n                                                            \n45 The other pending motions in this matter will be addressed at the end of this Opinion and Order. \n \n \nTerminology,” “Ship of Theseus or Knowingl y False Verification?,” and “North Carolina \nAttorneys May Know Less About Securities Law Than They Do Delaware Law.”  The Third-\nParty Claim alleges that Velleros has suffered “d amage, harm, or injury” as a result of the \nconduct Johnston attempts to allege. \n31. Plaintiff opposes the Johnston Motion, contending that Johnston has unduly \ndelayed in filing the proposed amendment, that the Johnston Motion has been made in bad \nfaith “to contrive a conflict be tween Velleros and its counsel,” and that Velleros would be \nprejudiced if the amendment were allowed at this stage of the proceeding. Further, Plaintiff \ncontends that the proposed amendment is futile, because Johnston attempts to state a Third-\nParty Claim on behalf of Plaintiff, for which he lacks standing.\n46 \n32. Rule 15 provides that “leave shall be freely given” to amend a pleading “when \njustice so requires.” This has been interpreted to mean that an amendment should be “freely \nallowed unless some material prejudice to the other party is demonstrated.” Mauney v. \nMorris, 316 N.C. 67, 72 (1986). A court may deny a motion to amend for, inter alia, undue \ndelay, bad faith, and undue prejudice. See, e.g., Martin v. Hare, 78 N.C. App. 358, 361 (1985). \nUltimately, whether to allow an amendment rests in the trial judge’s discretion. House of \nRaeford Farms, Inc. v. Raeford, 104 N.C. App. 280, 282 (1991). \n33. The Court concludes that, at a minimum, Defendant Johnston unduly delayed \nin filing his Motion. Even assuming that John ston filed his original Answer “on extremely \nshort notice,” the Johnston Motion was not filed for half a year after his purported discovery \nthat he was proceeding in this lawsuit pro se.  In addition, the Court finds that Johnston’s \nproposed amendments would be futile, both be cause they fail to adequately state any cause \nof action against any party, and because the claims purport to be on behalf of “the Company” \n                                                            \n46 Pls.’ Resp. Mot. Amend Ans. & Include Third Party Compl. by Def. Johnston. \n \n \nand Johnston is not a shareholder in Velleros.   Accordingly, he lacks standing to bring \nderivative claims on behalf of Velleros.  To allow such a voluminous amendment at this stage \nof the proceedings would result in undue prejudice to Plaintiff.  \n34. THEREFORE, the Court FINDS and CONCLUDES, in its discretion, that the \nJohnston Motion should be DENIED.47 \nPlaintiff’s Motion \n35. Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment  with regard to its claims against \nJohnston and Johnston’s counterclaim against Pl aintiff, and for default judgment on its \nclaims against Patterson and Uhl. Both Plaint iff and Johnston seek declaratory judgments \nas to the legal effect of the actions taken by  Defendants at the Special Meeting. Before \nproceeding to an analysis of the motions for summary judgment and default judgment, the \nCourt addresses the law to be applied to its determination. \nChoice of Law \n36. It is well established under North Caro lina law that procedural matters are \ngoverned by the law of the forum. See, e.g., Young v. Baltimore & O.R. Co. , 266 N.C. 458 \n(1966). A court’s analysis of a claim for declaratory judgment is therefore governed by North \nCarolina law.48  \n37. With regard to the substantive law to be applied to the claims, North Carolina \nhas adopted the “internal affairs doctrine,” which recognizes that “only one State should have \nthe authority to regulate a corporation’s internal affairs – matters peculiar to the \n                                                            \n47 It follows that the exhibits included with the proposed amendment are not before this Court for its \nanalysis of Plaintiff’s Motion. \n48 See also Boyce Thompson Inst. for Plant Research v. Medimmune, Inc., 2009 Del. Super. LEXIS \n185, *20 n. 44 (finding that, in an action in Delaware court for declaratory judgment on a contract \nwith a New York choice of law provision, the Delaware declaratory judgment statute would govern \nthe “procedural aspects” and the choice of law provision would govern the “substantive rights of the \nparties” under the disputed contract). \n \n \nrelationships among or between the corporat ion and its current officers, directors, and \nshareholders – because otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.”  \nBluebird Corp. v. Aubin, 188 N.C. App. 671, 680-81 (2008) (citing Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 \nU.S. 624, 645 (1982)). Pursuant to the internal affairs doctrine, courts look to the local law of \nthe state of incorporation to determine matters  involving a corporation’s “internal affairs.” \nId.  Plaintiff is a Delaware corporation, and the allegations at issue deal with the internal \ngovernance of Plaintiff.  In addition, the parties appear to agree that Delaware law should be \napplied to the parties’ claims.  Accordingly, Delaware law governs this Court’s legal analysis \nof the substantive claims in this action. \nLegal Standard \n38. Under North Carolina law, a declaratory judgment is a statutory remedy that \ngrants a court the authority to “declare rights , status, and other legal relations” when an \n“actual controversy” exists between parties to a lawsuit. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-253; Pine Knoll \nShores v. Carolina Water Serv., Inc., 128 N.C. App. 321, 321 (1998). Summary judgment may \nbe granted on a claim for declaratory judgment if there remain no issues of material fact and \neither party is entitled to relief as a matter of law. Smith v. Marez, 217 N.C. App. 267, 270 \n(2011) (internal citation omitted). \n39. Summary judgment is appropriately granted under Rule 56 of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rules”) if the pleadings, depositions, interrogatories, \nadmissions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \nthat any party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Smith, 217 N.C. App. at 270. Any \ninference of fact should be drawn against the movant. Forbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, 523-524 \n(2007) (citing Caldwell v. Deese, 288 N.C. 375, 378 (1975)). A genuine issue of material fact \nwill require the court to preserve the issue for a finder of fact. Bumpers v. Cmty. Bank of N. \nVa, ___ N.C. ___, 747 S.E.2d 220 (2013).  Although the Court must view the record “in the \n \n \nlight most favorable to the party opposing th e motion,” Rule 56(e) provides that summary \njudgment may not be defeated by “mere allegations or denials,” but rather that the opposition \nmust be supported by “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  Patterson \nv. Reid, 10 N.C. App. 22, 28 (1970).  In this case, Plaintiff has filed the sworn affidavits of \nDanny Parker and exhibits in support of its motion for summary judgment.  Johnston did not \noffer any evidence in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.  Accordingly, the facts \nas supported by Plaintiff’s evidence are undisputed.                                                                                          \n40. Under Rule 55, “[w]hen default is ente red due to a defendant’s failure to \nanswer, the substantive allegations contained in plaintiff’s complaint are no longer in issue, \nand for the purposes of entry of default and default judgment, are deemed admitted.” Luke \nv. Omega Consulting Grp., LC, 194 N.C. App. 745, 751 (2009).  A party against whom default \nhas been entered, however, may still challenge the sufficiency of the complaint’s allegations \nto support the relief sought by the plaintiff. Baxter v. Jones , 14 N.C. App. 296, 312 (1972) \n(“The default admits only the allegations of  the complaint and does not extend either \nexpressly or by implication the scope of the de termination sought by the plaintiff, or which \ncould be granted by the court.”);  see also Hunter v. Spaulding, 97 N.C. App. 372, 377 (1990).  \nIn other words, Plaintiff must still establish that the facts alleged in the Complaint support \njudgment in its favor. \n41. Parker’s first affidavit 49 mirrors most of the allegations contained in the \nComplaint, and the undisputed facts for purposes of summary judgment are almost identical \nto the factual allegations in the Complaint upon which Plaintiff seeks default judgment.  The \nquestion for this Court’s consideration with regard to both motions is whether or not the facts \n                                                            \n49 Plaintiff filed two affidavits from Parker.  The first affidavit signed on 11/25/13 (“Parker Aff.”) is \nthe affidavit containing essentially the same facts as alleged in the Complaint.  The second affidavit \nsigned on 12/30/13 (“Second Parker Aff.”) contains additional facts not alleged in the Complaint. \n \n \nsupport judgment as a matter of law in favor of Plaintiff.  Accordingly, the Court will analyze \nthe motions together and consider the arguments raised by Patterson in his opposition to the \nmotion for default judgment as raised on behalf of all of the Defendants. \n42.  The facts and allegations establish that Patterson and Uhl were not successful \nin ousting Plaintiff’s Directors or electing themselves Directors at the Special Meeting.  It is \nundisputed that all of the voting shares of  stock were present at the Special Meeting. 50  \nPatterson and Uhl collectively own approximately 35% of Velleros’ stock.  Even if their proxy, \nFarzanegan, had properly voted all of Patterson ’s and Uhl’s shares in favor of removing \nPlaintiff’s Directors and electi ng Defendants, this was not sufficient to remove or elect \ndirectors under Plaintiff’s Bylaws. Plaintiff’s Bylaws provide that “[t]he vote of the holders of \na majority of the shares entitled to vote and thus represented at a meeting at which a quorum \nis present shall be the act of the stockholde rs’ meeting unless a greater number is required \n. . . .”51  The Bylaws further provide that “[t]he owners of a majority of the outstanding shares \nof capital stock may remove any Director  . . .” and that vacancies on the Board of Directors \n“will be filled by the owners of the majority  of outstanding shares of capital stock.” 52  It is \nundisputed that no shareholders others than Patterson and Uhl voted in favor of the removal \nof Plaintiff’s Directors and the election of Defendants as Directors.  Defendants received, at \nbest, the votes of only approximately 40% of Plaintiff’s outstanding shares.  This did not effect \nthe removal or election of any Directors. \n43. Similarly, Plaintiff’s Bylaws provide that the Bylaws can be amended only by \n“by the affirmative vote of a majori ty of shares entitled to vote.” 53  It is undisputed that \n                                                            \n50 Parker Aff. ¶ 17; Patterson Br. at 6. \n51 Bylaws Art. II, § 9. \n52 Bylaws Art. III §§ 3, 4. \n53 Bylaws Art. X § 1. \n \n \nDefendants’ proposed amendments to Plaintiff’s Bylaws received the votes of only Patterson’s \nand Uhl’s shares, and not the majority of Plaintiff’s shares required to amend the Bylaws. \n44. Finally, it is also undisputed that Defendants’ attempts to present and vote on \ntheir proposals at the Special Meeting were no t effective because no actual vote of the \nstockholders on those proposals was called for or taken at the Special Meeting. 54  Plaintiff’s \nBylaws authorized Parker, as Chairman of th e Board, to preside over all stockholder \nmeetings, and it is undisputed that Parker did not call for a vote on Defendants’ Proposals.55 \n45. Patterson argues that Defendants proper ly passed each of their proposals at \nthe Special Meeting because Patterson’s and Uhl’s shares constituted the majority of shares \nentitled to vote at the Special Meeting. This argument is contradicted by the allegations, the \nrecord evidence, and Patterson’s and Uhl’s ad missions.  Patterson concedes that “all \nshareholders were present, or represented by proxy, at the special meeting.”56  Although not \nalleged in the Complaint, by which th ey are bound, Defendants contend that all of the \nshareholders at the Special Meeting other than Patterson and Uhl “were represented by \nproxy that restricted their voti ng authority” and were not enti tled to vote on Defendants’ \nproposals.57  Defendants cite no support for this claim and, in fact, the undisputed facts \nestablish that stockholders owning 43.7% of the voting shares were present in person at the \nSpecial Meeting.  There is no allegation in th e Complaint or evidence in the record that any \nproxies at the Special Meeting were restricted from voting on any proposal.  Finally, by their \ndefault, Patterson and Uhl have admitted that Defendants’ proposals at the Special Meeting \nwere “not approved.” \n                                                            \n54 Parker Aff. ¶¶ 25-26; Compl. ¶ 43. \n55 Bylaws Art. VI. § 5.a.; Compl. ¶ 43; Parker Aff. ¶ 22. \n56 Patterson Br. at 6. \n57 Id. at 7. \n \n \n46. The undisputed material facts establish t hat Plaintiff is entitled to judgment \nas a matter of law with regard to its Motion for Summary Judgment against Johnston.  \n47. The admitted factual allegations in the Complaint establish that Plaintiff is \nentitled to default judgment against Patterson and Uhl.58 \n48. Plaintiff also seeks summary judgme nt on Johnston’s counterclaim for \ndeclaratory judgment.  In his counterclaim, Jo hnston seeks a declaration that Plaintiff did \nnot validly elect Danny Parker, Richard Speers,  and David LeClaire as Directors at the \nAnnual Meeting, and that at the Special M eeting Patterson and Uhl successfully removed \nParker, Speers, and LeClaire from office, el ected Defendants as Directors, and passed their \nproposed bylaws.  Again, Johnston did not file with the Court any evidence in opposition to \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the counterclaim.  The same undisputed facts \nthat entitle Plaintiff to summary judgment on  its claim for declaratory relief support entry \nof judgment as a matter of law in its favor wi th regard to Plainti ff’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment on Johnston’s counterclaim. \nMotions for Sanctions \n49. In its Order of December 13, 2013, this Court granted Plaintiff’s November 14, \n2013 motion to compel Johnston to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests but held in \nabeyance its ruling on Plaintiff’s request for sanctions related to that motion.  Pursuant to \nRule 37(a)(4) of the North Carolina Rules of  Civil Procedure, the Court now GRANTS \nPlaintiff’s request for sanctions. \n                                                            \n58 The Court need not address the parties’ respective arguments regarding the validity of the \nAdvance Notice Requirement imposed by Plaintiff and the sufficiency of Defendants’ notice regarding \nthe purposes for Special Meeting.  As discussed above, even if Defendants’ proposals were properly \npresented and voted upon at the Special Meeting, the undisputed facts establish that the proposals \nfailed to receive the required votes and were unsuccessful. \n \n \n \n50.  On February 4, 2014, Defendant Johns ton filed a Rule 11 Motion asserting \nthat Plaintiff’s counsel signed all the filings submitted by Plaintiff in this case in violation of \nRule 11. This Court subsequently granted Plaintiff’s motion to defer a responsive filing to the \nRule 11 Motion until after the resolution of the merits in this matter.  Having now considered \nthe record before it, the pleadings filed by Pl aintiff in this case, the brief submitted by \nJohnston in support of his Rule 11 Motion, and other appropriate matters, the Court in its \ndiscretion DENIES Johnston’s Rule 11 Motion, and Plaintiff is not required to respond to \nthat motion. \nNOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, it hereby is ORDERED that: \n51. Defendant Johnston’s Motion to Amend Answer and Include Third-Party \nComplaint is DENIED. \n52. Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to its First Claim for Relief for \nDeclaratory Judgment against Defendant Johnston is GRANTED. \n53. Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Johnston’s counterclaim for \ndeclaratory judgment is GRANTED. \n54. Plaintiff’s Oral Motion for Permanent Injunction is DENIED.\n59 \n55. Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment as to its First Claim for Relief for \nDeclaratory Judgment against Defendants Patterson and Uhl is GRANTED. \n56. The Court enters the following DECLARATORY JUDGMENT pursuant to \nG.S. §1-253 regarding the rights, status and other legal relations of the parties to this action: \na. Danny Parker, Richard Speers and David LeClaire were duly elected as \nmembers of Velleros’ Board of Directors at the April 16, 2013 Annual Meeting \nof the Company and constitute the current Board of Directors; \n                                                            \n59 The Court does not believe it would be appropriate to, or that it has the authority to, permanently \nenjoin Patterson and Uhl from participating in the affairs of Velleros in the future as shareholders. \n \n \nb. No stockholder vote occurred at the Special Meeting held on April 16, 2013, \nand no stockholder proposals were approved at the Special Meeting; \nc. The proposals offered by Patterson and Uhl were not approved by a majority \nof Velleros stockholders present in person  and  by proxy and entitled to vote, \nand were not effective to remove the current directors, elect Patterson, Uhl and \nJohnston as new directors, or to amend Velleros’ bylaws; \nd. Patterson, Uhl and Johnston currently lack  legal authority to act as directors \nor officers of Velleros. \n57. The Preliminary Injunction entered by this Court on May 15, 2013, is hereby \nDISSOLVED, and the security posted with th e Clerk of Court is RELEASED and may be \nreturned to Plaintiff. \n58. Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions filed on November 14, 2013 is GRANTED.  \nPlaintiff shall file with the court an affidavit specifying the fees and costs being sought within \n21 days of the entry of this Opinion and Order.   Defendants shall have 21 days to file any \nresponse to the affidavit filed by Plaintiff. \n59. Defendant Johnston’s Rule 11 Motion for sanctions is DENIED. \nSO ORDERED, this the 23rd day of February, 2015. \n   \n "
