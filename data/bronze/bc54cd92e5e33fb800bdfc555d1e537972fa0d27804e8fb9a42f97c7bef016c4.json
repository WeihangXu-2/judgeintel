The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  The following background, drawn from the evidence submitted \nby the parties, is intended only to provide context for the Court’s analysis and ruling. \n3. This case arises from the aftermath of  Hurricane Florence , which \ndevastated parts of the North Carolina coast in September 2018.  Among the hardest \nhit areas was the Village of Bald Head Island.   The storm damaged many homes on \nthe island, including those owned by MIP 1, LLC, David Peterson, and James and \nPatricia Bonica (together, “Homeowners”). \n4. In October 2018, after the hurricane had passed, the Homeowners engaged \nDisaster America USA, LLC  to repair and restore their homes.  (See Pls.’ Exs. 1–3, \nECF Nos. 99.2–99.4.)  Disaster America USA —along with its sister companies , \nDisaster America NC, LLC and DA Roofing Systems —markets itself as a n \nexperienced provider of catastrophic remediation and restoration services .  Donald \nHusk was its sole owner and CEO at all relevant times; his son, Jason, was the chief \n \n1 The Court granted leave for Hodges Coxe & Potter, LLP to withdraw after briefing on the \nmotion was complete. \n \n \noperating officer.  (See Dep. D. Husk 19:5–7, ECF No. 99.6; Aff. J. Husk ¶ 2, ECF No. \n102.3.) \n5. Disaster America USA is not a licensed general contractor in North Carolina \nand was not licensed at the time it contracted with the Homeowners .  (See, e.g. , \n30(b)(6) Dep. Disaster Am. USA 190:4–7, ECF No. 99.5.)  The Husks did not view this \nas a problem.   According to their deposition testimony, Disaster America USA \nobtained permission to use the North Carolina license of another general contractor, \nJCG & Associates , LLC .  (See, e.g. , 30(b)(6) Dep. Disaster Am. USA 120:16–24, \n216:12–24; Dep. D. Husk 160:25–161:18.)  JCG & Associates—which is undisputedly \nnot a party to any of the contracts—denies giving permission and denies having heard \nof Disaster America USA at all.  (See Aff. Greene ¶¶ 9–11, ECF No. 99.34.)  Even so, \nDisaster America USA named “DISASTER AMERICA USA, LLC/JCG & \nASSOCIATES, LLC” as the general contractor  in each contract .  (Pls.’ Exs. 1 –3.)  \nLater, Disaster America USA purported to assign the contracts to Disaster America \nNC, which obtained a North Carolina general contractor’s license in late 2018.  (See \nDep. D. Husk 144:4–24; Defs.’ Ex. 5, ECF No. 102.5.) \n6. The anticipated scope of work was broad.   Disaster America USA was to \nperform all repair and restoration work for the full scope of the Homeowners’ \ninsurance proc eeds.  ( See, e.g. , Pls.’ Exs. 1 –3.)  According to Jason Husk, the \nHomeowners “hired us to handle everything” from mitigation to reconstruction.  (Dep. \nJ. Husk 137: 9 –12, ECF No. 99.24 ; see also, e.g., Dep. D. Husk 70:8 –11, 147:12–19; \nDep. J. Husk 177:2–8.) \n \n \n7. By spring 2019, the Homeowners  had lost faith in Disaster America USA \nand its capabilities.  They questioned the pace of the restorations, believed that  \nDisaster America USA had overcharged and unnecessarily butted heads with the \ninsurance companies, and accused its workers and subcontractors of damaging parts \nof the homes that hadn’t been  damaged by the hurricane.  Frustrated, t he \nHomeowners retained counsel and terminated the contracts.  (See Aff. Bonica ¶¶ 15, \n17–20, 22, ECF No. 99.49; Aff. Smith ¶¶ 17, 22, 24, ECF No. 99.50; Aff. Peterson \n¶¶ 14, 15, ECF No. 99.51.) \n8. This case followed .  The Homeowners have asserted several claims, \nincluding negligence, fraud, constructive fraud, unfair or deceptive trade practices \nunder section 75-1.1, and others.  (See generally Compl., ECF No. 2; Am. Compl., ECF \nNo. 70 .)  In addition, they seek a declaratory judgment that the contracts with \nDisaster America USA are illegal and unenforceable.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 206–10.)  JCG \n& Associates also joined the suit as a plaintiff, alleging that Disaster America USA \nhad no right to u se its name and general contractor’s license.  (See, e.g. , Compl. \n¶¶ 121–35.)  Disaster America NC, as Disaster America USA’s assignee,  responded \nwith counterclaims for breach of contract and quantum meruit.  ( See generally \nAnswer to Am. Compl., ECF No. 71.) \n9. In December 2020, while discovery was ongoing, the Homeowners moved for \npartial summary judgment.  (See ECF No. 98.)  Their motion has been fully briefed, \nbut two events have delayed its resolution.  Shortly after the completion of briefing, \ncounsel for all defendants moved to withdraw, which the Court granted.  Then, a few \n \n \nweeks later, Donald Husk died.  His estate has since been substituted as a party in \nhis place.  No counsel  has appeared, however, on behalf of the estate or any other \nnamed defendant (together, “Defendants”).   \n10. Although the Court invited Defendants to suggest a convenient hearing date \nfor the pending motion for summary judgment, they  did not respond .  The Cour t \ntherefore elects to decide the motion based on the briefs and supporting materials \nfiled by counsel.  See BCR 7.4. \nII.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n11. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In deciding a motion for summary \njudgment, the Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty and draws all inferences in its favor.  See Vizant Techs., LLC v. YRC Worldwide, \nInc., 373 N.C. 549, 556 (2020); N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sadler , 365 N.C. \n178, 182 (2011). \n12. The moving party “bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of \na genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, \n579 (2002).  If the moving party carries this burden, the opposing party “may not rest \nupon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading,” N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e), but must \ninstead “come forward with specific facts establishing the presence of a genuin e \nfactual dispute for trial,” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 356 N.C. at 579.  “An issue is ‘genuine’ \n \n \nif it can be proven by substantial evidence and a fact is ‘material’ if it would constitute \nor irrevocably establish any material element of a claim or a defense. ”  Lowe v. \nBradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369 (1982) (quoting Bone Int’l, Inc. v. Brooks, 304 N.C. 371, \n374–75 (1981)). \n13. “When the party with the burden of proof moves for summary judgment, a \ngreater burden must be met.”  Almond Grading Co. v. Shaver, 74 N.C. App. 576, 578 \n(1985).  The movant “must show that there are no genuine issues of fact ; that there \nare no gaps in his proof; that no inferences inconsistent with his recovery arise from \nthe evidence; and that there is no standard that must be applied to the fac ts by the \njury.”  Kidd v. Early, 289 N.C. 343, 370 (1976).  For that reason, “rarely is it proper \nto enter summary judgment in favor of the party having the burden of proof.”  \nBlackwell v. Massey, 69 N.C. App. 240, 243 (1984 ); see also Parks Chevrolet, Inc. v. \nWatkins, 74 N.C. App. 719, 721 (1985). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n14. At issue are the Homeowners’ claims for declaratory judgment and unfair or \ndeceptive trade practices and Disaster America NC’s  counterclaims for breach of \ncontract and quantum meruit .  Because t he arguments directed to the \ndeclaratory-judgment claim and the counterclaims are closely tied together, the Court \nconsiders them in tandem.2 \n \n2 In their opposition brief, Defendants object that the motion is premature because it was \nfiled before the end of discovery.  Not so.  The Rules of Civil Procedure and th e case \nmanagement order in this action do not bar early motions for summary judgment .  And in \nany event, the parties completed discovery well in advance of this opinion, yet Defendants \nhave never asked to supplement the record. \n \n \nA. Contract Enforceability  \n15. It is undisputed  that Disaster America USA was not a licensed general \ncontractor when it inked contracts with the Homeowners to repair and restore their \nproperties.  The Homeowners contend that the contracts are illegal and unenforceable \nas a result.  They seek a declaration to that effect and further contend that Disaster \nAmerica NC’s counterclaims to enforce the contracts necessarily fail. \n16. By statute, anyone who makes a contract to perform construction services \nvalued over $30,000 must have a general contractor’s license.  See N.C.G.S. § 87-1.  \nOur Supreme Court has stressed that a “contract illegally entered into by an \nunlicensed general construction contractor is unenforceable by the contractor.”  \nBrady v. Fulghum, 309 N.C. 580, 586 (1983).  This is an unyielding rule.  The contract \n“cannot be validated by the contractor’s subsequent procurement of a license,” id., or \nby partnering with a licensed contractor, see, e.g., Hawkins v. Holland, 97 N.C. App. \n291, 294 (1990); Joe Newton, Inc. v. Tull , 75 N.C. App. 325, 328 (1985).   Likewise, \nassignment to a licensed contractor  does not  “cure the illegal contract. ”  Jenco v. \nSignature Homes, Inc., 122 N.C. App. 95, 100 (1996). \n17. Under these decisions, the contracts between Disaster America USA and the \nHomeowners are unenforceable.  In each contract, Disaster America USA agreed to \nperform comprehensive repair and restoration services  with a value  greater than \n$30,000.  ( See Pls.’ Exs. 1 –3; see also, e.g., Pls.’ Exs. 40–43, ECF No s. 99.54–99.57 \n(addressing cost of services).)  Later, Disaster America USA assigned the contracts to \nDisaster America NC.  ( See Defs.’ Ex. 5.)   But Defendants concede that Disaster \n \n \nAmerica USA “was not licensed as a general contractor” when it made the contracts.  \n(Opp’n 7, ECF No. 102; see also, e.g., 30(b)(6) Dep. Disaster America USA 70:22–71:3.)  \nThus, neither it nor Disaster America NC can enforce them now.  \n18. Defendants’ responses are not persuasive.  They argue,  first, that Disaster \nAmerica USA had permission from JCG & Associates to use its license to perform the \ncontracts.  Even if true, that is immaterial because the contracting party itself “must \nbe licensed.”  Hawkins, 97 N.C. App. at 294; see also Joe Newton, 75 N.C. App. at 328–\n29.  Here, it is undisputed that the Homeowners’ contracts are with Disaster America \nUSA, not JCG & Associates. \n19. Next, Defendants deny that Disaster America USA needed a license.  They \ncontend that the contracts were not for  construction services, as defined by section \n87-1, and that they performed no such serv ices before the Homeowners terminated \nthe contracts.  (See Opp’n 7–9.)  This contention is meritless. \n20. Each contract bears the title “Construction Agreement,” states that it is “a \nconstruction contract,” and contemplates extensive restoration work, including \npotentially “roof removal, roofing, siding, trim, gutters, awnings, carports, carpentry, \nand masonry.”  (Pls.’ Exs. 1–3.)  Defendants’ own witnesses and evidence confirm that \nDisaster America USA contracted for constr uction work.  ( See, e.g. , Dep. D. Husk \n70:8–11, 147:12 –19; Defs.’ Ex. 5 at 1 (stating that assigned contracts were for \n“construction services”).)  And e verything done before the contracts were \nterminated—demolition, removal, and related preparatory work —was part and \nparcel of the overall restoration project.  Without question, section 87-1 requires a \n \n \ngeneral contractor’s license for home renovation and restoration  of this kind .  See \nDaye v. Roberts, 89 N.C. App. 344, 346 (1988) (“There is no doubt that plaintiff’s work \n[to restore] defendants’ home [after a fire] constituted an ‘improvement’ under G.S. \n87-1.”); Mill-Power Supply Co. v. CVM Assocs., 85 N.C. App. 455, 460–61 (1987) (“We \nfind that plaintiff undertook to construct an ‘improvement’ under G.S. 87-1 by adding \na roof over an existing structure.”); Reliable Props., Inc. v. McAllister , 77 N.C. App. \n783, 786 (1985) (requiring license when “renovation included the installation of new \nroofing, correction of dry rot, installation of new storm doors and windows, and the \ncomplete renovation of all apartment interiors; including new paint, wallpaper and \ncarpet”). \n21. Defendants also argue tha t they may rely on the contracts , even if \nunenforceable, for defensive purposes—namely, to offset any damages claimed by the \nHomeowners.  Perhaps that is true, but the Court need not and does not address the \nissue because the Homeowners have not moved for summary judgment as to any \naffirmative defense.  (See Reply Br. 8, ECF No. 107.) \n22. In sum, the undisputed evidence shows that the contracts at issue are illegal \nand unenforceable.  The Homeowners are entitled to a declaration saying the same. \n23. No further analysis is required for Disaster America NC’s  counterclaims.  \n“Our Courts have repeatedly held that an unlicensed contractor may not recover on \na contract or in quantum meruit.”  Reliable Props., 77 N.C. App. at 785.   The Court \ntherefore enters  summary judgment in favor of the Homeowners as to the \ncounterclaims as well.  \n \n \nB. Section 75-1.1  \n24. The Homeowners seek summary judgment as to their claim for unfair or \ndeceptive trade practices under section 75 -1.1.  This claim, too, is based on Disaster \nAmerica USA’s actions as an unlicensed contractor.  Going further, the Homeowners \ncontend that all Defendants are liable on a theory of concerted action. \n25. Section 75-1.1 requires a plaintiff to show that “(1) defendant committed an \nunfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) the action in question was in or affecting \ncommerce, and (3) the act proximately caused injury to the plaintiff.”  Dalton v. Camp, \n353 N.C. 647, 656 (2001).  If the claim stems from an alleged misrepresentation, the \nplaintiff must “demonstrate reliance on the misrepresentation in order to show the \nnecessary proximate cause.”  Bumpers v. Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 367 N.C. 81, 88 (2013). \n26. Numerous factual disputes preclude summary judgment.   First, the \nHomeowners argue, in part, that Disaster America USA misrepresented its status as \na licensed contractor and impersonated JCG & Associates in violation of N.C.G.S. \n87-13.  There is evidence, though, that Disa ster America USA informed prospective \ncustomers that it was unlicensed, telling them that it was instead relying on someone \nelse’s license.  (See 30(b)(6) Dep. Disaster Am. USA 182:24–183:5; Aff. Smith ¶ 9.) \n27. Second, whether the Homeowners relied on any alleged misrepresentation \nis contested.  They claim that they would not have hired Disaster America USA had \nthey known that it was unlicensed.  ( See Aff. Bonica ¶ 13; Aff. Smith ¶ 13; Aff. \nPeterson ¶ 11.)  In response, though, Defendants point to evidence that the \nHomeowners hired Disaster America USA based on referrals from their insurance \n \n \nadjuster, property manager, or both .  (See, e.g. , 30(b)(6) Dep. Disaster Am. USA \n138:18–140:23, 176:18–177:11; Dep. Hill 119:15–122:2; see also Dep. Hill 132:1–18 \n(“the contract process actually went through Wendy Wilmot’s office”).)  This evidence \ncould support an inference that the Homeowners relied on referrals rather than any \nrepresentations by Disaster America USA. \n28. Third, the evidence of injury is also muddled.  The Homeowners claim to \nhave suffered injury due to damage caused by workers and unreasonable delays  by \nDisaster America  USA, among other things .  These injuries appear to stem from \nallegedly deficient performance under the contracts.  It is less clear whether they \nwere proximately caused by misrepresentations about Disaster America USA’s \nlicensing status. \n29. Notably, the Homeowners ’ briefs do not mention , much less satisfy, the \nhigher burden they face when seeking summary judgment on their own claim.  The \nHomeowners have not shown an absence of genuine issues of material fact and that \nthere are no gaps in their proof.  The Court therefore denies the Homeowners’ motion \nas to the claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices.  See, e.g., Kidd, 289 N.C. at 370 \n(“[I]f the need for cross -examination appears, the court is free to deny the summary \njudgment motion.”); Blackwell, 69 N.C. App. at 243 (“[R]arely is it proper to enter \nsummary judgment in favor of the party having the burden of proof.”). \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n30. For all these reasons, the Court GRANTS the Homeowners’ motion for \nsummary judgment in part and DENIES it in part, as follows:  \n \n \na. The Court enters judgment in favor of the Homeowners as to their claim \nfor declaratory judgment.  The Court DECLARES that Disaster \nAmerica USA and Disaster America NC may not enforce the contracts at \nissue, (Pls.’ Exs. 1–3). \nb. The Court enters judgment in favor of the Homeowners as to Disaster \nAmerica NC’s counterclaims for breach of contract and quantum meruit.  \nThese counterclaims are DISMISSED with prejudice.   \nc. The Court DENIES the motion as to the Homeowners’ claim for unfair \nor deceptive trade practices.  This claim shall proceed to trial. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 9th day of December, 2021.   \n  /s/ Adam M. Conrad   \nAdam M.
