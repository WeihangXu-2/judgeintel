Having considered the \nMotion, the parties’ briefs, the arguments of counsel, the applicable law, and all other \nappropriate matters of record, the Court concludes that the Motion to Dismiss should \nbe GRANTED in part and DENIED in part for the reasons set forth below. \nMiano Law PC by Bert J. Miano for Plaintiff Action Learning Associates, LLC. \nEllis & Winters LLP by Jonathan D. Sasser and Kyle A. Medin for Defendants \nKenan-Flagler Business School Executive Education LLC; Heather Freeland; \nDavid Hofmann; and Stephen Hyde. \nDavis, Judge. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n1. This case arises from the  deterioration of a decade-long relationship \nbetween two businesses in the corporate leadership and executive education industry.  \nFor years, Plaintiff Action Learning Associates, LLC (“Plaintiff”) contracted with \nKFEE to design and facilitate executive learning courses for KFEE’s clients, \nincluding ExxonMobil.  Plaintiff alleges that , beginning in 2022 , KFEE began \ninfringing on Plaintiff’s proprietary material, soliciting Plaintiff’s current and former \nemployees, and misrepresenting the long -term prospects of the parties’ contractual \nrelationship in an effort to begin servicing ExxonMobil directly.  Defendants now seek \ndismissal of all of Plaintiff’s claims. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n2. The Court does not make findings of fact in connection with a motion to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and \ninstead recites those facts contained in the complaint and in documents attached to, \nreferred to, or incorporated by reference in the complaint that are relevant to the \nCourt’s determination of the motion.  See, e.g., Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC \nv. Window World, Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 12, 2017). \n3. Plaintiff is a Colorado limited liability company that is primarily in the \nbusiness of providing executive education services to businesses throughout the \nworld.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 11.) \n4. KFEE is a North Carolina non -profit limited liability company , which \noperates from the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the \n \nKenan-Flagler Business School.  (Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 2, 14.)  KFEE provides executive \neducation services to private business es through annual contracts with third -party \nproviders, such as Plaintiff.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 13.) \n5. At all times relevant to this action, Freeland, Hofmann, and Hyde \n(collectively, the “Individual Defendants”) were employed by KFEE.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n3–5.) \n6. Beginning in 2013, KFEE contracted with Plaintiff to provide executive \ndevelopment services to one of KFEE’s corporate clients—ExxonMobil.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 17.)  The terms of the agreement were reflected in an Independent Contractor Scope \nof Work (“SOW”) agreement between Plaintiff and KFEE.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 19.) \n7. Generally, Plaintiff was responsible for providing personnel to conduct \nexecutive development services  through an Emerging Leadership Program —and \nlater, a Business Leadership Program  (together with the Emerging Leadership \nProgram, the “ExxonMobil Programs”) —to ExxonMobil executives in the Americas, \nEurope, and Asia.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19.) \n8. On 22 August 2019, KFEE engaged Plaintiff to redesign the Emerging \nLeadership Program for ExxonMobil.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 20.) \n9. The terms of the redesign were reflected in a Master Services Agreement \n(“MSA”) and in the SOW.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.)   Specifically, the MSA provided that \nthe contract would be for a one -year term, subject to renewal upon the mutual \nagreement of Plaintiff and KFEE.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.) \n \n10. Between 2019 and 2022, the MSA was renewed on an annual basis , \nwhich resulted in Plaintiff expending significant resources across multiple years to \nredesign and develop unique materials for the ExxonMobil Programs.  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 22–23.) \n11. On 30 September 2022, KFEE’s Program Director, Tony Laffoley, \ncontacted Plaintiff to inquire  about its ability to expand its capacity to deliver the \nExxonMobil Programs in three regions in 2024.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 29.) \n12. Plaintiff responded on 4 October 2022 by providing plans for expanding \nits capacity in 2024 and expressing its expectation that such an investment would be \nrecouped by KFEE agreeing to renew the MSA for a period of at least five years.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 30.) \n13. Around that same time, while negotiating the 2023 renewal of the MSA, \nKFEE represented that Plaintiff could “get more fees in 2024” if Plaintiff “work[ed] \nwith [KFEE] for 2023” by reducing its professional fees and discounting Plaintiff’s \nprograms in Europe and Asia.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 25.) \n14. In these negotiations and through  “multiple conversations and emails” \nbetween late 2022  and July 2023 , KFEE executives continued to make Plaintiff \nbelieve that the MSA would subsequently be renewed in 2024 and beyond.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 27.) \n15. Based on the promise of “more fees in 2024” and the belief that the MSA \nwould continue to be renewed on a long -term basis, Plaintiff entered into a one-year \n \ncontract to renew the MSA on 6 January 2023  at discounted rates.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n25–26.) \n16. From January to June 2023, Plaintiff and KFEE continued discussing \nkey details —such as pricing , scale, onboarding, and dates —for the ExxonMobil \nPrograms in 2024.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31–33.) \n17. On 23 May 2023, Hofmann (KFEE’s Faculty Director for the ExxonMobil \nPrograms) traveled to Singapore and  met with Plaintiff’s Lead Facilitator for Asia, \nAlexandre Paitre.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.) \n18. During the meeting, Hofmann expressed doubt that Plaintiff woul d \ncontinue to be involved with the Emerging Leadership Program beyond 2023 and \ninquired as to whether Paitre would be restricted in his ability to work directly with \nKFEE.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 37.) \n19. On 8 June 2023, Plaintiff’s President, Scott Miller , attempted to \nschedule a meeting with KFEE leadership  to discuss issues concerning Plaintiff’s \nrelationship with KFEE but was unable to do so.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 45.) \n20. The next day,  Freeland (KFEE’s Program Director)  participated in a \nWhatsApp call with Plaintiff’s Lead Facilitator in Europe, Kari Erickson (together \nwith Paitre, the “Current Facilitators”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 38.) \n21. During the call, Freeland told Erickson that the relationship between \nKFEE and Plaintiff was not going well and that KFEE was considering other options \nfor 2024.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 39.)  Freeland inquired as to what Erickson thought about \n \ncontracting directly with KFEE to facilitate the ExxonMobil Programs in 2024.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 40.) \n22. Erickson rebuffed Freeland’s suggestion and recommended that \nFreeland communicate directly with Plaintiff.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 41.) \n23. Erickson subsequently learned of Hofmann’s meeting with Paitre  and \nreported both incidents to Miller.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 44.) \n24. On 24 July 2023, Miller learned that KFEE had registered two of \nPlaintiff’s former employees—Jenn Giordano and Ryan Soares (together, the “Former \nFacilitators”)—as “observers” for an upcoming Emerging Leadership Program.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 47.) \n25. When pressed about why he had been scheduled to attend the Emerging \nLeadership Program, Soares informed Miller that  he had signed a non -disclosure \nagreement with KFEE and that he had been instructed to keep his attendance on the \n“down low.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 48.) \n26. The next day, Miller contacted Hyde (KFEE’s President ) to discuss \nFreeland and Hofmann’s sol icitation of the Current Facilitators and Former \nFacilitators, as well as to express his concern regarding the need to protect Plaintiff’s \nproprietary information relating to the ExxonMobil Programs.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 51.) \n27. However, instead of  conducting an independent investigation  into \nFreeland and Hofmann’s conduct , Hyde informed them of his conversation with \nMiller so that they could “resolve” the situation with Plaintiff .  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 52 –\n53.) \n \n28. Shortly thereafter, on 10 August 2023, KFEE notified Plaintiff that the \nMSA would not be renewed for 2024 as it relate d to the Emerging Leadership \nProgram in Europe and Asia.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 59.) \n29. Two weeks later, on 25 August 2023, KFEE informed Plaintiff that the \nMSA would not be renewed for 2024 with regard to the Business Leadership Program.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 60.) \n30. Plaintiff contends that rather than renew ing the MSA, KFEE has \ninstead hired the Former Facilitators and provided them with unauthorized access to \nPlaintiff’s proprietary materials so that KFEE can facilitate the ExxonMobil \nPrograms itself.  (Compl. ¶¶ 61–62.) \n31. Plaintiff initiated this action by filing a Complaint (“Complaint ,” ECF \nNo. 3 ) in Orange County Superior Court on 19 November 2024  asserting various \nclaims for monetary relief against Defendants. \n32. This matter was subsequently designated to the Business Court and \nassigned to the undersigned on 22 January 2025.  (ECF Nos. 1–2.) \n33. On 11 February 2025, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the \nComplaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  \n(ECF No. 8.) \n34. However, while th at motion to dismiss was pending, Plaintiff filed an \nAmended Complaint (“Amended Complaint,” ECF No. 12) on 10 March 2025.   \nTherefore, the Court denied the motion to dismiss as moot.  (ECF No. 14.) \n \n35. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff reasserted the five claims for relief \npled in the original Complaint —breach of contract, tortious interference with \ncontractual relations, fraud and fraud in the inducement, unfair and deceptive trade \npractices (“UDTP”), and conversion.  (Compare Compl. ¶¶ 1–109 with Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n1–112.)  In addition, the Amended Complaint alleged three new claims for relief—\nmisappropriation of trade secrets, constructive fraud, and civil conspiracy.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 112–38.) \n36. Defendants filed the present Motion to Dismiss on 9 April 2025. \n37. This matter came on for a hearing before the Court on 10 June 2025 at \nwhich all parties were represented by counsel.  (See ECF No. 20.) \n38. Having been fully briefed, the Motion  to Dismiss  is now ripe for \nresolution. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n39. In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may only \nconsider the complaint and “any exhibits attached to the complaint[,]” Krawiec v. \nManly, 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018), in order to determine whether “as a matter of law, \nthe allegations of the complaint, treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted under some recognized legal theory,” Forsyth Mem’l \nHosp., Inc. v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc. , 336 N.C. 438, 442 (1994) (cleaned up).  \nThe Court must view the allegations in the complaint “in the light most favorable to \nthe non-moving party.”  Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, Inc. , 370 N.C. 1, 5 \n(2017) (cleaned up). \n \n40. “It is well established that dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper \nwhen (1) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; \n(2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good \nclaim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.”  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (cleaned up). \nANALYSIS \n41. In the Motion  to Dismiss , Defendants seek dismissal of all claims \nasserted against them in the Amended Complaint.  The Court will address each claim \nin turn. \nI. Breach of Contract  \n42. “The elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) existence of a valid \ncontract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.  The elements of a valid contract \nare offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutuality of assent to the contract’s \nessential terms.”  Davis v. Woods, 286 N.C. App. 547, 561 (2022) (cleaned up). \n43. As an initial matter, Plaintiff concedes that the Individual Defendants \nare not parties to the MSA  or the SOW.  Therefore, as non -parties to a ny contract \nwith Plaintiff, the Individual Defendants cannot be liable for breach of contract.  See \nHowe v. Links Club Condo. Ass’n , 263 N.C. App. 130, 139 (2018) ( stating that “as a \nmatter of law, a non-party to a contract cannot be held liable for any breach that may \nhave occurred”); see also Loray Master Tenant, LLC v. Foss N.C. Mill Credit 2014 \nFund I, LLC , 2022 NCBC LEXIS 1, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 11, 2022) ( holding \n \nthat a “claim for breach of contract must be dismissed against [defendant] because it \nis a non-party to the [a]greement”). \n44. Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for breach of \ncontract is GRANTED with respect to the Individual Defendants. \n45. With regard to KFEE, Plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract is broadly \npremised on two purported breaches:  (1) KFEE’s decision not to renew the MSA in \n2024, and (2) KFEE’s breach of the confidentiality  and non-disclosure provisions of \nthe MSA. \nA. Nonrenewal of the MSA \n46. Plaintiff first asserts that KFEE’s decision not to renew the MSA in 2024 \namounts to a breach of its contracts with KFEE.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 74.) \n47. However, this theory contradicts the allegations in the Amended \nComplaint.  The Amended Complaint makes clear that Plaintiff’s “work was reflected \nin a Master Services Agreement (‘MSA’) between KFEE and [Plaintiff] with a \nrenewable one-year term” and that the terms of the renewal had to be negotiated and \nagreed upon by both Plaintiff and KFEE.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 21; see also Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n24–25.) \n48. North Carolina caselaw is clear that absent a contractual right to \nrenewal, a party’s decision not to renew a contract does not give rise to a claim for \nbreach of contract.  See Fox v. Lenoir-Rhyne Univ., ___ N.C. App ___, 2024 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 966, at *10–14 (2024) (concluding that a university’s decision not to renew an \nathletic scholarship that was “for one academic year” did not give rise to a claim for \n \nbreach of contract); Gibbs v. Guilford Tech. Cmty. Coll., 2004 N.C. App. LEXIS 1487, \nat *12 –13 (N.C. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 2004) (unpublished) (holding that an employer \nexercising its “reserved [] right of nonrenewal of any employment agreements” did \nnot constitute a breach of contract). \n49. Therefore, because Plaintiff has failed to plead a contractual right to \nrenewal, KFEE’s decision not to renew the MSA in 2024 cannot support a claim for \nbreach of contract. \n50. In apparent recognition of this defect, Plaintiff asserts in its brief  that \nKFEE’s decision not to renew the MSA  also constitutes a breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing. \n51. As an initial matter, the Amended Complaint does not allege a violation \nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Instead, to the contrary, the \nAmended Complaint expressly alleges that “ Defendants’ retaliatory decisions not to \nrenew the contract . . . are breaches of the explicit terms of the MSA and SOW.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 74 (emphasis added).) \n52. Under North Carolina caselaw, “‘where a party’s claim for breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is based upon the same acts as its \nclaim for breach of contract, we treat the former claim as part and parcel of the latter,’ \nso that the two rise and fall together.”  Vill. at Motts Landing Homeowners’ Ass’n v. \nAftew Props., LLC, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 100, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 14, 2023) \n(quoting Cordaro v. Harrington Bank, FSB, 260 N.C. App. 26, 38–39 (2018)). \n \n53. Therefore, because Plaintiff’s claim for breach of an express term of the \nMSA fails, so too does its claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and \nfair dealing  based on  identical facts.  See, e.g., Johnson Bros. Corp. v. City of \nCharlotte, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 32, at *42 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, 2024) (dismissing \na claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where it was \n“based on the same alleged facts as [the] claim for breach of contract”). \n54. Accordingly, KFEE’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s  claim for breach of \ncontract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on \nits decision not to renew the MSA in 2024 is GRANTED. \nB. Sections 8 and 9 of the MSA \n55. Plaintiff further contends that KFEE violated the MSA’s confidentiality \nand non-disclosure provisions set out in Sections 8 and 9.  In support of this assertion, \nthe Amended Complaint alleges as follows: \nSection 8 of the 2023 MSA prohibits KFEE from sharing [Plaintiff’s] \nconfidential information with any third party and from using any of \n[Plaintiff’s] confidential information outside the terms of the SOW. \nKFEE manages access to [Plaintiff’s] work product, proprietary \nmaterials, and intellectual property (deemed “Contractor materials” in \nthe MSA) which in the case of the ExxonMobil program is stored on \nKFEE’s SharePoint server. \n. . .  \nDefendants have permitted nearly 70 unauthorized individuals to have \nuncontrolled access to [Plaintiff’s] proprietary material and intellectual \nproperty through KFEE’s SharePoint server despite repeated requests \nby [Plaintiff ] that access to that content be restricted pursuant to \nSection 8 of the MSA. \n. . .  \n \nSection 9 of the 2023 MSA bars KFEE from any \nright to use, copy, modify, execute, reproduce, display, perform, \nsublicense, and distribute, either internally or externally, any \nportion of Contractor materials or deliverables in any form.  \nFurthermore, [KFEE] shall not prepare derivative works based \nupon or authorize any third-party use of Contractor materials or \ndeliverables. \nThe executive education program designed and developed by [Plaintiff] \nfor ExxonMobil contains [Plaintiff’s] proprietary material and \nintellectual property. \nDefendants have allowed unauthorized third parties to use, copy, \nmodify, reproduce, display, perform, and distribute [Plaintiff’s] \nproprietary Contractor materials and to prepare derivative works based \nupon [Plaintiff’s] proprietary Contractor materials and deliverables. \n. . .  \nDefendants’ retaliatory decisions . . . to hire third parties including \nformer [Plaintiff] facilitators to use [Plaintiff’s] proprietary materials to \nimplement a program designed and developed by [Plaintiff] are breaches \nof the explicit terms of the MSA and SOW. \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 63–64, 67, 70–72, 74.) \n56. As Defendants’ counsel candidly acknowledged at the 10 June hearing, \nthese allegations are sufficient to satisfy the low bar of notice pleading for claims of \nbreach of contract.  See Dunn Holdings I, Inc. v. Confluent Health LLC , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 215, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 10, 2018) ( concluding that “[w]hile the \nallegations are bare-boned . . . [d]efendants’ allegations meet the low bar for breach \nof contract claims set by North Carolina’s notice pleading standard”); see also LFF IV \nTimber Holding LLC v. Heartwood Forestland Fund IV LLC, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 119, \nat *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 6, 2024) (noting that “[a]lthough [plaintiff] will, of course, \nhave to make a more detailed showing at later stages of this litigation  . . . its \n \nallegations are sufficient to pass muster under” the “relatively low bar” of notice \npleading for claims of breach of contract). \n57. Therefore, KFEE’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for breach of \ncontract as it relates to  the alleged breaches of Sections 8 and 9 of the MSA is \nDENIED. \nII. Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations \n58. Our Supreme Court has articulated the following elements of a \ntortious interference with existing contract claim: \n(1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third person which \nconfers upon the plaintiff a contractual right against a third person; (2) \nthe defendant knows of the contract; (3) the defendant intentionally \ninduces the third person not to perform the contract; (4) and in doing so \nacts without justification; (5) resulting in actual damage to plaintiff. \nUnited Lab’ys, Inc. v. Kuykendall, 322 N.C. 643, 661 (1988) (cleaned up). \n59. Plaintiff claims that Defendants have tortious ly interfered with the \nfollowing two categories of agreements: (1) Plaintiff’s contracts with KFEE and (2) \nPlaintiff’s contracts with the Former Facilitators. \nA. Contracts with KFEE \n60. As to Plaintiff’s first theory—that Defendants tortiously interfered with \nPlaintiff’s contracts with KFEE—the Amended Complaint alleges as follows: \nAs described more fully above, the Parties entered into a series of valid \nand enforceable agreements, including the 2023 Master Services \nAgreement (“2023 MSA”) and its incorporated Scope of Work (“SOW”). \n. . .  \nDefendants were aware of the existence of the contracts referenced \nabove. \n \nDefendants intentionally interfered with those contractual relations \nwithout justification. \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 82, 84–85.) \n61. However, as Plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged at the  10 June hearing, \none cannot legally interfere with a contract to which it is a party.  See, e.g., Lineage \nLogistics, LLC v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 2023 NCBC LEXIS 97, at *42 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Aug. 10, 2023)  (stating that “[g]enerally, a party cannot interfere with its own \ncontract[s]”). \n62. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot proceed on this theory against KFEE itself. \n63. Plaintiff attempts to salvage this claim by asserting that the Individual \nDefendants committed the alleged tortious interference by inducing KFEE to breach \nthe terms of the MSA and SOW.  Plaintiff argues that these actions were taken \noutside the course and scope of the Individual Defendants’ employment duties such \nthat they can be held individually liable for this conduct. \n64. However, the most basic problem with this  argument is that it is not \nsupported by the allegations in the Amended Complaint , which does not specifically \nallege that the Individual Defendants took any action to induce  KFEE to breach its \ncontracts with Plaintiff.  Therefore, this theory lacks merit. \nB. Contracts with Former Facilitators \n65. As to Plaintiff’s second theory, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants \ninterfered with Plaintiff’s contracts with its Former Facilitators —Giordano and \nSoares. \n \n66. Plaintiff concedes that neither Giordano nor Soares were employed by \nPlaintiff during the time period at issue.  Rather, Plaintiff argues that Giordano and \nSoares were subject to non-disclosure agreements with Plaintiff and that Defendants \ninduced them to breach  those agreements.  However, once again, the allegations in \nthe Amended Complaint do not support Plaintiff’s theory. \n67. Aside from general references to Plaintiff’s “contractual relationships” \nwith the Former Facilitators, the Amended Complaint does not allege that Giordano \nwas subject to a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement with Plaintiff. \n68. Furthermore, even accepting the conclusory allegation that Soares was \nsubject to a non -disclosure or confidentiality agreement with Plaintiff, a careful \nreading of the Amended Complaint reveals that there are no  allegations that \nDefendants actually attempted to induce Soares to breach that agreement by sharing \nconfidential information with KFEE.  As a result, this theory is also defective. \n69. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim s for tortious \ninterference with contractual relations is GRANTED. \nIII. Fraud and Fraudulent Inducement \n70. To state a valid claim for fraud, a plaintiff must allege “(1) [a] \nrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, \n(3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage \nto the injured party.”  Ward v. Fogel, 237 N.C. App. 570, 581 (2014), disc. rev. denied, \n368 N.C. 249 (2015). \n \n71. Our Supreme Court has held that the elements of claims for fraud and \nfraudulent inducement are identical.  Value Health Sols., Inc. v. Pharm. Rsch. \nAssocs., 385 N.C. 250, 264 (2023).  As a result, the Court shall consider the two claims \ntogether.  See Hale v. MacLeod, 294 N.C. App. 318, 328 (2024) (stating that “because \nthe elements for showing fraud and fraudulent inducement are identical, we consider \nthe first and second causes of action together”); B&D Software Holdings, LLC v. \nInfobelt, Inc., 2024 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 1, 2024) (analyzing \nclaims for fraud and fraudulent inducement together). \n72. “Claims of fraud are held to a heightened pleading standard pursuant \nto Rule 9(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure .”  Julian v. Wells Fargo \nBank, N.A., 2012 NCBC LEXIS 32, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 22, 2012 ) (cleaned \nup).  The particularity requirement of Rule 9(b) “is met by alleging [the] time, place \nand content of the fraudulent representation, [the] identity of the person making the \nrepresentation and what was obtained as a result of the fraudulent acts or \nrepresentations.”  Terry v. Terry , 302 N.C. 77, 85 (1981) .  “An alleged \nmisrepresentation must be ‘definite and specific.’”  Value Health Sols., Inc., 385 N.C. \nat 263.  If a fraud claim is premised on a promissory representation, “facts must be \nalleged from which a court and jury may reasonably infer that the defendant did not \nintend to carry out such representations when they were made.”  Whitley v. O’Neal, \n5 N.C. App. 136, 139 (1969) (cleaned up). \n \n73. In support of its claim s for fraud and fraudulent inducement, Plaintiff \nlargely relies on vague and conclusory allegations .  Such allegations include the \nfollowing: \nDuring negotiations for the 2023 renewal contract, [Plaintiff] agreed to \nlower its professional fees and give KFEE a discount on programs in \nEurope and Asia with the express promise that [Plaintiff] could “get \nmore fees in 2024” if [Plaintiff] “work[ed] with us for 2023.” \n. . .  \nThrough multiple conversions and emails from late 2022 and as late as \nJuly 2023 between executives of KFEE and [Plaintiff], Defendants led \n[Plaintiff] to believe the current MSA would be renewed into 2024 and \nbeyond.  Plans and program dates for the 2024 program were discussed \nand confirmed. \nDuring these discussions, [Plaintiff] expressed its understanding that \nits investment of resources into developing these educational materials \nfor ExxonMobil’s use since 2019 would be recouped by continued \nrenewal of the MSA contract in 2024 and beyond. \n. . .  \n[Plaintiff] continued its efforts to design and develop programming for \nExxonMobil throughout 2022 and 2023 in reliance on multiple express \nand implied representations by KFEE that [Plaintiff] would be able to \nrecoup its costs and discounted rates through continued renewal of its \ncontract with KFEE to provide services to ExxonMobil over a period of \nyears. \n. . . \nThese misrepresentations and concealment [s] were reflected in phone \nconversations and emails between Scott Miller of [Plaintiff] and multiple \nrepresentatives of KFEE, including Program Director Tony Laffoley and \nothers. \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 27–28, 34, 89.) \n74. These allegations fall far short of the Rule 9(b) particularity \nrequirement in that they (1) allege broad windows of time  in which the purported \n \nstatements were made ; (2) fail to describe the specific  and definite contents of the \nalleged representations; and (3) fail to identify the specific speaker attributable to \neach statement.  See Value Health Sols., Inc., 385 N.C. at 266 (finding the allegation \nthat the misrepresentation was made “[d]uring a yearlong due diligen ce period and \nnegotiations” insufficiently particular as to time); Alamance Fam . Prac., P.A. v. \nLindley, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 83, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 14, 2018) ( concluding \nthat the claim was inadequate when “the tim[ing] of the representations is [pled] only \nas a broad range”). \n75. The only statement referenced in the Amended Complaint that alleges \nthe time, place, content, and speaker of a communication is that “[o]n September 30, \n2022, [Plaintiff] was asked by Program Director Tony Laffoley about expanding [its] \ncapacity to deliver [the ExxonMobil Programs] in all three regions (Americas, APAC, \nand EMEA) for 2024.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 29.) \n76. However, this allegation  alone is insufficient because it fails to allege \nthat Laffoley made a misrepresentation of fact or promissory representation.  Rather, \nLaffoley’s statement, as described, is limited to an inquiry as to Plaintiff’s ability to \nprovide services in the future.  There are no specific allegations that Laffoley \npromised or otherwise represented that KFEE would engage Plaintiff’s services in \nthe future or that he knew at the time that he made the inquiry that KFEE intended \nnot to renew the MSA in 2024. \n77. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claims for fraud and \nfraudulent inducement is GRANTED. \n \nIV. Conversion \n78. “There are, in effect, two essential elements of a conversion claim: \nownership in the plaintiff and wrongful possession or conversion by the defendant.”  \nVariety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs., LLC, 365 N.C. 520, 523 \n(2012) ( cleaned up ).  “In cases where the defendant comes into possession of the \nplaintiff’s property lawfully, the plaintiff must show that it made a demand for the \nreturn of the property that was refused by the defendant. ”  Morris Int’l v. Packer, \n2021 NCBC LEXIS 99, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 2, 2021) (citing Hoch v. Young, \n63 N.C. App. 480, 483 (1983)). \n79. Plaintiff’s theory of conversion is —in a nutshell—that the materials it \ndesigned for the ExxonMobil Programs are its own property, which Defendants have \nwrongfully converted.  In support of this theory, the Amended Complaint alleges as \nfollows: \nKFEE manages access to [Plaintiff’s] work product, proprietary \nmaterials, and intellectual property (deemed “Contractor materials” in \nthe MSA) which in the case of the ExxonMobil program is stored on \nKFEE’s SharePoint server. \n. . . \nDefendants have permitted nearly 70 unauthorized individuals to have \nuncontrolled access to [Plaintiff’s] proprietary material[s] and \nintellectual property through KFEE’s SharePoint server despite \nrepeated requests by [Plaintiff] that access to that content be restricted \npursuant to Section 8 of the MSA. \n. . .  \nThe executive education program designed and developed by [Plaintiff] \nfor ExxonMobil contains [Plaintiff’s] proprietary material and \nintellectual property. \n \n. . . \nPlaintiff is the lawful owner of proprietary training and program \nmaterials that are and have been at all relevant times in the possession \nand control of KFEE. \nDefendants intended to and did wrongfully deprive Plaintiff of its \nproperty interest in these materials by allowing access to third parties \nwho have and are using the materials without legal or equitable \nauthority. \nDefendants’ wrongful acts are inconsistent with the property rights of \nPlaintiff. \nDefendant KFEE has refused to release Plaintiff’s proprietary materials \nto Plaintiff or to protect them from unauthorized access and have \nallowed third parties to continue to use the material [s] without \npermission. \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 64, 67, 71, 106–09.) \n80. In its briefs, Defendants’ sole argument for dismissal of the conversion \nclaim is that  to the extent the claim alleges conversion of Plaintiff’s  intellectual \nproperty, such property interests are intangible in nature and cannot be the subject \nof a conversion claim.1 \n81. “North Carolina does not recognize a claim for conversion of intangible \ninterests, and our courts have determined that this includ es” intellectual property \nrights.  BIOMILQ, Inc. v. Guiliano , 2024 NCBC LEXIS 58, at * 42 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nApr. 19, 2024) (cleaned up) ; see also Window World of N. Atlanta, Inc. v. Window \n \n1 At the 10 June hearing, Defendants’ counsel attempted to articulate additional grounds for \ndismissal of the conversion claim.  However, the Court will not consider arguments on a \nmotion that are raised for the first time at a hearing and were not briefed.   See Charles \nSchwab & Co. v. Marilley, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *16 n.4 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 20, 2024), \n(refusing to consider an argument that “was not briefed, and therefore inappropriately raised \nfor the first time in oral argument ), aff’d per curiam, 387 N.C. 185 (2025); see also BCR 7.2 \n(stating that “a party should . . . brief each issue and argument that the party desires the \nCourt to rule upon and that the party intends to raise at a hearing”). \n \nWorld, Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 111, at * 9–10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 22, 2018) \n(dismissing a conversion claim because neither “contract rights [nor] trademark \nrights . . . [are] tangible property upon which a claim for conversion may be based”). \n82. “On the other hand, electronically stored information may qualify as \npersonal property subject to a claim for conversion.”  SQL Sentry, LLC v. ApexSQL, \nLLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 107, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 20, 2017) (cleaned up) ; see \nalso HCW Ret. & Fin. Servs., LLC v. HCW Empl . Benefit Servs., LLC , 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 73, at *61 –62 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 14, 2015) (dismissing a claim for \nconversion of trademarks but holding that there is no “basis to conclude as a matter \nof law that depriving [plaintiff] of the customer and sales information by cutting off \nhis access to [electronic software] could not provide a basis for a conversion claim, \nwhen taking the same information printed into hard copy form would be sufficient”); \nAddison Whitney, LLC v. Cashion , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 51, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJune 9, 2017) (holding that “[t]he better view, and the weight of authority, treats \nelectronic documents as personal property subject to a claim for conversion”); A \nDistrib. Co. LLC v. Mood Prod. Grp. LLC, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 130, at *24 (N.C. Super \nCt. Sept. 26, 2024) ( holding that “[w]hile conversion claims do not generally extend \nto intangible property, the PDF [files] are ‘electronic documents’ that constitute \npersonal property subject to a claim for conversion”). \n83. Here, the allegations in the Amended Complaint can be properly read \nas asserting that at least some electronic documents  stored on KFEE’s servers —as \nopposed to purely intangible intellectual property interests —are the subject of \n \nPlaintiff’s conversion claim.  Thus, KFEE has failed to articulate a valid basis for \ndismissal of this claim. \n84. However, there is no basis to support a conversion  claim against the \nIndividual Defendants because there are no allegations that any of the Individual \nDefendants converted any of the electronic documents at issue.  See, e.g., Glob. Textile \nAll., Inc. v. TDI Worldwide, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 104, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. \n9, 2018) ( dismissing a claim for conversion against  an individual defendant where \n“the facts ple[d] do not support an allegation that [the individual defendant] was \ninvolved in the conversion”). \n85. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for conversion is \nDENIED as to KFEE but GRANTED as to the Individual Defendants. \nV. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets \n86. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants are liable for misappropriation \nof its trade secrets. \n87. North Carolina’s Trade Secrets Protection Act (“NCTSPA”) provides \nthat “[t]he owner of a trade secret shall have [a] remedy by civil action for \nmisappropriation of his trade secret.”  N.C.G.S. § 66-153. \n88. The NCTSPA defines a “trade secret” as: \n[B]usiness or technical information, including but not limited to a \nformula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, \ntechnique, or process that: \na. Derives independent actual or potential commercial value \nfrom not being generally known or readily ascertainable \nthrough independent development or reverse engineering \nby persons who can obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure or use; and \n \nb. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy. \nN.C.G.S. § 66-152(3). \n89. Furthermore, “misappropriation” is defined as the “acquisition, \ndisclosure, or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied authority or \nconsent, unless such trade secret was arrived at by independent development, reverse \nengineering, or was obtained f rom another person with a right to disclose the trade \nsecret.”  N.C.G.S. § 66-152(1). \n90. In the present case, the most basic problem with Plaintiff’s claim is that \nthe Amended Complaint fails to even come close to describing the alleged trade \nsecrets with the requisite degree of specificity. \n91. Our Supreme Court has recognized that “[t]o plead [a claim for] \nmisappropriation of trade secrets, a plaintiff must identify a trade secret with \nsufficient particularity so as to enable a defendant to delineate that which he is \naccused of misappropriating and a court to determine whether misappropriation has \nor is threatened to occur.”  Krawiec, 370 N.C. at 609 (cleaned up).  Moreover, “a \ncomplaint that makes general allegations in sweeping and conclusory statements, \nwithout specifically identifying the trade secrets allegedly misappropriated, is \ninsufficient to state a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.”  Id. at 610 (cleaned \nup). \n92. This Court has made clear that broad allegations regarding the misuse \nof a plaintiff’s “product information” are insufficient to state a claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets.  Aecom Tech. Corp. v. Keating, 2012 NCBC LEXIS \n \n9, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 6, 2012); see also Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc. v. Rogers, \n2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *68 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 3, 2011) (finding the purported \ntrade secret description as “proprietary formulas, methodologies, customer and \npricing data and other confidential information” to be too “sweeping and conclusory  \n. . . to identify the trade secrets the [defendants] [were] accused of misappropriating”). \n93. The Amended Complaint describes Plaintiff’s purported trade secrets as \nfollows: \nPlaintiff is the lawful owner of proprietary training and program \nmaterials that are and have been at all relevant times in the possession \nand control of KFEE. \nThese proprietary training and program materials contain trade secrets \ndeveloped and owned by Plaintiff at all relevant times.  Among \nPlaintiff’s trade secrets are the specific presentations and exercises \ndeveloped by Plaintiff and its personnel for use in providing services to \nExxonMobil through its contracts with KFEE, as specified in the annual \nSOWs, which include the curriculum designed and de veloped by \n[Plaintiff] for the ExxonMobil Business Leadership Program (BLP) and \nthe ExxonMobil Emerging Leaders[hip] Program (ELP). \nPlaintiff has taken repeated and affirmative steps to identify its trade \nsecrets in contracts with KFEE . . . . \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 113–15.) \n94. Plaintiff’s identification of its purported trade secret s provides little \nmore than what our Supreme Court in Krawiec found to be inadequate.  See Krawiec, \n370 N.C. at 611 (holding that “plaintiffs’ failure to . . . provide any detail about their \ndance productions render s their claim too general for this Court to determine . . . \nwhether there is a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, \nmethod, technique, or process at issue that derives independent actual or potential \n \ncommercial value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable through \nindependent development or reverse engineering”). \n95. Here, the Amended Complaint fails to provide any detail or description \nof the “specific presentations and exercises” at issue so as to enable this Court to \ndetermine whether the requirements of § 66-152(3) have been satisfied.   See, e.g., \nComput. Design & Integration, LLC v. Brown , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 216, at *35 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Dec. 10, 2018) ( concluding the description in plaintiff’s complaint of the \ntrade secret  was “broad, vague, and” insufficiently particular  when described as \n“proprietary and unique solutions, engineering drafts and plans, potential solutions \nand configurations , correspondence with potential customers, and information \ntechnology needs of each customer”).2 \n96. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for misappropriation \nof trade secrets is GRANTED. \nVI. Constructive Fraud \n97. Our Supreme Court has recognized that the elements of a constructive \nfraud claim largely overlap with the elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  \nSee Chisum v. Campagna, 376 N.C. 680, 706–07 (2021).  “[A] cause of action for \nconstructive fraud [requires] (1) a relationship of trust and confidence, (2) that the \ndefendant took advantage of that position of trust in order to benefit himself, and (3) \n \n2 Because Plaintiff’s failure to  identify its purported trade secrets with sufficient detail is \nalone sufficient to require dismissal of the misappropriation of trade secrets claim, the Court \nneed not address Defendants’ other argument that the Amended Complaint fails to \nspecifically allege that reasonable security measures were taken by Plaintif f to protect the \nsecrecy of these materials. \n \nthat plaintiff was, as a result, injured.”  White v. Consol. Planning Inc., 166 N.C. App. \n283, 294 (2004) (cleaned up).  “The primary difference between pleading a claim for \nconstructive fraud and one for breach of fiduciary duty is the constructive fraud \nrequirement that the defendant benefit himself.”  Id. \n98. “[I]t is axiomatic that ‘[f]or a breach of fiduciary duty to exist, there must \nfirst be a fiduciary relationship between the parties.’”  Truist Fin. Corp. v. Rocco, 2024 \nNCBC LEXIS 62, at *29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 25, 2024) (quoting Dalton v. Camp, 353 \nN.C. 647, 651 (2001)).  A fiduciary relationship is generally found to exist when “there \nhas been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is \nbound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing \nconfidence.”  Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A., 367 N.C. 363, 367 (2014) (cleaned up).  \n“North Carolina recognizes two types of fiduciary relationships: de jure, or those \nimposed by operation of law, and de facto, or those arising from the particular facts \nand circumstances constitut ing and surrounding the relationship.”  Hager v. \nSmithfield E. Health Holdings, LLC, 264 N.C. App. 350, 355 (2019) (cleaned up). \n99. Plaintiff concedes that it has not alleged a de jure fiduciary relationship.  \nInstead, Plaintiff asserts that Defendants owed Plaintiff  de facto  fiduciary duties \nbased on the parties’ long-term business relationship and Plaintiff’s act of entrusting \nKFEE with its proprietary and confidential information. \n100. This Court has previously stated the following with regard to the \ncircumstances that may give rise to de facto fiduciary duties: \nA de facto  fiduciary relationship exists where there is “confidence \nreposed on one side, and resulting domination and influence on the \n \nother.”  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 652 (quoting Abbitt v. Gregory, 201 N.C. 577, \n598 (1931)) (cleaned up).  “The standard for finding a de facto fiduciary \nrelationship is a demanding one: ‘Only when one party figuratively holds \nall the cards —all the financial power or technical information, for \nexample—have North Carolina courts found that the special \ncircumstance of a fiduciary relationship has a risen.’”  Lockerman v. S. \nRiver Elec. Membership Corp. , 250 N.C. App. 631, 636 (2016) (quoting \nS.N.R. Mgmt. Corp. v. D anube Partners 141, LLC , 189 N.C. App. 601, \n613 (2008)). \nPertinent to the present Motion, “[o]ur courts have been clear that \ngeneral contractual relationships do not typically rise to the level of \nfiduciary relationships.”  Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc. , 372 N.C. \n326, 340 (2019).  Notably, “[p]arties to a contract do not thereby become \neach other’s fiduciaries; they generally owe no special duty to one \nanother beyond the terms of the contract[.]”  Id. (quoting Branch \nBanking & Tr. Co. v. Thompson , 107 N.C. App. 53, 61 (1992)).  Even \nwhere one party is in th e “position as the holder of the purse strings,” \n“no [fiduciary] relationship arises absent the existence of dominion and \ncontrol by one party over another.”  Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C. , 196 \nN.C. App. 469, 474 (2009).  Thus, “[a]s a matter of law, there can be no \nfiduciary relationship between parties in equal bargaining positions \ndealing at arm’s length[.]”  French Broad Place, LLC v. Asheville Sav. \nBank, S.S.B. , 259 N.C. App. 769, 788 (2018) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted).  “In the eve nt that a party ‘fail[s] to allege \nany special circumstances that could establish a fiduciary relationship,’ \ndismissal of a claim which hinges upon the existence of such a \nrelationship would be appropriate.”  Azure Dolphin, LLC v. Barton, 371 \nN.C. 579, 599 (2018) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nLoray Master Tenant, LLC, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 1, at *31–32. \n101. Here, the Amended Complaint does not allege that KFEE exercised \ndomination or control over Plaintiff.  To the contrary, the Amended Complaint alleges \nthat Plaintiff was “instrumental” in KFEE obtaining contracts with ExxonMobil \nbecause of Plaintiff’s “ability to field local resources in Asia and Europe, as well as \ninforming many of the design elements of the core program.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.)   \nSuch an allegation demonstrates that Plaintiff was not powerless in its relationship \nwith KFEE.  See Crumley & Assocs., P.C. v. Charles Peed & Assocs., P.A. , 219 N.C. \n \nApp. 615, 621 (2012) (noting that contracting parties do not owe fiduciary duties to \neach other “even if they are mutually interdependent businesses”). \n102. Furthermore, this Court has recognized that the mere exchange of  \nconfidential and proprietary information pursuant to a contract does not—standing \nalone—create a fiduciary relationship.  See Volume Servs., Inc. v. Ovations Food \nServs., L.P., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 108, at *38–41 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 17, 2018) (finding \nno fiduciary duty where the plaintiff allegedly “placed trust and confiden ce in the \n[defendant], ‘through execution of certain agreements,’ . . . pursuant to which the \n[defendant] agreed to protect [p]laintiffs’ confidential business information”); see also \nHusqvarna Pro. Prods., Inc. v. Robin Autopilot Holdings, LLC , 2023 NCBC LEXIS \n155, at * 13–14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 28, 2023) ( concluding that an “agreement to \nmaintain the confidentiality of [plaintiff’s] trade secrets and other confidential \ninformation . . . does not give rise to a fiduciary duty ” where the complaint did not \nallege any “duties or damages separate and apart from those created by contract”). \n103. Ultimately, the Amended Complaint alleges that KFEE obtained \nPlaintiff’s confidential and proprietary information pursuant to the terms of the MSA \nand that KFEE subsequently breached its confidentiality obligations.  This is simply \nnot enough to demonstrate the existence of a fiduciary relationship.  See Crescent \nFoods, Inc. v. Evason Pharms, Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 76, at *20–21 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 5, 2016) ( holding that merely “trust[ing] [d]efendant to honor the terms of [an] \nagreement do[es] not transform its relationship into a fiduciary one”). \n \n104. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED as to Plaintiff’s \nclaim for constructive fraud. \nVII. UDTP \n105. “To prevail on a claim of unfair and deceptive trade practice [s][,] a \nplaintiff must show (1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, or an unfair method of \ncompetition, (2) in or affecting commerce, (3) which proximately caused actual injury \nto the plaintiff or to his business.”  Spartan Leasing Inc. v. Pollard, 101 N.C. App. \n450, 460 (1991) (cleaned up). \n106. Our Court of Appeals has recognized that “a defendant’s mere act of \ntortious conversion can satisfy the elements of a Chapter 75 claim.”  Faucette v. 6303 \nCarmel Rd., LLC, 242 N.C. App. 267, 276 (2015) (cleaned up).  Accordingly, because \nthe Court has concluded that Plaintiff sufficiently stated a claim for conversion \nagainst KFEE, Plaintiff can proceed with its UDTP claim against it.  See, e.g., Miller \nv. Redgoose, L.L.C., 2024 NCBC LEXIS 148, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 26, 2024) \n(noting that “the continuing viability of” a claim for conversion “automatically serves \nas a predicate for a UDTP claim to proceed”). \n107. As a result, the Court need not decide at the present time whether any \nof Plaintiff’s other allegations are independently sufficient to support its UDTP claim \nagainst KFEE. \n108. Because the Court has dismissed all of Plaintiff’ s claims (including the \nconversion claim) as to the Individual Defendants, there are no predicate claims that \ncould serve as a basis for the UDTP claim to survive against them. \n \n109. Moreover, based on its careful review of the Amended Complaint, the \nCourt concludes that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege acts by the Individual \nDefendants sufficient to support a claim for UDTP. \n110. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for UDTP is DENIED \nas to KFEE but GRANTED as to the Individual Defendants. \nVIII. Civil Conspiracy \n111. In order to state a claim for civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege: “(1) \nan agreement between two or more individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a \nlawful act in an unlawful way; (3) resulting in injury to plaintiff inflicted by one or \nmore of the conspirators; and (4) pursuant to a common scheme.”  Piraino Bros., LLC \nv. Atl. Fin. Grp., Inc., 211 N.C. App. 343, 350 (2011) (cleaned up). \n112. Notably, “[c]ivil conspiracy is not an independent cause of action in \nNorth Carolina.  Rather, liability for civil conspiracy must be alleged in conjunction \nwith an underlying claim for unlawful conduct. ”  McCarron v. Howell , 2024 NCBC \nLEXIS 144, at * 17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 19, 2024) (cleaned up) ; see also Toomer v. \nGarrett, 155 N.C. App. 462, 483 (2002)  (holding that “[o]nly  where there is an \nunderlying claim for unlawful conduct can a plaintiff state a claim for civil conspiracy \nby also alleging the agreement of two or more parties to carry out the conduct and \ninjury resulting from that agreement”). \n113. Plaintiff’s conspiracy claim fails for at least two reasons. \n114. First, a t the 10 June hearing, Plaintiff’s counsel argued that the \nunderlying causes of action for unlawful conduct serving as the predicate for its civil \n \nconspiracy claim are the claims for tortious interference with contractual relations \nand misappropriation of trade secrets.  However, because the Court has now \ndismissed both of those claims,  Plaintiff’s claim for civil conspiracy fails  on that \nground alone.  See, e.g., S. Fastening Sys., Inc. v. Grabber Constr. Prods., Inc., 2015 \nNCBC LEXIS 42, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 28, 2015) (noting that “[i]f the \nunderlying [claims] supporting a claim for conspiracy are dismissed, so too must the \nclaim for conspiracy be dismissed”). \n115. Second, dismissal of this claim is also proper because the Amended \nComplaint fails to allege either an actual agreement to commit an unlawful act or the \nidentity of the purported conspirators with any degree of specificity.   See Bottom v. \nBailey, 238 N.C. App. 202, 213 (2014) (affirming dismissal where “[t]he claim \nsuggest[ed] that defendants . . . conspired, but fail[ed] to allege how th[e] conspiracy \ncame to be, or when, or where, or why”); Trail Creek Invs. LLC v. Warren Oil Holding \nCo., 2023 NCBC LEXIS 70, at *45 –46 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 9, 2023) ( dismissing a \ncivil conspiracy claim because it was “unclear as to which of the [d]efendants [were] \nactually being alleged to have engaged in such a conspiracy” and where the pleading \nmade no “attempt to differentiate between the numerous individuals and entities who \nare named as [d]efendants”). \n116. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for civil \nconspiracy is GRANTED. \n \nIX. Dismissals With or Without Prejudice \n117. Finally, Plaintiff requests that if the Court concludes that dismissal of  \nany of its claims is proper, the dismissal be without prejudice in order to allow it to \namend those claims.  The Court declines to do so. \n118. “The decision to dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the \ndiscretion of the trial court[.]”  First Fed. Bank v. Al dridge, 230 N.C. App. 187, 191 \n(2013) (cleaned up).   When dismissing claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), “ the party \nwhose claim is being dismissed has the burden to convince the court that the party \ndeserves [another] chance[.]”  Id. at 192 (cleaned up). \n119. Each of Defendants’ present arguments made in support of their Motion \nto Dismiss the claims for breach of contract, tortious interference with contractual \nrelations, fraud and fraudulent inducement, and UDTP are essentially identical to \nthe arguments made by them in support of the ir original motion to dismiss.  Yet \ndespite Plaintiff having effectively been given a roadmap of the deficiencies in these \nclaims, a line-by-line comparison of the allegations in the original Complaint with the \nallegations in the Amended Complaint reveals that Plaintiff took virtually no action \nto address the defec ts identified by Defendants in their original motion to dismiss  \nthese same claims. \n120. Plaintiff has now had two bites at the apple to plead sufficient facts to \nsupport its various claims arising from these events and has failed to convince the \nCourt that it should be given a third.  See Lafayette Vill. Pub, LLC v. Burnham, 2025 \nNCBC LEXIS 23, at * 23 n.9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 4, 2025) ( dismissing claims with \n \nprejudice when the plaintiffs had “filed two legally deficient fiduciary duty claims ” \nbecause “it would be [in]appropriate to give them a third bite at the apple”); Plasman \nv. Decca Furniture (USA), Inc. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS  80, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. \n21, 2016), (dismissing claims with prejudice after the plaintiff had been “afforded . . . \nthe opportunity to re -plead his claims ” and where the complaint’s pleading \ndeficiencies had already been “specifically identified”). \n121. For these reasons, the Court concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, \nthat the claims dismissed herein should be dismissed with prejudice. \nCONCLUSION \n THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED as follows: \n1. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is  DENIED as to Plaintiff’s claim \nagainst KFEE alleging a breach of contract as to Sections 8 and 9 of the \nMSA, Plaintiff’s claim  against KFEE for conversion , and Plaintiff’s \nclaim against KFEE for UDTP. \n2. In all other respects, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED with \nprejudice. \nSO ORDERED, this the 2nd day of July 2025. \n \n \n \n/s/ Mark A. Davis     \nMark A.
