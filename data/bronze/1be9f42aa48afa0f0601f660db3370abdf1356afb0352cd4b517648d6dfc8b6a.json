Nature’s Pearl Corp., 2018 NCBC 83. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nDAVIE COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n16 CVS 217 \n \nKERRY BODENHAMER FARMS, \nLLC, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nNATURE’S PEARL CORPORATION; \nJERRY SMITH; and LE BLEU \nCORPORATION, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON MOTIONS \nFOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n \n \n1. Over the last  ten years , Plaintif f Kerry Bodenhamer Farms, LLC (“ KB \nFarms”) has sold hundreds of tons of muscadine grapes to Defendant Nature’s Pearl \nCorporation.  This dispute concerns a single shipment of grapes during  the 2014 \nharvest.  KB Farms  contends that Nature’s Pearl improperly refused to pay for the \ngrapes.  Nature’s Pearl says they were fermented and thus unusable.  Each accuses \nthe other of breaching the governing contract (with KB Farms asserting that Nature’s \nPearl’s owner, Jerry Smith, and an affiliate, Le Bleu Corporation, should also be \nliable for Nature’s Pearl’s alleged breach). \n2. The parties’ motions for summary judgment are pending.  For the following \nreasons, the Cour t GRANTS Defendants’ motion and GRANTS in part  and \nDENIES in part Plaintiff’s motion.   \nWyche, P.A., by Wade S. Kolb III, Matthew T.

Gray Wilson and Lorin \nJ. Lapidus, for Defendants Nature’s Pearl Corporation, Jerry Smith, and \nLe Bleu Corporation.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact in ruling on motions for summary \njudgment.  The following background, describing the evidence and noting relevant \ndisputes, is therefore intended only to provide context  for the Court’ s analysis and \nruling.   \n4. Nature’s Pearl sells juices , nutritional supplements, and similar products  \nmade from muscadine grapes.  (Compl. ¶ 7, ECF No. 1; Answer ¶ 7, ECF No. 3.)  KB \nFarms is one of its grape suppliers.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 12–14; Answer ¶¶ 12–14.)  From \n2008 through 2011, the two companies did business subject to yearly oral agreements \nin which Nature’s Pearl purchased  KB Farms’ grape harvests, paying a fixed price \nper ton.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 12–14; Answer ¶¶ 12–14; Countercl. ¶ 6.) \n5. In January 2012, Nature’s Pearl and KB Farms executed a written contract \n(“Agreement”).  Nature’s Pearl obtained “the sole and exclusive right to purchase all \nof [KB Farms’] muscadine grapes (‘ whole grapes’) on an annual  basis” for 20 years.  \n(Compl. Ex. A [“Agreement”] ¶¶ 1, 8.)  In return, it agreed to pay $700 per ton for the \n2012 harvest, with future years’ prices to be determined by “market conditions.”  \n(Agreement ¶  2.)  The Agreement was signed by each company’s owner and \nprincipal—Jerry Smith for Nature’s Pearl, and Kerry Bodenhamer  for KB Farms.  \n(See Agreement p.5.)   \n \n6. Grapes are, of course, perishable.  The Agreement required KB Farms to \nship all grapes “in refrigerated trucks” on “the same day that they [were] harvested.”  \n(Agreement ¶ 5.)  So long as the grapes were of “good qual ity,” Nature’s Pearl was \nrequired to purchase them , though it  reserved the right to “make the sole \ndetermination as to the quality of the product at the time of processing the whole \ngrapes” and also “the right to reject any whole grapes” it determined “to be unusable.”  \n(Agreement ¶ 4.)  \nSpecifically, [Nature’s Pearl]  will reject all whole grapes that it \ndetermines to be spoiled, rotten, molded, fermented or do not meet a \nminimum of 15 bri[ x] sugar content at the time of processing.  If \n[Nature’s Pearl] rejects any whole grapes pursuant to the terms and \nconditions of this Agreement, it will immediately notify [KB Farms], and \n[KB Farms] shall have the right to come to [Nature’s Pearl’s] place of \nbusiness to inspect the rejected whole grapes, pay to ship the r ejected \nwhole grapes back to its facility or authorize [Nature’s Pearl] to dispose \nof the whole grapes.     \n(Agreement ¶ 4.)  (The term “brix” is a metric for sugar content.)  The Agreement also \nallowed Nature’s Pearl to terminate the contract upon determining that KB Farms \n“failed to supply whole grapes of suitable quality.”  (Agreement ¶ 11.) \n7. The 2012 and 2013 harvests passed without incident.  ( See Compl. ¶  26; \nAnswer ¶ 26.)  Not so for  the 2014 harvest .  Nature’s Pearl alleges that  KB Farms \ndelivered a load of fermented , unusable grapes in September 2014.  (See Countercl. \n¶¶ 13–14.)  KB Farms denies the allegation, calling it a pretext for Defendants’ later \nefforts to renegotiate the terms of their bargain, and also claims that Nature’s Pearl \nimproperly refused to pay for the shipment.  (See Pl.’s Reply to Countercl. ¶¶ 10–11, \nECF No. 7; see generally Compl. ¶¶ 32–52.) \n \n8. Some facts are undisputed.  KB Farms picked t he grapes at issue  on \nSeptember 6 and shipped them on September 8.  (See Dep. K. Bodenhamer 116:3–8, \nECF No. 74.5 .)  Nature’s Pearl inspected the grapes, did not reject the m, and then \npressed them into juice on the day of delivery.  (See Dep. A. Smith 41:6–8, 68:10–17, \n71:9–10;1 Aff. A. Smith ¶ 4, ECF No. 74.2.)  Just over a month later, Jerry Smith sent \nKB Farms a letter refusing to pay for the shipment on the ground that the  grapes \n“were approximately 18 brix and tested 0.70 alcohol.”  (Compl. Ex. B.)   \n9. According to Nature’s Pearl, the g rapes were fermented at the time of \ndelivery.  Achan Smith, Jerry’s son and the supervisor in charge of processing grapes \nat Nature’ s Pearl,  testified that the grapes’ “general appearance and odor”  upon \ndelivery suggested that “something was amiss.”  (Aff. A. Smith. ¶¶ 1, 5.)  The grapes \n“had a different smell than all the rest,” an “alcohol smell.”  (Dep. A. Smith 40:3 –6; \nsee also Dep. A. Smith 64:14–18, 85:14–22.)  Achan Smith further testified that Kerry \nBodenhamer admitted the shipment contained grapes that “seem[ed] to ripen quicker \nthan the others.”  (Dep. A Smith 39:6 –11; see also Dep. D. Boden hamer 62:15–25, \nECF No. 74.8.) \n10. Nature’s Pearl asserts that it was unable to confirm that the grapes were \nfermented until it  pressed them and pasteurized the juice .  At that point , Achan \nSmith smelled “alcohol” again.  (Dep. A. Smith 64:14–18.)  He states that he tried to \nsalvage the juice by blending it with “good” juice from a different shipment but was \nunable to reduce the alcohol content below the legal  threshold for non -alcoholic \n                                            \n1 Excerpts of Achan Smith’s deposition testimony appear in exhibits located at ECF Nos. 69.1, \n74.11, and 76.7. \n \nbeverages.  (Dep. A. Smith 64:11–68:3; see also Aff. S. Mitchell ¶ 2, ECF No. 74.4; Aff. \nR. Fouts ¶ 3, ECF No. 74.3.) \n11. KB Farms sees things differently.  It points to evidence that the grapes were \nnot fermented at the time of de livery.  Kerry Bodenhamer recalls, for example, that \nAchan Smith characterized the grapes as “rough” but said nothing about \nfermentation or an alcohol smell.  (Dep. K. Bodenhamer 140:15–19.)  KB Farms also \ninsists that the time for inspection and rejection  under the Agreement was upon \ndelivery, not after the grapes were processed.   When Bodenhamer  asked whether \nNature’s Pearl would reject the shipment, the answer from Achan Smith was no.  (See \nDep. A. Smith 68:10 –17, 71:9–10; Dep. D. Bodenhamer 62: 4–7.)  According to KB \nFarms, Nature’s Pearl was not free to change its mind, particularly after processing \nthe grapes and blending their juice with juice from another shipment ( which, it \nsuggests, came from another vineyard).  (See Dep. K. Bodenhamer 139:10–140:4; Br. \nin Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. Summary J. 4 [“Pl.’s Br. in Supp.”], ECF No. 68.) \n12. Nearly a  year of uncertainty  ensued.  Nature’s Pearl threatened  to \nterminate the Agreement, prompting unsuccessful negotiations to amend its terms.  \n(See Compl. Exs. C–P.)  By June 2015, the parties’ relationship reached the breaking \npoint.  Jerry Smith gave written notice of termination “for [KB Farms’] failure to \nprovide suitable grapes for processing.”  (Compl. Ex. H.)   KB Farms refused to \nrecognize the termination, stating its intent to deliver the 2015 harvest , which \nNature’s Pearl turned away.  (See Compl. ¶ 48, Ex. N.)  In October 2015, Smith sent \nKB Farms “a check for the bad grapes” from the bank account of Le Bleu Corporation, \n \nanother company owned by Smith .  (Compl. Ex. M.)  KB Farms rejected the check.  \n(Compl. Ex. O; Dep. J. Smith 105:8–12.2)   \n13. KB Farms filed this action in May 2016, asserting claims against Nature’s \nPearl for breach of contract, tortious breach of contract, breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair or deceptive trade practices.  KB \nFarms also asserted those claims , along with an addit ional claim for tortious \ninterference with contract, against Jerry Smith and Le Bleu.  KB Farms alleged that \nSmith and Le Bleu should be liable for Nature’s Pearl’s debts in part because of their \nparticipation in the alleged breach, including Smith’s use of Le Bleu to pay for grapes \npurchased by Nature’s Pearl.   In response, Nature’s Pearl filed counterclaims for \nbreach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and \nbreach of the implied warranties of  merchantability and  fitness for a particular \npurpose. \n14. Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings on some but not all of KB \nFarms’ claims.   The Court granted the motion in part, dismissing the claims for \ntortious breach, unfair trade practices, and tortious interference.  Kerry Bodenhamer \nFarms, LLC v. Nature’s Pearl Corp , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMarch 27, 2017).  The Court also concluded that Jerry Smith and Le Bleu were not \nparties to the Agreement and therefore could not have breached  it or the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The Court allowed the claims against Smith \nand Le Bleu to proceed to the extent they “rested on a theory of veil piercing,” though \n                                            \n2 Excerpts of Jerry Smith’s deposition testimony appear in exhibits located at ECF Nos. 74.7, \n76.6, and 79.2. \n \nnoting that, “[i]n the event discovery demonstrates that KB Farms’ veil -piercing \ntheory lacks substance, Smith and Le Bleu remain [ed] free to challenge it on \nsummary judgment.”  Id. at *15. \n15. Discovery is now complete, and each side has moved for summary judgment.  \n(ECF Nos. 67, 70.)  The motions have been fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing \non May 24, 2018, at which all parties were represented by counsel.   \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n16. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In deciding a motion for summary \njudgment, the Court views the evidence “in the light most favorable to  the \nnonmov[ant],” taking the non -movant’s evidence as true and drawing inferences in \nits favor.  Furr v. K-Mart Corp., 142 N.C. App. 325, 327, 543 S.E.2d 166, 168 (2001). \n17. The moving party “bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of \na genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, \n579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002).  If the moving party carries this burden, the \nresponding party “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading,” \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e), but must instead “come forward with specific facts establishing \nthe presence of a genuine factual dispute for trial,” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 356 N.C. at \n579, 573 S.E.2d at 124.  A “genuine issue” exists when “‘it is supported by substantial \nevidence,’ which is that amount of relevant evidence necessary to persuade a \n \nreasonable mind to accept a conclusion.”  Id. at 579, 573 S.E.2d at 124 (quoting DeWitt \nv. Eveready Battery Co. , 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002)) (internal \ncitation omitted). \nIII. \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION \n \n18. Defendants’ motion for summary judgment comes in two parts.  Jerry Smith \nand Le Bleu seek summary judgment on all remaining claims against them.  They \nargue that discovery has confirmed their earlier contentions: that there is no basis to \npierce the corporate veil and hold them liable for  Nature’s Pearl’s alleged breach of \ncontract.  (See Br. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. for Summary J. 6–8 [“Defs.’ Op. Br.”], ECF \nNo. 71.)  Nature’s Pearl, by contrast, seeks only partial summary judgment, arguing \nthat the law does not recognize an independent cause of action  for breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing .  (See Defs.’ Op. Br. 4–6.)  The Court \nbegins with Smith and Le Bleu. \nA. Piercing the Corporate Veil \n19. As the Court explained in its previous Order and Opinion, “[d]isregarding \nthe corporate form is not to be done lightly .”  Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 145, \n749 S.E.2d 262, 270 (2013) .  It is a “drastic remedy,” reserved only for “an extreme \ncase where necessary to serve the ends of justice .”  Dorton v. Dorton , 77 N.C. App. \n667, 672, 336 S.E.2d 415, 419 (1985). \n20. The test for piercing the corporate veil is often referred to as  the \ninstrumentality rule.  Tha t is, a person or entity “exercis[ing] actual control over \nanother, operating the latter as a mere instrumentality or tool, is liable for the torts \n \nof the corporation thus controlled.”  Glenn v. Wagner, 313 N.C. 450, 454, 329 S.E.2d \n326, 330 (1985).  The plaintiff must show “domination and control of the corporate \nentity,” “the use of that domination and control to perpetrate a fraud or wrong,” and \n“the proximate causation of the wrong complained of by the domination and control.”  \nAtl. Tobacco Co. v. Honeycutt, 101 N.C. App. 160, 164, 398 S.E.2d 641, 643 (1990).   \n21. The second element is dispositive here .  Even assuming KB Farms has \nprovided sufficient evidence that Smith or Le Bleu  controlled Nature’s Pearl, it has \nneither alleged nor shown the use of that control to perpetrate a fraud or wrong.  KB \nFarms’ only theory is that Smith and Le Bleu “interjected themselves into the \ncontractual relationship between Nature’s Pearl and KB Farms” and “depriv[ed] KB \nFarms of the benefits of the Agreement for which it bargained.”  (Br. in Opp’n to Defs.’ \nMot. for Summary J. 11–12 [“Pl.’s Opp’n”], ECF No. 75.)  This is not enough. \n22. Our Court of Appeals  has rejected the argument that a breach of contract, \n“in itself, can amount to a wrongdoing to meet the second element of the \n[instrumentality] test.”  Best Cartage, Inc. v. Stonewall Packaging, LLC , 219 N.C. \nApp. 429, 440, 727 S.E.2d 291, 300 (2012).  This rule derives from one of the essential \ndifferences between contract and tort actions:  contracts are voluntary, consensual \narrangements, and torts are not.   The party seeking relief in a contract case has \nchosen its business partner (e.g., a subsidiary instead of a parent) and agreed to the \nterms of the arrangement  (including allocating risk).  If the party wishes t o be able \nto hold a parent corporation  or other controlling person  liable for another entity’s \nbreach, it can negotiate for additional security as part of the deal, through  a \n \nguarantee, for example .  When it forgoes these protections , the risk of loss may be \ngreater, but that alone is not a sufficient reason to disturb the parties’ bargain  by \npermitting a greater recovery through equity than the contract itself permits .  For \nthese reasons, “courts usually apply more stringent standards to piercing the \ncorporate veil in contract case s than they do in tort cases .”  1 William M. Fletcher, \nFletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations § 41.85; see also, e.g., Cascade \nEnergy & Metals Corp. v. Banks, 896 F.2d 1557, 1577 (10th Cir. 1990). \n23. Thus, our courts have pierced the veil in a case for breach of contract only \nwhere the evidence revealed other compelling factors apart from the breach itself.   \nThere must be some  indicia of fraudulent or inequitable conduct : a showing, for \nexample, that the puppet entity was created  for the purpose of entering into the \nrelevant contract or used as a means to unjustly insulate another from liability.  See \nBest Cartage, 219 N.C. App. at 440, 727 S.E.2d at 300–01; see also S. Shores Realty \nServs. v. Miller, 796 S.E.2d 340, 352–54 (N.C. Ct. App. 2017) (concluding plaintiff met \nsecond element where individual defendant created 30 or 40 LLCs  to manage  \nindividual rental propert ies and intentionally “disregard[ed] the contractual \nobligation to return . . . rental deposits”); E. Mkt. St. Square, Inc. v. Tycorp Pizza IV, \nInc., 175 N.C. App. 628,  637, 625 S.E.2d 191 , 199 (2006) (concluding plaintiff met \nsecond element where individual defendant created a shell corporation to shield \nhimself from liability under contract  at issue ); Insight Health Corp. v. Marquis \nDiagnostic Imaging of N.C., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 56, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. June \n5, 2018) (individual manager defendants caused LLC to cease operations and then \n \ntransferred cash and assets to themselves or other entities they c ontrolled rather \nthan pro rata to creditors as required by statute). \n24. KB Farms cites no contrary, controlling precedent.  (See Pl.’s Opp’n 10–11.)  \nThe only case it cites is a nonbinding decision by a federal district court, decided \nnearly twenty years before Best Cartage.  See Dassault Falcon Jet Corp. v. Oberflex, \nInc., 909 F. Supp. 345, 350 (M.D.N.C. 1995).  But even Dassault requires more than \nan ordinary breach of contract.  The alleged conduct must “show an ulterior purpose \nto benefit the person in control in a way not possible or legal without misuse of the \ncontrolled corporation.”  Id. (emphasis added).  That standard was met in Dassault \nin part because, after the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant arose, the \nplaintiff sold all its puppet’s assets, leaving only a shell corporation.  See id. at 351. \n25. There are no similar allegations or evidence here .  KB Farms has neither \nalleged nor shown that Nature’s Pearl was created for the purpose of entering into \nthe Agreement.  To the contrary, the complaint acknowledges that Nature’s Pearl and \nLe Bleu  are both  bona fide , ongoing businesses with substantial operations and \nproducts.  ( See Compl. ¶  7.)  KB Farms argues that Le Bleu had an informal \narrangement to purchase Nature’s Pearl’s grapes at cost, thereby depriving Nature’s \nPearl of profits, but the evidence it points to shows that profits increased from 2011 \nto 2016.  ( See Dep. J. Smith 170:13 –15.)  The evidence, even viewed in a light \nfavorable to KB Farms, does not show  that Smith or Le Bleu authorized fraudulent \ntransactions to deplete Nature’s Pearl’s assets.  Absent some indicia of fraudulent or \ninequitable conduct, th e mere allegation of a breach of contract is not a basis to  \n \ndisturb the allocation of risk negotiated by the parties by disregarding the corporate \nform.  Summary judgment is appropriate. \n26. In its opposition brief, KB Farms insists that Le Bleu should be liable for \nany breach on two theories unrelated to veil piercing (that Le Bleu assumed Nature’s \nPearl’s contractual obligations or that Le Blue is a third-party beneficiary).  (See Pl.’s \nOpp’n 13–14.)  Neither is properly before the Court.  In its previous Order & Opinion, \nthe Court permitted the claims against Le Bleu to proceed  only “to the extent” they \n“rest on a theory of veil piercing.”  Kerry Bodenhamer Farms, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 27, \nat *15.  Furthermore, as Defendants correctly observe, KB Farms did not plead these \ntheories in its complaint, and a motion for summary judgment is not an appropriate \nvehicle to introduce them.   \n27. For these reasons, the Court grants Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment as to the claims asserted against Jerry Smith and Le Ble u for breach of \ncontract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  No claims \nagainst Smith and Le Bleu remain, and they are dismissed from this action. \nB. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \n28. Nature’s Pearl moves for summary judgment only as to the claim for breach \nof the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The argument is a narrow, \nlegal one: Nature’s Pearl contends that there is no independent cause of action for \nbreach of the implied covenant.   \n29. This dispute is not over whether the Agreement between KB Farms and \nNature’s Pearl carries an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  It clearly \n \ndoes.  The Agreement is a “transaction[] in goods” subject to Article 2 of the Uniform \nCommercial Cod e (“UCC”).  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  25-2-102; see also id.  § 25-2-105(1) \n(definition of “Goods” includes “growing crops”).  And “[e]very contract” governed by \nArticle 2 “imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.”  \nId. § 25-1-304; see also Westpoint Stevens, Inc. v. Panda-Rosemary Corp., 1999 NCBC \nLEXIS 11, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 16, 1999).   \n30. The question is whether section 25-1-304, by imposing a duty to act in good \nfaith, also gives rise to an independent cause of action for its breach.  Although North \nCarolina court s have not addressed this question , courts in many other States, \ninterpreting identical UCC provisions, have done so .  “[T]he vast majority of courts \nhaving considered the issue conclude that breach of the obligati on of good faith \nimposed by force of the U.C.C.  does not give rise to an independent cause of action .”  \nDoyle v. Fleetwood Homes of Va., Inc. , 650 F. Supp. 2d 535, 540 (S.D. W. Va. 2009) \n(collecting cases; applying West Virginia’s UCC). \n31. The reasons are twofold.  First, the UCC’s Official Comment expressly states \nthat the obligation of good faith “does not support an independent cause of action of \nfailure to perform or enforce in good faith.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-1-304 cmt. 1.  Rather, \n“a failure to perform or enforce, in good faith, a specific duty or obligation under the \ncontract, constitutes a breach of that contract  or makes unavailable, under the \nparticular circumstances, a remedial right or power.”  Id.  This language is clear and \ndirect: a breach of the implied covenant does not give rise to a separate cause of action \nunder the UCC, but it may support an action for breach of contract.  See, e.g., Pain \n \nCenter of SE Ind. LLC v. Origin Healthcare Sol utions LLC, 893 F.3d 454, 462 (7th \nCir. 2018) (applying Indiana’s UCC); Smith v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 2017 \nU.S. App. LEXIS 21101, at *2 –3 (5th Cir. Oct. 25, 2017) (applying Texas’s UCC) ; \nDoyle, 650 F. Supp. 2d at 539. \n32. Second, the UCC’s “covenant of good fait h and fair dealing is not an \nindependent source of duties for the parties to a contract .”  Baxter Healthcare Corp. \nv. O.R. Concepts, Inc., 69 F.3d 785, 792 (7th Cir. 1995) (applying Illinois’s UCC).  The \n“obligation to perform or enforce in good faith extends only to the rights and duties \nresulting from” the contract itself.  Doyle, 650 F. Supp. 2d at 541 (citation omitted).   \nPut another way, the covenant of good faith “is not an unde rtaking that can be \nbreached apart from those terms.”  Autry Petroleum Co. v. BP Prods. N. Am., Inc. , \n2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 13978, at *6 (11th Cir. June 6, 2009) (applying Georgia’s UCC). \n33. The Court sees no reason to depart from this widely accepted rule.   In \nconstruing other UCC provisions, our appellate courts have held that the statut ory \ntext “should be read in conjunction with the Official Comments.”  S. Utils., Inc. v. \nJerry Mandel Mach. Corp., 71 N.C. App. 188, 190, 321 S.E.2d 508, 509 (1984).  They \n“are by far the most useful aids to interpretation and construction,” id. at 190, 321 \nS.E.2d at 510, and deserve “substantial weight.”  Rentenbach Constructors, Inc. v. CM \nP’ship, 181 N.C. App. 268,  271, 639 S.E.2d 16 , 18 –19 (2007) (quoting Parsons v. \nJefferson-Pilot Corp., 333 N.C. 420, 425, 426 S.E.2d 685, 689 (1993)) .  Furthermore, \nthe General Assembly directed our courts to construe the code with an eye toward \n \n“mak[ing] uniform the law among the various jurisdictions.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. 25 -1-\n103(a)(3).   \n34. Accordingly, the Court holds that section 25 -1-304 does not create  an \nindependent cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing.  Nature’s Pearl is entitled to summary judgment.  It bears noting that the \nclaim for breach of contract, which Nature’s Pearl has not challenged, will proceed to \ntrial.  KB Farms may rely on the obligation of good faith imposed by the UCC  in \nseeking to prove its claim for breach of contract at trial. \nIV. \nPLAINTIFF’S MOTION \n \n35. All of Nature’s Pearl’s counterclaims rest on the essential allegation that the \ngrapes delivered by KB Farms on September 8, 2014 were fermented.  (See Countercl. \n¶ 18; see also Countercl. ¶¶  17–19, 26 –30, 33 –35.)  These grapes, Nature’s Pearl \ncontends, did not conform to  the Agreement.  ( See Agreement ¶¶ 4, 5.)  It further \nalleges that fermented grapes are not suitable for juice and nutraceutical products, \nthereby breaching the implied warrant ies of merchantability and fitness for a \nparticular purpose.  (See Countercl. ¶¶ 27–28, 34.)   \n36. KB Farms argues that the undisputed facts require summary judgment.  It \ncontends that the express terms of the Agreement provide the exclusive means for \nNature’s Pearl to accept or reject whole grapes, thereby disclaiming the right to \nrevoke acceptance and any implied warranties.  The evidence, it contends, shows that \nNature’s Pearl accepted the grapes, processed them, and blended their juice with juice \nfrom another shipment.  (See Pl.’s Br. in Supp. 2.)  Because Nature’s Pearl inspected \n \nand accepted the grapes, KB Farms argues, it is beside the point whether they were \nfermented at the time of delivery.  (See Pl.’s Br. in Supp. 3, 6.) \n37. This dispute raises two issues.  The first is whether Nature’s Pearl was \nentitled to revoke its acceptance of the grapes under the UCC.  The second is whether \nthe parties’ Agreement disclaims the implied warranties of merchantability and \nfitness for a particular purpose. \nA. Revocation of Acceptance \n38. In any transaction for goods,  the expectation is that the seller wil l deliver, \nand the buyer will accept, goods that conform to the contract.  It doesn’t always work \nout that way.  Under the UCC, the onus is on the buyer to make an initial inspection.  \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. §  25-2-606.  If the goods conform to the contract, the buyer is \nobliged to accept and pay for them .  See id. § 25-2-301.  If the goods fail to conform, \nthe buyer may choose to accept or reject them (or accept part and reject the rest).  See \nid. § 25-2-601.  That choice—acceptance or rejection—triggers other rights and duties \nfor both buyer and seller.  See, e.g., id. §§ 603, 604. \n39. Acceptance is not necessarily final.  “The buyer may revoke his acceptance” \nin limited circumstances, including where acceptance was made  “without discovery \nof [the] nonconformity” and also  “reasonably induced either by the difficulty of \ndiscovery before acceptance or by the seller’s assurances.”  Id. § 25-2-608(1)(b); accord \nRoy Burt Enters., Inc. v. Marsh , 328 N.C. 262, 264, 400 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1990).  \nRevocation “must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should \n \nhave discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in the condition \nof the goods which is not caused by their own defects.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-2-608(2).   \n40. It is undisputed tha t Nature’s Pearl accepted the grapes delivered by KB \nFarms on September 8, 2014 .  (See Dep. A. Smith 71:14 –16; Dep. J. Smith 104:21 –\n105:1; Defs.’ Br. in Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. for Summary J. 13 [“Defs.’ Opp’n”], ECF No. \n74; Pl.’s Reply Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Summary J. 1 [“Pl.’s Reply Br.”], ECF No. 78.)  \nNature’s Pearl  contends that it  timely and properly revoked its acceptance  after \ntesting the grapes’ fermentation level.  (See Defs.’ Opp’n 13.)  KB Farms, by contrast, \ncontends that Nature’s Pearl’s refusal to pay for the grapes was an untimely rejection. \n41. The threshold question is whether Nature’s Pearl bargained away its \nrevocation rights.  With few exceptions, the UCC permits parties the freedom to vary \nits provisions “by agreement.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  25-1-302(a).  This includes the \nprovisions governing acceptance, rejection, and revocation.  See, e.g. , Business \nCommc’ns, Inc. v. Ki Networks, Inc. , 157 N.C. App. 710, 712 –13, 580 S.E.2d 77, 78 –\n79 (2003). \n42. KB Farms points to p aragraph 4 of the Agreement , which states, in part, \nthat Nature’s Pearl “shall make the sole determination as to the quality of the product \nat the time  of processing the whole grapes ” and “shall have the right to reject any \nwhole grapes” that it determines to be unusable.  (Agreement ¶  4.)  KB Farms \ninterprets this language—particularly the repeated references to “whole grapes”—to \neliminate Nature’s Pearl’s “right to revoke acceptance”  after processing the grapes.   \n(Pl.’s Reply Br. 3–4.)  KB Farms also contends that allowing Nature’s Pearl to revoke \n \nacceptance after delivery would render superfluous the need for it to reject fermented \ngrapes upon delivery.  (See Pl.’s Reply Br. 3–5.)   \n43. The Court disagrees.  To the extent paragraph 4 modifies the UCC’s default \nrules, it does so only with respect to the  rules for rejecting grapes.  Absent from \nparagraph 4 is any reference to the rules for revoking acceptance once given.  It would \nnot be reasonable to construe t he parties’ silence to demonstrate a shared  intent to \neliminate the right of revocation altogether. \n44. Nor does the existence of a right to revoke create an inconsistency or render \nsuperfluous paragraph 4.  The premise of KB Farms’ argument is that it was feasible \nto test grapes for fermentation at the time of delivery (a fact Nature’s Pearl vigorously \ncontests) and that the Agreement required Nature’s Pearl to do so .  (See Pl.’s Reply \nBr. 5 & n.3.)  Assuming KB Farms is correct, though, section 25-2-608 would never \ncome into play.  The statute  permits revocation only when a buyer accepts goods \nbefore learning of the defect because the defect is too difficult to discover.  See N.C. \nGen. Stat. §  25-2-608(2).  If Nature’s  Pearl could have discovered fermentation by \ninspecting the grapes before acceptance , then it was required to  reject them at that \ntime, and could no t revoke  its acceptance later, under both the statute and the \nAgreement.  The right to revoke becomes operat ive only if Nature’s Pearl could not \nhave reasonably discovered the fermentation until after acceptance .  In that \ncircumstance, the right to revoke supplements but does not displace  or render \nsuperfluous the right to reject. \n \n45. In short, paragraph 4 is fully consistent with the existence of a right to \nrevoke under section 25-2-608.  KB Farms’ argument that Nature’s Pearl should have \ntested the grapes for fermentation upon delivery has no bearing on the proper \ninterpretation of the Agreement but is instead more aptly characterized as a factual \ndispute about whether Nature’s Pearl can satisfy the preconditions for revocation .  \nThat dispute is one for the jury. \n46. The parties also have factual disputes about section 25 -2-608’s other \nrequirements.  One requirement is that revocation must occur “before any substantial \nchange in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects.”  N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 25-2-608.  The purpose of this section “is for the protection of sellers where the \nbuyer allows the goods to d eteriorate, creating the risk that the alleged defect was \ncaused or aggravated by the buyer’s action or inaction.”   Roy Burt, 328 N.C. at 264, \n400 S.E.2d at 427.   \n47. KB Farms argues that Nature’s Pearl cannot satisfy this requirement \nbecause it pressed the grapes, processed them, and bottled the juice before attempting \nto revoke its acceptance .  (See Pl.’s Reply Br. 6 –7.)  It contends that these actions \nresulted in a substantial change in the grapes’ condition as a matter of law , citing \nauthority from other jurisdictions in support.  (See Pl.’s Reply Br. 7.)  \n48. Our Supreme Court , however, has not construed section 25 -2-608 in this \nfashion.  In Roy Burt, a farmer claimed that fertilizer purchased from the defendant \ndamaged his crops and land.  The farmer attempt ed to revoke his acceptance long \nafter spreading the fertilizer on his fields.  Although the fertilizer was absorbed into \n \nthe soil and fully consumed, the Supreme Court held that there was a genuine issue \nof fact concerning whether these circumstances cons tituted a “substantial change in \nthe condition of the fertilizer.”   Roy Burt, 328 N.C. at 264, 400 S.E.2d at 427.  The \nCourt based this decision on evidence that the seller “contemplated that the buyer \nwould use the fertilizer,” that the defect “could not be discovered without difficulty \nexcept by spreading the fertilizer,” and that spreading the fertilizer did not cau se or \naggravate the defect.  Id. at 264–65, 400 S.E.2d at 427–28.   \n49. Here, Nature’s Pearl has forecast evidence showing that the grapes  were \nriper grapes smelling of alcohol ; that KB Farms  shipped them two days after \nharvesting; and that Nature’s Pearl stop ped the fermentation process shortly after \ndelivery by pasteurizing the juice.  (Dep. D. Bodenhamer 62:15–25; Aff. A. Smith ¶ 5; \nDep. R. Ghaedian 191:9–13, ECF No. 74.9.)  Nature’s Pearl has also forecast evidence, \nthrough its expert’s testimony, that it could not have discovered the fermentation by \ninspecting the grapes upon delivery.  (Dep. R. Ghaedian 167:3 –5, 170:1–173:9; see \nalso Dep. A. Smith 86:5–8.)  Viewed in the light most favorable to Nature’s Pearl, the \nevidence tends to show that KB Farms knew Nature’s Pearl would use the grapes to \nmake juice, that the grapes were fermented at the time of delivery, and that Nature’s \nPearl’s conduct did not cause or aggravate the fermentation, all of which is sufficient \nto establish a genuine issue of material fact under Roy Burt.  See also W.A. Davis \nRealty, Inc. v. Wakelon Agri-Products, Inc., 84 N.C. App. 97, 97, 351 S.E.2d 816, 818 \n(1987). \n \n50. Section 2 -25-608 also requires that the nonconformity “substantially \nimpair[]” the goods’ value to the buyer.  KB Farms argues that Nature’s Pearl cannot \nmeet this element as a matter of law because it sold the juice to another merchant in \nCalifornia.  (See Pl.’s Reply Br. 7–8; Dep. K. Bodenhamer 192:25–193:6.)  Again, there \nare genuine factual disputes.   Nature’s Pearl points to evidence that the elevated \nalcohol content cost it a substantial amount of money.  (See Dep. J. Smith 105:1–10, \n106:1–12, 107:6–15; see also Aff. A. Smith ¶ 6.)  \n51. Finally, revocation is not effective until the buyer gives notice.  See N.C. \nGen. Stat. §  2-25-608(2).  KB Farms argues that  Nature’s Pearl failed to give \nreasonable notice because its letter did not mention revocation .  (See Pl.’s Reply Br. \n8–9.)  But “[f]ormal notice” is not required.  Roy Burt, 328 N.C. at 264, 400 S.E.2d at \n427.  And reasonableness is typically a question for the jury.  See Warren v. Guttanit, \nInc., 69 N.C. App. 103, 110, 317 S.E.2d 5, 11 (1984).  Nature’s Pearl provides evidence \nshowing that it was dissatisfied with the product’s alcohol content and that it stated \nits refusal to pay.  This is sufficient, at a minimum, to reach the jury.  See Roy Burt, \n328 N.C. at 264, 400 S.E.2d at 42 7; Warren, 69 N.C. App. at 109–11, 317 S.E.2d at \n10–11. \n52. Implicit in all of KB Farms’ arguments is a concern that it is easy for buyers \nto gin up false or “stale” claims related to perishable agricultural products.  (Pl.’s \nReply Br. 4.)  The concerns are fair.  Spoilage and decay are not just expected, but \ninevitable.  The right to revoke acceptance, though, is not “unfettered,” as KB Farms \ncontends.  (Pl.’s Reply Br. 5.)  Section 25-2-608 includes elements designed to prevent \n \nrevocation based on nothing more than a chang e of heart, and Nature’s Pearl must \nconvince a jury that it satisfied these preconditions.   \n53. At this stage, the evidence forecast by Nature’s Pearl is sufficient to create \na jury question.  The motion for summary judgment as to the counterclaim for breach \nof contract is denied.   \nB. Implied Warranties \n54. Under the UCC, every contract for a transaction in goods carries implied \nwarranties that the goods shall be merchantable and fit for the particular purpose for \nwhich the goods are required.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 25-2-314, -315.  Both warranties \nmay be excluded or modified, but any disclaimer must be in writing and conspicuous.  \nId. § 25-2-315.  These requirements are met when the contract states, for example, \nthat the goods are provided “as is” and marked with bold, italics, or similar \ndistinction.  See id. § 25-2-316(3)(a); see also Tyson v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 82 N.C. App. \n626, 631, 347 S.E.2d 473, 477 (1986); Billings v. Joseph Harris Co., 27 N.C. App. 689, \n693, 220 S.E.2d 361, 365 (1975).  \n55. The Agreement does not include a disclaimer of implied warranties, much \nless the type of conspicuous disclaimer required by the UCC.  Nature’s Pearl did not \nagree to take KB Farms’ grapes “as is” or “with all faults.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  25-2-\n316(3).  To the contrary, it agreed to purchase only grapes of “good quality.”  \n(Agreement ¶ 4.)   \n56. KB Farms insists that its “grapes were not subject to any implied warranty” \nbecause the terms of the Agreement “are wholly inconsistent with the implied \n \nwarranties.”  (Pl.’s Br.  in Supp. 6.)  Even if that were true, inconsistency alone is \ninsufficient to disclaim implied warranties under section 25 -2-316.  The  disclaimer \nmust be conspicuous.  Here, even  KB Farms concedes that the Agreement does “ not \nexplicitly disclaim[] implied warranties.”  (Pl.’s Br. in Supp. 6.)   \n57. KB Farms also argues that Nature’s Pearl cannot prove a breach of any \nimplied warranty as a matter of law because it blended the purportedly bad batch of \njuice with juice from a different vendor before testing for alcohol content.  (Pl.’s Reply \nBr. 10.)  The evidence, though, is conflicting at best.  As noted above, Nature’s Pearl \nhas provided some evidence tending to show that the grapes were fermented at the \ntime of delivery.  ( See, e.g., Dep. A. Smith 39:6–11, 40:3–6, ECF No. 74.11; see also \nDep. A. Smith 64:14–18, 85:14–22; Aff. A. Smith. ¶¶ 1, 5; Dep. D. Bodenhamer 62:15–\n25.)  Its witnesses have also testified that no grapes or juice from other vendors was \npresent during the relevant timefram e.  (See Dep. C. Smith 26:8 –16, ECF No. 69.2 ; \nsee also Dep. A. Smith 55:22, 77:17–19, 78:1–3; Aff. A. Smith ¶ 1.)   \n58. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to Nature’s Pearl, the Court \ncannot conclude as a matter of law that KB Farms did not breach  the implied \nwarranties of merchantability and fit ness for a particular purpose.   The Court \ntherefore denies the motion for summary judgment as to the counterclaims for breach \nof the implied warranties. \nC. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \n59. Nature’s Pearl also asserts a counterclaim for breach of the implied covenant \nof good faith and fair dealing .  As discussed above,  the UCC does not recognize an \n \nindependent cause of action for breach of the implied covenant.  Nature’s Pearl \nargued as much in it s briefing and at the hearing .  (See Defs.’ Opp’n 10 n.2. )  The \nCourt therefore grants KB Farms’ motion for summary judgment as to the claim for \nbreach of the implied covenant. \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n60. For these reasons, the Court ORDERS as follows: \na. KB Farms’ motion  for summary judgment  is GRANTED in part .  \nNature’s Pearl’s counterclaim for breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing is DISMISSED with prejudice.  Except as stated, \nKB Farms’ motion is DENIED. \nb. Defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment is GRANTED.  The \nclaims for breach of contract against Jerry Smith and Le Bleu are \nDISMISSED, and the claims for breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing against Nature’s Pearl, Jerry Smi th, and Le Bleu \nare DISMISSED, each with prejudice.   \nc. KB Farms’ claim for breach of contract against Nature’s Pearl shall \nproceed to trial. \nd. Nature’s Pearl’s  counterclaims for breach of contract , breach of the \nimplied warranty of fitness  for a particular pu rpose, and breach of the \nimplied warranty of merchantability against KB Farms shall proceed to \ntrial. \n \n \n \nThis the 15th day of August, 2018. \n /s/ Adam M.
