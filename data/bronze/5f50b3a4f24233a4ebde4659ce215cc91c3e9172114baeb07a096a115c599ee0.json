  "raw_text": "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nUNION COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n22 CVS 583 \n \nWESTON DAVIS, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nDAVIS FUNERAL SERVICE, INC.; \nROBERT L.

Burns and Christopher A. Gray , for \nDefendants Davis Funeral Service, Inc., Robert Morgan, Phillip Tillman, \nand Robin Morgan. \n \nVillmer Caudill, PLLC, by Bo Caudill, for Third-Party Defendant Deidre \nTedder. \n \nConrad, Judge.  \n \n1. This case arises out of a dispute over the management of Davis Funeral \nServices, Inc.  Weston Davis  sued the company and its officers based on  allegations \nthat he was unfairly ousted from his position as president .  In response, Davis \nDavis v. Davis Funeral Serv., Inc., 2022 NCBC 38. \nFuneral Services has counterclaimed and accused Davis of self-dealing.  It has also \nfiled a third-party complaint against Deidre Tedder (mistakenly called “Deidra” in \nthe pleading).  The third-party claims are the subject of this Order. \n2. The allegations against Tedder are succinct.  She and Davis are supposedly \ngood friends.  He hired her in October 2020 to serve as corporate secretary for Davis \nFuneral Services.  The two allegedly then began misusing corporate assets for their \npersonal benefit.  According to Davis Funeral Services, Tedder bought one of the \ncompany’s vehicles at a steep discount and paid for her daily meals with  company \nfunds.  There are two  claims for relief: one for breach of fiduciary duty and another \nfor embezzlement.  (See Third-Party Compl. 9–11, ECF No. 4.)  \n3. Tedder has moved to dismiss both third-party claims under Rule 12(b)(6) of \nthe North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  (ECF No. 10.)  Davis Funeral Services \nhas not filed a response brief, and the time to do so has passed .  By rule, the motion \nis deemed “uncontested,” BCR 7.6, and the Court elects to decide it without a hearing, \nBCR 7.4. \n4. North Carolina remains a notice pleading jurisdiction.  All that is required \nof a complaint is a “short and plain statement of the claim” being asserted.  N.C. R. \nCiv. P. 8(a)(1).  In deciding whether the third-party complaint states a claim for relief, \nthe Court  must take its allegations as true and view the facts and permissible \ninferences in the light most favorable to Davis Funeral Services  as the nonmoving \nparty.  See, e.g., Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, 332 (2019). \n5. Under this liberal standard, Davis Funeral Services has adequately alleged \nits claims .  Breach of fiduciary duty requires the  existence of a fiduciary duty, a \nbreach of that duty, and injury proximately caused by the breach.  See Green v. \nFreeman, 367 N.C. 136, 141 (2013) .  Embezzlement includes conversion of company \nproperty by a corporate officer.  See N.C.G.S. § 14-90(b); see also State v. Speckman, \n326 N.C. 576, 578 (1990) .  Here, Davis Funeral Services alleges that Tedder was its \ncorporate secretary, owed a fiduciary duty as an officer, and wrongfully took money \nand other property received in the course of her employment .  ( See Third-Party \nCompl. 9 –11.)  These allegations , though not detailed,  are minimally sufficient  to \nstate a claim for relief. \n6. Each of Tedder’s arguments for dismissal is off target .  She  relies, for \nexample, on a document outside the third -party complaint to show that she was  an \nadministrative employee rather than a corporate officer  and that she bought the \ndisputed vehicle from Davis Funeral Services before working there.  (See Tedder’s Ex. \nA, ECF No. 12.1.)  “Perhaps the most fundamental concept of motions practice under \nRule 12 is that evidence outside the pleadings  . . . cannot be considered in \ndetermining whether the complaint states a claim on which relief can be granted.”   \nJackson/Hill Aviation, Inc. v. Town of Ocean Isle Beach , 251 N.C. App. 771, 775 \n(2017).  The Court therefore does not consider this evidence.   \n7. Next, Tedder speculates that the compan y’s bylaws may have altered  her \nresponsibilities and, thus, narrowed any fiduciary duty owed as corporate secretary.  \nAt this stage, however, the Court must take all inferences in favor of Davis Funeral \nServices, not Tedder.  An officer owes statutory duties of loyalty and due care to the \ncorporation.  See N.C.G.S. §  55-8-42(a).  Davis Funeral Services has alleged that \nTedder was its corporate secretary and that she therefore owed these duties.  It was \nnot required to describe her responsibilities fully or with particularity.   W hether \nTedder held “a title and not an actual office” is a question for discovery and not suited \nto a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Morris v. Scenera Rsch. LLC, 2012 NCBC LEXIS 1, at *31 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan 4, 2012); see also Addison Whitney, LLC v. Cashion, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 51, at * 13–14 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 9, 2017)  (“The Court is unaware of any \ncase dismissing a breach of fiduciary duty claim against individuals with similar \ntitles and authority at the 12(b)(6) stage.”). \n8. Finally, Tedder argues that Davis authorized her use of company property, \nsuch that it was  neither embezzlement nor a breach of fiduciary duty.  But t he \nthird-party complaint does not expressly allege that Davis authorized Tedder’s meal \npurchases.  Rather, it simply alleges that both Davis and Tedder used company funds \nfor that purpose.   And in any event, it is far from clear that Davis’s authorization \nwould exonerate Tedder.  The thrust of the third-party complaint is that both Davis \nand Tedder misused company assets for personal gain.  Tedder has not explained why \nself-dealing by two corporate officials together is any less wrongful than self-dealing \nby one alone. \n9. For all these reasons, the Court DENIES Tedder’s motion to dismiss. \n \n  \nSO ORDERED, this the 20th day of July, 2022.   \n \n \n /s/ Adam M. Conrad                          \n      Adam M.
