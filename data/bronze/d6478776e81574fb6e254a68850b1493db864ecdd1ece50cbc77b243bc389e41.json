Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a Class Action Complaint o n \nMarch 25, 2013, asserting claims against Defendant for breach of contract, breach of \nthe coven ant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, unjust enrichment, and \nunfair and deceptive trade practices under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1. \n3. Plaintiff’s claims arose out of multiple overdraft fees incurred by Plaintiff \nas a result of Defendant’s high -to-low posting of ATM and one -time, non-recurring, \ndebit card transactions, which Plaintiff alleged Defendant did not properly disclose \nin Defendant’s effort to derive excessive overdraft fee s at the expense of Plaintiff \nand other Bank customers.  Plaintiff cont ended Defendant manipulated the order \nand timing in which Plaintiff’s debit charges were processed to charge overdraft fees \non accounts that were not actually overdrawn.  Plaintiff further asserted Defendant \ntook these actions  without notice to , and in vio lation of Defendant’s contractual \nobligations to, its customers.   \n4. After lengthy discovery and motions practice, o n October 24, 2014, \nDefendant moved for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claims  (the “Summary \nJudgment Motion”).  On October 29, 2014, Defendant also served Plaintiff with an \nOffer of Judgment under Rule 68 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure  in \nthe amount of $5,001.00, including all costs, interest, and attorney ’s fees accrued to \nthat date  (the “Offer of Judgment”) .  Plaintiff declined to accept the Offer of \nJudgment within ten days; therefore, under the plain language of Rule 68, the Offer \nwas deemed withdrawn. \n5. On June 10, 2015, th is Court granted Defendant’s Summary Judgment \nMotion, and  dismissed Plaintiff’s claims with prejudice  (the “Summary Judgment \nOrder”).  On June 29, 2015, Defendant filed the present Motion .  On July 2, 2015, \nPlaintiff filed a notice of appeal of the Summary Judgment Order to the North \nCarolina Court of Appeals .  The Court thereafter stayed consideration of \nDefendant’s Motion during the pendency of Plaintiff’s appeal.   \n6. On May 3, 2016, t he Court of Appeals affirmed the Summary Judgment \nOrder.  See Gay v. Peoples Bank , No. COA 15 -1103, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 493 \n(N.C. Ct. App. 2016) (unpublished).   \n7. On June 16, 2016, the Court dissolved the stay, and the parties completed \nbriefing on the Motion.  The Motion is now ripe for resolution.   \nII. \nANALYSIS \nA. Rule 68 \n8. Defendant’s Motion seeks an order requiring Plaintiff to pay the costs \nDefendant incurred after Plaintiff was served with Defendant’s Offer of Judgment \nunder Rule 68.   \n9. Rule 68 provides: \nAt any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party \ndefending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to \nallow judgment to be taken against him for the money or property or to \nthe effect specified in his offer, with costs then accrued.  If within 10 \ndays after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written \nnotice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer \nand notice of a cceptance together with proof of service thereof and \nthereupon the clerk shall enter judgment.  An offer not accepted within \n10 days after its service shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence of \nthe offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine  costs.  If \nthe judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than \nthe offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of \nthe offer.   The fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not \npreclude a subsequent offer. \n \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 68 (emphasis added).  The purpose of Rule 68 is to “encourage \nsettlements and avoid protracted litigation.”  Estate of Wells v. Toms, 129 N.C. App. \n413, 416, 500 S.E.2d 105, 107 (1998).  “The offer operates to save the defendant the \ncosts from the time of that offer if the plaintiff ultimately obtains a judgment for \nless than the sum offered.”  Scallon v. Hooper , 58 N.C. App. 551, 554, 293 S.E.2d \n843, 844 (1982). \n10. Defendant argues that because (i) it tendered an offer of judgment  more \nthan ten days in advance of trial , (ii) Plaintiff rejected the offer of judgment such \nthat it was deemed withdrawn, and (iii) this Court’s entry of summary judgment in \nfavor of Defendant was a judgment “not more favorable than the offer, ” the Court \nshould award Defendant the costs it incurred after making the offer by operation of \nRule 68.  Plaintiff argues in opposition that Rule 68 does not require a plaintiff to \npay a defendant’s costs where, as here, the defendant -offeror, rather than the \nplaintiff-offeree, obtained a judgment in its favor. \n11. Contrary to Plaintiff’s contention, however, the North Carolina appellate \ncourts have held that Rule 68 applies to permit an award of costs where a defendant \nsucceeds in its defense and not simply where a plaintiff obtains a judgment less \nfavorable than the defendant’s offer.  For example, in Griffis v. Lazarovich, 164 N.C. \nApp. 329, 595 S.E.2d 797 (2004) , the defendant made an offer of judgment to the \nplaintiff in the amount of $500,  the plaintiff did not accept the offer , and the jury \nlater found that the plaintiff was not injured by the negligence of the defendant .  \nThe Court therefore entered judgment in favor of the defendant.   Faced with these \nfacts on appeal, t he Court of Appeals held that “Rule 68 required the trial cour t to \ntax plaintiff with the [defendant’s] costs of proceeding with trial after plaintiff \nrejected th[e] offer and received a less favorable result at trial.”  Id. at 335, 595 \nS.E.2d at 802 (emphasis in original). \n12. Similarly, in Morgan v. Steiner, 173 N.C. App. 577, 619 S.E.2d 516 (2005), \nthe defendant extended an offer of judgment to the plaintiff, whi ch the plaintiff did \nnot accept, and  after the defendant prevailed at trial, defendant filed a motion for \ncosts under Rule 68 .  Although not analyzed in depth,  in affirming the trial court’s \norder requiring the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs in accordance with Rule 68, \nthe Court of Appeals upheld the use of Rule 68 to permit an award of costs to the \nprevailing defendant in that case.  Id. at 579, 619 S.E.2d at 518. \n13. In seeking to avoid the result compelled by these North Carolina \ndecisions, Plaintiff argues that this Court should be guided instead by the United \nStates Supreme Court ’s decision in Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August , 450 U.S. 346 \n(1981), holding that the cost-shifting mandate in the similarly-worded Rule 68 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply where , as here,  the defendant \nobtains a judgment in his favor .  In that case, the defendant offered the plaintiff \n$450 to settle the plai ntiff’s claims, and  the plaintiff rejected the offer.   After the \njury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, the defendant moved under \nFederal Rule 68 for costs incurred after the settlement offer was tendered.   \n14. Federal Rule 68 provides, in relevant part, that “[i]f the judgment that the \nofferee finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree \nmust pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 68(d).  The \nissue before the Supreme Court in Delta Air Li nes was “whether the words \n‘judgment finally obtained by the offeree’ as used in that Rule should be construed \nto encompass a judgment against the offeree as well as a judgment in favor of  the \nofferee.”  Delta Air Lines , 450 U.S. at 348.  The Court conclud ed that Federal Rule \n68 only applies “to judgments obtained by the plaintiff”  in amounts less than the \nunaccepted offer and not where a defendant prevails in his defense.  Id. at 352.  \n15. As an initial matter, the Court observes that although “[d]ecisions und er \nthe federal rules are . . . pertinent for guidance and enlightenment in developing the \nphilosophy of the North Carolina rules,” Turner v. Duke Univ. , 325 N.C. 152, 164, \n381 S.E.2d 706, 713 (1989), federal decisions are not binding on this Court or any \nNorth Carolina court interpreting a question solely of state law.  See Virmani v. \nPresbyterian Health Servs. Corp. , 350 N.C. 449, 465, 515 S.E.2d 675, 686 (1999).  \nThus, because the proper interpretation of N.C. R. Civ. P. 68 is a matter solely of \nNorth Carolina state law, the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Delta Air \nLines is not binding on this Court. \n16. In any event , the Supreme Court  rested its holding in Delta Air Lines on \nits interpretation of Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which allows \na prevailing party after judgment to recover costs unless the trial court otherwise \ndirects.  The Supreme Court concluded that if Federal Rule 68 was interpreted to \napply to judgments obtained by defendants, it would “operate[] to deprive the \ndistrict judge of the discretion vested in him by Rule 54(d).”  Delta Air Lines , 450 \nU.S. at 353.  The North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, however, do not contain a \ncost-recovery rule similar to Federal Rule 54(d ), and the Court fails to see how the \ntrial court’s discretion under any North Carolina statute permitting cost recovery \nwill be impaired should Rule 68 apply to judgments obtained by defendants.   \n17. Moreover, although the North Carolina appellate courts have cited Delta \nAir Lines in interpreting N.C. R. Civ. P. 68 on two occasions, our courts have never \nrelied upon or elected to follow Delta Air Lines  to embrace the proposition that \nPlaintiff urges the Court to adopt here.  See Purdy v. Brown , 307 N.C. 93, 96, 296 \nS.E.2d 459, 462 (1982) (citing Delta Air Lines  concerning attorney’s fees as costs \nunder Rule 68); Aikens v. Ludlum , 113 N.C. App. 823,  825, 440 S.E.2d 319 , 321  \n(1994) (citing Justice Powell’s concurrence in Delta Air Lines concerning lump sum \noffers under Rule 68).  Thus , the Court concl udes that even if the North Carolina \nappellate courts had not squarely addressed the issue , the United States Supreme \nCourt’s holding in Delta Air Lines  concerning Federal Rule 68 is of limited \npersuasive force.   \n18. Accordingly, the Court declines to follow Delta Air Lines  and concludes \nthat prior North Carolina appellate decisions , including Griffis and Morgan, supra, \ncontrol the proper interpretation of N.C. R. Civ. P. 68 in these circumstances.  The \nCourt notes that c ourts in other states have similarly declined to follow Delta Air \nLines when interpreting their state’s Federal Rule 68-equivalent.  See, e.g., Kellis v. \nCrites, 20 P.3d 1112 (Alaska 2001);  Greenwald v. Ford Motor Co. , 993 P.2d 1087 \n(Ariz. Ct. App. 1999) ; Thompson v. Miller, 4 Cal. Rptr. 3d 905 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003) ; \nJorgensen v. Heinz, 847 P.2d 181 (Colo. App.1992);  Paull v. Coughlin, 466 A.2d 347 \n(Conn. Super. Ct. 1983); Timmons v. Combs , 608 So.2d 1 (Fla. 1992);  Divine v. \nGroshong, 679 P.2d 7 00 (Kan. 1984); Luidens v. 63d Dist. Court , 555 N.W.2d 709 \n(Mich. Ct. App. 1996); Schwartz v. Estate of Greenspun , 881 P.2d 638 ( Nev. 1994); \nFuller v. Pacheco, 21 P.3d 74 (Okla. Civ. App. 20 01); Cole v. Clifton, 833 S.W.2d 75 \n(Tenn. Ct. App. 1992).   \nB. Amount of Costs \n19. Defendant seeks to recover costs in the a mount of $5,780.88 as follows: (1) \n$4,380.88 for costs associated with the transcription of depositions and (2) $1,400.00 \nfor the mediator’s fee from the court-ordered mediation.   \n20. Plaintiff does not dispute the amount of the costs to be awarded or \nDefendant’s entitlement to deposition and mediation costs in the event that the \nCourt concludes, as it has, that Defendant is entitled to payment of its costs under \nRule 68.  Indeed, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A -305(d) specifically provides that recoverable \ncosts include  “[f]ees of mediators appointed by the court” and “[r]easonable and \nnecessary expenses . . . for the costs of deposition transcripts ,”  § 7A -305(d)(7), (10), \nwhich are the specific costs Defendant seeks to recover here.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that Defendant is entitled to recover costs in the amount of $5,780.88. \nIII.  \nCONCLUSION \n21. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that  because Plaintiff did not \nobtain a judgment that was more favorable than Defendant’s offer , N.C. R. Civ. P. \n68 requires that Plaintiff pay Defendant’s costs incurred after Defendant made its \noffer.   \n22. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby  GRANTS Defendant’s Motion  and \nORDERS that Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s costs in the amount of $5,780.88, such \npayment to be made within forty-five (45) days of the entry of this Order.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 16th day of September, 2016. \n \n \n \n/s/ Louis A.
