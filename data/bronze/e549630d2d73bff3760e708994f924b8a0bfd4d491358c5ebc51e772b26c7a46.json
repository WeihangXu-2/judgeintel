Sharp and \nDuke Energy Corporation. \n \nJolly, Judge.  \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n[1] Plaintiff's Verified Shareholder De rivative Amended Complaint (“Amended \nComplaint”) was filed on August 1, 2012.  \n[2] The Amended Complaint asserts the following derivative claims \n(\"Claim(s)\") on behalf of Duke Energy Corporation (\"Duke\"): (a) Count I – Against \nDefendants Barnet, Bernhardt, Browning, DiMicco, Forsgren, Gray, Hance, Reinsch, \nRhodes and Sharp for Breach of Fiduciary Duties of Loyalty and Good Faith; (b) Count \nII –  Against Defendants Barnet, Bernhardt, Browning, DiMicco, Forsgren, Gray, Hance, \nReinsch, Rhodes and Sharp for Waste of Corporate Assets; (c) Count III – Against \nDefendant Johnson for Unjust Enrichment; and (d) Count IV – Aiding and Abetting \nBreach of Fiduciary Duty Against Defendant Rogers. \n[3] The Motions have been briefed and argued, and are ripe for \ndetermination. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nAmong other things, the Amended Complaint alleges that: \n[4] This action arises out of the me rger between Progress Energy, Inc. \n(\"Progress\") and Duke that occurred between 2011 and 2012 (\"Merger\").  Under the \nterms of the Merger, Progress became a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke, thereby \ncreating one of the country's largest electric utility companies.   \n[5] In the period leading up to the finalization of the Merger, it was \nrepresented to stakeholders of both companies, among others, that William Johnson \n(\"Johnson\"), then CEO of Progress, would serve as CEO of the combined company.  \nJames Rogers (\"Rogers\"), then the CEO of Duke, was to serve as executive chairman \nof the combined company's board of directors.1 \n[6]   The Merger was approved by a vote of the shareholders of both \ncompanies on August 23, 2011.2   \n[7] On June 27, 2012, Duke entered into  a three-year employment agreement \nwith Johnson under which Johnson would serve as President and CEO of the combined \ncompany (\"Employment Agreement\").  Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, \nJohnson was to receive significant severance payments if Duke terminated his \nemployment without cause, or if Johnson voluntarily resigned for good reason at any \ntime following the close of the merger but prior to the second anniversary of such \nclosing.3   \n                                                 \n1 Am.

Compl. 6 (\"Duke Brief\"). \n[8] The terms of the Employment Ag reement were consistent with a term \nsheet that was executed as a part of the January 2011 merger agreement and attached \nas an exhibit to Duke's Form 8-K, publicly filed with the SEC on July 3, 2012 (\"8-K\").4 \n[9] The Merger became final after being approved by North Carolina \nregulators on July 2, 2012.5   \n[10] Within hours of the Merger becoming final, Duke announced that Johnson \nhad been removed as CEO of the combined company and that Rogers instead would \nserve in that role.  The decision to remove Johnson was made by the board of directors \nof the newly-combined company.  Ten former Duke directors voted in favor of removing \nJohnson (\"Director Defendants\").6  Five directors, all former directors of Progress, voted \nagainst the removal of Johnson as CEO.7 \n[11] Subsequently, Johnson and Duke ent ered into the Separation Agreement, \nwhich provided, among other things, that Johnson became CEO of Duke effective July \n2, 2012, and left that position by resignation at 12:01 a.m. on July 3, 2012.  Johnson's \nremoval as CEO triggered payments to him that could reach as much as $44.4 million.8 \n                                                 \n4 The Employment Agreement and a Separation and Settlement Agreement (\"Separation Agreement\") are \nattached to the 8-K as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively.  The 8-K, Employment Agreement and \nSettlement Agreement are specifically referred to in the Amended Complaint, and properly are before the \ncourt for consideration in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  See Coley v. N.C. Nat'l Bank, 41 N.C. \nApp. 121 (1979). \n5 Am. Compl. ¶ 38. \n6 Defendants William Barnet, III; G. Alex Bernhardt, Sr.; Michael G. Browning; Daniel R. Dimicco; John H. \nForsgren; Ann Maynard Gray; James H. Hance, Jr.; E. James Reinsch; James T. Rhodes and Philip R. \nSharp.  The Duke Brief contends that the Director Defendants were outside directors.  Plaintiff’s Omnibus \nOpposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss does not contest that contention.  \n7 Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40-42. \n8 Id. ¶¶ 41-45. The Amended Complaint specifically refers to the 8-K in support of its allegation that \nJohnson is owed as much as $44.4 million under the Employment Agreement. Both sides appear to \nacknowledge that the total value of payments due Johnson based upon his termination could be as high \nas $44.4 million. Notwithstanding the parties' implicit agreement, the payments alleged in the Amended \nComplaint do not total $44.4 million. Rather, the amounts allegedly due Johnson included, among other \nthings, $7.4 million in severance, a nearly $1.4 million cash bonus, a special lump-sum payment worth up \nto $1.5 million, accelerated vesting of his stock awards and $30,000 for relocation expenses.  The \nAmended Complaint provides no detailed explanation of how the total owing to Johnson might otherwise \nDISCUSSION \n[12] Both Motions seek dismissal of various Counts in the Amended Complaint \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rule(s)\").9  \nRule 12(b)(6) dismissal is appropriate when the complaint fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted.  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the well-pleaded \nallegations of the complaint are taken as true and admitted, but legal conclusions and \nunwarranted deductions of facts are not deemed admitted.  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. \n94, 98 (1970).  The court notes that in ruling upon such a motion, \"the complaint is to be \nliberally construed, and the trial court should not dismiss the complaint 'unless it \nappears beyond doubt that [the] plaintiff could prove no set of facts in support of his \nclaim which would entitle him to relief.'\"  Meyer v. Walls, 347 N.C. 97, 111-12 (1997) \n(quoting Dixon v. Stuart, 85 N.C. App. 338, 340 (1987)).  In its discretion, the court \nelects to address Count III before moving on to the less straightforward issues raised by \nCounts I, II, and IV. \nThe Johnson Motion \n[13] The Johnson Motion seeks dismissa l of Plaintiff's Count III unjust \nenrichment Claim on the basis that such a claim will not lie where there is a contract \nbetween the parties.  The court agrees.  A claim for unjust enrichment is properly \ndismissed where the complaint reveals the existence of a contract between the parties.  \n                                                 \nreach the $44.4 million figure, and the Separation Agreement provides no greater clarity.  The Separation \nAgreement specifies the payments alleged by Plaintiff in the Amended Complaint and also lists \nundisclosed amounts due or paid to Johnson classified as, \"[a]ccrued and vested amounts under all non-\nqualified and incentive plans, including the Progress, Inc. Management Deferred Compensation Plan, the \nProgress, Inc. Management Incentive Compensation Plan and the Progress, Inc. Deferred Compensation \nPlan for Key Management Employees.\" \n9 Although fashioned as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Duke Defendants' Motion argues in favor of dismissal \nbased on both Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1), the latter upon an argument arising from the failure of Plaintiff \nto make pre-suit demand as to the derivative Claims. \nSe. Shelter Corp. v. BTU, Inc., 154 N.C. App. 321, 330-31 (2002) (holding that a claim \nfor unjust enrichment, as a quasi-contractual remedy, cannot be maintained where an \nexplicit contract exists between the parties).   \n[14] As the North Carolina C ourt of Appeals recently noted: \nUnjust enrichment has been defined as \"a legal term \ncharacterizing the 'result or effect of a failure to make \nrestitution of, or for, property or benefits received under such \ncircumstances as to give rise to a legal or equitable obligation \nto account therefor.'\"  \"A claim of this type is . . . described as \na claim in quasi contract or a cont ract implied in law. . . . If \nthere is a contract between the parties[,] the contract governs \nthe claim and the law will not imply a contract.\" \n \nRev O, Inc. v. Woo, ___ N.C. App. ___, 725 S.E.2d 45, 49 (2012) (internal citations \nomitted).   \n \n[15] Here, Plaintiff alleges that Johnson was \"unjustly enriched by his receipt of \nexcessive compensation in the form of a $44 million severance payment.\"\n10  The \nAmended Complaint reveals, however, that the severance payments of which Plaintiff \ncomplains arose out of Johnson's Employment Agreement with Duke.11  Thus, the \nAmended Complaint discloses the existence of a contract between the parties \nconcerning the subject matter of Plaintiff's unjust enrichment Claim.   \n[16] Plaintiff appears to argue that the severance payments owing to Johnson \nwere excessive in light of Johnson's \"scant hours of service.\"12  Even assuming the \npayments to Johnson might be considered excessive as Plaintiff alleges, the existence \n                                                 \n10 Am. Compl. ¶ 74.   \n11 Id. ¶¶ 40-43.  \n12 Id. ¶ 44. \nof a contract between the parties concerning the subject matter of the unjust enrichment \nClaim is dispositive, as discussed above.13 \n[17] Accordingly, the Amended Complain t fails to state a Claim for unjust \nenrichment as to Defendant Johnson, and the Johnson Motion should be GRANTED \nwith regard to Count III. \nThe Duke Defendants’ Motion \n[18] The Duke Defendants’ Motion seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's Claims in \nCounts I and II against the Director Defendants and Duke, arguing that (a) Plaintiff has \nfailed to state any claim against them upon which relief may be granted, and (b) Plaintiff \nlacks standing to bring any derivative claims because his failure to make pre-suit \ndemand is not excused.  If Plaintiff does not have standing to bring the derivative \nClaims alleged in this civil action, the action is subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction and analysis of Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) \ncontentions would be unnecessary.  Accordingly, the court will address the standing \nissue first. \nStanding – Failure to Make Pre-suit Demand \n[19] Duke is incorporated in the State of Delaware and has its principal place \nof business in North Carolina.14  Both Delaware15 and North Carolina16 require that prior \n                                                 \n13 Plaintiff's unjust enrichment Claim is particularly problematic in the context of a derivative action.  \nBecause Plaintiff's unjust enrichment Claim is brought by and on behalf of Duke, the Claim amounts to an \nattempt by Duke to disown the terms of a contract into which it entered on the basis that the express \nterms of the contract were unfair to Duke.  An assertion that the express terms of a contract were \nultimately unfavorable to one of the contracting parties, without more, does not state a claim for unjust \nenrichment. See, e.g., Embree Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., 330 N.C. 487, 496 (1992) (distinguishing \na claim for unjust enrichment based on expected contractual benefits from a claim regarding non-\ncontractual benefits). \n14 Am. Compl. ¶ 10. \n15 Del. Ch. Ct. R. 23.1. \n16 N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-7-42. \nto filing a derivative suit in behalf of a corporation, a plaintiff must make appropriate \ndemand that the board of directors initiate the action in behalf of the corporation.  \nNothing else appearing, a plaintiff who files a derivative action without meeting this pre-\nsuit burden faces dismissal of the action for lack of standing to prosecute his claim. \n[20] Plaintiff concedes that he did not  make a pre-suit demand of the Duke \nBoard of Directors with regard to the matters alleged in the Complaint, but argues and \nalleges that his failure to do so should be excused because such demand would have \nbeen \"a futile and useless act\" since the Board was \"incapable of making an \nindependent and disinterested decision to institute and vigorously prosecute this \naction.\"\n17 Plaintiff’s contentions raise issues involving internal corporate governance and \naffairs.  \n[21] The laws of Delaware and North Carolina are materially different with \nregard to whether failure to make a pre-suit demand can be excused by a showing that \nthe demand would have been futile.  North Carolina no longer recognizes the futility \nexception to the demand requirement.18  Accordingly, the first determination to be made \nis which state’s law should govern here.  Both North Carolina and Delaware recognize \nthe “internal affairs” doctrine, which provides that only the state of incorporation can \nexercise the authority to regulate \"matters peculiar to the relationships among or \nbetween the corporation and its current officers, directors, and shareholders.\" See, e.g., \nPyott v. La. Mun. Police Emps.' Ret. Sys., 74 A.3d 612, 616 (Del. 2013), Bluebird Corp. \nv. Aubin, 188 N.C. App. 671, 680 (2008) (citing Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624 \n                                                 \n17 Am. Compl. ¶ 60. \n18 See Allen v. Ferrera, 141 N.C. App. 284, 288-289 (2000); N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-7-42.  \n \n(1982)); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-7-47 (providing that the laws of the state of \nincorporation of a foreign corporation shall govern derivative actions).  Duke is a \nDelaware corporation, and the failure to make pre-suit demand of a derivative claim \nconcerns Duke's internal affairs.  Consequently, whether Plaintiff's failure to make pre-\nsuit demand is excused is a matter to be settled in accordance with the laws of \nDelaware. 19 Id. \n[22] Delaware Chancery Court Rule 23.1 r equires a plaintiff in a derivative suit \nto \"allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action he \ndesires from the directors or comparable authority.\" A plaintiff who brings a derivative \nsuit without such an allegation must show that a demand on the board of directors \nwould have been futile. A plaintiff that fails to meet this burden faces dismissal upon a \nmotion to dismiss \"even if he has an otherwise meritorious claim.\" Kaufman v. Belmont, \n479 A.2d 282, 286 (Del. Ch. 1984). \nThe Aronson Test \n[23] Under Delaware law, whether the pre-suit demand requirement is excused \nis governed by Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 814 (Del. 1984), overruled in part by \nBrehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244 (Del. 1998) (\"Aronson Test\").  Pursuant to the Aronson \nTest, pre-suit demand is excused where particular facts are alleged that raise a \nreasonable doubt as to (a) director disinterest or independence or (b) whether the \ndirectors exercised proper business judgment in approving the challenged transactions.  \nRales v. Blasband, 634 A.2d 927, 933 (Del. 1993), abrogated by Hamilton Partners, \n                                                 \n19 Defendants concede this point.  See Duke Brief 11.  Further, in other cases this court has reached the \nsame determination under similar circumstances. See, e.g., Smith v. Raymond, 2010 NCBC 18 ¶ 1 n.1; \nEgelhof v. Szulik, 2006 NCBC 4 ¶ 41 (reversed in part on other grounds by Egelhof v. Szulik, 193 N.C. \nApp. 612 (2008)).  \nL.P. v. Englard, 11 A.3d 1180 (Del. Ch. 2010).  Reasonable doubt in this context is \npresent where facts are alleged that would give a reasonable shareholder reason to \ndoubt the ability of a board of directors to disinterestedly consider a demand.  Rales, \n634 A.2d at 934. \nDirectors’ Disinterest or Independence \n[24] Turning first to whether the Amended Complaint raises a reasonable \ndoubt as to director disinterest or independence, the court notes that there is no \nallegation that any director obtained a personal financial or pecuniary benefit from the \ndecision to terminate Johnson.  Instead, the Amended Complaint argues that the \nDirector Defendants face a substantial likelihood of personal liability for \"committing \nwaste and violating the Company's compensation mandates by approving Johnson's \nseverance payment.\"20  According to Plaintiff, the ability of the Director Defendants to \nconsider any demand for corporate action made by Plaintiff was sufficiently \ncompromised by a substantial likelihood of liability for the Director Defendants so as to \nmake any demand by Plaintiff futile. \n[25] Under Delaware law, director s have a \"disabling interest when the \npotential for liability is not a mere threat but instead may rise to a substantial likelihood.\"  \nIn re Baxter Int'l, Inc. S'holders Litig., 654 A.2d 1268, 1269 (Del. Ch. 1995) (internal \nquotations and citations omitted).  Put another way, \"the mere threat of personal liability \nfor approving a questioned transaction, standing alone, is insufficient to challenge either \nthe independence or disinterestedness of directors, although in rare cases a transaction \nmay be so egregious on its face that board approval cannot meet the test of business \n                                                 \n20 Pl. Resp. Br. 9 (citing Am. Compl.). \njudgment, and a substantial likelihood of director liability therefore exists.\"  Aronson, 473 \nA.2d at 815.   \n[26] The Amended Complaint alleges that  the Duke Board is incapable of \ndisinterestedly and independently considering a demand to commence and vigorously \nprosecute this action because the \"[Director Defendants] are substantially likely to be \nheld liable for breaching their fiduciary duties and wasting corporate assets by \nterminating Johnson and paying him a $44 million severance package.\"21 \n[27] Mere allegations that directors par ticipated in or approved of the alleged \nwrongs as a showing of directorial interest have been consistently rejected by Delaware \ncourts.  Decker v. Clausen, 1989 Del. Ch. LEXIS 143, at *7-8 (Del. Ch. Sept. 8, 1989).  \nSee also Rales, 634 A.2d 927 (holding that blanket allegations that the director \nparticipated in or approved the alleged misconduct are insufficient to establish interest); \nKaufman v. Belmont, 479 A.2d 282, 288 (Del. Ch. 1984) (\"[M]ere approval of a \ncorporate action . . . will not disqualify the director from subsequently considering a pre-\nsuit demand to rectify the challenged transaction.\" (internal citations omitted)); Haber v. \nBell, 465 A.2d 353, 359 (Del. Ch. 1983) (\"[A]llegations that the members of the Board of \nDirectors 'approved or acquiesced in' the actions which plaintiffs attack are . . . not \nsufficient to excuse demand for redress before suit.\" (internal citations omitted))  \nInstead, plaintiff must plead with particularity facts that demonstrate that the potential for \ndirector liability rises to the level of a \"substantial likelihood.\"  Wood v. Baum, 953 A.2d \n136, 141, 141 n.11 (Del. 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n                                                 \n21 Am. Compl. ¶ 62(a). \n[28] In substance, the Amended Compla int relies upon the sort of conclusory \nallegations that are inadequate to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of liability on the \npart of the Director Defendants.  By way of example, the Amended Complaint alleges \nthat \"Johnson's severance payment is excessive, unreasonable and serves no \nlegitimate purpose,\"22 that \"[t]here was not, and could not possibly have been, a good \nfaith business reason to approve a $44 million severance payment to Johnson in \nconnection with his dismissal,\"23 and that \"the Company has received nothing of real \nvalue from Johnson in exchange for awarding him $44 million.\"24 \n[29] The court notes that  the relative timing of Johnson's formal Employment \nAgreement and his departure presents some troublesome details.  However, after \nconsideration of the Amended Complaint and materials appropriately of record, viewed \nin the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as well as the broad discretion afforded directors \nas to compensation and severance matters, the court cannot conclude that the amount \nof Johnson's severance and its timing give rise to a substantial likelihood of director \nliability.  See, e.g., Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d 244, 262 n.56 (Del. 2000) (\"To be sure, \ndirectors have the power, authority and wide discretion to make decisions on executive \ncompensation.\"). \n[30] Plaintiff argues that, in approvi ng the termination of Johnson and the \nseverance payments to him, the Director Defendants knowingly violated the Company's \npublicly-disclosed compensation mandates.  According to Plaintiff, \"Duke has pledged \nto its stockholders in the Company's annual proxy materials that compensation of Duke \n                                                 \n22 Id. ¶ 43. \n23 Id. ¶ 44. \n24 Id. ¶ 46. \nexecutives will serve the goals of (1) 'attract[ing] and retain[ing] talented executive \nofficer' [sic]; (2) 'emphasiz[ing] performance-based compensation'; and (3) 'reward[ing] \nindividual performance.'\"25  Plaintiff contends that, \"[b]y granting Johnson's excessive \npayout at a time when he was leaving the Company after having only performed a few \nhours of work, the Director Defendants clearly knew that his severance award fulfilled \nnone of the Company's compensation mandates.\"26 \n[31] Plaintiff attempts to transform the executive compensation goals stated in \nDuke's proxy materials into affirmative mandates that were breached by Director \nDefendants based on their dealings with Johnson.  This attempt by Plaintiff also fails to \ndemonstrate a substantial likelihood of director liability.  While Plaintiff is correct that \nshareholders may generally rely upon information distributed by directors, Malone v. \nBrincat, 722 A.2d 5 (Del. 1998), the statements by Duke related to executive \ncompensation are plainly aspirational on their face and should not be contorted into \naffirmative mandates or representations that could give rise to a substantial likelihood of \nliability under the circumstances of this matter.   \n[32] Accordingly, the court CONCLUDES that  Plaintiff's failure to make pre-suit \ndemand is not excused based on the failure of the Director Defendants to be \ndisinterested and independent. \nDirectors' Business Judgment \n[33] In order for pre-suit  demand to be excused in the context of directors' \nbusiness judgment, a complaint must meet the burden of raising a reasonable doubt as \nto whether \"the challenged transaction was the product of a valid exercise of business \n                                                 \n25 Pl.

There exists a presumption that the directors \nacted on an informed basis, and with a good faith honest belief that the action taken \nwas in the company's best interest. Unitrin, Inc. v. Am. Gen. Corp., 651 A.2d 1361, 1373 \n(Del. 1995) (quoting Aronson, 473 A.2d at 812). The burden is on the challenging party \nto plead facts rebutting this presumption.  Id.   A plaintiff must plead particularized facts \nsufficient to raise a reason to doubt that (a) \"the action was taken honestly and in good \nfaith\" or (b) \"the board was adequately informed in making the decision.\"  In re J.P. \nMorgan Chase & Co. S'holder Litig., 906 A.2d 808, 824-25 (Del. Ch. 2005) (\"Due to the \nabsence of particularized factual allegations calling into question the directors' good \nfaith, honesty, or lack of adequate information, the court finds that the complaint does \nnot give rise to a reason to doubt whether the decision of the board of directors of JPMC \nto approve the Merger Agreement is entitled to the protection of the business judgment \nrule.\"). \n[34] The Amended Complaint here contains  no particularized allegations that \nthe Director Defendants were not adequately informed in making the decision to \nterminate Johnson's employment agreement and approve the severance payments to \nhim.  The only allegation that speaks to whether the Director Defendants were \nadequately informed is Plaintiff's conclusory allegation that, \"[f]or certain, in its hurry to \npay Johnson off, the Board failed to deliberate or inform itself of the foregoing \ntransaction.\"\n27 \n[35] Plaintiff contends that the decisio n by the Director Defendants to approve \nthe severance payments to Johnson could not have been the product of a valid exercise \n                                                 \n27 Am.

Specifically, Plaintiff contends that \nreasonable doubt can be raised through allegations of waste by pleading that, \"what the \ncorporation has received is so inadequate that no person of ordinary, sound business \njudgment would deem it worth that which the corporation has paid.\"29   \n[36] Delaware courts have develo ped an exacting standard by which to \nevaluate claims of corporate waste. \nThe judicial standard for determi nation of corporate waste is \nwell developed. Roughly, a wa ste entails an exchange of \ncorporate assets for consideration so disproportionately small \nas to lie beyond the range at which any reasonable person \nmight be willing to trade.  See Saxe v. Brady, 40 Del. Ch. 474, \n184 A.2d 602, 610; Grobow v. Perot, Del. Supr., 539 A.2d 180, \n189 (1988).  Most often the claim is associated with a transfer \nof corporate assets that serves  no corporate purpose; or for \nwhich no consideration at all is received. Such a transfer is in \neffect a gift. If, however, there is any substantial consideration \nreceived by the corporati on, and if there is a good faith \njudgment that in the circumstances the transaction is \nworthwhile, there should be no finding of waste, even if the \nfact finder would conclude a po st that the transaction was \nunreasonably risky. Any other ru le would deter corporate \nboards from the optimal rational acceptance of risk, for \nreasons explained elsewhere. See Gagliardi v. TriFoods \nIntern., Inc., Del. Ch., 683 A.2d 1049 (1996). Courts are ill-\nfitted to attempt to weigh t he 'adequacy' of consideration \nunder the waste standard or, ex post,  to judge appropriate \ndegrees of business risk. \n \nLewis v. Vogelstein, 699 A.2d 327, 336 (Del. Ch. 1997).   \n \n                                                 \n28 Pl. Resp. Br. 10.  \n29 Id. at 9 (citation omitted). \n[37] The crux of Plaintiff's argument re lated to waste is that, \"[t]he Director \nDefendants' unanimous decision to pay Johnson $44 million for only a few hours of \nwork is a clear waste of Company assets under Delaware law.\"\n30  To this end, Plaintiff \nattempts to parse the total severance payments made to Johnson in terms of the few \nhours he actually served as CEO of the combined company.  However, the Amended \nComplaint fails to account for the fact31 that in the event of merger, Johnson was \nentitled to receive substantial severance benefits under the Progress Management \nChange-In-Control Plan even if his subsequent Employment Agreement with Duke had \nnever been formalized.  The Amended Complaint only fleetingly acknowledges that, in \nfurther consideration of his severance payments, Johnson provided (a) a release of \nclaims against Duke; (b) an agreement to cooperate with Duke in respect to transition \nmatters and (c) non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and confidentiality \ncovenants.  \n[38] The business judgment rule ent itles the Director Defendants to the \npresumption that they acted in good faith in making the decision to terminate Johnson \nand approve the severance payments to him.  That presumption is heightened in cases \nwhere the majority of directors are outside or independent.  Leung v. Schuler, 2000 Del. \nCh. LEXIS 41 at *39 (Del. Ch. Feb. 29, 2000) (internal citations omitted).  \"To overcome \nthat presumption and to survive a motion to dismiss . . . the complaint must plead \nspecific facts from which it can be inferred that 'the decision [by the board] is so beyond \n                                                 \n30 Id. at 11. \n31 Clearly established in the Employment Agreement, 8-K and attached exhibits.  This is conceded by \nPlaintiff in his response brief.  Id. at 11 n.4. \nthe bounds of reasonable judgment that it seems essentially inexplicable on any other \ngrounds.'\"  Id. \n[39] The court cannot conclude that th e allegations of the Amended Complaint \nsupport a finding or conclusion that what Duke received in consideration for the \nseverance payments to Johnson was so inadequate that no person of ordinary, sound \nbusiness judgment would deem it worth the amount paid.  \n[40] The Amended Complaint asserts t hat Johnson received \"exit payments \nworth as much as $44.4 million for his day's work,\"32 and that, \"the Company . . . \nreceived nothing of real value from Johnson in exchange for awarding him $44 \nmillion.\"33  These conclusory assertions are insufficient to overcome the presumption \nthat the Director Defendants acted in good faith in terminating Johnson and approving \nhis severance payments.  Thus, in the context of the present action, Plaintiff's \nallegations of waste do not provide sufficient basis to doubt that the action was taken \nhonestly and in good faith. \n[41] Accordingly, the court CONCLUDES t hat Plaintiff's failure to make a pre-\nsuit demand relative to any derivative Claims in this civil action was not excused.  \nPlaintiff therefore does not have standing to bring the derivative Claims alleged in \nCounts I and II of this civil action.  As to Counts I and II, the action is subject to \ndismissal under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and \nfurther analysis of Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) contentions is unnecessary.  As to Counts \nI and II the Duke Defendants' Motion therefore should be GRANTED. \n  \n                                                 \n32 Am. Compl. ¶ 41. \n33 Id. ¶ 46. \nClaim IV Against Defendant Rogers \n[42] In view of the above rulings, t here remain no substantive Claims against \nthe Director Defendants.  Consequently, there are no Claims to support the aiding and \nabetting Count IV allegations against Rogers.  Accordingly, as to Count IV the Duke \nDefendants’ Motion should be GRANTED. \nNOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, it hereby is ORDERED that: \n[43] The Motion to Dismiss for Failure to  State a Claim by Defendant William \nJohnson is GRANTED.  Count III of the Amended Complaint therefore is DISMISSED.   \n[44] The Motion to Dismiss the Veri fied Shareholder Derivative Amended \nComplaint by Defendants James E.

Sharp and Nominal \nDefendant Duke Energy Corporation is GRANTED as to Counts I, II and IV of the \nAmended Complaint. Counts I, II and IV of the Amended Complaint therefore are \nDISMISSED.  \n[45] There remain no further Claims in th is civil action, and this matter hereby \nis DISMISSED in its entirety. \n[46] Taxable costs in this civil action are charged to Plaintiff. \n This the 30th day of April, 2014. \n    \n \n "
