  "raw_text": " \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nWAYNE COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n20 CVS 1430 \n \nMAXWELL FOODS, LLC, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nSMITHFIELD FOODS, INC., \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANT’S PARTIAL  \nMOTION TO DISMISS \n \n1. For over 25 years, Maxwell Foods, LLC has supplied swine to Smithfield \nFoods, Inc. under an output contract.  O nce one of the country’s  largest swine \nsuppliers, Maxwell recently began cutting its production and will soon be out of the \nhog business entirely.  Maxwell blames Smithfield for its demise .  The nub of the \ncomplaint is that Smithfield—the dominant player in the hog market —has used its \nmarket position to depress  prices, rendering the output contract unprofitable for \nMaxwell.  Although a ware of Maxwell’s tenuous financial position, Smithfield \nsupposedly slashed its purchases, refused to renegotiate swine prices, and reneged \non its promise to give Maxwell the same pricing and related economic benefits given \nto other suppliers .  Believing these steps w ere designed to force it out of business , \nMaxwell has sued Smithfield for sundry breaches of the output contract and for unfair \nand deceptive trade practices. \n2. Smithfield has moved to dismiss most of the pending  claims.  For the \nfollowing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion. \nMaxwell Foods, LLC v. Smithfield Foods, Inc., 2021 NCBC 50. \nBrooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard, L.L.P., by Reid L. \nPhillips, Charles E. Coble, Eric M. David, Amanda S. Hawkins, and \nShepard D. O’Connell, for Plaintiff Maxwell Foods, LLC.\n1 \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A., by Robert E. Harrington, Ethan R. \nWhite, and Mark A. Hiller, for Defendant Smithfield Foods, Inc. \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion to dismiss.  The \nfollowing background assumes that the amended complaint’s allegations are true. \n4. Smithfield is the largest pork producer in the world, processing  over six \nbillion pounds annually.  On the East Coast alone, it owns and operates thre e \nplants—one in Virginia and two in North Carolina—that together process over 55,000 \nhogs per day.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10–12, ECF No. 7.)  Smithfield sources hogs from \nhundreds of its own farms and from many independent suppliers, including Maxwell.  \n(See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 14, 15.) \n5. The production sales agreement (“PSA”) between Smithfield and Maxwell \ndates back to the mid-1990s and is still in effect.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 7, 8, 16, 28; see also \nAm. Compl. Ex. 1  [“PSA”].)2  It  is an output contract .  Subject to adjustments and \nconditions that are not relevant for present purposes,  Smithfield must buy all \n \n1 After this motion was fully briefed, Ms. O’Connell moved for leave to withdraw as counsel \nfor Maxwell, which the Court granted.  (ECF No. 32.) \n2 Maxwell Foods, LLC, the plaintiff here, is the successor-in-interest to Maxwell Foods, Inc., \nthe party to the PSA.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 2, 16; PSA, Preamble.) \n“Market Swine”—up to 155,000 per month—produced by Maxwell in Virginia and the \nCarolinas.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 16, 21–23; PSA ¶¶ 1(e), 3(a).) \n6. Pricing figured heavily in the parties’ negotiations  over the PSA and is the \nseed of their current dispute.  The parties agreed to a per-pound purchase price equal \nto “Market Value” plus or minus various premiu ms, discounts, and credits.  (PSA \n¶¶ 1(f), 5(b).)  Market Value is tied to the average daily price quoted for hogs sold on \nthe Iowa-Southern Minnesota spot market.  (PSA ¶ 1(b).)  Readers may wonder why \nthe agreement looks to  a market in the Midwest  for hog sales in the Southeast .  At \nthe time of the PSA, spot market transactions (also called negotiated sales) were \nprevalent in the hog trade.   ( See Am. Compl. ¶  38.)  Maxwell and Smithfield chose \nthe Iowa-Southern Minnesota spot market “to establish a relatively stable national \nmarket price” as the basis for calculating Market Value.  (PSA ¶ 1(b).)  Recognizing \nthat the marketplace might change , they agreed to “designate a substitute basis ” if \nthe Iowa-Southern Minnesota market ever ceased to be viable, backed by a “ right to \nsubmit the matter to arbitration” should  they fail to reach an agreement .  ( PSA \n¶ 1(b).) \n7. Maxwell also demanded assurances that Smithfield would not treat it less \nfavorably than Smithfield’s other major suppliers.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 18, 19.)  Just \none day after inking the PSA, the parties  signed a letter agreement with additional \nterms, including a  “most-favored-nation” clause.  (Am. Compl. ¶  28; see also  Am. \nCompl. Ex. 2 [“Letter Agrmt.”].)  Smithfield represented that the PSA gave Maxwell \n“the same economic incentives (including any Grade and Yield Matrix) as given all of \nSmithfield Foods’ other major swine suppliers”  and further agreed to offer Maxwell \n“the benefit of future changes in economic benefits given said major swine suppliers” \nduring the PSA’s term.  A handwritten annotation  states that Smithfield’s “[ m]ajor \nswine suppliers include Carroll’s Foods, Inc., Murphy Family Farms, Inc., and \nPrestage Farms, Inc.”  (Letter Agrmt. ¶ 1; see also Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 30, 32.) \n8. Nearly twenty-seven years have elapsed since the PSA was signed.  In that \ntime, the national hog market has seen immense change.  There are fewer hog farms, \ndue in part to industry consolidation.  There are also fewer  negotiated sales, falling \nfrom sixty percent of all hog sales in 1994 to twelve percent in 2004 to less than two \npercent in 2021.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 37, 39–41.)  Thinly traded spot markets are, as \nalleged, “easily manipulated” by pork processors.  (Am. Compl. ¶  46.)  This has \nchanged the way the industry does business.  As the number of negotiated sales has \ndwindled, the number of  marketing agreements between proce ssors and suppliers \nhas swelled.  Those looking for a reliable  base price for their marketing agreements \nnow favor index pricing and wholesale (or “cut out”) pricing over spot market prices.  \n(See Am. Compl. ¶ 47.) \n9. Smithfield was “a leader” in the “effort” to consolidate the hog market.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 37.)  It expanded its own hog -farming operations and acquired two of its \nmajor suppliers , Carroll’s and Murphy .  ( See Am. Compl. ¶¶  42–45.)  These \nacquisitions, according to Maxwell,  have made Smithfie ld the “dominant pork \nprocessor in the Southeast” —so dominant that it “controls the market  for hog \nprocessors in the Southeast” and wields “monopoly buyer power.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 50, \n87, 88.)  Likewise, vertical integration allows Smithfield to control much of its pork \nproduction from top to bottom, beginning with breeding and ending with processing \nand packing.  (See Am. Compl. ¶ 14.) \n10. Smithfield’s success is Maxwell’s sorrow.   Indeed, Maxwell believes th at \nSmithfield has used its market power to manipulate the Iowa -Southern Minnesota \nspot market and depress swine prices.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 88.)  By 2017, volume \nat the Iowa-Southern Minnesota market  dropped to the point that it ceased to be  \nviable.  (See Am. Compl. ¶  52.)  As a direct consequence, t he PSA “no longer yield s \npricing that allows Maxwell to operate at a profit.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 48.)  Maxwell has \nrepeatedly proposed a substitute basis for determining Market Value in the PSA, but \nSmithfield has rejected its proposals and refused to negotiate .  ( See Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 59–67.) \n11. That is not how Smithfield has dealt with its other major suppliers.  At some \npoint (the amended complaint does not say  when), Maxwell learned that Smithfield \nhad given other major suppliers (the amended complaint does not say which)  better \nterms, such as inde x or cut out pricing .  ( See Am. Compl. ¶¶  68, 81–83.)  Maxwell \nfurther alleges that Smithfield stopped sharing  production and sales information \nwith its major suppliers in 2016 —information that might have revealed  its \ndiscriminatory pricing practices.  ( See Am. Compl. ¶  55.)  Confronted by  Maxwell, \nSmithfield did not deny  the charge that it had given other suppliers  better terms.  \n(See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 84, 85; Am. Compl. Ex. 3.) \n12. The relationship between Maxwell and Smithfield deteriorated  just as the \nCOVID-19 pandemic began to unfold.  In April 2020, without invoking the PSA’s force \nmajeure provisions, Smithfield halved its purchases from Maxwell.  (See Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 70–72.)  Maxwell alleges that Smithfield could have continued buying  the entire \noutput but chose to maximize purchases from  its own affiliate s instead.  ( See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 75, 79.)  Because Smithfield is the only processor “with the capacity to \nhandle Maxwell’s production,” Maxwell faced a backup of hogs , had  to reduce its \noutput, and has since begun winding down its business entirely.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 50, \n72–78, 86.) \n13. This suit followed.  The original complaint included claims for breach of the \nmost-favored-nation clause and breach of the output requirement.  It also claimed \nthat Smithfield breached a duty to renegotiate the PSA’s pricing formula  once the \nIowa-Southern Minnesota spot market was no longer viable.   After  Smithfield \nunsuccessfully tried to remove the case  to federal court , Maxwell amended its \ncomplaint to add  a claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. \n§ 75-1.1 based partly on  allegations that Smithfield “abused its monopoly buyer \npower” in an effort “to target Maxwell unfairly and to force Maxwell out of the hog \nbusiness.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 88.)  Smithfield cited the new claim as grounds to designate \nthis action  as a mandatory complex business case, which  Maxwell opposed .  The \ndesignation was upheld, though, “[b]ecause there exists a material issue of antitrust \nlaw that must be resolved to litigate Maxwell’s claim arising under section 75 -1.1.”  \nMaxwell Foods, LLC v. Smithfield Foods, Inc. , 2021 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *6 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Apr. 13, 2021) (Bledsoe, C.J.) (located at ECF No. 20). \n14. Now, Smithfield has moved to dismiss three of the four pending claims under \nRule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  (ECF No. 21.)  The \nmotion has been fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing on 21 May 2021.  Th is \nmatter is ripe for resolution. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n15. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion “tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint.”  \nIsenhour v. Hutto, 350 N.C. 601, 604 (1999) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \nThe motion should be granted only when “(1)  the complaint on its face reveals that \nno law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence \nof facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that \nnecessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. \n605, 615 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \n16. In deciding the motion, the Court must treat the well-pleaded allegations of \nthe complaint as true and view the facts and permissible inferences in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party.  Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc.  (Sykes), 372 \nN.C. 326, 332 (2019); CommScope Credit Union v. Butler & Burke, LLP, 369 N.C. 48, \n51 (2016).  Exhibits to the complaint are deemed to be part of it and may also be \nconsidered, see Krawiec v. Manly, 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018), but the Court need not \naccept as true any “conclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact,” Wray v. \nCity of Greensboro, 370 N.C. 41, 46 (2017) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n17. Smithfield challenges the  claims for breach of the most -favored-nation \nclause, breach of the duty to negotiate, and violation of section 75-1.1.  The Court will \naddress each claim in turn. \nA. Most-Favored-Nation Clause \n18. Maxwell alleges that Smithfield breached the most-favored-nation clause by \ngiving other major swine suppliers better terms, including a more favorable pricing \nformula.  ( See Am. Compl. ¶¶  94–102.)  Smithfield argues that this clause  is \nunenforceable because it is hopelessly vague and indefinite.  (See Br. in Supp. 6–13, \nECF No. 22.) \n19. Definiteness is an aspect of contract formation.   “It is essential to the \nformation of any contract that there be mutual assent of the parties to the terms of \nthe agreement so as to establish a meeting of the minds.”  Creech v. Melnik, 347 N.C. \n520, 527 (1998) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  The terms “must be definite \nand certain or capable of being made so.”  Horton v. Humble Oil & Refin . Co., 255 \nN.C. 675, 679 (1961) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  “When an agreement \nis ‘so vague and indefinite that it is not possible to collect from it the full intent of the \nparties,’ then there was no true meeting of the minds, and the agreement ‘ is void.’ ”  \nEpic Chophouse, LLC v. Morasso , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 101, at * 7–8 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nSept. 8, 2020) (quoting Holder v. Home Mortg. Co., 214 N.C. 128, 133 (1938)). \n20. There are good  reasons for this rule.  Because contracts are consensual  \narrangements, it is up to the parties to define their material rights and obligations.  \nWhen they haven’t, “neither the court nor the jury can make an agreement for” them.  \nHolder, 214 N.C. at 133 (citation and quotation marks omitted) .  Incomplete  and \nincomprehensible agreements also pose a practical problem: “a court cannot enforce \na contract unless it can determine what it is.”  F. Indus., Inc. v. Cox , 45 N.C. App. \n595, 599 (1980) (cleaned up); see also Boyce v. McMahan, 285 N.C. 730, 734 (1974). \n21. But “[t]he law does not favor the destruction of contracts on account of \nuncertainty.”  Chew v. Leonard, 228 N.C. 181, 185 (1947).  If the parties’ intent “can \nbe ascertained,” the Court should, “if possible, so construe the contract as to carry \ninto effect” that intent.  Id.  (citations and quotation marks omitted).  Parties \npresumably intend that their agreements will be effective.  Demanding perfect clarity \nwould frustrate that intent, make it harder to draft contracts, and render contractual \nrelationships less certain rather than more.  Courts “must take language as it is and \npeople as they are.  All agreements have some degree of indefiniteness and some \ndegree of uncertainty.”  Carolina Helicopter Corp. v. Cutter Realty Co., 263 N.C. 139, \n146 (1964) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Indefiniteness is fatal only when \nthe court cannot reasonably ascertain what was intended “from the language used, \nconstrued with reference to the circumstances surrounding the making of the \ncontract.”  Welsh v. N. Telecom, Inc., 85 N.C. App. 281, 290 (1987).\n3 \n \n3 Although both parties appear to agree that the PSA is governed by the Uniform Commercial \nCode, neither discussed it in any depth.  The Code is arguably more tolerant of vagueness \nthan the common law.  See, e.g., N.C.G.S. § 25-2-204(3) (“Even though one or more terms are \nleft open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to \nmake a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.”); \nid. § 25-2-202(a) (stating that contract terms “may be explained or supplemented by course \n22. The most-favored-nation clause is hardly so vague as to defy understanding.  \nSmithfield assured Maxwell that the PSA gave it “the same economic incentives” as \ngiven all “other major swine suppliers” and promised to offer Maxwell “the benefit of \nfuture changes in economic benefits given said major swine suppliers during the term \nof this contract.”  (Letter Agrmt. ¶  1.)  T he undeniable intent was to ensure that \nSmithfield would treat Maxwell just as well as similarly situated suppliers.  Clauses \nlike this one are both common and commonly enforced.  See State ex rel. Utils. Comm’n \nv. Eddleman, 320 N.C. 344, 376 (1987) ( observing that the “clear intent” of a most-\nfavored-nation cl ause was to “ to equalize the net monetary  benefits” for the \ncontracting party and another similarly situated party).4 \n23. Smithfield frets that the phrase “economic benefits” is boundless and could \ninclude any term in the PSA —pricing, of course, but also length of term , limits on \nassignability, and even choice of law.   Without a definition in the PSA , Smithfield \n \nof performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade”); Carolina Builders Corp. v. Howard -\nVeasey Homes, Inc., 72 N.C. App. 224, 228 (1985). \n4 See also, e.g. , DeLoach v. Lorillard Tobacco Co. , 391 F.3d 551, 555 (4th Cir. 2004) \n(construing clause in settlement agreement that provided that defendants’ obligations “would \nbe ‘no less favorable’ to them ‘than those terms agreed to’ ” in any later settlement plaintiffs \nmight reach with another co -defendant); Albertini v. Warner Music Grp. Corp. , 2008 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 103878, at *2, *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2008) (concluding that most-favored-nation \nclause was “neither ambiguous nor reasonably subject to more than one interpretation” when \nit provided that employee would  “be treated no less favorably than”  another), aff’d, 351 F. \nApp’x 547 (2d Cir. 2009); Eveleth Taconite Co. v. Minn. Power & Light Co., 301 Minn. 20, 27 \n(1974) (“In our judgment, there is little doubt that the parties intended that the most-favored-\nnations clause would protect plaintiff from being placed in a noncompetitive position by \nprovisions in its contracts with defendant . . . which were less advantageous than provisions \nits competitors might be granted by defendant at a later time during the agreed- upon span \nof plaintiff's contracts.”); Hyatt v. Al Jazeera Am. Holdings II, LLC, 2016 Del. Ch. LEXIS 57, \nat *29 n.54 (Del. Ch. Mar. 31, 2016) (“Generally speaking, ‘MFN provisions’ are undertakings \nthat the contracting party will be treated at least as well as other [parties] similarly \nsituated.”). \ncontends, the parties and the Court are left “to guess” at what is and isn’t an economic \nbenefit.  (Br. in Supp. 8.) \n24. The uncertainty, if any, is not insoluble.  The words “economic” and “benefit” \nare neither technical nor obscure.  They might be broad, but it would be a mistake to \nequate breadth with ambiguity , much less indefiniteness .  Besides, contract terms \nare not construed in isolation but “as a whole.”  State v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 359 \nN.C. 763, 773 (2005).  The surrounding text  obviates much of the guesswork  by \npointing to the “ economic incentives” given to  “other major suppliers”—three are \nnamed—as benchmarks for comparison and by specifying the PSA’s “Grade and Yield \nMatrix” as one of those incentives, (Letter Agrmt. ¶  1).  See Welsh, 85 N.C. App. at \n291 (construing “company benefits” with r eference to company polic ies and \nretirement plan); La Tortilleria, Inc. v. Nuestro Queso, LLC , 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n43344, at *8 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 31, 2014) ( construing “equivalent pricing” and \n“comparable quality”  by using “ a clear benchmark for comparison” in contract ), \nR. & R. adopted, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94315 (July 11, 2014). \n25. Smithfield objects that “economic incentives” and “economic benefits” cannot \nbe the same  because contracting parties ordinarily intend different words to have \ndifferent meanings.  (See Br. in Supp. 8 (citing Hunter v. Town of Mocksville, 897 F.3d \n538, 552 (4th Cir. 2018) ).)  Here , though, the context suggests that the terms are \ninterchangeable.  And in any event,  canons of construction are tools, not absolutes.   \nSmithfield uncouples incentives and benefits as a means to destroy the most-favored-\nnation clause, not to construe it.  Yet the aim  of contract construction is for “every \nprovision . . . to be given effect.”  Singleton v. Haywood Elec. Membership Corp. , 357 \nN.C. 623, 629 (2003).  When contr act language “is susceptible of two meanings, one \nof which will destroy it or render it invalid, the former will be adopted so as to uphold \nthe contract.”  Torrey v. Cannon , 171 N.C. 519, 521 (1916)  (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted); accord Slocumb v. Raleigh, Charlotte & S. R .R. Co., 165 N.C. 338, \n341 (1914). \n26. Regardless, it is rare to hold a contract void for vagueness at the pleading \nstage.  This is because extrinsic evidence, such as “preliminary negotiations and \nsurrounding circumstances,” may “explain and clarify the contract’s terms.”  Thomco \nRealty, Inc. v. Helms, 107 N.C. App. 224, 227– 28 (1992).  Maxwell has alleged that \n“economic benefits” were “understood and intended by the parties” to include “the \npricing of hogs, the market or index that served as the base price for hogs, the Market \nValue, the Average Terminal Price, and the Grade and Yield Matrix.” 5  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 33.)  These allegations must be taken as true, and Maxwell is entitled to discovery \nand a chance to  prove its preferred interpretation .  See Boyce, 285 N.C. at 734 (“In \nthe usual case, the question whether an agreement is complete or partial is left to \ninference or further proof.”); Epic Chophouse, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 101, at *8 (“Usually, \nwhether there was a meeting of the minds is a question of fact.”). \n27. The Court has considered Smithfield’s remaining arguments and finds them \nequally unpersuasive.  The phrase “benefit of future changes” is no less definite than \n \n5 To Smithfield’s dismay, Maxwell goes on to say that the contemplated economic benefits \nalso include “any other economic benefits.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 33.)  This sort of circularity won’t \ndo at trial, but a little lenity is allowed in the pleadings. \n“economic benefits” for essentially the same reasons .  Indeed,  courts often describe \nthe purpose of most -favored-nation clauses using similar language .  See, e.g., Cent. \nStates, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. Reebie Storage & Moving Co. , 815 F. Supp. \n1131, 1135 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (describing clause to mean that “if I give somebody else a \nbetter deal at any point during the life of our contract, I promise to give you the \nbenefit of that better deal too”) ; Claassen v. City of Newton , 2015 Kan. App. Unpub. \nLEXIS 528, at *3 (Kan. Ct. App. June 26, 2015) (“Basically, a most favored nations \nprovision requires Party A to modify its contract with Party B to include more \nbeneficial terms Party A agrees to in later contracts with other parties.”). \n28. Last, with minimal explanation, Smithfield calls the most -favored-nation \nclause an unenforceable agreement to agree.  ( See Br. in Supp. 7.)  C ourts routinely \nrefuse to enforce mere letters of intent, statements of good faith, and other \npreliminary arrangements that leave material terms open to future negotiations.  \nSee, e.g., Boyce, 285 N.C. at 734.  This clause is none of those.  Smithfield is not subject \nto terms it cannot anticipate or to an indefinite obligation to agree to something in \nthe future.  Rather, it has a fixed and final obligation to offer Maxwell the economic \nbenefits given to other major sup pliers.  Nothing about that is left to future \nagreement. \n29. The Court therefore denies Smithfield’s motion to dismiss Maxwell’s claim \nfor breach of the most-favored-nation clause. \nB. Duty to Negotiate \n30. According to Maxwell, the parties were required to negotiate in good faith to \nestablish a new basis for determining Market Value once  the Iowa -Southern \nMinnesota spot market ceased to be viable.  Maxwell claims that Smithfield breached \nthe PSA by  refusing to negotiate.  ( See Am. Compl. ¶¶  104–10.)  Smit hfield argues \nthat it did not breach any duty to negotiate because none exists.  ( See Br. in Supp. \n13–18.) \n31. Contracts sometimes include express promises to negotiate additional terms \nin good faith.   These promises may be enforceable, and depending on the \ncircumstances, allegations that one party refused to negotiate might support a claim \nfor breach of contract.  See Recurrent Energy Dev. Holdings, LLC v. SunEnergy1, LLC, \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *43–47 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 7, 2017) (addressing express \nagreement to “use best efforts to negotiate [the anticipated transaction] in good \nfaith”); New Friendship Used Clothing Collection, LLC v. Katz , 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n72, at *40– 44 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017) (addressing express agreement “to \nnegotiate in good faith the terms of the acquisition that remained open”). \n32. Not so here.  The PSA  requires the parties to “designate” a new basis for \ndetermining Market Value.  It then allows either party to compel arbitration for that \npurpose beginning sixty days after the Iowa-Southern Minnesota spot market ceases \nto be viable.  (See PSA ¶ 1(b).)  Missing is any promise to negotiate the new basis in \ngood faith. \n33. Maxwell argues that the  duty to negotiate  is implied because the PSA \nrequires designation of a new  basis for Market Value by mutual agreement and no \nmutual agreement is possible absent negotiations.  This is unpersuasive for two \nreasons.  First, the parties expressly agreed to a rbitrate their disagreements, not to \nnegotiate them.  The Court must construe the PSA as written, leaving out “imagined \nterms” that the parties could have included but did not.  Morrell v. Hardin Creek, \nInc., 371 N.C. 672, 686 (2018).   Second , Maxwell conceded at the hearing that the \nbare promise to designate a new basis—unlike the agreement to arbitrate—is itself a \nnonbinding agreement to agree.  No duty to negotiate arises from a mere agreement \nto agree.  See Insight Health Corp. v. Marquis Diagnostic Imaging of N.C., LLC, 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 77, at  *6–19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 7, 2016) ; Comput. Design & \nIntegration, LLC v. Brown, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 216, at *61– 65 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. \n10, 2018); Remi Holdings, LLC v. IX WR 3023 HSBC Way L.P. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS \n110, at *16–19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 12, 2016). \n34. Furthermore, the only case that has recognized an implied duty to negotiate \nhad “unique facts.”  RREF BB Acquisitions, LLC v. MAS Props., L.L.C. , 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 61, at *57 (N.C. Super. Ct.

There, the Court “ did not imply a \nduty to negotiate in good faith based on the terms” of the agreement at issue but \nconcluded that there was a question of fact as to “whether the parties had entered \ninto an agreement to continue negotiating in good  faith” based on  their conduct.  \nInsight Health, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 77, at *8–10 (discussing RREF’s unique facts and \nnarrow holding).  Nothing of the sort is alleged here.  Maxwell points only to the terms \nof the PSA, not to any conduct by the parties.  Indeed, Maxwell alleges that Smithfield \nrebuffed all overtures—the opposite of an implied agreement to negotiate. \n35. In short, the PSA does not impose a duty to negotiate in good faith to \nestablish a substitute basis for determining Market Value.  T he Court therefore \ngrants Smithfield’s motion to dismiss the claim for breach of the duty to negotiate. \nC. Section 75-1.1 \n36. The last claim at issue is for violation of N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.  To state a claim, \na plaintiff must allege that “(1) defendant committed a n unfair or deceptive act or \npractice, (2)  the action in question was in or affecting commerce, and (3)  the act \nproximately caused injury to the plaintiff.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 656 (2001).  \n“The determination as to whether an act is unfair or deceptive is a question of law for \nthe court.”  Id. \n37. Maxwell asserts two theories: one that it calls a “ ‘direct’ or ‘pure’ unfairness \nclaim” based on Smithfield’s alleged abuse of market power , (Opp’n 22, ECF No. 26; \nsee also Am. Compl. ¶ 127), and another based on Smithfield’s alleged breaches of the \nPSA, (see Am. Compl. ¶  128).  Smithfield argues that neither is unfair or deceptive \nwithin the meaning of the statute.  (See Br. in Supp. 18–29.) \n1. Unfair Use of Market Power \n38. The premise of Maxwell’s first theory is that Smithfield abused its “position \nin the market” to “creat[e] the conditions that made the hog business economically \nunsustainable for Maxwell.”  (Am. Compl. ¶  126.)  Thanks to “aggressive vertical \nintegration” and “industry consolidation,” Smithfield is th e “dominant processor in \nthe Southeast” and “substantially controls the market.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶  14, 37, 39, \n44, 46, 50, 87, 88, 90, 93, 124, 127.)  Possessing  “monopoly buyer power,” Smithfield \nhas “manipulate[d] the Iowa-Southern Minnesota spot market” and “exert[ed] undue \ninfluence over the entire negotiated market.”   (Am. Compl. ¶¶  46, 88, 125.)  These \nactions drove down prices, putting severe “economic pressure” on Maxwell.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 48, 51, 53, 88, 90, 124, 127.)  Smithfield the n used its levera ge to force \nMaxwell out of business while giving  better pricing to other  suppliers, including its \naffiliates.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 50, 51, 69, 80, 88, 90.) \n39. Although Maxwell tries to deny it, there’s no serious question that these are \nallegations of anti trust misconduct.  A m onopoly on the buyer side of a market —\nwhich is what Maxwell alleges —is known as a monopsony.  In a monopsony , “the \nbuyers have market power to decrease market demand for a product and thereby \nlower prices.”  Buccaneer Energy (USA) Inc. v. Gunnison Energy Corp., 846 F.3d 1297, \n1315 (10th Cir. 2017) (quoting Campfield v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 532 F.3d \n1111, 1118 (10th Cir. 2008)).\n6  Actual and attempted monopsonies are prohibited both \nby state and federal antitrust laws.  See N.C.G.S. § 75-2.1; 15 U.S.C. § 2. \n40. It’s also clear that Maxwell has not alleged all that is needed to state a valid \nmonopsony claim.  Without rebuttal, Smithfield showed that the amended complaint \nlacks essential elements, including the “possession of monopoly power in the relevant \n \n6 Monopoly claims usually involve allegations that a seller acquired market power so as to \nrestrict output and raise prices.  “[A] monopsony is to the buy side of the market what a \nmonopoly is to the sell side and is sometimes colloquially called a ‘buyer’s monopoly.’  ”  \nWeyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 320 (2007) (citation \nand quotation marks omitted); see also Sykes, 372 N.C. at 330 n.2 (describing a monopsony \nas “a market situation in which one buyer controls the market” (citation and quotation marks \nomitted)). \nmarket” and the “willful acquisition or maintenance” of that power.  Sykes v. Health \nNetwork Sols., Inc. , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *60 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017) \n(quoting Oksanen v. Page Mem’l Hosp., 945 F.2d 696, 710 (4th Cir. 1991)), aff’d by an \nequally divided court, 372 N.C. 326 (2019). \n41. The upshot is that Maxwe ll’s sectio n 75 -1.1 claim is based on antitrust \nallegations that fall short of an antitrust violation.  According to Smithfield, that ends \nthe matter, and the claim must be dismissed. \n42. The Court agrees.  When a plaintiff alleges monopolistic misconduct as the \nbasis for overlapping antitrust and section 75-1.1 claims, “the failure of the antitrust \nclaim also defeats liability under section 75-1.1.”  SiteLink Software, LLC v. Red Nova \nLabs, Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *32 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 14, 2016);  see also, \ne.g., Sykes, 372 N.C. at 333 (affirming dismissal of section 75- 1.1 claim premised on \n“the same conduct that is the subject of” deficient antitrust claims ); Sykes v. Blue \nCross & Blue Shield of N.C. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 28, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 5, \n2018) (dismissing section 75-1.1 claim based on deficient antitrust allegations), aff’d, \n372 N.C. 318 (2019) ; Drs. Making Housecalls -Internal Med., P.A. v. Onsite Care, \nPLLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 16, 2019) (same); R . J. \nReynolds Tobacco Co. v. Philip Morris Inc., 199 F. Supp. 2d 362, 396 (M.D.N.C. 2002) \n(same), aff’d per curiam, 67 F. App’x 810 (4th Cir. 2003). \n43. It makes no difference that Maxwell chose not to pair its section 75-1.1 claim \nwith a matching antitrust claim.  What matters is the claim’s substance, not its label.  \nChief Judge Bledsoe  made this clear when he overruled  Maxwell’s opposition to \ndesignation of this case to the Business Court.  Maxwell argued at that time that it \nhad not raised an issue of antitrust law because it had not asserted a claim under the \nantitrust statutes.   Chief Judge Bledsoe d isagreed, concluding  that Maxwell \n“otherwise invoked state or federal antitrust law by alleging that Smithfield’s \nmonopolistic misconduct serves a s the basis for its claim under section 75 -1.1.”  \nMaxwell Foods, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *5– 6 (citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  As he put it, even without an independent antitrust claim, “there exists a \nmaterial issue of antitrust law that must be resolved  to litigate Maxwell’s claim \narising under section 75-1.1.”  Id. at *6 (emphasis added). \n44. That issue can now be resolved on the pleadings.  It is uncontested that \nMaxwell’s allegations of monopolistic misconduct, even if taken as true, do not show \na violation of the antitrust laws.  Neither do they support liability under section \n75-1.1. \n45. Maxwell maintains that Smithfield’s exploitation of market power , even if \nnot monopolistic, amounts to “an inequitable assertion of its power or position” under \nsection 75-1.1.  (Opp’n 20 (quoting Krebs v. Charlotte Sch. of L., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n143060, at *28 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 5, 2017)).)  But North Carolina courts have rejected \nsimilar arguments  based on the principle that,  “[i]n the absence of conspiracy or \nmonopoly, one may deal with whom he pleases.”  Tel. Servs., Inc. v . Gen. Tel. Co. of \nthe S., 92 N.C. App. 90, 93 (1988) (quoting United Artists Records, Inc. v. E. Tape \nCorp., 19 N.C. App. 207, 214 (1973)), review denied, 324 N.C. 251 (1989). \n46. In Telephone Services,  a telecommunications common carrier removed a  \ncontractor from its list of providers for installation and repair services.   This \neffectively eliminated the contractor from the market.  See id. at 91.  Seeking relief \nunder section 75 -1.1, the contractor alleged that the carrier had “monopoly status” \nand had “unfairly us[ed] its position of power ” to force the contractor out of the \nmarket.  Id. at 93.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the allegations of monopoly \npower were inadequate and that, absent a monopoly , the carrier’s exclusion of the \ncontractor was not an unfair assertion of power.  See id. at 93–94. \n47. This Court followed suit  in Thompson Installations, Inc. v. Stock Building \nSupply, LLC , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 21, 2012).  That case \ninvolved an installation and supply contract.  Although the contract was \nnonexclusive, the defendant instructed the plaintiff not to perform installation s for \nits competitors and threatened to terminate the contract if the plaintiff refused.  The \nplaintiff sue d for breach of contract and unfair trade practices , alleging \nanticompetitive coercion but “no monopoly or attempted monopoly by Defendant.”  Id. \nat *12.   Relying on Telephone Services, this Court concluded that the defendant’s \nactions were not unfair within the meaning of section 75 -1.1 “regardless of [its] \npotentially anti-competitive intent.”  Id. at *14. \n48. To be clear, it is possible to plead and prove an inequitable assertion of \nposition or power that is not based on an abuse of market or monopoly power.  Plenty \nof cases have upheld section 75 -1.1 liability when the circumstances involve fraud, \nwrongful retention of property, and abuse of overmatched consumers  by well-heeled \ninstitutions.  See, e.g., Nash Hosps., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 254 N.C. \nApp. 726, 738 (2017)  (involving insurer’s conduct that “effectively deprived [the \nplaintiff] of the funds to which [it] was entitled by law”); Faucette v. 6303 Carmel \nRoad, LLC , 242 N.C. App. 267, 276 (2015)  (“Defendants abused their positions of \npower to withhold payment of the money [plaintiff] legally was owed, solely to \npressure [plaintiff] to resolve several unrelated disputes . . . .”).7 \n49. This is not such a case.  Maxwell accuses Smithfield of crafting a scheme to \nput it out of business, but the alleged scheme depends on the existence and misuse of \nmonopoly power, not fraud or conversion  of property.  And these parties are  large, \nsophisticated companies dealing at arms’ length. \n50. Maxwell also suggests that Smithfield had all the power in the parties’ \nrelationship, making it s conduct unfair .  Again , though, the alleged source of \nSmithfield’s power in its relationship with Maxwell is its monopoly power and control \nof the market.  Without the monopoly allegations, Smithfield’s actions are not unfair \nwithin the meaning of section 75-1.1.  See Thompson, 2012 NCBC LEXIS 12, at *14.  \nMaxwell has not cited any decision in which a court has upheld a section 75-1.1 claim \nbased on an alleged imbalance of power between two sophisticated companies in an \narms’-length contractual relationship even when the “economic fate” of one is tied to \nthe other.  Sara Lee Corp. v. Quality Mfg., Inc., 61 F. App’x 836, 839 –40 (4th Cir. \n \n7 See also, e.g., Moose v. Allegacy Fed. Credit Union, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 47, at *11–13 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. May 5, 2021) (involving a consumer adhesion contract); Hamm v. Blue Cross & \nBlue Shield of N.C., 2010 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 27, 2010) (“Conduct \nby an insurance company that manifests an inequitable assertion of  power or position also \nconstitutes an unfair trade practice. ” (citation and quotation marks omitted)); Gray v. N.C. \nIns. Underwriting Ass’n, 352 N.C. 61, 68–73 (2000) (involving insurance carrier conduct). \n2003) (concluding that party did not act unfairly or deceptively by imposing “onerous \nand one -sided” agreement on supplier , threat ening to terminate  exclusive \nrelationship, and ending relationship in favor of performing supplier’s duties \nin-house). \n51. In sum, Maxwell  has not adequately alleged monopolistic misconduct by \nSmithfield.  Nor has it alleged any other basis to support its “direct”  unfairness \ntheory. \n2. Breach of Contract and Aggravating Circumstances \n52. As a second theory, Maxwell claims that Smithfield violated section 75 -1.1 \nby breaching the PSA.  Well-settled law holds otherwise. \n53. Our appellate courts have stressed that “a mere breach of contract, even if \nintentional, is not sufficiently unfair or deceptive to sustain an action under N.C.G.S. \n§ 75-1.1.”  Branch Banking & Tr . Co. v. Thompson, 107 N.C. App. 53, 62 (1992) ; see \nalso, e.g., SciGrip, Inc. v. Osae, 373 N.C. 409, 42 7 (2020); Broussard v. Meineke \nDiscount Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 347 (4th Cir. 1988) .  Something more is \nneeded.  There must be “egregious or aggravating circumstances” coupled with the \nbreach.  Dalton , 353 N.C. at 657 (citations and quotation marks omitted) ; see also \nSciGrip, 373 N.C. at 426–27; Bumpers v. Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 367 N.C. 81, 88 (2013). \n54. “As a general proposition, unfairness or ‘deception either in the formation of \nthe contract or i n the circumstances of its breach’ may establish the existence of \nsubstantial aggravating circumstances” under section 75 -1.1.  SciGrip, 373 N.C. at \n426 (quoting Bartolomeo v. S.B. Thomas, Inc., 889 F.2d 530, 535 (4th Cir. 1989)).  But \n“[i]t is far more difficult to allege and prove egregious circumstances after  the \nformation of the contract” because “ disputes concerning the circumstances of the \nbreach are often bound up with one party’s exercise of perceived rights and remedies \nunder the contract.”  Post v. Avita Drugs, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *10–11 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Oct. 11, 2017).  These claims are “best resolved by simply determining \nwhether the parties properly fulfilled their contractual duties.”   Heron Bay \nAcquisition, LLC v. Unite d Metal Finishing, Inc. , 245 N.C. App. 378, 383 (2016) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \n55. “Only where the circumstances of the breach exhibit clear deception are they \nsufficiently egregious to impose section 75-1.1 liability.”  Post, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 95, \nat *11.  This might include, for example, “the concealment of a breach combined with \nacts to deter further investigation.”  Id. at *12 (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \nA simple failure to disclose a breach , on the other hand, is not enough.  See Heron \nBay, 245 N.C. App. at 383 n.1; see also Post, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *11 (“A party’s \nthreats to terminate, efforts to encourage another to continue contractual \nperformance while planning to breach, and refusal  to otherwise meet contractual \nobligations do not rise to the level of aggravating circumstances. ” (citations and \nquotation marks omitted)). \n56. Maxwell’s allegations do not stack up.  Its claim for breach of the duty to \nnegotiate has been dismissed.  And it has not pointed to deception or other egregious \ncircumstances related to the alleged breach of the output provision.  ( See generally \nOpp’n 26–28.) \n57. As for the most-favored-nation clause, Maxwell argues that “Smithfield had \na duty to inform Maxwell of other economic benefits” given to major swine suppliers \nand that Smithfield hid that information to conceal its breach .  (Opp’n 27.)   It’s not \nclear what Maxwell means by a duty to inform  because the PSA does not expressly \nimpose any duty on Smithfield to disclose information to Maxwell  about other \nsuppliers.  In any event, whether Smithfield had an express or implied duty to inform \nMaxwell and whether it complied with such a duty are  simply contract question s, \nturning on the scope of each side’s rights and obligations under the PSA. \n58. More broadly, Maxwell has not alleged that Smithfield concealed its breach \nor took steps to deter investigation .  What the amended complaint alleges is that \nSmithfield voluntarily began sharing production and sales information with its \nsuppliers, including Maxwell, in 1994 and then stopped some twenty years later.  (See \nAm. Compl. ¶¶  54, 55.)  At no point does the amended complaint  allege that \nSmithfield provided false or misleading information, that it took affirmative steps to \nconceal or destroy information, or that Maxwell was prevented from making inquiries \nto police compliance with the most-favored-nation clause.  Likewise, Smithfield “has \nnot denied ” that it gave  other suppliers better terms , even when confronted by \nMaxwell.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 85.)  At most, these allegations show that Smithfield failed \nto disclose its breach , which is not sufficiently deceptive or egregious  to support \nliability under section 75 -1.1.  See Heron Bay, 245 N.C. App. at 383 n.1; see also  \nUnited Roasters, Inc. v. Colgate- Palmolive Co. , 649 F.2d 985, 992 (4t h Cir. 1981) \n(holding that no “unfairness inhered in the circumstances of the breac h within the \nmeaning of the statute simply because the breach was intentional and not promptly \ndisclosed”). \n59. Maxwell offers little else.   It contends that Smithfield “intentionally \ndeprived Maxwell of the benefit of the” most-favored-nation clause.  (Opp’n 27.)  Even \nassuming that Smithfield acted with ill will and with knowledge of how severe the \nharm would be to Maxwell , that’s just another way of saying that Smithfield \nintentionally breached the PSA .  See, e.g., Haddock v. Volunteers of Am., Inc. , 2021 \nNCBC LEXIS 70, at * 28–29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 25, 2021); Kerry Bodenhamer \nFarms, LLC v. Nature’s Pearl Corp. , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 27, at * 21–23 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Mar. 27, 2017); Flanders/Precisionaire Corp. v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Tr. Co., Nat’l \nAss’n, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 36, at *38 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 7, 2015); see also CF Indus., \nInc. v. Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., 448 F. Supp. 475, 485 (W.D.N.C. 1978) (“It can \nhardly be doubted that most, if not all,  . . . buyers who refuse delivery in a falling \nmarket do so intentionally, yet these ordinary commercial breaches are wholly foreign \nto the purposes of § 75-1.1.”). \n60. This is not “the unusual case in which the circumstances of the breach itself \nare egregious and deceptive.”  Post , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *13.   The PSA’s \n“terms—and not section 75-1.1—define the parties’ rights and obligations, as well as \nthe remedies for the alleged breaches.”  Id. at *16. \n* * * \n61. Neither of Maxwell’s theories states a claim for relief under section 75 -1.1.  \nThe Court therefore grants Smithfield’s motion to dismiss the claim. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n62. For all these reasons, the Court  GRANTS in part  and DENIES in part  \nSmithfield’s partial motion to dismiss and ORDERS as follows: \na. The Court GRANTS  the motion to dismiss  Maxwell’s second claim for \nbreach of the duty to negotiate.  The claim is dismissed with prejudice. \nb. The Court GRANTS  the motion to dismiss Maxwell’s fourth claim for \nviolation of N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.  In its discretion, the Court dismi sses the \nclaim without prejudice. \nc. In all other respects, the Court DENIES the motion. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 26th day of August, 2021. \n \n \n        /s/ Adam M. Conrad   \n      Adam M.
