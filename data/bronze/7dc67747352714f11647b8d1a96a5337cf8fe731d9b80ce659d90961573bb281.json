Harris, Pro se. \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \n4. This dispute arises within a large group of cases before this Court that have \nbeen consolidated into two files: In re Se. Eye Ctr.-Pending Matters (Wake County 15 \n \n7 The Nivison Parties are, collectively, Plaintiff Nivison Family Investments, LLC  (“NFI”), \nPlaintiff Old Battleground Properties, Inc. (“Old Battleground”), and Arthur Nivison.  \n \n8 (See Receiver’s Resp. Br. Opp’n Doug Harris Mot. Pursuant Rule 54 (Old Battleground v. \nCCSEA/Nivison v. Harris), ECF No. 1627; Nivison Parties’ Resp. Opp’n Douglas S. Harris’s \nMot. Reconsider, ECF No. 1624.)  \nCVS 1648) and In re Se. Eye Ctr.—Judgments (Guilford County 12 CVS 11322).  The \nextensive background of these cases is set forth in previous orders and opinions  of \nthis Court.9  \n5.  To provide context for the Court’s analysis and resolution of the Motion, the \nCourt finds it necessary to reproduce certain findings and conclusions from prior \norders and opinions in these actions which are now at issue.   \n6. As relevant here, on 28 April 2016, and upon Plaintiffs’ and the Receiver’s \nvarious motions, the Court entered the Settlement Approval Order and the JDPW \nReceivership Order.  The Settlement Approval Order provided, in relevant part, as \nfollows: \n19.  The Receiver has negotiated a settlement of the claim by the Nivison \nParties.  The terms of the Settlement provide for an allowed claim \nagainst CCSEA, DRE and KEPES\n10 of $4 million (the “Allowed Claim”) \nand an allowed claim against the JDPW Trust of $2.1 million, plus \naccrued interest and attorney’s fees, if the JDPW Trust is placed into \nReceivership with Gerald A. Jeutter, Jr. appointed as the Receiver.  Both \nof these allowed claims are less than half of the total amount sought by \nthe Nivison Parties against the Receivership Entities, Dr. Epes, Ms. \nEpes, and the JDPW Trust.\n11 \n \n \n9 See In re Se. Eye Ctr.—Pending Matters, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 29, at *3 –23 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMay 7, 2019); Jan. 2022 Am. Order, at *3–18; Order & Op. Def. Douglas S. Harris’s Mot. \nDismiss Pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. Rules 12(b)(1) & 12(h)(3) ¶¶  3–10, ECF No. 1683 (each \nreciting procedural background and citing prior orders). \n \n10 DRE and KEPES “were established to receive and hold substantially all of the assets of Dr. \nRichard Epes and his wife by Order of this Court.”  (Settlement Approval Order ¶ 2; see Order \nJoint. Mot. Approve Settlement Agreement & Release (All Matters), ECF No. 117.)  \n \n11 (Settlement Approval Order ¶ 19.)   \n \nHarris argues that the C ourt’s approval of the Settlement permitting a $2.1 million \nclaim against JDPW was  clearly erroneous and should be revised or rescinded \nbecause a “settlement between two parties basing their settlement upon the use of a \nthird party’s legal rights and property is not permitted by law.”12  \n7. The Settlement Approval Order further provided, in relevant part, as \nfollows: \n38. Doug Harris objects that the joint prosecution aspects of this \nSettlement result in a conflict of interest for the Receiver, if the Receiver \nis appointed as the Receiver of the JDPW Trust, and that the claims may \nbe circular due to indemnity claims by those from whom relief is sought \nin the joint prosecution.  In the event of such an appointment, the \nSettlement provides for allowance of a claim against the JDPW Trust in \nthe amount of $2.1 million, plus accrued interest and attorney’s fees.   \nThis amount is a substantial reduction in the amount sought from the \nJDPW Trust by the Nivison Parties.  The Settlement further provides \nthat the allowed claim will be assigned to KEPES.  As a result, upon \nentry of this Order approving the Settlement, the Receiver will not be in \na position to assert claims against the JDPW Trust while acting as \nReceiver for the JDPW Trust.  To the extent that Doug Harris or the \nCastle McCulloch Parties assert claims against Receivership Entities \nbased upon claims asserted by the JDPW Trust, any issues presented by \nthose claims can be addressed at that time in the context of actual, \ninstead of hypothetical, disputes.  These objections are OVERRULED in \nthe exercise of the Court’s discretion. \n \n**** \n \n 40. The Receiver is free to settle these disputed claims in the manner \nthat is most favorable to the Receivership Entities and those with valid \nlegal interests in the Receivership Entities and in the Receivership \nEntities’ assets.  The Receiver is not required to settle in the manner \nthat is most beneficial to other persons and entities who may be liable \nin whole or in part for the loan to the JDPW Trust or for damage that \noccurred in connection with that transaction.  To the contrary, the \napproach taken here seeks to maximize the recovery available to the \ncreditors of the Receivership Entities and represents sound business \n \n12 (Harris Mot. Reconsider ¶ 4.) \njudgment.  This objection is OVERRULED in the exercise of the Court’s \ndiscretion.  \n \n41. Doug Harris and Mr. McDaniel further object to the entire \nSettlement on the grounds of “bad math” and a litany of other reasons \nwhy an allowed claim of $4 million dollars is not justified on the facts as \nthey see them.  These objections reflect one side of the many disputed \nfactual contentions surrounding the transactions with the Nivison \nParties since 2012.  Disputes exist as to which version of the 3 \nSeptember 21, 2012 contract, if any, is a binding contract, whether a \ncontract was ever formed, whethe r consideration was provided for \nmodifications, whether material facts were misrepresented, whether \ndisclosures were full and adequate, whether property was owned by Dr. \nEpes or Ms. Epes, whether documents were signed by the person whose \nsignature purports  to be on the documents, and many other similar \nissues.  These are the types of heavily contested disputes, filled with \nuncertainties and complexities, from which settlements are born.  As a \nresult, these objections are OVERRULED in the exercise of the Cou rt’s \ndiscretion.  \n \n42. The Nivison Parties are pursuing their claims against the \nReceivership Entities with vigor and determination.  The proposed \nSettlement appears to the Court to be a better alternative than the \ncontinued expenditure of Receivership resources in an effort to \ndetermine each and every one of these disputed factual and legal claims. \nThe resolution reached is a reasonable middle ground among the \nmultiple potential outcomes.  Given that the Nivison Parties \nundisputedly provided several million dollars of value to the \nReceivership Entities and the JDPW Trust, for which they have not been \nrepaid, the result does not appear inequitable to the Court.  Accordingly, \nthis Objection is OVERRULED in the exercise of the Court’s \ndiscretion.\n13  \n \n8. The JDPW Receivership Order provided, in relevant part, as follows: \n4.  The Motion seeks appointment of a receiver to administer the assets \nthat JDPW Trust had in the past or which it currently has, citing the \nfact that JDPW Trust does not appear to be operating for the benefit of \nits beneficiary or its creditors.   As recited in the Motion, on September \n21, 2012, NFI loaned the sum of $2.1 million to JDPW Trust and these \nfunds were used to acquire, at a discount, loans and various instruments \nfrom NewBridge Bank.  These loans were made by NewBridge Bank or \n \n13 (Settlement Approval Order ¶¶ 38, 40–42.) \nits predecessor in interest to both the CCSEA Entities and HCM and \nCM.  Defendant Richard Harris is the brother of Defendant Doug Harris.  \nDefendant Richard Harris is the primary owner of HCM and CM.  Doug \nHarris negotiated with NewBridge Bank on behalf of the Castle \nMcCulloch Defendants, in particular his brother, Richard Harris, for \nsale of the loan documents to a third party purchaser, later identified as \nArthur Nivison, the principal of NFI, for set tlement of the total \noutstanding balance owed for a loa n extended to HCM and CM (the \n“Castle McCulloch Loan”) and three loans extended to the CCSEA \nEntities by NewBridge Bank (the “CCSEA Loans”).   It appears to the \nCourt that, upon receipt of $2.1 million, NewBridge Bank transferred \nits interest in all four loans to JDPW Trust, but JDPW Trust did not \nassign any of the loan documents from any of the four loans to NFI as \nNFI contends JDPW Trust promi sed to do.  It is undisputed that as of \nSeptember 21, 2012, the date the four loans were assigned by \nNewBridge Bank to JDPW Trust, the total amount owed to NewBridge \nBank on all four loans was approximately $3.4 million.  It is further \nundisputed that of the $3.4 million owed to NewBridge Bank, \napproximately $1.6 million was the outstanding balance on the Castle \nMcCulloch Loan.  \n \n**** \n \n7. It appears to the Court that the Castle McCulloch Defendants \nbenefited from the acquisition by JDPW Trust of the NewBridge Bank \nnotes because the notes were in default and Doug Harris, the Trustee of \nJDPW Trust, agreed to, and in fact did, forbear from collection of the \nnotes.  In sworn testimony, Doug Harris and JDPW Trust acknowledged \nthe indebtedness which it owes to NFI.  (Transcript – September 14, \n2014 hearing before the Honorable Paul C. Ridgeway.)  JDPW Trust \nclaims it has no assets to pay this debt, and appears to have been \ninsolvent at all relevant times.  Yet, Doug Harris has testified under \noath that JDPW Trust assigned the Castle McCulloch Loan documents \nto Defendant Richard Harris shortly after the September 21, 2012 \nclosing.  In addition, a release deed dated March 15, 2013, prepared by \nDoug Harris and recorded in the Guilford County Registry on April 14, \n2015, purports to release all of the Castle McCulloch real property from \nthe Castle McCulloch Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents and \nProfits granted to NewBridge Bank. (Exhibit YY –  Amended \nConsolidated Complaint.)  It appears to the Court that these actions \ndemonstrate that Doug Harris, as Trustee of JDPW Trust, has taken \naffirmative steps to rid JDPW Trust of substantial assets which would \notherwise have been available to pay the debt of JDPW Trust to NFI.  It \nfurther appears that such transactions benefitted Doug Harris, the \nTrustee of JDPW Trust, as well as his brother, Richard Harris, and his \nrelated companies.  It appears to the Court that, at the same time that \nDoug Harris was representing his brother, Richard Harris and JDPW \nTrust in these transactions with NewBridge Bank and Nivison and \nadverse to Dr. Epes, Mark McDaniel and CCSEA, Doug Harris also was \nsimultaneously representing Dr. Epes and CCSEA in litigation with Dr. \nHarriott. \n  \n**** \n \n12.  The Court perceives no conflict of interest in the Receiver of the \nCCSEA Entities serving as receiver for the JDPW Trust, provided that \nNFI is allowed a $2.1 million claim, plus interest and attorney’s fees, \nagainst the receivership estate of JDPW Trust.  Further, the Receiver \nalready has substantial knowledge regarding the facts and \ncircumstances regarding the transactions at issue, and therefore judicial \neconomy would be served by having him appointed as the receiver for \nJDPW Trust.\n14 \n \nHarris argues that the first sentence of paragraph 12 above is clear error and must \nbe revised or rescinded.15 \n9. The JDPW Receivership Order further provided that “[t] he Receiver of \nJDPW Trust is authorized to allow the claim of NFI against the receivership estate \nof JDPW Trust in the amount of $2.1 million, together with accrued interest, \nattorney’s fees and costs.”\n16  \n10. In its Amended Order and Opinion of 6 January 2022, the  Court described \nthe comprehensive settlement between the Receiver and the Nivison Parties and the \nallowance of the claim against JDPW as follows:  \n \n14 (JDPW Receivership Order, Findings Fact ¶¶ 4, 7, 12.)   \n \n15 (Harris Mot. Reconsider ¶ 5.) \n \n16 (JDPW Receivership Order, Order for Relief ¶ 5.) \n \n27.  Along with placing JDPW into receivership, the Court also approved \na settlement agreement between Plaintiffs, the Receivership Entities, \nand JDPW.  Among other things, the settlement allowed Plaintiffs a $2.1 \nmillion claim against JDPW, arising out of the Nivison Loan for the \nsame amount. ( See Ord. Approving Nivison Settlement & Related \nTransactions [“Ord. Approving Nivison Agrmt.”] at 8, ECF No. 471.)  \nThis represented a substantial reduction from the amount originally \nsought by Plaintiffs against JDPW.  (See Ord. Approving Nivison Agrmt. \n8.).\n17  \n \nHarris argues that the inclusion of JDPW at the end of the  first sentence of this \nparagraph is clear error and should be revised or rescinded.18 \n11. In its Jury Trial Order also issued on 6 January 2022, the Court determined \nthat “JDPW’s liability to Nivison has been established at $2.1 million plus accrued \ninterest, attorney’s fees, and costs and, as a result, no issue concerning the amount \nof JDPW’s liability to Nivison remains for determination by a jury.”19  Harris argues \nthat this determination constituted clear error and should be revised or rescinded  \nbecause it conflicts with the Court’s footnote 1 in its Order Amending Summary \nJudgment Order,20 which was also entered on 6 January 2022 and reads as follows: \n“The Court notes that both the Receiver, ( see ECF No. 1386 at 1– 2), and the Court \nassumed for purposes of the Receiver’s motion for partial summary judgment that \n \n17 (Jan. 2022 Am. Order ¶ 27.)   \n \n18 (Harris Mot. Reconsider ¶ 1.) \n \n19 (Jury Trial Order ¶ 5.) \n \n20 (Harris Mot. Reconsider ¶ 2.) \n \nthe Assignment Agreement document favored by Doug Harris was the operative \nAssignment Agreement.”21  \n12. Also relevant to Harris’s Motion are the following provisions of the Court’s \nJanuary 2022 Amended Order: \n140.  Monetary Judgment Against Doug Harris .  Second, the Court \ngrants JDPW’s request to enter a money judgment in JDPW’s favor \nagainst Doug Harris for: (i) the full amount JDPW owes to Plaintiffs on \nthe Nivison Loan and (ii) the $1.3 million due and payable on the CM \nNote over and above the $2.1 million JDPW borrowed under the Nivison \nLoan.  As already observed, the Court may “[c]ompel the trustee to \nredress a breach of trust by paying money, restoring property, or other \nmeans[.]”  N.C.G.S. §  36C-10-1001(b)(3); see also id . §  36C-10-1002(a) \n(“A trustee who commits a breach of trust is liable for the greater of: (1) \n[t]he amount required to restore the value of the trust property and trust \ndistributions to what they would have been had the breach not occurred; \nor (2) [t]he profit the trustee made by reason of the breach.”); id. § 36C-\n10-1010(b) (“A trustee is personally liable for torts committed in the \ncourse of administering a trust, or for obligations arising from \nownership or control of trust property . . . if the trustee is personally at \nfault.”). \n \n**** \n \n142.  In addition, JDPW is entitled to a monetary judgment against \nDoug Harris for the $1.3 million due and payable on the CM Note over \nand above the amount JDPW borrowed from Plaintiffs via the Nivison \nLoan.  Had Doug Harris not committed a breach by transferring away \nthe CM Note and Release Deed and failing to enforce JDPW’s rights to \nthe CM Loan, JDPW would not only have been able to repay the Nivison \nLoan, but it would have also profited from the CM Loan by receiving the \ndifference ($1.3 million) between what JDPW could have collected on the \nCM Loan and what it owed on the Nivison Loan.  But instead, Doug \nHarris arranged to receive that amount for himself personally through \nother channels, pursuant to the Epes and McDaniel Agreements.  Thus, \neven absent a breach of trust, Doug Harris may be held personally liable \nfor that amount.  See N.C.G.S. §  36C-10-1003(a) (“A trustee is \n \n21 (Order Am. Summ. J. Order (Old Battleground v. CCSEA) ¶ 7 n.1, ECF No. 1442.) \n \naccountable for any profit made by the trustee arising from the \nadministration of the trust, even absent a breach of trust.”).22  \n \nHarris argues that the Court’s conclusions in these two paragraphs that $1.3 million \nwas due and payable on the Castle McCulloch Note (“CM Note”) was clear error and \nshould be revised or rescinded.23 \n13. Finally, also relevant to Harris’s Motion is the claim  he submitted to the \nReceiver seeking $1.3 million for himself based upon his agreements with Dr. Epes \nand Mark McDaniel.24  The claim stated, in relevant part, as follows: \nWHEREAS, NewBridge Bank has made four loans, numbers \n06846670101, 06846679001, 06846679002 to CCSEA and 04753419001 \nto Historic Castle McCulloch, LLC, Castle McCulloch, Inc., and NSITE \n(all Newbridge Bank documents incorporated by reference), and \nNewbridge has offered to discount equity in these loans of $3,350,139.30 \nto $2,026,834.35 which offer these parties wish to effectuate. \n \n**** \n \nMcDaniel and the corporations in consideration of said waiver agree \nthat the money owed on NewBridge loan number 04753419001, $1.3 \nmillion, will be paid to Harris with eight percent annual interest in a \nlump sum, two years from the date of this agreement.\n25  \n \n \n22 (Jan. 2022 Am. Order ¶¶ 140, 142.) \n \n23 (Harris Mot. Reconsider ¶ 3.) \n \n24 (See 2d Index Exs. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. by Receiver for JDPW Tr.  (Old \nBattleground v. CCSEA), Ex. 1385.8, Claim of Douglas S. Harris against the entities within \nthe receivership, joint & severally (Old Battleground v. CCSEA – Consol.), ECF No. 1385.8; \nIndex Exs. Supp. Mot.

(Old Battleground v. \nCCSEA), Ex. 1384.4, Agreement re $1.3MM by Dr. Epes; Ex. 1384.5, Agreement re $1.3MM \nby Companies, ECF Nos. 1384.4, 1384.5.) \n \n25 (See Index Exs. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. by Receiver for JDPW Tr. (Old Battleground \nv. CCSEA), Ex. 1384.5, Agreement re $1.3MM by Companies 1–2.) \n \n14. After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motion on 11 September \n2024, at which the Receiver and the Nivison Parties were represented by counsel and \nDouglas S. Harris appeared pro se.26  The Motion is now ripe for resolution.  \nII.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n15. Under Rule 54(b), interlocutory orders are “subject to revision at any time \nbefore the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities \nof all the parties.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  That said, “[a] motion for reconsideration is \nnot a vehicle to identify facts or legal arguments that could have been, but were not, \nraised at the time the relevant motion was pending.”  Reynolds v. Burks, 906 S.E.2d \n508, at *12 (N.C. Ct. App. Sept. 3, 2024) ( quoting Julianello v. K-V Pharm. Co., 791 \nF.3d 915, 923 (8th Cir. 2015) ).  “The limited use of a motion to reconsider serves to \nensure that parties are thorough and accurate in their original pleadings and \narguments presented to the Court. ”  Id. (quoting Wiseman v. First Citizens Bank & \nTr. Co., 215 F.R.D. 507, 509 (W.D.N.C. 2003)).  But “[t] o allow motions to reconsider \noffhandedly or routinely would result in an unending motions practice.”  Id. \n16. As a result, “[m]otions to reconsider rarely succeed because the grounds that \nmerit reconsideration rarely exist.”  Gvest Real Est., LLC v. JS Real Est. Invs., LLC, \n2024 NCBC LEXIS 42, *3–4 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 7, 2024).  As Judge Conrad of this \nCourt has explained, “[i]t isn’t enough to polish up old arguments and try them again \nor to spin out new arguments that could’ve been raised but weren’t.  A party must \n \n26 (See Am. Not. Hr’g, ECF No. 1632.) \npoint to a true game changer: ‘new evidence,’ a ‘change in the controlling law,’ or ‘the \nneed to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.’”  Id.  (quoting Pender v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1838, at *7 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 7, 2011)). 27  \nSince “[s]uch problems rarely arise,” a “motion to reconsider should be equally rare.”  \nW4 Farms, Inc. v. Tyson Farms, Inc. , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 99, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 19, 2017) (quoting Harson Corp. v. Zlotnicki, 779 F.2d 906, 909 (3d Cir. 1985)). \nIII.  \nANALYSIS \n17. In his attempt to meet the high bar for reconsideration, Harris cites no new \nevidence or change in relevant law and instead relies entirely on purported instances \nof “clear error” in the Court’s challenged orders.  As will be shown below, however, \nrather than show “clear error” or “manifest injustice,”  Harris merely repackages a \nseries of previously rejected arguments into a new Motion under Rule 54 that fails to \nprovide a basis for reconsideration .  The Court will address each of Harris’s \ncontentions in turn.  \nA. The Court’s finding  that the Settlement Agreement between the Nivison \nParties and the Receiver bound JDPW—Paragraph 27 of the January 2022 \nAmended Order. \n \n18. Harris argues that since he  was the Receiver of JDPW at the time of the \nsettlement negotiations between the Receiver and the Nivison Parties  and did not \n \n27 See, e.g., United Therapeutics Corp. v. Liquidia Techs. , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 107, at *3–4 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 31, 2023) (“Absent guidance from North Carolina’s appellate courts on \nthe standard to apply when considering a motion to reconsider an interlocutory ruling under \nRule 54(b), the Court turns to federal case law addressing similarly worded portions of the \nFederal Rule 54(b).”).  \n \nparticipate in those discussions, the Court could not have approved a settlement \nbinding JDPW.  Harris therefore contends that  the Court’s recitation that the \nSettlement Approval Order is binding on JDPW constitutes clear error. 28  This is \nprecisely the same argument Harris raise s in his Motion to Dismiss under Rules \n12(b)(1) and 12(h)(3),29 however, which the Court has rejected by its Order on that \nmotion which is filed contemporaneously herewith (the “12(b)(1) Order”).  The Court \nincorporates by reference its analysis in the 12(b)(1) Order here and therefore denies \nHarris’s Motion as to paragraph 27 of the January 2022 Amended Order.30  \nB. The Court’s finding that JDPW’s liability to the Nivison Parties  is $2.1 \nmillion—Paragraph 5 of the Jury Trial Order. \n \n19. Next, Harris seeks reconsideration of the Court’s recognition in the Jury \nTrial Order that “JDPW’s liability to Nivison has been established at $2.1 million \nplus accrued interest, attorney’s fees, and costs, and, as a result, no issue concerning \nthe amount of JDPW’s liability to Nivison remains for determination by a jury.”\n31  \n \n28 ( Harris Mem.

Rules \n12(b)(1) & 12(h)(3) ¶¶ 23, 25, ECF No. 1683  (noting that “ With Count Four still pending \nagainst JDPW, and after a full hearing on both motions, including Harris’s opposition to each, \nthe Court entered its order appointing the Receiver as the receiver for JDPW—immediately \nvesting title to all of JDPW’s assets in the Receiver—and at the same time entered its order \nauthorizing the Receiver to allow NFI’s reduced claim in the amount of $2. 1 million, which \nthe Receiver later reported to the Court and all parties that he had allowed.”).)   \n \n31 (Jury Trial Order ¶ 5.) \nThis, he contends, is inconsistent wit h footnote 1 in the Court’s Order Amending \nSummary Judgment Order ( Old Battleground v. CCSEA ), which , as noted above,  \nreads, “[t]he Court notes that both t he Receiver, (see ECF No. 1386 at 1 –2), and the \nCourt assumed for purposes of the Receiver’s motion for partial summary judgment \nthat the Assignment Agreement document favored by Doug Harris was the operative \nAssignment Agreement.” 32  Because Harris’s preferred version of the Assignment \nAgreement contains a clause limiting JDPW’s liability to the Nivison Parties,33 \nHarris argues that the Court’s finding that JDPW owes the Nivison Parties $2.1 \nmillion is clearly erroneous.34 \n20. Harris ignores, however, that : (i)  the Court conditioned its April 2016 \napproval of JDPW’s Settlement Agreement with the Nivison Parties on the Receiver’s \nappointment as the trustee of JDPW Trust ; (ii) that the settlement involved an \nassessment of the strength s and weaknesses of the Receiver’s and the Nivison \nParties’ competing positions and ultimately resulted in a substantial reduction from \n \n \n32 (Order Am. Summ. J. Order (Old Battleground v. CCSEA) ¶ 7 n.1.) \n \n33 This provision states:   \n \n5.  It is understood by the Parties that James Mark McDaniel, Jr. and Dr. C. \nRichard Epes are pledging additional security together with personal \nguarantees in separate documents, but in the event of default, JDPW Trust’s \nliability is limited to the forfeiture of the aforementioned equipment and all of \nits future right title, and interest in said equipment.   \n \n(Index Exs. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 1382.2, Sept. 21, 2012 Agreement between Arthur Nivison & \nJDPW ¶ 5, ECF No. 1382.2.) \n \n34 (Harris Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Reconsider 6–9.) \n \nthe Nivison Parties’  viable damages claim ; and (iii) that assessing uncertain \noutcomes, and compromising claims and defenses, in litigation is inherent in \nevaluating and reaching any settlement.35  Harris provides no new evidence or law \nto suggest that th e Court’s approval of the $2.1 million settlement in April 2016 \nshould be reconsidered, and the Court finds no clear error or manifest injustice to \njustify the reconsideration of its ruling in Paragraph 5 of the Jury Trial Order.36 \nC. The Court’s conclusion that $1.3 million was due and owing on the CM \nNote—Paragraphs 140 and 142 of the January 2022 Amended Order. \n \n21. Harris next argues that p aragraphs 140 and 142 of the January 2022 \nAmended Order granting “JDPW’s request to enter a money judgment in JDPW’s \nfavor against Doug Harris for  . . . (ii) the $1.3 million due and payable on the CM \nNote over and above the $2.1 million JDPW borrowed under the Nivison Loan” should \nbe revised and rescinded for clear error.  In support of his argument, Harris claims \nthat when NewBridge Bank received the payment of $2.1 million in exchange for the \nNotes, it allocated a portion of that payment to pay off the remaining balance on the \nCM Note.37  Harris thus contends that because there was no money owed on the CM \nNote, he cannot face liability for failing to collect on that Note.  Harris’s argument is \nagain without merit. \n \n35 (Settlement Approval Order ¶ 41.) \n \n36 In light of the Court’s conclusion, it need not consider the Receiver’s argument that Harris’s \npreferred Assignment Agreement did not constitute a valid and binding contract .  ( See \nReceiver’s Resp . Br. Opp ’n Doug Harris Mot. Pursuant Rule 54 ( Old Battleground v. \nCCSEA/Nivison v. Harris) 11–14.) \n \n37 (Harris Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Reconsider 11.) \n \n22. As noted above, the Court concluded in paragraph 142 of the January 2022 \nAmended Order as follows:  \nHad Doug Harris not committed a breach by transferring away the CM \nNote and Release Deed and failing to enforce JDPW’s rights to the CM \nLoan, JDPW would not only have been able to repay the Nivison Loan, \nbut it would have also profited from the CM Loan by receiving the \ndifference ($1.3 million) between what JDPW could have collected on the \nCM Loan and what it owed on the Nivison Loan.  But instead, Doug \nHarris arranged to receive that amount for himself personally through \nother channels, pursuant to the Epes and McDaniel Agreements.  Thus, \neven absent a breach of trust, Doug Harris may be held personally liable \nfor that amount.  (citations omitted).\n38 \n \n23. Harris does not argue anywhere in his briefing that  the breach of fiduciary \nduty found by the Court  in its January 2022 Amended Order was erroneous .  \nMoreover, even if JDPW satisfied, rather than purchased, the CM Note, as Harris \ncontends, the undisputed fact remains that he failed to use JDPW’s ownership of the \nNotes to its benefit.  To the contrary, as he described in the claim he submitted to the \nReceiver, he sought to obtain the benefit of the $1.3 million reduction in the CM Note \nfor himself—not, as his duty as JDPW’s trustee required, for the benefit of JDPW.  \nThe Court therefore finds no clear error or manifest injustice in its conclusions in \nparagraphs 140 and 142 of its January 2022 Amended Order.  \nD. The Court’s approval of the Settlement Agreement was not a conflict-of-\ninterest transaction—Paragraph 12 of the JDPW Receivership Order. \n \n24. The Court stated in p aragraph 12 of the JDPW Receivership Order that  it \n“perceive[d] no conflict of interest in the Receiver of the CCSEA Entities serving as \nreceiver for JDPW Trust, provided that NFI is allowed a $2.1 million claim, plus \n \n38 (Jan. 2022 Am. Order ¶ 142.) \n \ninterest and attorney’s fees, against the receivership estate of JDPW Trust.”   Harris \nargues that the Court’s conclusion is clear error because JDPW did not benefit from \nthe settlement and that the settlement  was made solely for the gain of the Nivison \nParties.39   \n25. Harris raised this same argument in his objection to the appointment of the \nReceiver in his 2016 Objection to the Settlement  and again in his objections to the \napproval of the Joint Prosecution Agreement that same month.40  Having previously \nconsidered the Receiver’s potential conflict of interest, the Court squarely addressed \nthis issue after full briefing by the parties in the Settlement Approval Order: \nDoug Harris objects that the joint prosecution aspects of this Settlement \nresult in a conflict of interest for the Receiver, if the Receiver is \nappointed as the Receiver of the JDPW Trust, and that the claims may \nbe circular due to indemnity claims by those from whom relief is sought \nin the joint prosecution.  In the event of such an appointment, the \nSettlement provides for allowance of a claim against the JDPW Trust in \nthe amount of $2.1 million, plus accrued interest and attorney’s fees.  \nThis amount is a substantial reduction in the amount sought from the \nJDPW Trust by the Nivison Parties.  The Settlement further provides \nthat the allowed claim will be assigned to KEPES.  As a result, upon \nentry of this Order approving the Settlement, the Receiver will not be in \na position to assert claims against the JDPW Trust while acting as \nReceiver for the JDPW Trust.  To the extent that D oug Harris or the \nCastle McCulloch Parties assert claims against Receivership Entities \nbased upon claims asserted by the JDPW Trust, any issues presented by \nthose claims can be addressed at that time in the context of actual, \n \n39 (Harris Mem.
