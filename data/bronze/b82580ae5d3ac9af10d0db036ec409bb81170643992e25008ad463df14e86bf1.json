Corley (pro hac vice), for Defendant SS&C Technologies, Inc. \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n2. Plaintiffs initiated this litigation on August 7, 2014 and filed an Amended \nComplaint on November 25, 2014.  The parties are currently engaged in discovery, \nand the fact discovery deadline is April 28, 2017. \n3. SS&C Technologies, Inc. (“SS&C”) initiated this matter on March 9, 2017 by \ne-mailing the Court a request for a telephone conference pursuant to BCR 10.9(b)(1) \nso that the Court could address a discovery dispute between the parties.   \n4. As stated in its email request, SS&C seeks an order from the Court \nprohibiting Plaintiffs’ counsel from deposing SS&C’s President and Chief Operating \nOfficer (“COO”), Normand A. Boulanger (“Boulanger”).  Plaintiffs timely e-mailed the \n \n \nCourt their response opposing SS&C’s request in accordance with BCR 10.9(b)(1), and \nthe Court held a telephone conference to discuss the dispute on March 27, 2017.  \n5. Plaintiffs’ claims in this action arise out of an alleged multi -million dollar \nfraudulent “Ponzi scheme” that Defendant Stephen A. Maiden (“Maiden”) \npurportedly operated through a hedge fund managed by Defendant Maiden Capital, \nLLC.  Maiden’s fund was a limited partnership named the Maiden Capital \nOpportunity Fund, LP (“Fund”).  SS&C served as the Fund’s administrator from \napproximately 2007 until the Fund’s collapse in 2013.  Plaintiffs were limited \npartners and investors in the Fund .  The Court has more fully discussed Plaintiffs’ \nallegations and claims in its earlier opinion, Bradshaw v. Maiden, 2015 NCBC LEXIS \n80 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2015).   \n6. SS&C’s duties as the Fund’s administrator arose from an Administrative \nServices Agreement (the “ASA” or “Agreement”) entered into by SS&C and the Fund \non September 1, 2006.  Boulanger signed the ASA on behalf of SS&C.   \n7. Among the obligations imposed by the ASA, SS&C agreed that it would \n“keep at its premises books, records and statements as may be reasonably necessary \nto document the transactions recorded by us on behalf of the Fund.”  Nevertheless, \nPlaintiffs have elicited testimony suggesting that SS&C’s accountants did not \nindependently document the existence of “restricted  investments” in the Fund, \ninstead relying on e -mails from Maiden stating that the Fund owned these \ninvestments, which ultimately proved to be fraudulent or nonexistent.  SS&C’s \n \n \naccountant stated that merely relying on Maiden’s e -mail satisfied SS&C’s duties of \nsufficient documentation.   \n8. Based on this evidence, Plaintiffs contend that they must be able to depose \nBoulanger, who signed the ASA, to determine : (i) what “instructions, policies, or \ntraining” were provided to the SS&C employees charged with carry ing out SS&C’s \nduties under the contract ; (ii) what actions SS&C took to “make sure that SS&C’s \naccountants complied with the ‘reasonable documentation’ duties imposed by the \ncontract;” and (iii) what SS&C did to  fulfill its “duties of care that sprang fr om the \n[ASA].”  As a result, Plaintiffs contend that the Court should permit Plaintiffs to \ndepose Boulanger in this action. \n9. SS&C argues, on the other hand, that: (i) Boulanger has no unique or special \nknowledge of the facts at issue in this case ; (ii) Boulanger had no involvement with \nthe negotiation or implementation of the ASA ; (iii) none of the “thousands of emails \nor other documents produced by the parties” reveal “any communication between \n[Boulanger] and [Maiden] regarding the negotiation or interpretation of the terms of \nthe ASA, or any other facts in issue in this case ;” (iv) none of the thousands of \ndocuments produced by the parties show any communications between Boulanger \nand any of the Plaintiffs; (v) Boulanger’s only involvement with the matters in dispute \nwas to sign the ASA on behalf of SS&C , which SS&C asserts Boulanger did as a \nroutine matter “in accordance with SS&C’s standing signature policy and practice ;” \n(vi) scheduling and preparing for Boulanger’s deposition would be particularly \nburdensome for SS&C and Boulanger, especially in light of Boulanger’s many \n \n \nextensive responsibilities and obligations as SS&C’s President and COO  and the \nheavy deposition schedule in this case over the next 30 days; and (vii) Plaintiffs have \nnot attempted or found inadequate less burdensome means to secure the information \nsought from Boulanger.   \n10. As a result, SS&C argues that the burden of deposing Boulanger \nsubstantially outweighs any marginal relevance Boulanger’s potential testimony may \nhave, and thus SS&C seeks an order prohibiting Boulanger’s deposition  under Rule \n26 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. \n11. Having considered the parties’ written summaries of the dispute, the \nevidence of record, and the arguments of counsel at the telephone conference, the \nCourt, for the reasons set forth below, and in the exercise of its discretion, concludes \nand orders that Plaintiffs shall not be permitted to depose Boulanger at this time, \nwithout prejudice to Plaintiffs’ right to renew their request for good cause shown upon \nthe completion of further discovery or in the event of other changed circumstances. \nII. \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \n12. Rule 26 establishes a liberal scope of discovery; parties can seek discovery \n“regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter \ninvolved in the pending action,” even if the information sought will be inadmissible \nat trial or the examining party already has knowledge of the information sought.  N.C. \nR. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  The Court may, however, on its own initiative or upon request of \na party, limit discovery if it determines that: \n \n \n(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is \nobtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less \nburdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had \nample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information \nsought; or (iii) the discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking \ninto account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, \nlimitations on the parties’ resources, and the importance of the issues at \nstake in the litigation.   \n \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1a).  The Court may also limit discovery upon a party’s motion \n“to protect a party or person from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, \noppression, or undue burden or expense.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(c).   \n13. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26, federal courts have developed the \n“apex doctrine” to address the precise fact scenario presented in this discovery \ndispute.  “In its stronger form, the doctrine holds that, before a plaintiff may depose \na defendant corporation’s high-ranking (“apex”) officer, that plaintiff must show that \n‘(1) the executive has unique or special knowledge of the facts at issue and (2) other \nless burdensome avenues for obtaining the information sought have been exhausted.’”  \nPerformance Sales & Mktg. LLC v. Lowe’s Cos., Inc. , No. 5:07-CV-00140-RLV-DLH, \n2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131394, at *16–17 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 14, 2012) (citation omitted).  \n“Simply stated, the apex doctrine applies when those at the top of the company, i.e. \nmen and women  at the ‘apex,’ really don’t have personal knowledge about what is \ngoing on with the product, or its marketing, or its financing or really anything else \nthat might be of interest to the plaintiffs, or the attorn eys, or the jury, or the court.”  \nIn Re Tylenol (Acetaminophen) Mktg., Sales Practices & Prods. Liab. Litig ., No. 14-\nmc-00072, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89981, at *8 (E.D. Pa. July 1, 2014). \n \n \n14. The federal courts applying the apex doctrine have r ecognized the \n“tremendous potential for abuse or harassment ” presented by depositions of an \nofficial at the “highest level or ‘apex’ of corporate management ,” In re Lipitor \nAtorvastatin Calcium Mktg ., No. 2:14 -mn-02502-RMG, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n194852, at *5 (D.S.C. Nov. 13, 2014) , and have embraced the doctrine to “ensur[e] \nthat the liberal rules of procedure for depositions are used only for their intended \npurpose and not as a litigation tactic to create undue leverage by harassing the \nopposition or inflating its discovery costs ,”  Performance Sales & Mktg., 2012 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 131394, at * 16.  Nevertheless, federal courts have consistently \nrecognized that “[t]he ‘apex’ doctrine exists in tension with the otherwise broad \nallowance for discovery of party wit nesses under the federal rules.”  Apple Inc. v. \nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd, 282 F.R.D. 259, 263 (N.D. Cal. 2012). \n15. The apex doctrine stands out in many federal jurisdictions because the \ndoctrine shifts the burden of proof to the proponent of the deposition.  See, e.g., Sun \nCapital Partners, Inc. v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., 310 F.R.D. 523, 527 (S.D. Fla. 2015) \n(“The party seeking the deposition of the high-ranking official has the burden to show \nthat the deposition is necessary.”); Performance Sales & Mktg., 2012 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 131394, at *19 –20 (“Put simply, the apex doctrine is the application of the \nrebuttable presumption that the deposition of a high-ranking corporate executive [is \ninappropriate under Rule 26].”).  Nevertheless, some jurisdictions reje ct the apex \ndoctrine altogether on this ground, while others follow a version of the apex doctrine \nthat maintains the traditional burden of proof under Rule 26.  See, e.g., Crest Infiniti \n \n \nII, LP v. Swinton, 174 P.3d 996, 1004 (Okla. 2007) (“We decline to adopt a form of the \napex doctrine that shifts a burden to the party seeking discovery.”); Scott v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc. , 306 F.R.D. 120, 122 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (stating  that even in apex \ndoctrine scenarios the plaintiff bears no burden to show that the deponent has special \nknowledge).   \n16. North Carolina state courts have not explicitly adopted the apex doctrine, \nbut this Court has found federal decisions interpreting the apex doctrine to be useful \nin applying the balancing factors set forth in our state’s  Rule 26.  See Next Advisor \nContinued, Inc. v. LendingTree, Inc. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *6 –10 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Sept. 16, 2016) (discussing the apex doctrine and concluding that “an assessment \nand balancing of the factors contained in Rules 26(b) and 26(c)” controlled the court’s \ndecision); see also, e.g ., Willis v. Duke Power Co., 291 N.C. 19, 34, 229 S.E.2d 191, \n200 (1976) (“One party’s need for information must be balanced against the likelihood \nof an undue burden imposed upon the other.”).   \n17. This Court did not adopt the apex doctrine in Next Advisor and does not do \nso in this Order and Opinion .  Because Rules 26(b) and (c) clearly set  forth the \ngrounds on which discovery may appropriately be limited , and our rules make clear \nthat the party opposing discovery bears the burden of proof, the Court concludes, as \nit did in Next Advisor, that adoption of the apex doctrine is not necessary and that \nRule 26 is entirely adequate to resolve disputes of this nature .  See Next Advisor, \n2016 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *9 .  Nonetheless, the Court finds federal and state court  \ndecisions applying the apex doctrine useful in discerning the unique factual \n \n \nconsiderations that arise when a party seeks to depose a high-ranking corporate \nexecutive.     \n18. Plaintiffs admit  that they seek to depose SS&C’s President and COO \nprimarily, if not solely, because he sig ned the ASA on behalf of SS&C.  A federal \ndistrict court in the Northern District of California faced a nearly identical set of facts \nin M.H. v. Cnty. of Alameda, No. 11-cv-02868-JST, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146166, at \n*7 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2013).  In that case, the plaintiffs argued that because a CEO \nsigned a contract on behalf of the corporate defendant, the CEO was “the best person \nto testify about the obligations [the corporate defendant] undertook under that \ncontract.”  Id.  In applying the apex doctrine to bar the deposition, the court held that \n“[t]he mere fact of [the CEO’s] signature on a contract to which [the corporate \ndefendant] is a party does no t establish that [the CEO] ‘has unique first -hand, \nnon-repetitive knowledge of the facts at issue’ regarding the obligations under that \ncontract, or how they were performed.”  Id.  Based on this conclusion, and the court’s \nfinding that the plaintiffs “have [not] exhausted their alternatives for obtaining the \ninformation using ‘less intrusive discovery methods,’” including by a Rule 30(b)(6) \ndeposition, the court denied the motion to take the CEO’s deposition.  \n19. Similar considerations are present here.  Plaintiffs contend that Boulanger \nmust be deposed because he, and he alone, can testify to any “instructions, policies, \nor training” SS&C issued to its employees and accountants concerning the meaning \nand interpretation of the ASA and SS&C’s obligations under the contract.  However, \ndespite engaging in rigorous discovery for over eighteen months, Plaintiffs have not \n \n \nshown that Boulanger had any involvement in this dispute other than as the \ncorporate officer who executed the ASA on behalf of SS&C.  Plaintiffs have not offered \nor forecasted evidence that Boulanger was involved in, or had personal responsibility \nfor, the negotiation, implementation, or interpretation of the ASA at any level, or that \nBoulanger instructed or directed any SS&C employees, accountants, or agents in how \nto perform SS&C’s duties under the ASA.  Indeed, other than affixing his signature \nto the ASA, which SS&C contends was simply an exercise of SS&C’s standard \nsignature policy and practice, there is no evidence before the Court that Boul anger \nwas a party to any communication with Maiden, a Plaintiff, or an SS&C employee or \nagent about any facts that are at issue in this litigation, including concerning SS&C’s \ninterpretation of, and duties and compliance efforts under, the ASA.  \n20. In addition, Plaintiffs have failed to show that the information Plaintiffs \nseek, even if known to Boulanger, is information that is unique and special to him or, \ngiven the paucity of evidence tying Boulanger to the ASA, that he is the best person \nwithin the company to testify about the Agreement.  To the contrary, the information \nsought concerns SS&C’s corporate policies, practices, and actions, which a corporate \nrepresentative or others within the company with appropriate authority should be \nable to identify  and explain , at least —based on this record —more fully than \nBoulanger.  \n21. Finally, Plaintiffs have also failed to show that the information sought \ncannot be obtained “from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, \nor less expensive.”  N. C. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1a).  As stated during the Rule 10.9 telephone \n \n \nconference, Plaintiffs have deposed at least four SS&C witnesses with operational \nresponsibility concerning the ASA, but Plaintiffs have not offered evidence from any \nof these witnesses or fr om other sources that these SS&C witnesses were unable to \nprovide information concerning the meaning, interpretation, and implementation of \nthe Agreement.  Likewise, there is no evidence before the Court that Plaintiffs have \nattempted to obtain this inform ation through a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition of SS&C  or \nmade any showing that Boulanger has particular knowledge of the information \nsought that could not be obtained through a 30(b)(6) deposition or other appropriate, \nless intrusive, discovery methods.   \n22. At the same time, SS&C has persuasively argued that Boulanger has \nsubstantial, extensive, and time -sensitive duties and obligations in his role of \nPresident and COO of SS&C that weigh in favor of prohibiting his deposition in light \nof Plaintiffs’ failure to show that he possesses any unique or special knowledge that \nis relevant to this case.  This is particularly true considering the time and expense \ninvolved in scheduling and preparing Boulanger for deposition before the April 28  \ndiscovery deadline and the twenty-plus fact depositions the parties have noticed to \noccur by that same date.   \n23. Plaintiffs rely upon  this Court’s Next Advisor  decision, but that case is \nreadily distinguishable.  In that case, the dispute arose out of a failed corporate \nacquisition, and the evidence of record suggested that the CEO had an active role in \nthe negotiations, the failure of the negotiations, and the resulting conduct that \nprompted the plaintiff corporation to bring s uit.  Next Advisor, 2016 NCBC LEXIS \n \n \n72, at *11–12.  Based on these facts, this court concluded that the CEO had “unique, \npersonal knowledge relevant to the issues in dispute in this litigation,” and, in \nparticular, “unique, personal knowledge” concerning “his role and participation in the \norigins of the current dispute between [the plaintiff] and [the defendant].”  \nRecognizing the frequently applied principle that “ if a prospective deponent has \nrelevant knowledge, the mere fact that the prospective deponent is a CEO or is busy \ndoes not constitute a showing of good cause for a protective order,” the court allowed \nthe plaintiffs to depose the defendant’s CEO.  Id.  The contrast between the defendant \nCEO’s active participation in the facts at issue in Next Advisor and the lack of any \ncomparable evidence of Boulanger’s active participation in the facts underlying this \ncase, apart from signing the ASA on behalf of SS&C, is stark.   \n24. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes, in the \nexercise of its discretion, that the deposition of Boulanger should not be permitted at \nthis time under the balancing test set forth in North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure \n26(b)(1a) and (c).  See, e.g., Analog Devices, Inc. v. Michalski, 2006 NCBC LEXIS 16, \nat *32–38 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 1, 2006)  (discussing discovery standards, including \nthe “relative burdens and benefits of [discovery] as contemplated by the balancing \ntest of [Rule 26]”).  See also, e.g., Blue Cross Blue Shield v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ., \nNo. 11-2529, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161041, at *7 (D. Minn. Nov. 9, 2012) (disallowing \nexecutive’s deposition because he “did not have relevant knowledge”); Baine v. Gen. \nMotors Corp., 141 F.R.D. 332, 335 (M.D. Ala. 1991) (disallowing vice -president’s \ndeposition because “it ha[d] not been established that the information necessary \n \n \n[could not] be had from [other witnesses],” including via Rule 30(b)(6), “which could \nsatisfy some of plaintiffs’ needs”).   \n25. The Court’s ruling, however, is without prejudice to Plaintiffs’ right to renew \ntheir request to depose Boulanger should further discovery or other circumstances \nestablish good cause for Boulanger’s deposition to proceed.  See, e.g., Salter v. Upjohn \nCo., 593 F.2d 649 , 651  (5th Cir. 1979) ( affirming disallowance of  president’s \ndeposition until plaintiff first deposed, and established the inadequacy of depositions \nof, defendant’s 30(b)(6) corporate representative and lower -ranking company \nofficials); Bank of the Ozarks v. Capital Mortg. Corp ., No. 4:12-mc-00021, 2012 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 99506, at *6 –8 (E.D. Ark. July 18, 2012) (disallowing CEO’s deposition \nuntil defendants pursued and demonstrated as inadequate “less burdensome avenues \nfor obtaining the information sought,” including through Rule 30(b)(6) and corporate \nemployee depositions). \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n26. WHEREFORE, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, hereby ORDERS \nthat Plaintiffs shall not be permitted to depose SS&C’s President and COO, Normand \nA. Boulanger , in this action, without prejudi ce to Plaintiffs’ right to renew their \nrequest for good cause shown upon the completion of further discovery or in the event \nof other changed circumstances. \n \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 31st day of March, 2017. \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A.
