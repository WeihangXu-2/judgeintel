Pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina \nRules of Civil Procedure (the “Rules”), the Motion requests dismissal with prejudice \nAnderson v. Hobart Fin. Grp., Inc., 2024 NCBC 10. \nof all seven claims for relief alle ged by one or more of the thi rteen plaintiffs in the \nSecond Amended Complaint.  (Mot. 1–2; see Second Am.

Nebrig, Joseph Piligian, \nAlexandra Davidson, Christopher D. Tomlinson, and Caroline F. Savini, \nfor Defendants.  \n \nRobinson, Judge. \nI. INTRODUCTION \n3. This action arises out of Defendants’ alleged recommendation of unsuitable \ninvestment products to Plaintiffs, who purchased some of those recommended \ninvestments to their financial detriment.  Plaintiffs, older adults who were retired or \nnearing retirement at the time they made their investments , now allege that the \ninvestments Defendants recommended bore undisclosed hidden fees and \ncommissions and that the unsui tability of those investments u ltimately caused \nPlaintiffs to collectively lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Plaintiffs primarily \ncontend that, if Defendants upheld the ir fiduciary obligations to Plaintiffs , for \nexample by disclosing the information that made the investments unsuitable, \nPlaintiffs would not have entrusted Defendants with their retirement savings. \n4. The issue before the Court is to consider the metes and bounds of this action \nby determining which causes of actions state a claim for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5. The Court does not make determinations of fact on motions to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) but only recites those factual allegations of the Second Amended \nComplaint that are relevant and necessary to the Court’s determination of the \nMotion.  Gateway Mgmt. S ervs. v. Carrbridge Berkshire Grp., Inc. , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 45, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 9, 2018). \nA. The Parties \n6. Francis Burton (“Mr. Burton”) and Jean M. Burton (“Ms. Burton”; together, \nthe “Burtons”) are  residents of Union County, North Carolina.  (SAC ¶  2.)  The \nBurtons allege that some Defendants  recommended they purchase  “unsuitable \nAlternative Investments and fixed-index annuities” before 1 February 2012, and that \nin 2014 and 2015, the Burtons did purchase some of those investments.  (SAC ¶ 2.) \n7. Beverly Byrnes (“Ms. Byrnes”) is a resident of Mecklenburg County, North \nCarolina and the beneficiary of the estate of her mother , Katherine R.

Ms. Byrnes alleges claims for \nrelief against Defendants  both for herself and on behalf of  (1) her Individual \nRetirement Account (“ IRA”) and (2) Ms. Gleason, as the beneficiary of her estate, \ncontending that some Defendants recommended unsuitable alternative investments \nand fixed- index annuities to Ms. Byrnes and her mother  before 1 February 2012.  \n(SAC ¶  3.)  Ms. Byrnes affirmatively alleges that the investment advisor -client \nrelationship was terminated around March 2013.  (SAC ¶ 3.) \n8.

James Tanger (“Mr. Tanger”) is a resident of Mecklenburg County, North \nCarolina.  (SAC ¶ 8.)  He alleges claims for relief against Defendants both for himself \nand on behalf of his IRA.  (SAC ¶  8.)  Mr. Tanger alleges that Defendants \nrecommended he purchase unsuitable alternative investments and fixed -index \nannuities in 2014 , and that the investment advisor -client relationship was \nterminated in May or June 2019.  (SAC ¶ 8.) \n13. Larry B. Wilshire (“Dr. Wilshire”) and Cynthia Wilshire (“Ms. Wilshire” ; \ntogether, the “Wilshires”)  are residents of Lancaster County, South Carolina .  \n(SAC ¶ 9.)  They  allege claims for relief on their own behalf and for their IRA.  \n(SAC ¶ 9.)

Joseph Zucker (“ Dr. Zucker” ; together with the Burtons, Ms. Byrnes, \nMr. Forbis, the Leshocks, the Ostranders, Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Tanger, and the Wilshires, \n“Plaintiffs”) is a res ident of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina .  (SAC ¶ 10.)  He \nalleges claims for relief against Defendants both for himself and on behalf of his IRA.  \n(SAC ¶ 10.)

Hobart Financial Group, Inc. (“Hobart Financial”)  f/k/a Senior Financial \nPlanners, Inc.,  is a North Carolina corporation engaged in “ financial sales .”  \n(SAC ¶ 12.)  Plaintiffs allege that Hobart Financial “ does not have a board of \ndirectors” and that it “fails to follow corporate formalities[.]”  (SAC ¶ 12.) \n16. Defendant Christopher Scott Hobart (“Mr.  Hobart”) is a resident of \nMecklenburg County, North Carolina.  (SAC ¶ 17.)  Mr. Hobart is Hobart Financial’s \npresident and its sole officer and shareholder .  (SAC ¶  12.)  Mr. Hobart  was a \nregistered broker with the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (“FINRA”) for the \nperiods 1 January 2002 to 2 February 2012 and 23 September 2015 to 17 April 2019.  \n(SAC ¶ 17.)  Mr. Hobart is a registered investment advisor (“RIA”) with the State of \nNorth Carolina and the U.S. Securities a nd Exchange Commission (“ SEC”).  \n(SAC ¶ 17.) \n17. Hobart Private Capital, LLC (“Hobart Capital”) d/b/a Hobart Wealth is a \nNorth Carolina limited liability company w hich provides investment advisory \nservices.  (SAC ¶  13.)  Hobart Capital allegedly provided inves tment services to \nPlaintiffs, and its sole member  and manager is Mr. Hobart .  (SAC ¶  13.)  Hobart \nCapital was registered with the State from 5 September 2013 to 27 July 2016 and the \nSEC beginning on 29 February 2016 through the filing of the Second Amended \nComplaint.  (SAC ¶ 13.) \n18. Hobart Insurance Services, LLC (“Hobart Insurance”)  is a North Carolina \nlimited liability company wh ose sole member and manager is Hobart Financial.  \n(SAC ¶ 14.)  Hobart Insurance is an insurance agency that brokered the sale of fixed-\nindex annuities and high- commission insurance products to certain Plaintiffs.  \n(SAC ¶ 14.) \n19. Legacy GFIS & KCI Holdings, LLC (“Legacy GFIS” ; together with Hobart \nFinancial, Hobart Capital, and Hobart Insurance, the “Hobart Entities”) is a North \nCarolina limited liability company that  does largely the same business as Hobart \nFinancial and Hobart Capital .  (SAC ¶  15.)  Mr. Hobart is the sole member and \nmanager of Legacy GFIS.  (SAC ¶ 15.) \n20. Each of the Hobart Entities maintains its principal place of business at \n7733 Ballantyne Commons Parkway, Suite 101, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277.  \n(SAC ¶ 16.) \n21. Steven A. Gr eer (“Mr. Greer”) is a resident of Union County, North \nCarolina.  (SAC ¶ 18.)  Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Greer has been an RIA with the SEC \nsince 2011 and the State of North Carolina  since 5 September 2013.  (SAC ¶  18.)  \nMr. Greer was a registered broker with FINRA from 2011 through 17 April 2019 and \nwas the only FINRA broker employed by the Hobart Entities from 2  February 2012 \nto 23 September 2015.  (SAC ¶ 18.) \n22. Corey S. Sunstrom (“Mr. Sunstrom”; together with Mr. Hobart, Mr. Greer, \nand the Hobart Entities , “Defendants”) is a resident of Mecklenburg County, North \nCarolina.  (SAC ¶  19.)  Mr. Sunstrom  has been an RIA with the State of North \nCarolina since 6 February 2015.  (SAC ¶ 19.)  Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Sunstrom was \na registered broker with FINRA at all relevant times until 20  February 2018.  \n(SAC ¶ 19.)  Mr. Sunstrom registered as an insurance agent with the State on \n29 October 2019.  (SAC ¶ 19.) \n23. Plaintiffs allege that “[a]t all relevant times, Mr. Hobart, Mr. Greer, and \nMr. Sunstrom have been employees of the Hobart Entities, and the wrongful acts \ncomplained of  . . . were performed in furtherance of the business of the Hobart \nEntities.”  (SAC ¶ 20.) \nB. A Brief Background on the Hobart Entities \n24. Mr. Hobart began his career in the financial industry as an insurance \nsalesman.  (SAC ¶ 24.)  In 2004, Mr. Hobart formed Hobart Financial as a “financial \nsales” company.  (SAC ¶ 12.)  Hobart Financial was branded as the “Senior Financial \nPlanners: The Retirement Professionals,” and later as the “Carolinas’ Retirement and \n401(k) Rollover Specialist.”  (SAC ¶  25.)  Based on the allegations in the Second \nAmended Complaint, it appears that Hobart Financial grew rapidly  from a group of \nthree employees in 2011 to a group of at least nineteen employees  by 2015 .  \n(SAC ¶¶ 28–29.)  It appears from the allegations of the Second Amended Complaint  \nthat Mr. Greer was hired to work at Hobart Financial sometime in 2011.  ( See \nSAC ¶¶ 18, 28.) \n25. In its early yea rs, Hobart Financial focused largely on selling insurance \nproducts, including fixed- index annuities , to senior citizens.  (See SAC ¶¶  24–26.)  \nAround 2010 or 2011, Hobart Financial  began to offer “certain commissioned, \nnontraded securities” including: real estate investment trusts (“REIT (s)”); business \ndevelopment corporations under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“BDC (s)”); \nand other direct participation program securities (“DPP(s)”; together with REITs and \nBDCs, “Alternative Investments”).  (SAC ¶ 27.) \n26. Hobart Capital was formed on 12 July 2013 to provide investment advisory \nservices, (SAC ¶  13), and  Hobart Insurance was thereafter organized in 2015 , \n(SAC ¶ 14).  Plaintiffs allege that Hobart Insurance is an “ affiliate” with Hobart \nCapital, “under common ownership and control.”  (SAC ¶ 38.) \n27. On 30 June 2015, Mr. Sunstrom was hired as an associate wealth advisor.  \n(SAC ¶ 29.)  Plaintiffs allege that “Mr. Hobart, [Mr. Sunstrom,] and Mr. Greer were \nprimarily responsible for overseeing the process, structure, and management of client \nportfolios and accounts for [Defendants] .”  (SAC ¶  31.)  By no later than 2017, \nMr. Sunstrom was holding “himself out to  clients—including through his email \nsignature line—as ‘director of financia l planning, Hobart Financial’ and as ‘senior \nwealth advisor.’ ”  (SAC ¶ 31.) \n28. Mr. Hobart, Mr. Greer, and Mr. Sunstrom performed several roles for the \nHobart Entities.  (See SAC ¶ 32.) \n29. Plaintiffs allege that “Mr. Hobart established [Defendants’] policies and  \npractices” in recommending “Alternative Investments and fixed- index annuities to \n[their] clients[,]” and was directly involved in recommending these to Plaintiffs.  \n(SAC ¶ 33.) \n30. Mr. Greer’s role was serving as the registered  broker through whom \n“substantially all” the Alternative Investment transactions at issue were processed.  \n(SAC ¶  34.)  Mr. Greer also directly participated in recommending the sale of \nAlternative Investments  and fixed- index annuities  to numerous Plaintiffs.  \n(SAC ¶ 35.) \n31. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Sunstrom’s role was participating “in the \nrecommendation of unsuitable Alternative Investments and fixed-index annuities to \nseveral of the Plaintiffs,” including the Burtons, the Ostranders, Mr. Rhodes, and the \nWilshires.  (SAC ¶ 36.) \n32. Legacy GFIS was organized on 26 March 2021.  (SAC ¶ 15.)  Plaintiffs do \nnot allege its precise role in relation to the acts and omissions complained of in the \nSecond Amended Complaint.  (See SAC ¶ 15.) \nC. Overview of the Financial Products at Issue \n33. It is well settled that “[w] hen documents are attached to and incorporated \ninto a complaint, they become part of the complaint and may be considered in \nconnection with a Rule  12(b)(6) motion without converting it into a motion for \nsummary judgm ent.”  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, 577 (2009) (citations \nomitted).  The Court may similarly consider documents “specifically referred to [] or \nincorporated by reference in the complaint.”  Id. \n34. Various investment and insurance products are at issue  in this litigation.  \nThe Court therefore finds it useful to describe the offerings that Defendants allegedly \nrecommended to Plaintiffs.  Since t he Second Amended Complaint quotes from and \nspecifically refers to documents attached to the Amended Complaint,  the Court \nconsiders some of those documents to explain  the investment products at issue \nwithout converting the Motion into one for summary judgment. \n35. Plaintiffs assert that Defendants knew at all relevant times that the \ninvestments at issue are “unsuitable for retirees and near-retirees with conservative \ninvestment goals.”  (SAC ¶ 85.) \n36. A 2007 Statement of Policy Regarding R eal Estate Investment Trusts (the \n“Statement of Polic y”) issued by the National American Securities Administrators \nAssociation (“NASAA”) describes the qualification and registration requirements for \nREITs.  The Statement of Policy provides that Real Estate Investment Trusts, or \nREITs, are corporations, trusts, associations, or other legal entities, excluding a real \nestate syndication, “engaged primarily in investing in equity interests in real estate \n(including fee ownership and leasehold interests) or in loans secured by real estate or \nboth[,]” which may be publicly or non -publicly traded.  (Am. Compl. Ex. 1  at 4, ECF \nNo. 34.1 [“Ex. 1”]; SAC ¶ 86.) \n37. The Statement of Policy further provides that R EITs require special \nattention in order to determine if an investor can “bear the economic risk of the \ninvestment,” meaning the investor should understand (i) “the fundamental risk of the \ninvestment;” (ii) “the risk that the [ shareholder] may lose the entire investment;” \n(iii) “the lack of liquidity of REIT [shares];” and (iv) “the restrictions on transferability \nof REIT[s.]”  (Ex. 1 at 10; SAC ¶ 86.) \n38. The Statement of Policy also provides  that subscription agreements for \nREITs are prohibited from including representations that “[t]he SHAREHOLDER \nunderstands or comprehends the risks associated with an investment in the RE IT”; \nand “[i]n deciding to invest in the REIT, the SHAREHOLDER has relied solely on the \nPROSPECTUS, and not on any other information or representations from other \nPERSONS or sources.”  (Ex. 1 at 12; SAC ¶ 87.) \n39. According to an 11 January 2013 FINRA Regulato ry and Examination \nPriorities Letter from Chairman Rick Ketchum, business development corporations, \nor BDCs, are  \ntypically closed- end investment companies.  Some BDCs primarily \ninvest in the corporate debt and equity of private companies and may \noffer attractive yields generated through high credit risk exposures \namplified through leverage.  As with other high-yield investments, such \nas floating -rate/leveraged loan funds, private REITs and limited \npartnerships, investors are exposed to significant market, credit [,] and \nliquidity risks.  In addition, fueled by the availability of low -cost \nfinancing, BDCs run the risk of over -leveraging their relatively illiquid \nportfolios. \n \n(Am. Compl. Ex. 5 at 2, ECF No. 34.5 [“Ex. 5”].)   Put simply,  “BDCs are closed-end \ninvestment companies that are operated to make investments in small and emerging \nbusinesses and financially troubled businesses.”  ( Am. Compl. Ex. 6 at 8 n.3, ECF \nNo. 34.6 [“Ex. 6”].) \n40. Finally, FINRA Regulatory Notice  13-18 describes d irect participation \nprogram securities, or DPPs, as “investment programs that provide for flow-through \ntax consequences regardless of the structure of the legal entity or vehicle for  \ndistribution.  DPPs include, among other investment vehicles, real estate programs \nthat are not structured as REITs.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. 3 at 1, ECF No. 34.3 [“Ex. 3”].) \n41. FINRA Regulatory Notice 15 -02 stated that  industry practice was to use \nthe offering pri ce of DPPs as the “ per share estimated value during the offering \nperiod, which can continue [for] seven and one-half years.  The offering price, typically \n$10 per share, often remains constant on customer account statements during this \nperiod,” although various costs and fees may have caused the investments to decrease \nin value.  (Am. Compl. Ex. 9 at 2, ECF No. 34.9 [”Ex. 9”].)  This practice changed on \n11 April 2016 by FINRA Regulatory Notice 15- 02, which required increased \ntransparency.  (Ex. 9 at 1; SAC Ex. 8 at 2, ECF No. 55 [“SAC Ex. 8”].) \nD. Plaintiffs’ Individual Allegations of Defendants’ Misconduct \n42. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants designed each of their investment \nportfolios and recommended that Plaintiffs purchase the above-described Alternative \nInvestments and fixed-index annuities.  (SAC ¶  30.)  Plaintiffs further allege that \nDefendants consistently held themselves out to present and prospective “clients as a \nreputable, trustworthy firm that promised to uphold the highest of standards and to \nalways act in the client’s best interest.”  (SAC ¶ 40.)  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \nmade numerous oral representations to each of them that Defendants were obligated \nto “act in the client’s best interest,” including that “Plaintiff(s) should engage onl y a \nfiduciary, like the Hobart [Entities], because only a fiduciary is obligated to have the \nclient’s best interests at heart;” and that “Plaintiffs could trust [Defendants were] \ncomplying with  [their] fiduciary obligations by recommending only suitable \ninvestments in an appropriate amount[.]”  (SAC ¶¶ 76.a., 76.c., 76.g.) \n43. The allegations in the Second Amended Complaint largely concern t he \nrecommendation of the investments described herein and the marketing materials \ndeveloped by Mr. Hobart  and/or the Hobart Entities .  (SAC ¶¶  26, 33.)  The \nallegations are particularly focused on whether the marketing materials provided to \nPlaintiffs “concealed and misrepresented the excessive fees and commissions \n[Defendants] received from the sale of fixed -index annuities and other insurance \nproducts, while at the same time ‘ warning’ clients of the ‘hidden fees’ in mutual \nfunds.”  (SAC ¶ 26.) \n44. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants failed to provide necessary \ndisclosures regarding the illiquidity and high vo latility of the Alternative \nInvestments they sold .  (SAC ¶  129.)  In fact, Plaintiffs allege that numerous \nmisrepresentations were made by Defendants when providing investment -related \nadvice, detailed herein. \n45. First, Defendants allegedly “misrepresented to each and every Plaintiff that \nAlternative Investments were ‘strong and secure’ investments like the walls of a \nhouse.”  (SAC ¶  130 (emphasis removed) .)  The “house analogy” was used by \nMr. Hobart to describe the investments as safe, secure, and subject to different types \nof risks.  (See SAC ¶ 133.)  Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Hobart’s analogy went as follows:  \nAt Hobart Financial, we believe you should build your portfolio kind of \nlike you would build a house.  A house has three main components: \nyou’ve got foundation, which is safe and sound; you’ve got the walls, \nwhich need to be strong and secure; and you’ve g ot the roof, that is \nbasically subject to different types of risk out there –  and needs to be \nmaintained on that basis.  Retirement needs to be the same way. \n \n(SAC ¶ 132 (emphasis removed).)  Mr. Hobart used the  “house metaphor to falsely \nminimize, in a simplistic manner, the level of risk associated with Alternative \nInvestments.”  (SAC ¶ 135.) \n46. The Burtons, Mr. Forbis, the Leshocks, the Ostranders, Mr. Rhodes, \nMr. Tanger, and Dr. Zucker each allege that they received a copy of The Hobart \nFinancial brochure, Consumer’s Guide to Finding the Right Advice Givers (“Hobart \nBrochure”), around the time of  their initial interactions with Defendants.  \n(SAC ¶¶ 44–45, 253, 309, 329, 343, 385, 396, 429.)  The Hobart Brochure is a six-part \nhandout that includes promotiona l information and materials  and a quiz to assess \n“risk exposure to bad investments.”  (SAC ¶ 45; SAC Ex. 1, ECF No. 48 [“Brochure”].) \n47. The Second Amended Complaint highlights Defendants’ self-contradictions \nin the Hobart Brochure, including  that: Defendants recommended potential clients \ndo their own research on financial matters but that retained clients should sit back \nand rely on trusted advisors to make investment decisions on their behalf; clients \nshould avoid relying on online res ources and should view that information “ with a \nvery skeptical eye”; and, Hobart Financial could be trusted as a “real expert” that \n“really knows his or her stuff.”  (SAC ¶¶  53–54; Brochure 12– 13.)  According to \nPlaintiffs, and as discussed more herein, these statements and others support the \nCourt determining that a fiduciary relationship is adequately pleaded.  \n48. The Hobart Brochure provides  that Defendants are “financial fiduciaries \n[that] provide advice on an independent, clien t by client basis.  We represent the \nclient, not a company.  And we are legally responsible to promote full disclosure and \ndo what is in the very best interest of our clients[.]”  (Brochure 4.) \n49. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants’ “ policy and practice ” was to send a \nwelcome email to recently engaged clients, similar to the following email sent in \nFebruary 2013 by Mr. Hobart:\n1 \nWe are a specialized group working in a unique environment with a \nproprietary process that we’ve developed over the past decade t o assist \nclients, like you, in achieving their dreams and avoiding the  common \npitfalls that can damage a retirement.   Many of our clients  who have \nworked with us for years tell us that they always wanted  to be \nrepresented by a comprehensive planning group but could  never find a \ntruly holistic financial group focused specifically on  designing, building \n \n1 Plaintiffs do not allege to whom this email was sent. \nand maintaining a successful retirement  planning [sic] with no \nunnecessary fluff or hidden costs.  I am your lead financial planner and \nI will always remain c ompletely involved with the proper management \nand oversight of your money. \n \n(SAC ¶ 61 (emphasis removed).) \n50. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants “expressly and repeatedly promised” that \nfinancial advice provided to them was “at the level of a fiduciary ,” inclu ding in \npromotional materials, public filings with the SEC, on Defendants’ website, and in \noral and written communications with Defendants.  (SAC ¶ 41.)  Plaintiffs relied on \nDefendants’ representations that they were fiduciaries prior to entrusting \nDefendants with their retirement savings.  (SAC ¶ 42.) \n1. The Burtons \n51. The Burtons met Defendants in the summer of 2011 at a solicitation dinner, \nand around that time, Mr. Hobart warned them against entrusting their retirement \nsavings to other groups because those groups “did not have the Burtons’ best interests \nat heart.”  (SAC ¶¶ 251–52.)  The Burtons made clear to Defendants that they were \nunsophisticated and “conservative investors nearing retirement[.]”  (SAC ¶¶ 254–55.) \n52. Mr. Hobart first sold Alternative Investments and a fixed-index annuity to \nthe Burtons in 2011.  (SAC ¶ 256.)  In late 2011, Mr. Hobart sold Mr. Burton “an \nunsuitable fixed-index annuity,” which Mr. Hobart represented “had a guaranteed \nreturn of six percent (6%) and had the ability to grow when the S&P 500 index was \nup.”  (SAC ¶  258.)  Mr. Burton alleges that he paid undisclosed fees on that \ninvestment “for an income rider and death benefit[.]”  (SAC ¶ 258.) \n53. Mr. Hobart and Mr. Greer also recommended that the Burtons invest in \nnon-publicly traded REITs, misrepresenting them as  “a more stable and secure \ninvestment” that provided “safe, reliable income  that would preserve and grow the \nprinciple [sic] forever.”  (SAC ¶ 259.) \n54. The Burtons allege that when they expressed concerns regarding hidden \nfees and costs, Mr. Hobart misrepresented the commissions paid to Defendants, \nclaiming that he had a “compensati on arrangement” with the sellers or sponsors of \nthe individual Alternative Investments.2  (SAC ¶ 264.) \n55. The Burtons allege that they followed all of Defendants’ investment \nrecommendations.  (SAC ¶ 266.)  The pair expressed “misgivings” for the first time in \nApril 2015 when they “asked Mr. Greer to get them out of the Alternative \nInvestments if their price ever dropped.”  (SAC ¶ 267.) \n56. Mr. Sunstrom recommended and sold the Burtons additional Alternative \nInvestments on 15 July 2015.  (SAC ¶¶ 256, 267.) \n57. Thereafter, in April 2016, “[t]he Burtons made clear they wanted out of the \ninvestments” after noticing the  reported value decreased, but Defendants “insisted” \nthe investments were suitable and that the Burtons should remain invested.  \n(SAC ¶ 268.)  Around the same time, the Burtons started to receive offers to purchase \ntheir Alternative Investments from potential buyers, and “[w]hen the REITs stopped \npaying the Burtons dividends, the Burtons were forced to sell the REITs . . . at a loss \n \n2 Plaintiffs further allege that these transactions were laden with concealed conflicts of \ninterest related to commissions and fees.  (SAC ¶¶  90, 92, 114 (noting Defendants had a \n“financial incentive” to recommend certain products, which went undisclosed until 2021).) \nin order to provide income for themselves.”  (SAC ¶  270.)  The Burtons claim they \n“remain stuck with non- traded Alternative Investments ” including “BDCA, FS \nEnergy and Power, and Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II[.]”  (SAC ¶ 271.) \n2. Ms. Byrnes \n58. Following an introduction to Hobart Financial through her mother, \nMs. Byrnes met with Mr. Hobart on 8 September 2010 to discuss her financial plan.  \n(SAC ¶¶ 273–74.)  Ms. Byrnes alleges that Mr. Hobart recommended she purchase “a \nhybrid life insurance and long-term care insurance plan.”  (SAC ¶ 274.) \n59. On 18 October 2010, Ms. Byrnes again met with Mr. Hobart and he  \nrecommended that she open a new IRA and move her 401k to Hobart Financial.  \n(SAC ¶¶ 276–77.)  During the meeting, Mr. Hobart discussed the commission and \nfees Ms. Byrnes’s previous financial advisor made when she purchased a Prudential \nvariable annuity.  (SAC ¶  279.)  He recommended that Ms. Byrnes switch from the \nPrudential annuity in favor of  “a fixed -index annuity issued by Aviva, which \n[Mr. Hobart] misrepresented paid more in interest: an ‘8% compounding income \nbenefit,’ plus an ‘8% upfront bonus.’ ”  (SAC ¶¶ 279–80.)  Mr. Hobart misrepresented \nthat Ms.  Byrnes would not incur a surrender penalty by selling the Prudential \nannuity to purchase the Aviva annuity, and he failed to disclose that he would make \na 10% commission on the purchase—roughly $32,500.00.  (SAC ¶ 282.)  \n60. On 4 February 2011, Mr. Hobart alerted Ms. Byrnes that Aviva declined \nthe transfer.  (SAC ¶  283.)  Ms.  Byrnes alleges that Mr. Hobart  advised her of  “an \neven better offer” from Security Benefit, another purveyor of fixed -index annuities, \nbut that he did not disclose that the better offer from Security Benefit had a surrender \nperiod of ten years.  (SAC ¶¶ 284–85.)  Mr. Hobart did, however, claim that any loss \nfrom surrendering the Prudential annuity “would be more than made up for by the \nbetter rate of return of the new fixed-index annuity issued by Security Benefit,” which \nMs. Byrnes alleges was untrue.  (SAC ¶ 284.) \n61. Plaintiffs allege th at Mr. Hobart engaged in similar conduct with \nMs. Gleason when he convinced her to make two annuity transfers: Mr. Hobart sold \nMs. Gleason a Great American/American Valor II Annuity for $200,000.00  in \nDecember 2006, before engaging in a n exchange in September 2009 to replace it in \nfavor of an RBC Enhanced Choice 12 Annuity; Mr.  Hobart then engaged in an \nexchange of the replacement annuity in October 2011 in favor of an annuity from \nNational Western Life Insurance Company.  (SAC ¶ 287.) \n62. On at least one occasion , Ms. Gleason sent a letter to Mr. Hobart \ncommunicating that “she felt pressured by him and did not understand the \npaperwork she was asked to sign.”  (SAC ¶ 289.)  Ms. Byrnes alleges that she and her \nmother were “unsophisticated investors” and “did not understand any of the material \nterms of the fixed-index annuities that Mr. Hobart sold to them.”  (SAC ¶ 290.) \n63. In late March or early April 2011, Ms. Byrnes called Mr. Hobart “to ask \nquestions,” and on 5 April 2011, she received an email in response from Mr. Greer \nthat “provided little clarity.”  (SAC ¶  290.)  She remained confused , and around \n1 February 2012 she met with a different financial advisor who advised her that her \ninvestments may be unsuitable.  (SAC ¶ 293.) \n64. Around July 2012, Ms. Byrnes understood that she had been deceived by \nDefendants.  (SAC ¶  293.)  Ms. Byrnes nonetheless remained invested with \nDefendants, and on 12  September 2012, emailed a list of questions to Mr. Hobart.  \n(SAC ¶  294.)  Rather than responding by email, Mr. Hobart called Ms. Byrnes  to \nanswer some of her questions but not the pointed questions she posed regarding \ncommissions.  (SAC ¶ 295.)  Ms. Byrnes followed up in December 2012, but received \n“evasive and misleading a nswers” which resulted in Ms. Byrnes remov ing her and \nher mother’s investments from Defendants’ supervision in March 2013.  \n(SAC ¶¶ 298–99, 302.) \n3. Mr. Forbis \n65. Mr. Forbis was introduced to Defendants in the fall of 2015.  (SAC ¶ 308.)  \nShortly thereafter, on 3 September 2015, Mr. Forbis received a template letter from \nDefendants scheduling an individual meeting with Mr. Greer and Mr. Hobart on \n15 September 2015.  (SAC ¶ 310.) \n66. Mr. Forbis searched Google for any lawsuits involving D efendants prior to \nengaging Mr. Hobart, and even expressed concern to Mr. Greer about “falling victim \nto a Bernie Madoff-like Ponzi scheme[.]”  (SAC ¶ 311.)  Aiming for retirement within \none year, Mr. Forbis hoped for an investment plan that would “provide  reliable \nincome in retirement ,” and he expressed concern about annuities and other \ninvestment products that “locked up retirement savings.”  (SAC ¶ 313.) \n67. On 15 October 2015, Mr. Greer made an investment recommendation to \nMr. Forbis that included Alternative Investments, which Mr. Greer described as “safe \nand secure investments.”  (SAC ¶ 314.)  When Mr. Forbis asked whether it would be \ndifficult to sell  the Alternative Investments, Mr. Greer “falsely” responded that he \ndid not know of any investors having problems selling them.  (SAC ¶ 316.)  Mr. Greer \nalso represented that there were no costs or fees associated with the Alternative \nInvestments.  (SAC ¶ 317.) \n68. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Forbis was an “unsophisticated investor” and that \nhe followed Defendants’  recommended investment plan.  (SAC ¶  319.)  Mr. Forbis \nalleges that i n November  2015, Defendants invested “$425,000 [of his investment \nfunds] in illiquid and unsuitable Alternative Investments, well in excess of 20% of \nMr. Forbis’s liquid net worth.  Of this amount, approximately $40,000 came from \nMr. Forbis’s IRA.”  (SAC ¶ 319.)  Despite reinvesting all dividends in the Alternative \nInvestments, in April 2016 Mr. Forbis  noticed a decrease in the reported principal \nvalue.  (SAC ¶  320.)  In April 2016, Mr. Forbis determined that one of his \ninvestments, which decreased by about $40,000, was “the worst investment he had \never been sold.”  (SAC ¶¶ 320–21.) \n69. Mr. Forbis thereafte r called Mr. Greer,  who switched Mr. Forbis to \nreceiving cash dividends from the Alternative Investments in late 2016 or early 2017.  \n(SAC ¶ 322.)  The dividends declined after about one year from $3,000.00 to $800.00 \nper month.  (SAC ¶  322.)  Mr.  Forbis complained to Mr. Greer again in 2017 after \nanother Alternative Investment ’s principal declined by at least $20,000.00.  \n(SAC ¶ 323.)  Mr. Forbis thereafter began receiving unsolicited offers to purchase his \nAlternative Investments “for pennies on the dollar.”  (SAC ¶ 324.)  For example, one \noffer to purchase Mr. Forbis’s shares in an Alternative Investment was for $2.60 per \nshare, but the investment was reported to be worth $10.66 per share.  (SAC ¶ 324.) \n70. Mr. Forbis remains “stuck” with several of his investments “which have lost \nsignificant amounts of principal.”  (SAC ¶ 327.) \n4. The Leshocks \n71. The Leshocks were introduced to Defendants in 2014, and on around  \n10 April 2014, the pair received a letter from Mr. Hobart indicating that he would \nserve as their lead financial planner.  (SAC ¶¶  328–29.)  T he Leshocks sought “a \nconservative, low-risk investment portfolio” and were concerned about their ability to \npay for long -term assisted living or future healthcare services.  (SAC ¶  330.)  The \nLeshocks allege that, around this same time, Mr. Hobart represented to them that \nAlternative Investments were “safe and secure.”  (SAC ¶ 331.) \n72. The Leshocks allege that , before investing, Defendants misrepresented \nseveral things by (1) “falsely minimiz[ing] limits on the liquidity of the Alternative \nInvestments”; and (2) suggesting that, if the Leshocks took out a mortgage on their \nnew residence, rather than paying for the house in c ash, the Leshocks could invest \nmore in the Alternative Investments and average a twelve percent return.  \n(SAC ¶¶ 332, 334.) \n73. On 15 April 2014, the Leshocks invested $140,000.00—“ nearly half their \nnet worth” —in five Alternative Investments .  (SAC ¶  335.)  Th e pair allege that \nMr. Hobart did not explain the risks associated with these investments.  (SAC ¶ 335.)  \nThe Leshocks reinvested their monthly dividends in the Alternative Investments .  \n(SAC ¶ 340.) \n74. In 2016, Mr. Hobart informed the Leshocks of a decline in the value of their \ninvestments, but he explained that it was the result of “a FINRA-mandated reporting \nchange” and did not reflect an actual loss.  (SAC ¶ 336.) \n75. In June 2020, the Leshocks discovered that their investments were illiquid, \nand were “shocked” to learn that they could not sell the Alternative Investments for \ntheir reported value—except for the Global Net Lease investment, which went public \nin the intervening six years—because the sale would be at a “significant discount on \ntheir original investment.”  (SAC ¶ 337.) \n5. The Ostranders \n76. The Ostranders were introduced to Defendants in the f all of 2012 and \ncommunicated their conservative investment goals to Mr. Hobart.  (SAC ¶¶ 343, 346.) \n77. The Ostranders understood from their first meeting with Mr. Hobart that \nhe was not affiliated with any company that sold investment products.  (SAC ¶ 345.)  \nMr. Hobart communicated to the Ostranders that Alternative Investments were \n“significantly less risky than in dividual stocks,” and  “were recession proof.”  \n(SAC¶ 347.)  They allege that Mr. Hobart (1)  falsely minimized the liquidity \nrestrictions of the Alternative Investments , and (2)  along with Mr.  Greer, \nmisrepresented the commissions and sales load in the Alternative Investments .  \n(SAC ¶¶ 348–49.) \n78. On 6 February 2013, the Ostranders met with Mr.  Hobart prior to \ninvesting.  (SAC ¶ 350.)  They allege that Mr. Hobart falsely stated that “all fees were \ndisclosed” and that the Ostranders would be protected from risks associated with \nmarket slides available in more conservative portfolios from other advisors.  \n(SAC ¶¶ 350–51.)  The Ostranders allege that  before investing  they specifically \nconfronted Mr. Greer and Mr. Hobart “with pointed questions about fees and \ncommissions,” and that both provided “materially false responses.”  (SAC ¶ 349.) \n79. On 16 April 2013, Mr. Hobart prepared an investment summary for the \nOstranders, recommending that the pair “ invest a  substantial portion of their \nretirement savings in unsuitable fixed-index annuities and Alternative Investments.”  \n(SAC ¶ 354.)  Ms. Ostrander read a prospectus document for one of the recommended \nalternative investments, and on 18 April 2013, emailed Mr. Hobart and Mr. Greer \nwith concerns about the high hidden fees she found.  (SAC ¶ 355.)  The email read, in \nrelevant part, as follows:  \nAnother fee question please . . . it was my understanding that we would \nnot have any fees on [the Alternative Investment], but in looking at the \nattached page from their prospectus, it appears  that there are \nsignificant fees.  Are these being waived or will we be  incurring these?  \nThey reflect a 10% sales load, which I’m  assuming was waived since \nthere was not a reduction in our initial investment, but please confirm.  \nAdditionally, the 6% annual  expense is quite high and I’m hoping we \naren’t subject to that. \n \n(SAC ¶ 355.)  On 19 April 2013, Mr. Greer responded, copying Mr. Hobart, stating \nthat the fees would “never” come out of the Ostranders’ pocket or earning s, which \nPlaintiffs allege was materially false.  (SAC ¶ 356.) \n80. Ms. Ostrander followed up with Mr. Greer the same day, asking him to \nconfirm that the Ostranders would not incur the ten percent sales load.  (SAC ¶ 357.)  \nAccording to Ms. Ostrander, Mr.  Greer called her, “lied to [her ,] and confirmed the \nOstranders would not pay the ‘10% sales load,’ otherwise disclosed in the prospectus.”  \n(SAC ¶  357; see SAC Ex. 4, ECF No. 51 [“SAC Ex. 4”] .)  On 22  April 2013, \nMs. Ostrander attempted to confirm these representations through an email to \nMr. Hobart, but he did not respond to her email inquiry.  (SAC ¶¶ 358–59.) \n81. The prospectus at issue provides that, “if you invest $100 in shares in this \noffering, only  $88.50 will actually  be invested in the Company. ”  (SAC ¶  361 \n(emphasis removed).)  But Plaintiffs allege that there were numerous other fees and \nexpenses that were not disclosed when the Ostranders ultimately invested.  ( See \nSAC ¶¶ 362–65.)  The Ostranders allege that they w ere “unable to learn the extent \nof the embedded fees” in one of their recommended Alternative Investments and were \nsimilarly unable to learn  that the “investment recommendations were tainted by \npervasive conflicts of interest related to undisclosed commissions.”  (SAC ¶ 366.) \n82. Between 2013 and May 2019, the Ostranders worked with Mr. Greer and \nthen Mr. Sunstrom when he joined Hobart Financial.  (SAC ¶¶  271–72.)  The \nOstranders were repeatedly re-assured that decreases in value were not a cause for \nconcern.  ( See SAC ¶¶  373–75.)  Ultimately, the Ostranders purchased over \n$270,000.00 in investments from Defendants, which they allege was roughly twenty \npercent of their savings.  (SAC ¶ 371.) \n83. After two non -traded REITs in which the Ostranders w ere invested went \npublic in June 2020, the share price dropped dramatically.  (SAC ¶¶  377–78.)  On \n10 July 2020, Mr. Ostrander expressed concern about the drop by email , asking  \nMr. Greer “for an accurate valuation of their existing Alternative Investments, which \nthey never received.”  (SAC ¶ 379.) \n84. The Ostranders, having lost trust in D efendants, ended the relationship \nwith them in December 2020.  (SAC ¶ 380.) \n6. Mr. Rhodes \n85. Mr. Rhodes  was introduced to Defendants in 2013 when he attended a \nsolicitation dinner, and he thereafter went to Hobart Financial for a meeting with \nMr. Hobart.  (SAC ¶¶  384, 386.)  Mr. Rhodes had a “moderate/conservative risk \ntolerance,” and Mr. Hobart represented that Alternative Investments were “safe and \nsecure,” emphasizing that Mr. Rhodes would see regular returns.  (SAC ¶ 388.) \n86. That same year, Mr. Rhodes purchased approximately $250,000.00 in \nAlternative Investments through Defendants.  (SAC ¶ 387.)  Mr. Rhodes alleges that \nDefendants did not disclose the (1) sales load on the investments or (2) commissions \nDefendants received from the sales .  (SAC ¶  387.)  Further, “[a]t all relevant times, \nMr. Hobart concealed the illiquidity and risks associated with Alternative \nInvestments and recommended that Mr. Rhodes  reinvest dividends in the  same.”  \n(SAC ¶ 391.) \n87. The reported value of Mr. Rhodes’s investments declined in April 2016, but \nMr. Greer reassured him there was nothing to worry about.  (SAC ¶ 389.)  Later that \nyear, when the investments did not rebound, Mr. Rhodes sent a letter to Defendants \n“complaining” about his investment portfolio.  (SAC ¶ 390.) \n88. Mr. Rhodes alleges that he learned for the first time that he was unable to \nsell the Alternative Investments in April 2017 because his CPA said to him, “[w] hat \nidiot put an 80- year-old in illiquid  REITs?”  (SAC ¶  391.)  Mr. Rhodes thereafter \nterminated his relationship with Defendants and transferred his investments to \nTD Ameritrade.  (SAC ¶ 391.) \n7. Mr. Tanger \n89. Mr. Tanger was introduced to Defendants in 2014 and had his first meeting \nat Hobart Financial on 14 October 2014.  (SAC ¶ 394.)  O n 25 November 2014, \nMr. Tanger met with Mr. Greer, who largely served as Mr. Tanger’s primary contact.  \n(SAC ¶¶  398, 402.)  Mr. Tanger communicated to Mr. Greer his conservative \ninvestment goals and his hope to retire in 2016.  (SAC ¶ 399.) \n90. During the November 2014 meeting, Mr. Tanger alleges that Mr. Greer \nmisrepresented that the Alternative Investments: (1) would be liquid within one to \nthree years ; (2) produced a “stable,” “reliable” divid e[n]d; and (3) had no hidden \ncommissions or fees.  (SAC ¶¶ 400–02.)  Mr. Tanger trusted Defendants and invested \nabout $300,000.00 in several Alternative Investments recommended by Defendants.  \n(SAC ¶ 403.) \n91. Around April 2016, the reported value of Mr. Tanger’s investments  \ndecreased by approximately ten percent.  (SAC ¶ 404.)  Mr. Greer reassured him that \nthe decline resulted from “merely a reporting change ,” and when Mr. Tanger asked \nwhether he should sell or make changes to his Alternative Investments , Mr. Greer \nsaid that he “still could not sell the Alternative Investments.”  (SAC ¶¶ 404–05.) \n92. Mr. Tanger alleges that he was never told that the dividends could decrease \nor that he could stop receiving dividends altogether.  (SAC ¶ 407.)  Until mid-2019, \nDefendants reinvested Mr. Tanger’s dividends in the Alternative Investments .  \n(SAC ¶ 412.) \n93. Plaintiffs allege that “[b]y late May or early June 2019, Mr. Tanger came to \nthe conclusion that the  Alternative Investments sold to him by [Defendants] were \nunsuitable investments, and he attempted to  redeem his shares at every \nopportunity.”  (SAC ¶ 410.)  When Mr. Tanger asked Mr. Greer for help liquidating \nhis Alternative Investments, Mr. Greer allegedly told Mr. Tanger that he was “on his \nown.”  (SAC ¶ 411.) \n8. The Wilshires \n94. The Wilshires met  Defendants in 2013 and that same year  entrusted \nDefendants with “some of their retirement savings” to be invested into a fixed-index \nannuity and in Alternative Investments.  (See SAC ¶¶ 416–18.)  Mr. Hobart invested \n$250,000 of Ms. Wilshire’s IRA in a fixed-index annuity, and “ around March 2015, \n$735,000 of Dr. Wilshire’s profit -sharing retirement account in five Alternative \nInvestments.”  (SAC ¶ 418.) \n95. The Wilshires allege that Mr. Hobart misrepresented the commissions that \nDefendants would receive, informing the Wilshires that the full purchase price for \nthe relevant investments “would be invested on their behalf, without accounting for \nany sales load.”  (SAC ¶ 419.) \n96. Mr. Hobart “passed off” the Wilshires to Mr. Sunstrom after the March 2015 \ninvestments.  (SAC ¶ 420.)  In April 2016, the Wilshires “observed a six-figure decline \nin the reported value of  the Alternative Investments,” but Mr. Sunstrom reassured \nthe Wilshir es that the investments would rebound.   (SAC ¶  421.)  The Wilshires \ncontinued to reinvest dividends in the Alternative Investments until 2018.  \n(SAC ¶ 422.) \n97. The Wilshires first began questioning the suitability of their investments \nin 2020, when dividends “dried up” and one of the REITs suffered a 2.43:1 reverse \nstock split.  (SAC ¶ 423.) \n98. The Wilshires allege that they suffered great loss on their principal in the \nAlternative Investments and that they remain stuck with several non-publicly traded \nAlternative Investments .  (SAC ¶  424.)  Notwithstanding  that the fixed -index \nannuity Ms. Wilshire was invested in produced “almost zero return over eight years,” \nPlaintiffs allege that it was redeemed f or roughly $267,000.00  in April 2021.  \n(SAC ¶ 425.) \n9. Dr. Zucker \n99. Dr. Zucker was introduced to Defendants in late 2011 when he attended \nHobart-sponsored events, and around this same time, met with Mr. Hobart at Hobart \nFinancial.  (SAC ¶ ¶ 428, 431.)  Mr. Hobart allegedly misrepresented the volatility \nand in come generation of  Alternative Investments and fixed -index annuities , \ndescribing them as “strong and secure ,” as he did with the other Plaintiffs.   \n(SAC ¶ 431.)  Mr. Hobart did not disclose that these investment products were \nilliquid, instead promising that “if Dr. Zucker followed his direction, he would earn  \nbetween $10,000 to $15,000 per month in reliable dividends.”  (SAC ¶¶ 432–33.) \n100. “Dr. Zucker followed Mr. Hobart’s recommendations and, from \napproximately December 2011 through 2013, invested around $1 million in \nAlternative Investments and fixed-index annuities.”  (SAC ¶ 437.)  Prior to investing \nwith Defendants, Dr. Zucker was invested in a diversified portfolio of mutual funds \nand other investments.  (SAC ¶ 427.) \n101. Dr. Zucker alleges that he did not und erstand the “complicated \nterminology” used by Mr. Hobart, and that Mr. Hobart failed to explain any risks that \nmight be associated with the recommended investments.  (See SAC ¶¶ 435–36.) \n102. In April 2016, when Dr. Zucker’s investments dropped by double -digit \npercentages in one month, Defendants reassured him that the drop was the result of \na reporting change  and that the value of the investments would rebound.  \n(SAC ¶ 438.) \n103. Mr. Hobart recommended that Dr. Zucker reinvest his dividends into the \nAlternative Investments, and Dr. Zucker alleges that he “did not realize” taking cash \ndividends was an option until the summer of 2021.  (SAC ¶ 439.)  Dr. Zucker met with \nMr. Woodrum, a junior financial advisor for Defendants,  around the same time  he \nwas advised by Mr. Hobart to reinvest his dividends .  (SAC ¶  439.)  Mr. Woodrum \nrecommended, however, that Dr. Zucker discontinue reinvesting his dividends and to \nsell for a loss, telling him to “get out of these [Alternative Investments], they’re dead.”  \n(SAC ¶ 439 (modification in original).) \n104. Dr. Zucker continues to try to liquidate his Alternative Investments but is \nunable to sell them because four of the five Alternative Investments he is invested in \nstill have not gone public.  (SAC ¶ 439.) \nE. The FINRA Disclosure Changes in 2016 \n105. April 2016 appears to be the turning -point for many Plaintiffs.  ( See, e.g., \nSAC ¶¶ 268, 320–21, 336, 389, 404–05, 421, 438.)  Nearly all Plaintiffs allege that the \nvalue of their investments decline d in April 2016 and that Defendants offered them \nreassurances.  By way of example, Defendants “ continued to recommend the \nPlaintiffs hold onto Alternative Investments and reinvest dividends into Alternative \nInvestments[, causing] Plaintiffs to buy additional shares of the  Alternative \nInvestments for years after April 2016.”  (SAC ¶ 193; see infra ¶ 109.) \n106. Plaintiffs allege that, prior to April 2016, Defendants sold them Alternative \nInvestments at the “gross offering price ,” or the price offered during the initial \noffering period.  (SAC ¶ 177.)  The price was typically $10.00 per share and remained \nconstant until the offering period concluded.  (SAC ¶ 178; supra ¶ 41.) \n107. On 11 April 2016, the SEC modified NASD Rule 2340—now FINRA \nRule 2231—to require “increased transparency in the reported per- share value of \nAlternative Investments on periodic statements provided to retail investors.”  \n(SAC ¶ 180.)  From that point forward, account statements were required to reflect a \nper-share estimated value in the form of (a) the net investment methodology, or \n(b) the appraised value methodology.  (SAC ¶  181.)  T he rule change also requi red \naccount statements to disclose that Alternative Investments “ are generally illiquid \nand that, even if a customer is able  to sell the securities, the price received may be \nless than the per-share estimated value[.]”  (SAC ¶ 182.) \n108. On 1 April 2016, just before the effective date of the new rule,  Defendants \nemailed all their clients that held Alternative Investments , including Plaintiffs .  \n(SAC ¶ 185.)  Plaintiffs allege that the email “ (a) minimized the impact of the \nregulatory reporting change, (b)  reassured [the] clients that the Alternative \nInvestments remained strong and secure investments, and (c) recommended that \n[the] clients continue to hold and reinvest dividends into the Alternative \nInvestments.”  (SAC ¶ 186.) \n109. Plaintiffs allege that they received various assurances from Defendants \nduring this time : t he Burtons allege that Mr. Hobart claimed “the value of the \nAlternative Investments would rebound when they went public ,” (SAC ¶  268); the \nLeshocks were told that, “ although it appeared their A lternative Investments had \ndeclined in value, this was simply due to a FINRA -mandated reporting change, not \nreflective of a loss,” (SAC ¶ 336); and “Mr. Rhodes communicated with Mr. Greer, who \nblamed the change on ‘bookkeepers’ or ‘bean counters’ and assured Mr. Rhodes there \nwas nothing to worry about —that the value of  the Alternative Investments would \nrebound,” (SAC ¶ 389). \n110. Notwithstanding Defendants’ assurances to Plaintiffs and other client s, \nDefendants stopped selling Alternative Investments around April 2016.  (SAC ¶ 189.) \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n111. The Court sets forth herein  only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motion. \n112. This action was initiated by sixteen plaintiff s on 1 February 2022 with a \nRule 3 Application.  (See ECF No. 3.)  On 21 February 2022, the Complaint was filed \nby Plaintiffs’ counsel.  (ECF No. 4.)  On 24 March 2022, this action was designated as \na mandatory complex business case, (ECF No. 1), and it was assigned to the \nundersigned on 17 May 2022, (ECF No. 13). \n113. Following the filing of an  Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 9), Defendants \nsought dismissal of all claims against them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), (ECF Nos. 22–\n23).  After full briefing and a hearing on that motion, (ECF Nos. 29 –31), the Court \ndetermined that a more definite statement pursuant to Rule 12(e) was “both \nnecessary and appropriate,” and therefore Plaintiffs were ordered to file a  Second \nAmended Complaint that more clearly set forth the facts and claims alleged as to \neach Plaintiff against each Defendant , see Baker v. Hobart Fin. Grp. , 2023 NCBC \nLEXIS 45, at **9–10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 22, 2023). \n114. On 1 May 2023, Plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint.  (See SAC.)  \nPlaintiffs allege seven claims for relief against Defendants: (1 ) breach of fiduciary \nduty (“Count One”), (SAC ¶¶  444–59); (2) constructive fraud (“Count Two”), \n(SAC ¶¶ 460–67); (3) violation of the North Carolina Securities Act  (“NCSA”), \nN.C.G.S. § 78A-1 et seq. (“Count Three”), (SAC ¶¶ 468–79); (4) violation of the North \nCarolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“UDTPA”), N.C.G.S. §  75-1.1 et \nseq. (“Count Four”), (SAC ¶¶  480–87); (5) fraud (“Count Five”), (SAC ¶¶  488–96); \n(6) professional negligence (“Count Six”), (SAC ¶¶  497–506); and (7) negligent \nmisrepresentation (“Count Seven”), (SAC ¶¶ 507–13).  As set forth in more detail in \nthe Second Amended Complaint, most Plaintiffs join in only some claims and seek \nrelief from only some Defendants.  However, all Plaintiffs join in bringing Count Two \nfor constructive fraud against Defendants.  (See SAC ¶ 461.) \n115. Defendants thereafter filed the Motion, again seeking dismissal of all \nclaims against them pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6).  (See Mot.; Defs.’ Br. Supp. \nMot., ECF No. 73 [“Br. Supp.”].)  \n116. On 16 October 2023, f ollowing full briefing on the Motion but prior to the \nhearing, Plaintiff s William Baker III, individually, on behalf of his IRA , and as \npersonal representative of Nancy Baker and her IRA, and Joyce Elizabeth Baker, as \nbeneficiary to Nancy Baker, voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims against \nDefendants.  (ECF No. 79.) \n117. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on 24 October 2023 (the “Hearing”), \nat which all parties were present and represented through counsel.  (See ECF No. 78.) \n118. The Motion is ripe for resolution. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n119. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6), the Court \nreviews the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint in the light most favorable \nto Plaintiffs.  See Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, Inc. , 370 N.C. 1, 5 (2017).  \nThe Court’s inquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint \n. . . are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal \ntheory[.]”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. 669, 670 (1987)  (citation \nomitted).  The Court accepts all well -pleaded factual allegations in the relevant \npleading as true.  See Krawiec v. Manly , 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018).  T he Court is \ntherefore not required “to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, \nunwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. \nv. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274 (2005) (cleaned up). \n120. Furthermore, the Court “can reject allegations that are contradicted by the \ndocuments attached, specifically referred to, or incorporated by reference in the \ncomplaint.”  Moch v. A.M. Pappas & Assocs., LLC , 251 N.C. App. 198, 206 (2016) \n(citation omitted).  The Court may consider these attached or incorporated documents \nwithout converting the Rule  12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment.  \nId. (citation omitted).  Moreover, the Court “may properly consider documents which \nare the subject of a plaintiff’s complaint and to which the complaint specifically refers \neven though they are presented by the defendant.”  Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin , \n147 N.C. App. 52, 60 (2001) (citation omitted). \n121. Our Supreme Court has observed  that “[i]t is w ell-established that \ndismissal pursuant to Rule  12(b)(6) is proper when ‘(1)  the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals \nthe absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3)  the complaint discloses \nsome fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.’  ”  Corwin v. British Am. \nTobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoting Wood v. Guilford Cty., 355 N.C. 161, \n166 (2002)).  This standard of review for Rule 12(b)(6) motions is the standard our \nSupreme Court “uses routinely .  . . in assessing the sufficiency of complaints in the \ncontext of complex commercial litigation.”  Id. at 615 n.7 (citations omitted). \nV. ANALYSIS \n122. Defendants contend that dismissal of all claims with prejudice is proper.  \n(Mot. 4.)  Defendants argue that: (1) Counts One, Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven \nfail as to the Leshocks, the Ostranders, Mr. Tanger, the Wilshires, and Dr. Zucker \nbecause those claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and that \nCount Two as to Ms. Byrnes is similarly time barred, (Mot. 4–5); (2) Counts Five and \nSeven fail as to the Leshocks, the Ostranders, Mr. Tanger,  the Wilshires, and \nDr. Zucker because the allegations do not meet the particularized pleading standard \nset forth in Rule 9(b), (Mot. 6–7); and (3) the claims alleged otherwise fail to state a \nvalid cause of action, (Mot. 5).  The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn, \nbeginning with the arguments related to the applicable limitations periods. \nA. Statute of Limitations Issues \n123. “A statute of limitations can provide the basis for dismissal on a \nRule 12(b)(6) motion if the face of the complaint establishes that plaintiff’s claim is \nso barred.”  Soderlund v. N.C. Sch. of the Arts, 125 N.C. App. 386, 389 (1997) (citation \nomitted).  “Dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) on the grounds that a claim is barred \nby the statute of limitations is proper only when all the facts necessary to establish \nthat the claim is time -barred are either alleged or admitted in the complaint, \nconstruing the complaint liberally in favor of plaintiff.”  Lau v. Constable, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 10, at **10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 7, 2017) (cleaned up) (citing Fox v. Sara Lee \nCorp., 210 N.C. App. 706, 708-09 (2011)). \n124. The Court begins the statute of li mitations analysis by first addressing \nMs. Byrnes’s claim at Count Two,  and then turns to Counts One, Three, Four, Five, \nSix, and Seven related to the other Plaintiffs. \n1. Count Two as to Ms. Byrnes \n125. Defendants contend that Ms. Byrnes’s claim for constructive fraud is time-\nbarred.  (Br. Supp. 16.)  Plaintiffs contend the  claim is  not time -barred because \nMs. Byrnes did not discover or have reason to know the basis for her claim until \nJuly 2012.  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. 17, ECF No. 76 [“Br. Opp.”]  (citing SAC ¶  293).)  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel misunderstands the standard. \n126. “[T]he the limitations period applicable to constructive fraud claims is ten \nyears[.]”  Chisum v. Campagna, 376 N.C. 680, 707 (2021) (citing N.C.G.S. § 1-56(a)).  \nThus, a cause of action for constructive f raud, “may not be commenced more than \n10 years after the cause of action has accrued.”  N.C.G.S. § 1-56(a).  “A cause of action \ngenerally accrues when the right to institute and maintain a suit arises.”  Piles v. \nAllstate Ins. Co., 187 N.C. App. 399, 403 (2007) (citation omitted). \n127. Count Two is based on  allegations that Defendants breached a fiduciary \nduty owed to Plaintiffs by  recommending unsuitable Alternative Investments and \nfixed-index annuities for Defendants’ own benefit.  (See SAC ¶¶ 462–64.)  Therefore, \nit appears that the question, for purposes of determining when the limitations period \nruns, is when did Defendants recommend that Ms. Byrnes purchase  unsuitable \ninvestments? \n128. Ms. Byrnes met with Mr. Hobart in September and October 2010,  and she \nalleges that Mr. Hobart made various misrepresentations during that meeting about \nexpected dividends and his own commissions for certain purchases.  (See SAC ¶¶ 274, \n276, 282.)  Further, i n February 2011, Mr. H obart recommended and executed the \nannuity transfer for Ms. Byrnes  by selling her Prudential variable annuity and \npurchasing one from Security Benefit.  (See SAC ¶¶ 282–84.) \n129. Ms. Byrnes ’s mother, “Ms. Gleason [,] wrote a letter to Mr.  Hobart \nevidencing that, on one or more occasion, she communicated to Mr.  Hobart that she \nfelt pressured by him and did not understand the paperwork she was asked to sign.”  \n(SAC ¶ 289.)  Further, in March or April 2011, Ms. Byrnes called Mr. Hobart to ask \nquestions about her investments, and on 5 April 2011, she received an email from \nMr. Greer providing “little clarity[.]”  (SAC ¶ 290.) \n130. Even reviewing the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint in the \nlight most favorable to Ms. Byrnes , Defendants’ recommendation regarding \nAlternative Investments and fixed -index annuities occurred on or around \nFebruary 2011 when Mr. Hobart suggested Ms. Byrnes purchase a different fixed-\nindex annuity and then executed on that advice.  ( See SAC ¶¶ 283, 462.)  Thus, in \nFebruary 2011, the ten-year statute of limitations for Ms. Byrnes’s constructive fraud \nclaim began to run.  As for her late mother, Ms. Gleason, it appears that the last  \nallegation of investment recommendations or advice occurred in October 2011.  \n(SAC ¶ 287.)  As noted above, this action was initiated on 1 February 2022.   ( See \nsupra ¶ 112.)  Therefore, over ten years passed between when the limitations period \nbegan to run and when this action was filed. \n131. The Court determines that the allegations contained in  the Second \nAmended Complaint establish as a matter of law that  Ms. Byrnes’s claim , \nindividually and as beneficiary to Ms. Gleason’s estate, is time-barred.  The question \nis not when Ms.  Byrnes knew or should have known  of the wrong, but rather when \nthe act giving rise to the cause of action occurred .  It was on that date that her  \nconstructive fraud claim accrued. \n132. Therefore, the Motion is hereby GRANTED in part, and Ms. Byrnes’s claim \nunder Count Two is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice.3 \n2. Counts One,  Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven  as to \nMr. Tanger and Dr. Zucker \n \n133. Defendants similarly seek dismissal of Counts One, Three, Four, Five, Six, \nand Seven as to Mr. Tanger and Dr. Zucker, contending that Plaintiffs’ counsel  \npreviously conceded in briefing and at oral argument that these two plaintiffs did not \nfile the claims “within a five-year statute of limitations.”  (Br. Supp. 4 n.1; Br. Opp’n \nMot. Dismiss Am. Compl. 35  n.12, ECF No.  29.)  Defendants argue that this \nadmission bars Mr. Tanger and Dr. Zucker’s claims, except their constructive fraud \nclaims.  (Br. Supp. 4, 25–27.) \n \n3 “The decision to dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the discretion of the trial \ncourt.”  First Fed. Bank v. Aldridge, 230 N.C. App. 187, 191 (2013). \n134. “A judicial admission is a formal concession which is made by a party  \n[(usually through counsel)] in the course of litigation for the purpose of withdrawing \na particular fact from the realm of dispute.”  Outer Banks Contractors, Inc. v. Forbes, \n302 N.C. 599, 604 (1981); see Aspen Specialty Ins. Co. v. Nucor Corp. , 2022 NCBC  \nLEXIS 134, at **16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 8, 2022). \n135. In its Order and Opinion Requiring Plaintiffs to File a Second Amended \nComplaint, the Court wrote that “Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint should itself reflect \nthis concession.  In other words, if Plaintiff recognizes that its claim is barred by the \napplicable statute of limitations, Plaintiff should not bring the claim.”  (ECF No. 43.) \n136. The concession by Plaintiffs’ counsel that these claims are untimely entitles \nDefendants to dismissal of those claims, as Plaintiffs did not respond to the assertion \nin the briefing  and have therefore not met their burden of demonstrating that the \nlimitations period has yet to run.  See McFee v. Presley , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 173, at \n**9–10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 28, 2023) (dismissi ng a claim at summary judgment \nbecause plaintiff’s counsel conceded at the hearing that the claim was untimely). \n137. As a result, the Motion is GRANTED in part as to all of Mr. Tanger and \nDr. Zucker’s claims, except for Count Two, and those claims are hereby DISMISSED \nwith prejudice. \n3. Counts One, Three, Five, Six, and Seven  as to the Leshocks, \nthe Ostranders, and the Wilshires \n \n138. The Court next turns to Defendants’ argument that the Leshocks, the \nOstranders, and the Wilshires’ claims, as applicable, under Counts One, Three, Five, \nSix, and Seven fail because those claims are barred by the applicable statute of \nlimitations.  (See Mot. 4–5.)  The Court addresses Count Four separately in the next \nsection, as it is subject to a different limitations period.  (See infra § V.A.4.) \n139. The Leshocks and the Ostranders allege claims for relief under Count One \nand Count Six, each of which has a three -year statute of limitations.  Scott & Jones, \nInc. v. Carlton Ins. Agency, Inc., 196 N.C. App. 290, 297 (2009) (statute of limitations \nfor a negligence claim); Lau, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 71, at *22 (statute of limitations for \na breach of fiduciary duty claim).  The same Plaintiffs, joined by the Wilshires, bring \nCounts Three, Five, and Seven, which similarly have a three -year statute of \nlimitations.  N.C.G.S. §§  1-52(9), 78A-56(f) (limitations periods for fraud and \nviolations of the NCSA, respectively); Guyton v. FM Lending Servs., 199 N.C. App. 30, \n35 (2009) (statute of limitations for negligent misrepresentation claim). \ni. Count Six: Professional Negligence \n140. Plaintiffs have not offered, and the Court has not located, any authority to \nsupport the legal proposition that a professional negligence claim exists in North \nCarolina for the negligent acts of investment advisors.   See Aldridge v. Metro. Life \nIns. Co., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *137 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 31, 2019). \n141. North Carolina General Statutes  § 1-52 imposes a three -year statute of \nlimitations for negligence actions, Scott & Jones, 196 N.C. App. at 297, which accrue \nwhen the wrong giving rise to the right to bring suit is committed, “ even though the \ndamages at that time [may] be nominal and the injuries cannot be discovered until a \nlater date[,]” Harrold v. Dowd, 149 N.C. App. 777, 781 (2002) ; see Carpenter v. N.C. \nDep’t of Health & Human Servs., 2023 N.C. App. LEXIS 52, at *8 (2023) (unpublished) \n(following the rule stated in Harrold). \n142. Plaintiffs allege that their negligence claim arises out of Defendants’ failure \nto: (1) investigate the recomm ended securities or have any reasonable basis for \nrecommending Alternative Investments to Plaintiffs ; (2) perform investment \nadvisory services with the requisite knowledge, skill, and judgment; and (3) stop the \nreinvestment of  dividends in the Alternative Investments.   (SAC ¶¶  502–04.)  \nPlaintiffs allege that the “last wrongful act or omission” did not occur until \n1 February 2019.  (SAC ¶  505.)  Thus, Plaintiffs’  negligence claim is based on  \nDefendants’ conduct at the initial sale of the investments and the reinvestment of \ndividends thereafter, if the relevant plaintiff elected to reinvest dividends in the ir \nAlternative Investments. \n143. Defendants argue that  the wrongful conduct alleged—recommending and \nselling the Alternative I nvestments—ceased by 2016 at the latest, based on the \nallegations in the Second Amended Complaint.  (Br. Supp. 5 (citing SAC ¶ 189).) \n144. The Second Amended Complaint  states that the Leshocks reinvested \nmonthly dividends in re commended investments, (SAC ¶ 340), but the Ostranders \ntook cash dividends, (SAC ¶ 373).  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants last gave \ninvestment advice or recommendations to the Leshocks in 2016, (SAC ¶ 336), and to \nthe Ostranders on 2 August 2017 at the latest, (SAC ¶ 374).  Notwithstanding these \nallegations, Plaintiffs argu e that the continuing wrong doctrine protects their \nnegligence claim from dismissal. \n145. “Our Supreme Court has  recognized the continuing wrong doctrine as an \nexception to the general rule that a claim accrues when the right to maintain a suit \narises.”  Babb v. Graham, 190 N.C. App. 463, 482 (2008) (citing Williams v. Blue Cross \nBlue Shield of N.C. , 357 N.C. 170, 178– 79 (2003)) .  Under the continuing wrong \ndoctrine, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the unlawful act ceases.  \nSoft Line, S.p.A. v. Italian Homes, LLC , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 6, at **13 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Jan. 16, 2015) (citing Marzec v. Nye, 203 N.C. App. 88, 94 (2010)). \n146.  However, the continuing wrong doctrine is not easily invoked.  Id.  For the \ndoctrine to apply, Plaintiffs—who raised this exception—must show that Defendants \n“continuously committed unlawful acts, not merely that there were continual ill \neffects from an original unlawful act.”  Id. (citing Marzec, 203 N.C. App. at 94). \n147. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ reinvestment of dividends serves as the \ncontinuing wrong .  (Br. Opp. 26.)  However, the Ostranders took cash dividends .  \nThus, the last act by Defendants potentially giving rise to the Ostranders’ negligence \nclaim occurred on 2 August 2017 when Mr. Sunstrom assured the Ostranders to “stay \nthe course with Alternative Investments.”  (SAC ¶  375.)  T hree years following \n2 August 2017 was 2 August 2020 —nearly six months before this action was \ninitiated. \n148. Therefore, the Court GRANTS in part the Motion as to the Ostranders’ \nclaim for relief under Count Six and that claim is hereby DISMISSED  with \nprejudice. \n149. The Leshocks, however, allege that they  reinvested dividends through at \nleast 2020.  (SAC ¶ 340.)  Reading  the allegations in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, the Court determines that the Leshocks’ negligence claim under Count Six \nis not time-barred.  See Piles, 187 N.C. App. at 405 (where there are allegations in \nthe complaint sufficient to support an inference that the limitations period has not \nexpired, it is error to find that claims are time-barred).  Therefore, the Court DENIES \nin part the Motion as to the Leshocks’ claim for relief alleged under Count Six.4 \nii. Count Three: Violations of the NCSA \n150. The Leshocks, the Ostranders, and the Wilshires each allege violations of \nthe NCSA under Count Three. \n151. While claims for violations of the NCSA are subject to a three-year statute \nof limitations, \n[g]enerally, the suit must be initiated within five years following the sale \nor the rendering of the investment advice regardless of when the \nplaintiff discovered the violation.   However, where the plaintiff alleges \nthat the de fendant acted fraudulently or deceitfully in concealing a \nviolation of the NCSA .  . . , a discovery rule applies, and the five -year \nlimitation does not necessarily bar the plaintiff ’s ability to bring the \nclaim. \n \nAldridge, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *55. \n152. Defendants contend that all sales of securities occurred no later than 2015.  \n(Br. Supp. 6.)  Thus, they argue that  Count Three is barred since this action was \ninitiated more than five years later.  (Br. Supp. 6.) \n \n4 This determination is without prejudice to application of the statute of limitations with \nrespect to this claim at a later stage of the litigation on a more developed record. \n153. However, th e Leshocks, the Ostranders, and the Wilshires allege that \nDefendants actively concealed their violations of the NCSA, including  through their \nuntrue statements and omissions regarding the Alternative Investments.  ( Br. \nOpp. 27–28; SAC ¶¶ 472, 474.)  Theref ore, at this time, the Court cannot conclude \nfrom the face of the Second Amended Complain t that Plaintiffs’ NCSA claims are \ntime-barred. \n154. Therefore, the Court DENIES in part the Motion  as to the Leshocks, the \nOstranders, and the Wilshires’ claim under Count Three.5 \niii. Counts One, Five, and Seven \n155. Defendants seek dismissal of Counts One, Five, and Seven , arguing that \neven with the benefit of the discovery rule, Plaintiffs’ claims are untimely.  (Br. Supp. \n7.) \n156. Claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation \nare each subject to a three- year statute of limitations that begins to run when the \nclaimant knew , or by  exercising due diligence should have known,  of the facts \nconstituting the b asis for the claim.  Lau , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 71, at *22  (breach of \nfiduciary duty); Forbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, 524–25 (2007) (fraud); Guyton, 199 N.C. \nApp. at 35 (quoting Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 666 (1997))  (“A \nclaim for negligent misrepresentation does  not accrue until two events occur: first, \nthe claimant suffers harm because of the misrepresentation, and second, the claimant \ndiscovers the misrepresentation.” (cleaned up)). \n \n5 This determination is without prejudice to application of the statute of limitations with \nrespect to this claim at a later stage of the litigation on a more developed record. \n157. Under the discovery rule, the  limitations perio d begins to run when a \nplaintiff “first becomes aware of facts and circumstances that would enable him to \ndiscover the defendant’s wrongdoing in the exercise of due diligence.”  Doe v. Roman \nCatholic Diocese, 242 N.C. App. 538, 543 (2015) (citing Toomer v. Branch Banking & \nTr. Co., 171 N.C. App. 58, 66 (2005)).   Even where there is a special relationship \nbetween plaintiffs and defendants, this duty of inquiry begins “when an event occurs \nto ‘excite [the aggrieved party’s] suspicion or put her on such inquiry as should have \nled, in the exercise of due diligence, to a discovery of the [claim].’ ”  Forbis, 361 N.C. \nat 525 (quoting Vail v. Vail, 233 N.C. 109, 117 (1951) (modifications in original)). \n158. In this case, the allegations do not admit facts that would properly permit \nthe Court to determine as a matter of law that the claims are time-barred. \n159. The Leshocks and the Ostranders’ claims at Counts One, Five, and Seven \nare based on allegations that Defendants: (1) recommended unsuitable Alternative \nInvestments and fixed-index annuities; (2) concealed and misrepresented conflicts of \ninterest that impacted their recommendations; and (3) concealed and misrepresented \nthe material terms of the Alternative Investments and fixed -index annuities, \nincluding fees, liquidity, and income generation.  (SAC ¶¶ 455–57, 490–94, 510.)  The \nWilshires join only in Counts Five and Seven on the same bases.  (SAC ¶¶ 489, 508.) \n160. Defendants contend that no later than 2017,  Plaintiffs were armed with \nsufficient information to discover, with due diligence, the misrepresentations at issue.  \n(Br. Supp. 8.)  Defendants direct the Court’s attention to their April 2016 disclosure \nof the  NASD rule change as the  inquiry-triggering event.  (Br. Supp. 8 (citing \nSAC ¶¶ 336, 421); see also SAC ¶ 374.) \n161. However, the Ostranders allege that they did inquire and  in turn received \na false response because Mr. Sunstrom continued to recommend that they “stay the \ncourse” with their Alternative Investments .  (SAC ¶  375.)  The Wilshires also \ninquired further, alleging that when they observed the decline, Mr. Sunstrom \nreassured them that their investments would recover.  (SAC ¶ 421.)  Plaintiffs argue \nthat the “April 2016 email continued Defendants’ pattern and practice of concealing \nthe material risks, liquidity restrictions, and embedded fees in the Alternative \nInvestments.”  (Br. Opp. 24 (citation omitted).) \n162. Reading the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court \ndetermines that Plaintiffs have sufficiently met their burden of demonstrating, at \nthis preliminary stage, that these claims were filed within the applicable limitations \nperiod.  (Br. Opp. 23 –24 (citing SAC ¶¶  336–37, 380–81).)  To determine otherwise \nwould require the Court to perform a more fact -intensive inquiry  that is  \ninappropriate at this stage.  See Beam v. Sunset Fin. Servs., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 56, \nat **35 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2019) (“Whether Plaintiffs need to prove that [they] \ncould not have discovered Defendant’s actionable conduct earlier is a question for a \ndifferent day, and presumably one for the factfinder or for th e Court on a more \ndeveloped record.”). \n163. Therefore, the Court DENIES in part the Motion  to the extent it seeks \ndismissal of Counts One, F ive, and Seven on the basis that the claims  are time -\nbarred.6 \n4. Count 4: Violations of the UDTPA \n164.  The Wilshires allege violations of the UDTPA in Count Four.  Defendants \nseek dismissal of that claim, arguing that it was not timely filed.  (See Br. Supp. 7.) \n165. Violations of the UDTPA have a four-year statute of limitations measured \nfrom when a plaintiff should have discovered the misconduct giving rise to a claim.  \nN.C.G.S. § 75-16.2; Nash v. Motorola Commc’ns & Elec. , 96 N.C. App. 329, 331 –32 \n(1989). \n166. Count Four  is premised on Defendants’ alleged misre presentations \nregarding the terms of the  fixed-index annuities  they sold to some Plaintiffs .  \n(SAC ¶¶ 482–84.)  B ecause the claim appears to be  premised on Plaintiffs’ fraud \nclaim, and the Court has already determined that claim is not ripe for dismissal based \non the statute of limitations  defense, Count Four is similarly  not ripe for dismissal, \nat least based on timeliness.  See Nash, 96 N.C. App. at 331–32. \n167. Therefore, the Court DENIES in part the Motion  to the extent it seeks \ndismissal of Count Four on the basis that the claim is untimely.7 \n \n6 This determination is without prejudice to the raising of the defense at a later stage on a \nmore developed record. \n \n7 This determination is without prejudice to the raising of the defense at a later stage on a \nmore developed record. \nB. Claims Which Require Rule 9(b) Particularity \n168. Rule 9 requires that  claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation be \npleaded with particularity.   N.C.G.S. §  1A-1, Rule 9(b); Value Health Sols. Inc. v. \nPharm. Research Assocs. , 385 N.C. 250, 265 –66 (2023) .  “A pleader meets the \nrequirements of [Rule 9] when its fraud claim alleges the ‘time, place, and content of \nthe fraudulent representation, identity of the person making the representation, and \nwhat was obtained as a result of the fraudulent acts or representations.’ ”  Lawrence \nv. UMLIC-Five Corp., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at * *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 18, 2007) \n(citing Bob Timberlake Collection, Inc. v. Edwards, 176 N.C. App. 33, 39 (200 6)).  \n“Mere generalities and conclusory allegations of fraud will not suffice. ”  Sharp v. \nTeague, 113 N.C. App. 589, 597 (1994). \n1. Count Five: Fraud \n169. Plaintiffs must allege the five essential elements of a fraud claim: \n“(1) [f]alse representation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated \nto deceive, (3)  made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, [and] \n(5) resulting in damage to the injured party.”  Ragsdale v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, \n138 (1974) (citing Pritchard v. Dailey , 1 68 N.C. 330, 332 (1915) ).  In addition, \nPlaintiffs’ reliance on the fraudulent misrepresentation “must be reasonable.”  Forbis, \n361 N.C. at 527 (citing Johnson v. Owens, 263 N.C. 754, 757 (1965)).  Reliance is not \nreasonable if a plaintiff exercising reasonable diligence fails to make any independent \ninvestigation as to the truth of the assertion.  Calloway v. Wyatt, 246 N.C. 129, 134–\n35 (1957). \n170. The Leshocks and the Ostranders each allege claims for relief under Count \nFive against the Hobart Entities, Mr. Hobart, and Mr. Greer.  (SAC ¶¶ 489.b.–c.)  The \nWilshires allege a claim for relief under Count Five against the Hobart Entities, \nMr. Hobart, and Mr. Sunstrom.  (SAC ¶ 489.e.) \ni. The Leshocks \n171. The Leshocks alleg e two false representations in detail : (1 ) that “[ i]n \nmeetings at the Hobart Headquarters in April 2014, Mr. Hobart represented the \nAlternative Investments were safe and secure investments, like the walls of [ a] \nhouse[,]” (SAC ¶ 331); and (2) that  \nMr. Greer completed a “suitability checklist,” prior to the sale of \nAlternative Investments to the Leshocks.  The document lists the \n“surrender periods and percentages” of redemption allowed for each of \nfive Alternative Investments. In the document, Hobart represented the \nAlternative Investments had “limited liquidity,” but only because there \nwas to be “no redemption in year 1” for each of the Alternative \nInvestments.  Hobart misrepresented in writing that, at the end of the \nfirst year, each Alternative Investment was fully redeemable at a price \nequal to or greater than 90% “of share value,” with some of the \nAlternative Investments, such as Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT, \nto be redeemable at 92.5% of net asset value (“NAV”) after year 1 , 95% \nafter year 2, 97.5% after year 3, and 100% after year 4[,] \n \n(SAC ¶ 332).  However, neither statement is pleaded with sufficient particularity. \n172. While the first statement contains the approximate time, place, content of \nthe representation, and identity  of the person making the representation, the \nLeshocks do not allege what was obtained as a result of the fraudulent \nrepresentation.  Even if the Court were to presume or infer that Defendants obtained \nthe Leshocks’ investment, t here is also no allegation that the Leshocks exercised \nreasonable diligence to independently investigate the truth of this assertion.  \nTherefore, the allegation does not meet Rule 9(b)’s specificity requirements. \n173. As for the second statement, Plaintiffs fail to provide the time and place of \nthe alleged representation, stating only that it occurred “prior to the sale of \nAlternative Investments to the Leshocks.”  (SAC ¶ 332.)  In addition, once again there \nis no allegation of reasonable diligence on the part of the Leshocks to investigate the \ntruth of the representations by Mr. Greer and Mr. Hobart.  Rule 9(b) is not satisfied.  \nSee Martin Communs., LLC v. Flowers, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 30, at **17 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Mar. 31, 2021) (the Second Amended Complaint is “devoid of any allegations that \nPlaintiff[s] even attempted to investigate the veracity of Defendants’ statements”). \n174. Therefore, the Court GRANTS in part the Motion, and Count Five as to the \nLeshocks is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. \nii. The Ostranders \n175. The Ostranders allege several representations that  satisfy Rule  9(b), \nincluding the following:  \nIn a pre -investment meeting on around February 6, 2013, the \nOstranders expressly asked Mr. Hobart whether fees paid to the Hobart \nFinancial Advisory Team were “disclosed or embedded.”  Mr. Hobart \nfalsely responded that all fees were disclosed, including as related to \nAlternative Investments, specifically.  While Mr. Hobart disclosed that \none fixed-index annuity carried a 0.95% fee, he falsely claimed there was \n“no fee received by Hobart” for the sale of the fixed-index annuity. \n \n(SAC ¶  350.)  The  Ostranders’ allegations regarding Ms.  Ostrander’s interactions \nwith Mr. Hobart and Mr. Greer in April 2013, ( see SAC ¶¶ 355–59; SAC Ex. 4), as \nwell as the couple’s April 2016 communications with Mr.  Sunstrom, (SAC ¶  374), \nmeet the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9. \n176. But Defendants argue that the Ostranders’ reliance on these statements \nwas unreasonable.  (Br. Supp. 25.)  Defendants contend that “Ms. Ostrander clearly \nread and understood the prospectus and its plain language terms regarding the \ndisputed ‘sales load,’ and therefore her reliance on Mr. Greer was unreasonable as a \nmatter of law.”  (Br. Supp. 25 (internal citations omitted).) \n177. In response, Plaintiffs argue that “Mr. Greer and Mr. Hobart expressly \nmisrepresented the ‘sales load’ and excessive commissions they received,” contending \nthat it would be improper to charge the Ostranders with knowledge of the discrete \nmeaning of terms in a prospectus, particularly when Ms. Ostrander question ed the \nmeaning and was met with materially false responses.  (Br. Opp. 2 0–21; see also  \nSAC ¶ 366 (Defendants “effectively convinced Ms. Ostrander that her eyes had not \nseen what she thought they had seen in the prospectus document”  (emphasis in \noriginal)).) \n178. Unlike the Leshocks, Ms. Ostrander alleges that she read the prospectus \nfor one of the Alternative Investments and asked questions about the fees described.  \n(SAC ¶  355.)  Mr. Greer’s response indicated that fees would not come out  of her \n“pocket or earnings” and she would not pay the fees described in the prospectus for \nthe investment.  (SAC ¶¶ 356–57.) \n179. Upon a careful review of the Second Amended Complaint, there are \nsufficient allegations that the Ostranders made a reasonable inquiry into Defendants’ \nrepresentations.  The pair allege that they attempted to investigate the veracity of \nDefendants’ statements but were met with inaccurate responses.  These allegations \nare sufficient to pass the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.  The reasonableness of their reliance on \nDefendants’ misrepresentations is best determined later in the litigation.  See Collier \nv. Bryant, 216 N.C. App. 419, 435 (2011).  \n180. Therefore, the Court DENIES in part the Motion to the extent it seeks \ndismissal of the Ostranders’ claim under Count Five. \niii. The Wilshires \n181. The Wilshires allege one false representation  by Defendants which \nattempts the specificity required by Rule 9(b): \nMr. Hobart misrepresented Hobart’s commissions, otherwise hidden in \nthe fixed -index annuities and Alternative Investments, by \nmisrepresenting to the Wilshires that the full amount of the purchase \nprice (for t he fixed -index annuity and the Alternative Investments, \nrespectively) would be invested on their behalf, without accounting for \nany sales load. \n \n(SAC ¶ 419.) \n182. While this  allegation contains the content of the representation  and the \nidentity of the person ma king the representation, Plaintiffs do not allege  the \napproximate time and place of the representation or what was obtained as a result of \nit.  Even if the Court were to presume or infer that Defendants obtained a commission \nand fees, there is no allegation of reasonable diligence on the part of the Wilshires to \nindependently investigate the truth of the assertion.  Therefore, the allegation fails \nto state a claim for fraud. \n183. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS in part the Motion and Count Five as to \nthe Wilshires is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. \n2. Count Seven: Negligent Misrepresentation \n184. “It has long been held in North Carolina that ‘ [t]he tort of negligent \nmisrepresentation occurs when (1) a party justifiably relies (2) to his detriment (3) on \ninformation prepared without reasonable care (4) by one who owed the relying party \na duty of care.’ ” Simms v. Prudential Life Ins. Co. of Am. , 140 N.C. App. 529, 532 \n(2000) (quoting Raritan River Steel Co. v. Cherry, Bekaert & H olland, 322 N.C. 200, \n206 (1988)).  The question of justifiable reliance in an action for negligent \nmisrepresentation is “analogous to that of reasonable reliance in fraud actions[.]”  See \nMarcus Bros. Textiles, Inc. v. Price Waterhouse, LLP, 350 N.C. 214, 224 (1999).  \n185. Count Seven is based on Defendants’ alleged breach of the duty of care “in \npreparing information for Plaintiffs regarding the Alternative Investments and fixed-\nindex annuities .”  (SAC ¶¶  509–10.)  Based on this allegation  alone, the Court is \nunable to determine what information Defendants prepared that Plaintiffs take issue \nwith. \n186. Both the Leshocks and the Wilshires’ claims for fraud under Count Five \nfailed, in part, because neither couple alleged reasonable reliance.  Therefore, to the \nextent Plaintiffs attempt a claim for negligent misrepresentation based on a \nstatement or statements negligently made, their claims similarly fail.  Therefore, the \nCourt GRANTS in part the Motion and DISMISSES with prejudice Count Seven as \nto the Leshocks and the Wilshires. \n187. As to the Ostranders, their negligent misrepresentation claim sufficiently \nalleges the misrepresentation of material facts about the investments.   However, \nPlaintiffs do not allege with Rule 9(b) specificity the information that was deficiently \nprepared or that they undertook an inquiry into the veracity of the information .  As \na result, the Motion is GRANTED in part as to the Ostranders and this claim is \nDISMISSED with prejudice. \nC. Sufficiency of the Allegations for the Remaining Claims \n188. Having dealt with the statute of limitations issues  and whether certain \nclaims meet the heightened specificity required by Rule 9 , the Court now turns to \nwhether Plaintiffs’ remaining claims sufficiently state a claim. \n1. Counts One and  Two: Breach of Fiduciary Duty and \nConstructive Fraud \n \n189. Defendants seek dismissal of Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claim \narguing, in relevant part, that no fiduciary relationship existed between any Plaintiff \nand one or more of the Defendants.  (Br. Supp. 10–12.) \n190. “A claim for breach of fiduciary duty requires the existence of a fiduciary \nrelationship.”  White v. Consol. Planning, Inc. , 166 N.C. App. 283, 293 (2004).  “The \nrelation . . . extends to any possible case in which a fiduciary relation exists in fact, \nand in which there is confidence reposed on one side, and resulting domination and \ninfluence on the other. ”  Id.  at 293 (quoting Abbitt v. Gregory , 201 N.C. 577, 598 \n(1931)).  “A fiduciary relationship can be created either by law (de jure), or in fact (de \nfacto).”  Beam, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 56, at **8– 9.  Defendants contend that we have \nneither here.  \ni. Existence of a Fiduciary Duty \n191. Defendants’ counsel argues that Defendants were brokers, not RIAs, for the \ninvestments at issue.  (Br. Supp. 10.)  Defendants further argue that no de jure duty \nis available to Plaintiffs under North Carolina law.  (Br. Supp. 10.)  In r esponse, \nPlaintiffs argue only that Defendants “provided individualized inve stment advice to \nPlaintiffs” at all times, directing the Court to White v. Consol . Planning, Inc., 166 \nN.C. App. 283 (2004), and a case that supports federal RIAs being a fiduciary to their \nclients, Transamerica-Mortg. Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 17 (1979) ; (Br. \nOpp. 4). \n192. In Hart v. First Oak Wealth Mgmt. , LLC, this Court explicitly recognized \nthat “an investment adviser ‘is a fiduciary and has a duty to act primarily for the \nbenefit of its clients.’ ”8  2022 NCBC LEXIS 81, at **29 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 28, 2022) \n(quoting 18 N.C. Admin. Code 06A.1801(a) (2022)).  There, plaintiff alleged that \ndefendants were registered investment advis ors and the Court concluded that, \npursuant to 18 N.C. Admin. Code 06A.1801(a), defendants owed plaintiff a fiduciary \nduty as a matter of law.  Id. at **30–31 (citing SEC v. Capital Gains Rsch. Bureau, \nInc., 375 U.S. 180, 201 (1963)).  This Court has similarly recognized that “status as a \nfederally registered investment advisor . . . would create a fiduciary duty as a matter \nof law.”  Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. v. Wachovia Bank , 2010 NCBC LEXIS \n50, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 26, 2010). \n \n8 While miniscule in the Court’s overall consideration of the Motion, there appears to be \ninconsistent spelling of “advisor” and “adviser” in our State’s caselaw.  Notwithstanding that \nfact, there does not appear to be a material difference between the two words as used in our \ncaselaw, and rather that the spellings may be used interchangeably. \n193. Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Hobart, Mr. Greer, and Mr. Sunstrom were RIAs \nwith the State of North Carolina.  (SAC ¶¶ 17–19.)  Further, Mr. Hobart and \nMr. Greer were RIAs with the SEC.  ( SAC ¶¶ 17–18.)  Plaintiffs also alleged that \nMr. Hobart, Mr. Greer, and Mr. Sunstrom ’s wrongful acts complained of were at all \ntimes performed in furtherance of the business of the Hobart Entities.  (SAC ¶ 20.) \n194. Therefore, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants are \nfiduciaries de jure.  See Hart, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 81, at **31 n.3 (“Both the individual \nadviser and the firm with which the adviser works may be registered investm ent \nadvisers and, as a result, concurrently owe fiduciary duties to clients .”) (citing SEC \nv. Bolla, 401 F. Supp. 2d 43, 61 (D.D.C. 2005)). \n195. Furthermore, and regardless of whether a de jure fiduciary duty exists \nunder the allegations in the Second Amended C omplaint, Plaintiffs allege sufficient \nfacts to support an allegation that a de facto  fiduciary relationship existed between \nthem and Defendants. \n196. “The standard for finding a  de facto fiduciary relationship is a demanding \none: Only when one party figuratively holds all the cards—all the financial power or \ntechnical information, for example —have North Carolina courts found that the \nspecial circumstance of a fiduciary relationship has arisen. ”  Lockerman v. S. River \nElec. Mbrshp. Corp. , 250 N.C. App.  631, 636 (2016) (cleaned up) ( quoting S.N.R. \nMgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC, 189 N.C. App. 601, 613 (2008)). \n197. In Aldridge v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., the Court declined to infer the existence \nof a de facto fiduciary duty where plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient control—i.e., \nthat defendants figuratively held all the cards .  2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at * 69–71.  \nIn making that determination, the Court considered whether plaintiffs pleaded: \n(1) lack of financial sophistication or another vulnerability; ( 2) any sort of \n“domination” by Defendants over Plaintiffs; or (3) that Defendants held all of \nPlaintiffs’ “  ‘technical information’ such that they had to rely exclusively on their \ninvestment advisors’ advice and actions.”  Id.  at *70.  The pleadings there lacked \nallegations of each characteristic, ultimately resulting in the Court determining that \nno de facto fiduciary duty existed.  Id. at *70–71. \n198. Here, Plaintiffs allege that they lacked financial sophistication, (Br. \nOpp. 9), and that they were “vulnerable seniors ,” (SAC ¶ 89).  Plaintiffs also allege \nthat Defendants required them “to sign voluminous paperwork to effectuate the sale \nof the Alternative Investments, without providing copies of the signed documents to \nany of Plaintiffs[ ,]” (SAC ¶ 154), and none of them “actually received a prospectus \ndocument from [Defendants], except for the Ostranders [,]” (SAC ¶  155).  While the \nallegations do not demonstrate that Defendants withheld all  financial information, \nwhich would result in Plaintiffs’ being forced to rely exclusively on Defendants for \nadvice and action, the allegations do  appear to state that Def endants withheld at \nleast some crucially important financial documents. \n199. The allegations go on: the Hobart Financial website provided that \nDefendants were “legally obligated, as an RIA, to act in the very best interest of our \nclients,” (SAC ¶  72 (emphasis removed)); Defendants orally represented to at least \nsome Plaintiffs that they “paid more for professional licenses and professional \nliability insurance than other financial advisors, due to the increased obligations \nassumed by [Defendants] as a fiduciary[,]” (SAC ¶ 76.d.); and none of the Plaintiffs \nwould have invested with Defendants if they had truthfully disclosed that the firm \nwas only acting as a “financial salesperson” with no obligation to act in their clients’ \nbest interest, (SAC  ¶ 77).  Similar all egations of Defendants’ representations and \nconduct is littered throughout the Second Amended Complaint, demonstrating how \npervasive their practice of holding themselves out as a fiduciary was to their business. \n200. Plaintiffs are, under the relevant allegations of the Second Amended \nComplaint, properly considered unsophisticated investors who were operating  with \nless than complete information and relied on Defendants’ reputation as a safe, secure \ninvestment company that always represented it was acting in Plaintiffs’ best interest \nand without conflicts of interest.  See Edwards v. Vanguard Fiduciary Tr. Co. , 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 237, at *20–21 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 21, 2018). \n201. Reviewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, it \nappears to the Court that  Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient at the Rule 12(b)(6) \nstage to plead the existence of a de facto fiduciary relationship. \nii. Breach of the Fiduciary Duty \n202. Moreover, the Leshocks and the Ostranders each allege that the Hobart \nEntities, Mr. Hobart, and Mr. Greer breached fiduciary duties owed to them .  \nDefendants respond that Plaintiffs fail to allege  facts amounting to  an actionable \nbreach.  (Br. Supp. 13–14.) \n203. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their duty by: (1) recommending \nunsuitable investments to Plaintiffs, as they were retirees or near-retirees who were \npoorly suited to illiquid, volatile investments with hidden fees and commissions; and \n(2) concealing and misrepresenting conflicts of interests in their recommendations \nand the material terms of the Alternative Investments and fixed -index annuities.  \n(SAC ¶¶ 455–57.) \n204. The Court concludes that the Leshocks and Ostranders’ allegations of \nbreach are sufficient at this stage.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion to the \nextent it seeks dismissal of Count One as to the Leshocks and the Ostranders. \niii. Count Two: Constructive Fraud \n205. All Plaintiffs join in alleging a claim for relief under Count Two. \n206. “The primary difference between pleading a claim for constructive fraud \nand one for breach of fiduciary duty is the constructive fraud requirement that the \ndefendant benefit himself [through the breach.]”  White, 166 N.C. App. at 294.  The \nreceipt of the improper benefit must be alleged for each defendant individually.   See \nTrail Creek Invs. LLC v. Warren Oil Holding Co., LLC , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 70, \nat **30–32 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 9, 2023); White, 166 N.C. App. at 294. \n207. “The benefit sought by the defendant must be more than a continued \nrelationship with the plaintiff. ”  Sterner v. Penn , 159 N.C. App. 626, 631 (2003) \n(cleaned up)  (citing Barger, 346 N.C. at 667) .  Further, “payment of a fee to a \ndefendant for work done by that defendant does not by itself  constitute sufficient \nevidence that the defendant sought his own advantage in the transaction. ”  \nNationsBank v. Parker, 140 N.C. App. 106, 114 (2000) (emphasis added).  \n208. The Court has determined that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that \nDefendants owed them a fiduciary duty and that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged \nbreaches of that duty .  Thus, the remaining question for the Court is whether \nPlaintiffs have adequately alleged that Defendants also sought to benefit themselves \nthrough the purported breach of that duty. \n209. The answer is yes.  The Second Amended Comp laint is replete with  \nallegations that the fees and commissions associated with the investment produc ts \nrecommended to P laintiffs were excessive and undisclosed —the benefit Defendants \nallegedly sought through their breach.  (See SAC ¶ 464.) \n210. Defendants characterize Plaintiffs’ argument as boiling down “ to an  \nallegation that the commission on the investments sold to them was higher than  \nPlaintiffs think it should have been, not that Defendants manufactured a way to take \na commission greater than what the investment provided.”  (Defs.’ Reply Br. 11, ECF \nNo. 77 [“Reply”].)  Defendants misunderstand Plaintiffs’ allegations. \n211. While Plaintiffs do contend that the fees associated with the investments \nwere “excessive,” they also allege that they did not know  there were commissions \nassociated with the investments because Defendants either failed to disclose that \ninformation, or they actively misrepresented that there would be no fees associated \nwith the investments.  ( See SAC ¶¶ 258, 264, 317, 349, 355, 366, 400– 02.)  These \nallegations distinguish this case from the  line of cases relied on by Defendants \nholding that receipt of fees for w ork done is insufficient.  (Reply 11 ( citations \nomitted).) \n212. Plaintiffs allege more tha n mere payment of a fee to D efendants for work \ndone.  They allege that, in addition to Defendants’ typical fee, Defendants received \nother fees and commissions that Plaintiffs were told either would not come from the \nfunds intended for investing or would not be incurred at all.   There is an important \ndifference between (1) receiving all financial documents and being able to review that \ninformation for fees and commissions assessed, and (2) being told that there are no \ncommissions and fees being deducted from your investment .  The latter  is what \nPlaintiffs allege happened to them. \n213. Defendants unsuccessfully attempt to align the allegations in this case with \nthe allegations in the Court of Appeals’ decision in Sterner v. Penn.  There, the Court \nheld that an allegation that plaintiff’s money “was t raded through defen dants and \nthat defendants financially benefitted via commissions on sales transactions. ”  159 \nN.C. App. at 632.  The Court determined there that this was insufficient “to show \nthat defendants sought to benefit themselves by taking unfair advantage of plaintiff.”  \nId.; Cf. Long Bros. of Summerfield, Inc. v. Hilco Transp., Inc., 268 N.C. App. 377, 385 \n(2019) (determining that where a crucial financial document  was omitted, a \nconstructive fraud claim could arise out of defendant preventing plaintiff’s access to \nthat information prior to the transaction which resulted in a benefit to defendant).  \nSterner is easily distinguishable from the facts alleged here. \n214. Plaintiffs allege that the fees received by Defendants w ere manipulated in \nthe form of oral and email misrepresentations.  Plaintiffs were thus prevented from \naccessing crucial information about the investment transactions prior to investing.  \nAt this stage, the Court must accept the allegations as true and make all reasonable \ninferences in favor of Plaintiffs.  While the receipt of commissions or a standard fee \nalone would typically be insufficient to support a constructive fraud claim, allegations \nthat Defendants received  undisclosed or actively misrepresented  fees and \ncommissions are sufficient for the claim to survive at this stage. \n215. Therefore, the Court DENIES the Motion to the extent it seeks dismissal \nof Count Two. \n2. Count Three: Violations of the NCSA \n216. The Leshocks, the Ostranders, and the Wilshires  each allege violations of \nthe NCSA in Count Three. \n217. When claims under the NCSA are based on allegations of fraud in the sale \nof investments, the allegations must be pleaded with particularity.  Bucci v. Burns, \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 83, at *11  (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 14, 2017).   Where claims for \nfraud and negligent misrepresentation have been dismissed and the conduct with \nrespect to alleged violation of the NCSA is the same, the NCSA claims are likely \nsimilarly deficient.  Id. \n218. Such is the case here.  Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs’ claim for violations \nof the NCSA is predicated on the same  behavior as Plaintiffs’ fraud claim —that \nDefendants made fraudulent misrepresentations or omissions in connection with the \nsale of Fraud Plaintif fs’ investments—and likewise fails to satisfy the heightened \npleading requirements of Rule 9(b).”  (Mot. 6; see also Br. Supp. 27.) \n219. The Court determines that Defendants’ argument is well -grounded as it \nrelates to the Leshocks and Wilshires’ claims.  For the same reasons that their fraud \nand negligent misrepresentation claims fail for lack of specifi city, their NCSA claim \nsimilarly fails. \n220. The Ostranders’ fraud claim, however, survives dismissal, and Defendants \nhave not raised arguments regarding why the  Ostranders’ claim under the NCSA \nshould be treated differently.  (Br. Supp. 27; Reply 14–15.) \n221. Therefore, the Cour t DENIES in part the Motion  as to the Ostranders’ \nclaim under Count Three , but GRANTS in part the Motion as to the Leshocks and \nthe Wilshires’ cl aims.  The Leshocks and the Wilshires’ claims under Count Three \nare hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. \n3. Count Four: Violations of the UDTPA \n222. Only the Wilshires have a claim remaining under Count Four. \n223. Defendants argue that, “[b]ecause the UDTPA claim is based on purported \nfraudulent misrepresentations, it also must satisfy the heightened pleading standard \nof Rule 9(b).”  (Br. Supp. 27.)  The Court agrees that the Wilshires’ claim for violations \nof the UDTPA is derivative of the fraud claim.  See Silverdeer, LLC v. Berton , 2013 \nNCBC LEXIS 21, at **28–29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 24, 2013). \n224. Given that the Wilshires’ claim for fraud was dismissed herein, and that \ntheir claim for violations of the  UDTPA concerns the same behavior, th e Court \nlikewise GRANTS in part the Motion and DISMISSES the Wilshires’ claim with \nprejudice. \n4. Count Six: Professional Negligence \n225. Only the Leshocks have a remaining claim under Count Six.  Defendants \nmake no arguments regarding dismissal of this claim, other than the statute of \nlimitations defense already addressed herein.  (See Br. Supp. 4; but see Br. Opp. 29.)  \nThe Court has previously determined  that the Leshocks’  negligence claim survives \nDefendants’ statute of limitations defense at this stage.  (Supra ¶ 148.)  Therefore, to \nthe extent the Motion requests dismissal of this claim as it remains, the Motion is \nDENIED. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n226. THEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby  GRANTS in \npart and DENIES in part the Motion as follows:  \na. The Motion is DENIED in part as to: the Leshocks and Ostranders’ \nclaims for breach of fiduciary duty  under Count One; all Plaintiffs’ claims  \nfor constructive fraud under Count Two, except as to Ms. Byrnes ; the \nOstranders’ claims for violations of the NCSA under Count Three and fraud \nunder Count Five; and the Leshocks’ claim for negligence under Count Six. \nb. Except as expressly denied, the Motion is otherwise GRANTED  as \nset forth more fully above, and those claims are hereby DISMISSED  with \nprejudice. \n227. The Case Management Order, (ECF No. 35 [“CMO”]), sets various \ndeadlines for the parties to conduct discovery in this matter.  The Court clarifies that \nthe “second phase” of discovery, lasting seven months, shall begin upon entry of this \norder.  (CMO 7.)  Thus, the close of all discovery shall be 23 September 2024, and \nthirty days thereafter the parties shall file any post -discovery dispositive motions.  \n(CMO 7, 12.) \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 26th day of February, 2024. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L.
