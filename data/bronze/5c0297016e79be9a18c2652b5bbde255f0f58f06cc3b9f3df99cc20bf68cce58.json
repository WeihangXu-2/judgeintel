(“Motion”, ECF No. 89.)   \nTHE COURT, having thoroughly reviewed the Motion, the briefs filed in \nsupport of and in opposition to the Motion, the oral arguments of counsel, and oth er \nappropriate matters of record, concludes, in its discretion, that the Motion should be \nGRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part. \nBrooks, Pierce , McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard LLP  by Gary S. \nParsons, Eric M. David, and Shepard D. O’Connell for Plaintiffs \nConstruction Managers, Inc. of Goldsboro, Construction Managers, LLC, \nACTS Contracting, Inc., and ACTS Investments, LLC. \n \nEllis & Winters, LLP  by Jonathan D. Sasser and Michelle Liguori for \nDefendant Kevin D. Amory. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \n \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1. The facts relevant to determination of the Motion are drawn from the \nAmended Complaint.  (“Amended Complaint”, ECF No. 78.) \nA. Plaintiffs’ Business \n2. Plaintiffs Construction Managers, Inc. of Goldsboro (“CMI”), \nConstruction Managers, LLC (“CM, LLC”), ACTS Contracting, Inc., (“ACTS”), and \nACTS Investments, LLC (“ACTS Investments” ; collectively CMI, CM, LLC, ACTS, \nand ACTS Investments are “Plaintiffs”) are affiliated North Carolina entities that are \nmanaged and operated from Wayne County, North Carolina.   (ECF No. 78, at ¶¶ 1–\n4, 15, 20 –24.)  Plaintiffs have common ownership, are highly integrated, and are  \ncontrolled and managed by Sammy Sasser (“Sasser”), Robert Crenshaw \n(“Crenshaw”), and Justin Thorn (“Thorn”).  (Id. at ¶¶ 6–8, 15, 20–24.)  Amory worked \nfor Plaintiffs CM, LLC and ACTS from April 2015 through June 2018.  (Id. at ¶ 5.)   \n3. Since 2010, Plaintiffs have been engaged in the business of building, \nleasing, and managing small and mid -sized medical clinics for the United States \nDepartment of Veteran Affairs (the “VA”).  ( Id. at ¶ 15.)  The clinics are called \ncommunity-based outpatient clinics (“CBOC”).  (Id.)  The process by which Plaintiffs \nacquire work projects from the VA is known as the “design-to-build-to-lease process,” \nwhich Plaintiffs describe as “technical, arcane, and laden with bureaucratic hurdles.”  \n(Id. at ¶ 17.)  During this process, the VA first publicly identifies a city or town in \nwhich to locate a CBOC.  ( Id.)  Potential bidders on the project then identify and \narrange to acquire pro perty on which to locate the VA clinic.  ( Id. at ¶ 18.)  The \n \nproperty acquired must meet VA requirements .  According to Plaintiffs, “[t]hese \nrequirements are learned from past experiences, and many of them are unpublished \nand known only to companies that work in this area with the VA.”  (Id.)  Next, after \nthe VA approves a particular piece of property on which to locate a CBOC, the VA \nissues a request for lease proposal (“RLP”) “seeking bids from lessors to have \ncontractors build the clinic on the identified property and then, after the clinic is built, \nto lease the building to the VA.”  (Id. at ¶ 19.)  The winning bidder then designs and \nbuilds the CBOC, leases it to the VA, and manages the property.  (Id.)  Plaintiffs have \nbeen selected a total of 13 times to design, build, and lease clinics for the VA.  (Id. at \n¶ 15.) \n4. Plaintiffs consider themselves experts in the VA design -build-to-lease \nprocess and “have organized themselves, in substantial part, to be highly successful \nin the VA CBOC bidding and leasing process.”  ( Id. at ¶ 20.)  Plaintiff CM, LLC \nmanages CMI.  ( Id. at ¶ 24.)  Plaintiff CMI is the corporate entity that deals with, \nsubmits proposals to, and contracts with the VA.  (Id. at ¶ 21.)  Plaintiff ACTS signs \nconstruction contracts for Plaintiffs’ CBOC projects.  ( Id. at ¶ 22.)  Plaintiff ACTS \nInvestments is a part-owner of the entities that hold the leases for various completed \nCBOCs.  (Id. at ¶ 23.)   \nB. CMI’s Trade Secrets \n5. CMI identifies the CMI Process—“a proprietary analytical formula and \nprocess for assessing and managing all aspects of the VA’s ‘design-build-to-lease’ \nprogram, from land acquisition to design -build to property management” —as its \n \nprimary trade secret.  (Id. at ¶¶ 25–26.)  According to Plaintiffs, the CMI Process “is \na comprehensive and proprietary set of formulas, financial spreadsheets, design \ndrawings, property criteria, and property management guidelines . . . .”  (Id. at ¶ 32.)  \nPlaintiffs consider both the CMI proces s as a whole, an d its constituent parts, to be  \ntrade secrets.  (Id. at ¶ 26.)   \n6. The aspects of the CMI Process that Plaintiffs allege to be trade secrets, \ninclude: \na. The specific criteria and methodology by which CMI identifies \nproperties on which to build a VA clinic. \n \nb. Detailed and proprietary financial formulas and spreadsheets that \nallow CMI to  submit a com prehensive bid in response to an RLP that \nwill meet the VA’s specific financial criteria while also being profitable \nfor CMI and its affiliated companies. \n \nc. CMI’s proprietary method and strategy for preparing bids in response \nto an  RLP. These bids ar e 400 to 1,000 pages long, with detailed \ninformation about  the property, the proposed  [Patient Aligned Care \nTeam (“PACT”)]  design and construction (down to the carpets and other \nfinishes), and the financial details of the proposed lease. \n \nd. Detailed and proprietary pricing and other supplier information \ncovering all  aspects of the construction and ongoing management of \nproperties housing VA clinics. CMI knows from experience how much a \nproject will cost, how to save  the government money, and how to \ncomplete the project with high quality, at a profit for Plaintiffs. \n \ne. Information about the specific requirements and preferenc es for VA \nprojects, developed by CMI after many years of dealing with the VA and \nits contract officers. \n \n(Id. at ¶ 28.)   \n \n7. In addition to the components listed above, Plaintiffs allege that their \nQuickbook files  are trade secrets that are part of the CMI P rocess.  Plaintiffs’ \n \nQuickbook files contain detailed bank account information, private financial \ninformation about Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ employees, and the various financial data \nthat goes into CMI’s pricing and bidding documents.  Plaintiffs contend that these \nQuickbook files “are like the Rosetta Stone to the CMI Process, allowing anyone with \naccess to them to re-create, down to the penny, how Plaintiffs are able to successfully \nbid for and operate VA CBOCs across the country.”  (Id. at ¶ 29.) \n8. Plaintiffs state that the CMI Process is the product of years of work and \nexperience, and that “if stolen, the CMI Process would allow the thief to immediately \ncompete with CMI without any of the investment of time and money that Plaintiffs \nhave committed since 2010 to get to this point.”  (Id. at ¶ 32.)   \nC. Plaintiffs’ Efforts to Protect the CMI Process \n9. Most of Plaintiff’s confidential and trade secret information, including \nthe CMI Process, is in electronic form.  CMI protects its electronic data by storing it \non a password -secured cloud account (“the Box Account”).  (Id. at ¶ 36.)  Access to \nfiles in the Box Account is limited to employees with a specific business need to access \nthe files.  (Id.)  Additionally, the Box Account allows company managers to track and \nlog every time any company file was accessed, copied, or moved.  (Id. at ¶ 41.) \n10. With respect to its confidential information kept in paper form, CMI \nholds any paper files in its office, which is locked at night and which is not generally \nopen to the public.  Further, it is a company policy that paper files are not taken out \nof the office, unless Sasser specifically approves.  (Id. at ¶ 35.)   \n \n11. CMI also attempts to protect its confidential information when \nsubmitting bids to the VA by “insisting that the VA keep the financial information \nincluded in the bid confidential to the full extent allowed by law.”  (Id. at ¶ 39.)  Based \non this policy, “when the VA has been asked to publicly disclose such information, it \nhas redacted the sensitive information from all documents.”  (Id.)  \nD. Amory’s Employment with Plaintiffs, Downloading of Alleged Trade \nSecrets, and Resignation \n \n12. Amory was employed by CM, LLC from April 7, 2015 through \napproximately April 2017.  Then, from April 2017 through June 5, 2018, Amory was \nemployed by ACTS as the Vice President.  (Id. at ¶ 5.)  During his employment, Amory \nacquired a 25% owner ship interest in  ACTS and in ACTS Investments and was a \nmanager of ACTS Investments.  (Id.)   \n13. While employed by CM, LLC and ACTS, Amory had substantial \naccounting and bookkeeping responsibilities and also acted as a project manager for \ncertain of CMI’s CBOC projects.  (Id. at ¶¶ 81, 82.)   \n14.  Plaintiffs allege that  “Sasser, Crenshaw, and Thorn reposed trust in \nAmory and granted him broad access to Plaintiffs’ files because he was a project \nmanager with substantial bookkeeping responsibilities for the companies.”  ( Id. at \n¶ 37.)  Amory, however, was “frequently remin ded [ ] of the need to maintain the \nsecurity of Plaintiffs’ electronic data” and was once refused the authority to take a \nlaptop with Plaintiffs’ Quickbook files home because Sasser believed allowing an \nemployee to have company data in their home or car wi thout proper security \nmeasures created a security risk.  (Id. at ¶ 38.)   \n \n15. On June 5, 2018, Amory resigned from his employment with ACTS to \ntake a job with BridgePoint  Civil, LLC (“BridgePoint”), located in Goldsboro, North \nCarolina.  (Id. at ¶ 12.)   BridgePoint, which describes itself as a “turnkey site \ndevelopment company,” is part of an affiliated group of companies which hold an \nunlimited general contractor’s license and claim to be a “construction consulting firm \nproviding owner’s representation and sus tainability consulting for building projects \nof all types.”  (Id. at ¶ 92.) \n16. Following his resignation, Amory was removed as a manager of ACTS \nInvestments.  Amory, however,  remains a 25% owner of ACTS and ACTS \nInvestments.   (Id. at ¶ 5.)   \n17. Before resigning  his employment with ACTS,  Amory downloaded \nhundreds of gigabytes of Plaintiffs’ alleged confidential and trade secret information.  \nThe data downloaded by Amory constituted approximately half of all data stored in \nthe Box Account .  Plaintiffs claim that t he documents Amory downloaded included \ndocuments relating to CMI’s research and investigations for several new CBOC \nprojects, personal and company tax returns  and bookkeeping files , and other \nconfidential information relating to every project Amory worked on over the years.  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 44–48.)  Plaintiffs believe Amory may have downloaded the information to \nhis iPad, iPhone, personal laptop, desktop, or all the above. \n18. In addition to downloading information from the Box Account, Amory \nalso emailed with Patti King (“King”), a former CMI employee  who now works for \nBridgePoint.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 50–51.)  Amory’s emails to King included “confidential and \n \nproprietary documents” aimed at assisting King with her work for BridgePoint and \nhelping BridgePoint.  (Id.)   \nE. The Fraudulent Overpayment Scheme \n19. In June 2016, while Amory was employed by CM, LLC, the VA awarded \nCMI a lease for a CBOC project in Macon, Georgia.  (the “Macon Lease”, Id. at ¶ 53.)  \nThe Macon Lease provided that CMI would construct a shell building and that the \nVA would negotiate with CMI the costs to upfit the building for use as a CBOC.  (Id.)  \nThe property on which the Macon CBOC was to be constructed, however, was owned \nby a Georgia limited liability company (“the Georgia LLC”).1  In late 2016, the Georgia \nLLC and CMI agreed that the Georgia LLC would borrow funds to construct and upfit \nthe Macon CBOC, take over the Macon Lease, pay CMI a fee for the assignment of \nthe Macon Lease  and to manage the CBOC construction project, and contract with \nACTS on a cost -plus basis to serve as the general contractor for the projec t \n(“Development Agreement”).  (Id. at ¶ 58.) \n20. Pursuant to the Development Agreement, the Georgia LLC separately \nentered into a Construction Contract (the “Construction Contract”) with ACTS, which \nprovided that ACTS would construct the Macon CBOC on a “cost-plus” basis.  (Id. at \n¶ 61.)  The Construction Contract also provided that ACTS would submit cost -plus \nbased payment applications to the Georgia LLC.  (Id. at ¶ 62.) \n                                            \n1 Plaintiff alleges that a successor LLC to the Georgia LLC was formed sometime after CMI \nwas awarded the Macon Lease (id. at ¶ 57), but for ease of reference the Court will continue \nto refer to the LLC as the “Georgia LLC.” \n \n21. The Georgia LLC subsequently obtained a loan  (“Construction Loan”) \nfrom a Georgia bank (the “Bank”) to finan ce the construction of the CBOC.  Amory, \nas Vice President of ACTS, was responsible for preparing and submitting to the \nGeorgia LLC the cost -plus payment applications pursuant to the Construction \nContract.  Upon receipt of the payment applications prepared by Amory, the Georgia \nLLC would submit them to the Bank to obtain draws from their construction loan.  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 63–64.)   \n22. Plaintiffs allege that “sometime in mid-2017, Amory and the principals \nof the Georgia LLC devised a scheme to overdraw on the Construction Loan and, in \nso doing, defraud CMI and ACTS for the personal benefit of Amory and his co -\nconspirators.”  (Id. at ¶ 65.)  To accomplish this, “Amory —without the knowledge or \nconsent of Sasser or any other officer or director of CMI or ACTS—conspired with the \nprincipals of [the Georgia LLC] to create, and Amory did create, a falsified set of \nACTS payment applications on a percentage -completion basis, rather than a cost -\nplus basis.”  (Id. at ¶ 66.)  The falsified payment applications stated that the amounts \ndue to ACTS were substantially greater than the amounts actually due  to ACTS \nunder the cost-plus based Construction Contract.  (Id. at ¶ 67.) \n23. According to Plaintiffs, “Amory provided the falsified percentage \ncompletion-based payment applications to the [Georgia LLC] with the knowledge and \nintent that [the Georgia LLC] would submit the . . . payment applications to the \nBank.”  (Id. at ¶ 68.)  Additionally, “because [Amory and the principals of the Georgia \nLLC] knew that the Bank would require documenta tion that the full amount of the \n \ndraw would be paid to ACTS, [they] conspired for Amory to misrepresent to Sasser \nthat the overpayments were ‘mistakes,’ and to have Sasser authorize ACTS to wire \nback to counsel for [the Georgia LLC] the excess amounts paid to ACTS.”  (Id. at ¶ 70.)  \n24.  Pursuant to this conspiracy, on at least four occasions in the fall of 2017, \nAmory misrepresented to Sasser that the Bank’s overpayments were mistakes.  ( Id. \nat ¶  71.)  Based on the misrepresentations to Sasser, on at least thr ee occasions, \nACTS wired back to counsel for the Georgia LLC the amounts that the Bank had \n“mistakenly” paid in excess.  (Id. at ¶ 72.)   \n25. In November of 2017, Sasser discovered the fraudulent overpayment \nscheme following Amory’s fourth request that ACTS wi re “mistaken” excess \npayments from the Bank back to counsel for the Georgia LLC.  ( Id. at ¶ 74.)  Sasser \nimmediately ordered Amory to stop creating and submitting to the Bank the falsified \npayment applications.   \n26. Plaintiffs allege that because of the fraudulent overpayment scheme, \nCMI and ACTS were required to “expend time and resources to engage construction \nestimate, accounting, and legal professionals to investigate and document the \ncircumstances of the falsified payment applications . . . and to negotiate agreements \nfor the winding up of the Macon CBOC project and all associated agreements.”   \nFurther, Plaintiffs claim that Amory’s wrongful conduct and involvement in the \nscheme “placed in jeopardy ACTS’ and CMI’s reputation and goodwill with s ome of \nits key business partners and the VA.”  (Id. at ¶ 77.) \n \nF. Amory’s Alleged Fiduciary Duties and Breach of Fiduciary Duties \n27. Plaintiffs allege that as a corporate officer (Vice President) of ACTS and \na manager of ACTS Investments, Amory owed fiduciary dut ies to those entities as a \nmatter of law.  (Id. at ¶ 78.)  Plaintiffs allege Amory breached those duties by:  \n(a) [ ] acquiring confidential business information, that \nconsists of information and data owned by ACTS and \nACTS Investments, including the entirety of their \naccounting and bookkeeping files, and then taking that \ninformation to his new employer within the \nconstruction industry[.] \n \n(b) [ ] conspiring to carry out, and carrying out, a \nfraudulent overpayment scheme[.] \n \n(c) [ ] wait[ing] until just after ACTS made  a $150,000 \ndistribution to him to announce his departure. \n \n(d) [ ] g [iving] an unwarranted raise and bonus to former \nACTS employee, Patti King, an employee [Amory] had \nconvinced Plaintiffs to hire. During her employment, \nPlaintiffs found that Ms. King did not  possess the \nskillsets Amory claimed that she had in QuickBooks \nand other necessary software. Ms. King now works for \nBridgePoint.  \n \n(Id.) \n \n28. Plaintiffs also maintain that Amory owed fiduciary duties to CMI and \nCM, LLC on account of the special trust and confidence they reposed in him to act as \na bookkeeper and accountant on behalf of CMI and its affiliated companies.  (Id. at \n¶¶ 80–81.)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege Amory owed a fiduciary  duty to CMI on \naccount of the trust and confidence CMI placed in him as a project manager and \nbecause of the way he operated as a project manager.  (Id. at ¶¶ 82–84.) \n \n29. Plaintiffs claim Amory breached his fiduciary duties to CMI and CM, \nLLC by “acquiring confidential and trade secret information owned by CMI, which \nconsists of the CMI Process and all CMI’s and CM LLC’s accounting and bookkeeping \nfiles, and then taking that information to  his new employer within the construction \nindustry.”  (Id. at ¶ 85.)  Further, Plaintiffs allege Amory breached his duty to CMI \nby “conspiring to carry out, and carrying out, [the] fraudulent overpayment scheme.” \n(Id. at ¶ 86.)   \nG. Procedural History \n30. On July 6, 2018, Plaintiffs initiated this case by filing a Complaint and \na Motion for Temporary Restraining Order  and Preliminary Injunction  in the \nSuperior Court of Wayne County.   (“Complaint”, ECF No. 3; “Motion for TRO /PI”, \nECF No. 6.)  On that same date, a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) was entered \nby the Honorable William Bland.  (ECF No. 8.) \n31. On July 11, 2018, the lawsuit was designated to this Court and assigned \nto the undersigned.  (“Designation Order”, ECF No. 1; “Assignment Order”, ECF No. \n2.)  On that same date, the Court entered an order extending the TRO until the Court \ncould hear and rule upon Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction  (“Extension \nOrder”, ECF No. 11), and on October 11, 2018, the Court granted in part and denied \nin part Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  (“Order on Motion for PI”, ECF \nNo. 67.) \n32. On November 14, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint.  In the \nAmended Complaint, Plaintiffs make the following claims against Amory: \n \nmisappropriation of trade secrets (first claim); breach of fiduciary duty (second claim); \nconstructive fraud (third claim); fraud (fourth claim); violation of the North Carolina \nUnfair or Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA), N.C. Gen. Stat. §  75-1.1 \n(hereinafter the North Carolina Gener al Sta tutes are referred to as “G.S.”) (fifth \nclaim); violation of G.S. § 14-458 (sixth claim); and punitive damages (seventh claim). \n33. On January 14, 2019, Amory filed the Motion (ECF No. 89) and a \nsupporting brief.  (Br. in Supp., ECF No. 90.)  On February 6, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a \nresponse brief in opposition to the Motion.  (Br. in Opp., ECF No. 91.)  On February \n17, 2019, Defendant filed a reply brief in support of the Motion.  (Reply Br., ECF No. \n92.)  The Motion came before the Court for a hearing on February 27, 2019 and is now \nripe for review. \nII. ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review     \n34. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \ntrue, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some \nlegal theory, whether properly labeled or not.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 N.C. \nApp. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).  North Carolina is a notice pleading state.  \nSee, e.g., Feltman v. City of Wilson, 238 N.C. App. 246, 252, 767 S.E.2d 615, 620 (2014) \n(quoting Wake Cty. v. Hotels.com, L.P. , 235 N.C. App. 633, 646, 762 S.E.2d 477, 486 \n(2014)).  “Under notice pleading, a statement of claim is adequate if it gives sufficient \nnotice of the claim asserted to enable the adverse party to answer and prepare for \n \ntrial, to allow for the application of the doctrine of res judicata, and to show the type \nof case brought.”  Id. \n35. “It is well established that dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper \nwhen ‘(1) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff ’s claim; \n(2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good \nclaim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.’”  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615, 821 S.E.2d 729, 736–\n37 (2018) (quoting Wood v. Guilford County, 355 N.C. 161, 166, 558 S.E.2d 490, 494 \n(2002)).  \n36. In deciding a motion to dismiss,  the Court must construe the Amended \nComplaint liberally and accept all well-pleaded allegations as true.  Laster v. Francis, \n199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009).  The Court, however, is not \nrequired “to accept as true allegations that are m erely conclusory, unwarranted \ndeductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t \nof Health & Human Servs. , 174 N.C. App. 266, 2 74, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005) \n(citation and quotations omitted).   \n37. Applying these standards, the Court will address each of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims in turn. \nB. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets \n38. In their first claim in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff s allege  that \nAmory misappropriated “[t]he CMI Process and other trade secret information \ndescribed in [the Amended Complaint]” in violation of G.S. § 66-152, et seq.  (ECF No. \n \n78, at ¶¶ 94–95.)  Amory, however, argues that Plaintiffs have failed to plead a claim \nfor misappropriation of trade secrets.  Specifically, Amory argues that (1) CMI, as the \nowner of the purported trade secrets, is the only Plaintiff with a misappropriation of \ntrade secrets claim; (2) Plai ntiffs’ claim fails because their overly broad allegations \ndo not sufficiently identify the trade secrets at issue; and (3) Plaintiffs ’ claim fails \nbecause they have not made reasonable efforts to guard the secrecy of CMI’s trade \nsecrets.  (ECF No. 90, at pp. 5–12.)    \n39. Under the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act (“TSPA”), “[t]he \nowner of a trade secret [has a] remedy by civil action for misappropriation of his trade \nsecret.”  G.S. § 66-153 (emphasis added).  The TSPA defines a trade secret as  \nbusiness or technical information, including but not limited \nto a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of \ninformation, method, technique, or process that: \n \na. Derives independent actual or potential commercial value \nfrom not being generally known or readily ascertainable \nthrough independent development or reverse engineering \nby persons who can obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure or use; and \n \nb. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy. \n \nG.S. § 66-152(3).   \n \n40. The TSPA defines “misappropriation” of a trade secret  as the \n“acquisition, disclosure, or use of a  trade secret of another without express or implied \nauthority or consent, unless such trade secret was arrived at by independent \ndevelopment, reverse engineering, or was obtained from another person with a right \nto disclose the trade secret.”  G.S. § 66-152(1).   \n \n41. To state a claim for misappropriation of a trade secret under the TSPA, \n“a plaintiff must identify a trade secret with sufficient particularity so as to enable a \ndefendant to delineate that which he is accused of misappropr iating and a court to \ndetermine whether misappropriation  has or i s threatened to occur.”  Krawiec v. \nManly, 370 N.C. 602, 609, 811 S.E.2d 542, 547 –48 (2018) (citation and quotations \nomitted).  Additionally, the plaintiff must “set forth with sufficient specificity the acts \nby which the alleged misappropriation occurred. ”  Bldg. Ctr., Inc. v. Carter Lumber, \nInc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 21, 2016).  \n42. The North Carolina Supreme Court has stated that “there is no \npresumption that a thing is secret” and has warned plaintiffs of the shortcomings of \nrelying on general allegations.  Krawiec, 370 N.C. at 611, 811 S.E.2d at 549 (citation \nand quotations omitted).  Likewise, the North Carolina Court of Appeals has provided \nthat “ a complaint that makes general allegations in sweeping and conclusory \nstatements, without specifically identifying the trade secrets  allegedly \nmisappropriated, is insufficient to state a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.”  \nWashburn v. Yadkin Valley Bank & Trust Co. , 190 N.C. App. 315, 327, 660 S.E.2d \n577, 585 –86 (2008) (citation and quotations omitted) .  Rather, in alleging a  \nmisappropriation of  trade secret s claim, the plaintiff  must include specific details \nabout why the alleged trade secret qualifies as such under G.S. § 66-152(3).  Krawiec, \n370 N.C. at 611, 811 S.E.2d at 549 (“ [P]laintiffs’ failure to describe a specific idea, \nconcept, strategy, or tactic with respect to their  marketing plan or to provide any \ndetail about their dance productions renders their claim too general for this Court to \n \ndetermine—even taking plaintiffs’  factual allegati ons as true —whether there is a \n‘formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or \nprocess’ at issue that ‘[d]erives independent actual or potential commercial value \nfrom not being generally known or readily ascertainable through independent \ndevelopment or reverse engineering.’” (quoting G.S. § 66-152(3)); Safety Test & Equip. \nCo. v. Am. Safety Util. Corp., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *25–26 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. \n23, 2015)  (“A plaintiff must also demonstrate that information is of actu al or \ncommercial value, is not ‘generally known or readily ascertainable,’ and is subject to \nreasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.” (quoting G.S. § 66-152(3)).  Simply alleging \nthat the information at issue falls into a category of trade secrets previously  \nrecognized by our courts is insufficient.  See Krawiec, 370 N.C. at 610, 811 S.E.2d at \n548 (“Provided that the information meets the two requirements for a trade secret as \ndefined in  subsection 66 -152(3), we agree with the determinatio n of the Court of \nAppeals that [i]nformation regarding customer lists, pricing formulas and bidding \nformulas can qualify as a trade secret under  G.S. § 66 -152(3).” ( citation and \nquotations omitted) (emphasis added)).   \n43. With respect to alleging reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of a \ntrade secret, “‘ only where efforts to maintain the s ecrecy of the allegedly \nmisappropriated trade secrets were completely absent have North Carolina courts \ndismissed claims at the 12(b)(6) stage.’” AYM Techs., LLC. v. Rodgers , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 14, at *40 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 9, 2018) (quoting Bldg. Ctr., Inc., 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 79, at *14).   \n \n44. At the outset , the Court first concludes that CMI is the only Plaintiff \nwith a cognizable misappropriation of trade secrets claim  with respect to the CMI \nProcess and its component parts , with the exception of each Plaintiff’s individually \nowned QuickBook files.  The TSPA grants only “[t]he owner of a trade secret” the \nremedy of a civil action for misappropriation of a trade secret.  G.S. § 66 -153.  Here, \nPlaintiffs allege that the CMI Process and its component trade  secrets and \nconfidential information “belong[ ] to CMI.”  (ECF No. 78, at ¶ 26.)  Plaintiffs even \ntitled the section  of the Amended Complaint discussing the trade secrets at issue \n“CMI’S TRADE SECRETS —THE CMI PROCESS.”  ( Id. at p. 5.)  The only trade \nsecret which Plaintiffs claim is owned by an entity other than CMI is the QuickBook \nfiles.  The Amended Complaint states that “each Plaintiff owns its individual \nQuickBook files[.]”  ( Id. at ¶ 29.)  Therefore, each of Plaintiffs has a cognizable \nmisappropriation of trade secrets claim with respect to their individual Quickbook \nfiles, but only CMI has a claim with respect to the other components of the CMI \nProcess. \n45. Next, the Court concludes that the Amended Complaint sets forth “with \nsufficient specificity the acts by which the alleged misappropriation occurred.”  Bldg. \nCtr., Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *9.  The allegations clearly allege that Amory \ndownloaded a lar ge quantity of information from Plaintiffs ’ Box Account to his \npersonal device(s), including many of CMI’s alleged trade secrets.  (ECF No. 78, at \npp. 9–11.)   \n \n46. Additionally, Plaintiffs have alleged that they’ve taken some measures \nto protect the secrecy of  their trade secret information, such as storing their trad e \nsecrets in the password protected Box Account, limiting access to trade secret \ninformation to employees with a specific business need to access the information, \nhaving the ability to track who has accessed or copied trade secret information from \nthe Box Account, and keeping any paper files containing trade secrets secured in their \noffice.  This is sufficient, at this stage, to state that Plaintiffs have taken reasonable \nmeasures to protect their t rade secrets.  Bldg. Ctr., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *14 \n(“[O]nly where efforts to maintain secrecy of allegedly misappropriated trade secrets \nwere completely absent have North Carolina courts dismissed claims at the 12(b)(6) \nstage.”).    \n47. Lastly, the Court ad dresses the real crux here, whether Plaintiffs \nallegations sufficiently identify, in more than conclusory fashion, the aspects of their \nalleged trade secrets  which “[d]erive[ ] independent actual or potential commercial \nvalue from not being generally known  or readily ascertainable through independent \ndevelopment or reverse engineering[.]” G.S. § 66-152(3).   \n48. While Plaintiffs ’ allegations are  less than robust, Plaintiffs have \nidentified their trade secrets, and the aspects of their trade secrets that derive value \nfrom not be ing known, sufficiently enough to put Amory on notice of what he is \naccused of misappropriating  and for this Court to determine whether \nmisappropriation has or is threatened to occur .  First, Plaintiffs have alle ged that \ntheir trade secrets include information—such as financial formulas, pricing policies, \n \nmethods and strategies, and confidential pricing and supplier information—that our \ncourts have previously recognized can qualify as trade secrets.  See GE Betz, Inc. v. \nConrad, 231 N.C. App. 214, 233, 752 S.E.2d 634, 649 (2013)  (“This Court has held \nthat cost history records; pricing policies, formulas, and information; and customer \nlists constitute trade secrets. ”); see also Byrd’s Lawn & Landscaping, Inc. v. Smi th, \n142 N.C. App. 371, 375, 542 S.E.2d 689, 692 (2001) (agreeing that “[c]onfidential data \nregarding operating and pricing policies can . . . qualify as trade secrets.”) ; New \nFriendship Used Clothing Collection, LLC v. Katz, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *7, 34–\n37 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017)  (concluding Plaintiff stated a claim for \nmisappropriation of its “confidential and proprietary strategies” contained in a \ndocument).   \n49. Next, Plaintiffs have identified why their trade secrets derive \ncommercial value from not being known.  Plaintiffs’ overarching allegation is that the \nCMI Process and its component parts are valuable because they reflect what \nPlaintiffs have learned, through experience, “works and does not work when it comes \nto building and operating VA CBOCs.”  (ECF No. 78, at ¶ 31.)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs \nallege that the information contained in the CMI Process is only obtainable through \nworking on VA CBOC projects and learning the VA’s “unpublished” preferences and \ncan’t be independently developed or re verse engineered.  ( Id. at ¶ ¶ 18, 26 .)  For \nexample, CMI’s detailed financial formulas and spreadsheets derive value because \nthey “allow CMI to submit a comprehensive bid in response to an RLP that will meet \nthe VA’s specific financial criteria while also being profitable[.]”  (Id.)  In other words, \n \nPlaintiffs imply that CMI has manipulated the formulas and spread sheets to reflect \nits knowledge of how to submit successful bids to the VA and make a profit.  Similarly, \nPlaintiffs’ QuickBook files are valuable because they contain “detailed bank account \ninformation, private financial information about Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ employees, \nand the various financial data that goes into CMI’s pricing and bidding documents.”   \n(Id. at ¶ 29.)   Plaintiffs insist that  access to the QuickBook files would allow \ncompetitors to re -create “how Plaintiffs are able to successfully bid for and operate \nVA CBOCs across the country. ”  ( Id.)  Liberally construed, t hese and other similar \nallegations of Plaintiffs are sufficient , at this juncture , to allow Plaintiffs ’ \nmisappropriation of trade secrets claim to survive.   \n50. In conclusion, Amory’s motion to dismiss each Plaintiff’s \nmisappropriation of trade secrets claim related to the QuickBook files should be \nDENIED.  Additionally, Amory’s motion to dismiss CMI’s misappropriation of trade \nsecrets claim, with respect to the CMI Process and its component parts, should be \nDENIED.  To the extent CM, LLC, ACTS or ACTS Investments attempts to state a \nmisappropriation of tra de secrets claim based on CMI’s trade secrets, however, \nAmory’s motion to dismiss should be GRANTED. \nC. Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud \n51. In their  second and third  claims for relief, Plaintiffs bring  breach of \nfiduciary duty and constructive fra ud claims against Amory.  Plaintiffs allege that \nAmory owed fiduciary duties to each individual Plaintiff and willfully and maliciously \nbreached tho se duties by (1) misappropriating confidential and trade secret \n \ninformation; (2) conspiring with the owners of the Georgia LLC to carry out the \nfraudulent overpayment scheme; (3) waiting until after ACTS made a $150,000 \ndistribution to announce his resignation; and (4) giving an unwarranted bonus and \nraise to King.  (ECF No. 78, at ¶ 103.)  Plaintiffs further allege that Amory personally \nbenefitted from the breaches of fiduciary duty, thereby giving rise to a constructive \nfraud claim.  (Id. at ¶¶ 106–11.)  Amory argues that Plaintiffs failed to state claims \nfor breach of fiduciary duty  and constructive fraud  because (1) CMI and CM, LLC \nhave not sufficiently alleged that Amory  owed them a fiduciary duty; (2) Plaintiffs \nhave not sufficiently alleged that Amory breached a fiduciary duty or caused harm to \nany of Plaintiffs ; and (3) Plaintiffs do no t allege that Amory benefitted himself at \ntheir expense.  (ECF No. 90, at pp. 14–20.)   \n52. To state a claim for breach of fiduciar y duty, a plaintiff must show  the \nexistence of a fiduciary rel ationship, a breach of that duty, and that the brea ch \nproximately caused injury to the plaintiff.  Gao v. Sinova Specialties, Inc., 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 71, at *36 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 16, 2018) (citing Farndale Co., LLC v. \nGibellini, 176 N.C. App. 60, 68, 628 S.E.2d 15, 20 (2006)).   \n53. In contrast, to plead a claim for constructive fraud, a plain tiff must \nallege a breach of a fiduciary duty and allege that the defendant benefit ted himself \nas a result of the breach.  White v. Consol. Planning, Inc., 166 N.C. App. 283, 294, 603 \nS.E.2d 147,  156 (2004) (“The primary difference between pleading a claim  for \nconstructive fraud and one for breach of fiduciary duty is the constructive fraud \nrequirement that the defendant benefit himself.”); Crumley & Assocs., P.C. v. Charles \n \nPeed & Assocs., P.A., 219 N.C. App. 615, 620, 730 S.E.2d 763, 767 (2012) (“To establish \nconstructive fraud, a plaintiff must show that defendant (1) owes plaintiff a fiduciary \nduty; (2) breached this fiduciary duty; and (3) sought to benefit himself in the \ntransaction.”).  Additionally, a claim of constructive fraud m ust be pled with \nparticularity.  Terry v. Terry , 302 N.C. 77, 85, 273 S.E.2d 674, 679 (1981) .  The \nparticularity requirement is satisfied by “alleging facts and circumstances “(1) which \ncreated the relation of trust and confidence, and (2) [which] led up to and surrounded \nthe consummation of the transaction in which defendant is alleged to have taken \nadvantage of his position of trust to the hurt of plaintiff.”  Id. (citation and quotations \nomitted). \ni. Existence of Fiduciary Relationship \n54. The Court begins its analysis by assessin g whether a fiduciary \nrelationship existed between Amory and Plaintiffs.  Amory does not dispute that, as \na corporate officer of ACTS and a manager of ACTS Investments, he  owed fiduciary \nduties to ACTS and ACTS Investments  as a matter of law .  (ECF No. 90,  at p. 15.)  \nHe does, however, dispute that he owed de facto fiduciary duties to CMI and CM, LLC \narising from his relationship with those entities.   Amory primarily argues that CMI \nand CM, LLC cannot meet the extraordinary bar of alleging a de facto fiduciary duty \nbecause he “had no relationship with either CMI or CM, LLC” as he was never \nemployed by CMI and was not an employee of CM, LLC at the time of the alleged \nbreaches.  (ECF No. 90, at pp. 15–16.)   \n \n55.  “Courts in North Carolina recognize that ‘a fiduciary duty can arise by \noperation of law ( de jure ) or based on the facts and circumstances ( de facto )[.]’”  \nAlkemal Sing. Private Ltd. v. Dew Global Fin., LLC , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 36, at *34 \n(N.C. Super. Ct.  April 19, 2018) (quoting Lockerman v. S. River E lec. Membership \nCorp., 250 N.C. App. 631, 635, 794 S.E.2d 346, 351 (2016)  (alteration in original)) .  \n“The standard for finding a de facto fiduciary relationship is a demanding one: [o]nly \nwhen one party figuratively holds all the cards —all the financial power or technical \ninformation, for example —have North Carolina courts found that the special \ncircumstance of a fid uciary relationship has arisen.”  Lockerman, 250 N.C. App. at \n636, 794 S.E .2d at 352 (quoting S.N.R. Mgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC , \n189 N.C. App. 601,  613, 659 S.E.2d 442, 451 (2008) (internal quotations omitted)).   \nPut another way, a de facto  fiduciary relationship exists  only where “‘there is \nconfidence reposed on one side, and resulting domination and influence on the other.’”  \nDalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 652, 548 S.E.2d 704, 708 (2001) (emphasis in original) \n(quoting Abbitt v. Gregory, 201 N.C. 577, 598, 160 S.E. 896, 906 (1931)). \n56. Here, Plaintiffs first maintain that Amory owed de facto fiduciary duties \nto CMI and CM, LLC because of the special trust and confidence they reposed in him \nas an accountant/bookkeeper .  Plaintiffs allege  that “CMI and CM, LLC trusted \nAmory with substantial responsibility for  accounting and bookkeeping on behalf of \nCMI and all its affiliated companies[,]” including providing Amory with “access to all \nof Plaintiffs’ QuickBook files and tax returns.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 80–81.)   \n \n57. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ allegations fall well short of alleging \nthat Amory was in a position of domination and influence over CMI or CM, LLC with \nregard to his role as an accountant and bookkeeper .  While his role as bookkeeper \nundoubtedly provided Amory access to confidential financial information, this alone \ndoes not create fiduciary responsibilities to CMI or CM, LLC.  See Hager v. Smithfield \nE. Health Holdings, LLC, No. COA18-651, 2019 N.C. App. LEXIS 238, at *17 (2019) \n(“While it is true that the provision of confidential in formation places confidence in \nthe recipient, that alone does not create a fiduciary duty[.]”).  Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat the owners or managers of CMI or CM, LLC lacked access to the financial and \nother information needed to manage the  companies.  Nor do Plaintiffs allege that \nSasser and Crenshaw did not have access to the same financial and other information \nto which Amory was provided access, or that Amory was the only one with access to, \nor technical knowledge of, CMI’s or its affiliated companies ’ accounting records.  In \nthe absence of such allegations, the mere fact that Amory was given substantial \naccounting and bookkeeping responsibility  is not sufficient to establish a fiduciary \nrelationship.  Timbercreek Land & Timber Co., LLC v. Robbins, 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n64, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 28, 2017) (“Even when an employee is entrusted with \nsubstantial managerial authority, a fiduciary relationship will not exist absent \nevidence that such authority led to the employer being subjugated to the impro per \ninfluences or domination of [its] employee” (citation and quotations omitted)). \n58. Plaintiffs also allege that Amory owed a fiduciary duty to CMI because \nof the trust CMI reposed in him to act as a project manager for eight of its CBOC \n \nprojects and “because of the way [he] operated as a project manager[.]”  (Id. at ¶¶ 82–\n84.)  Plaintiffs state that, in his role as project manager, Amory “shared extremely \nlimited information with Sasser, Crenshaw, or Thorn about the project[s], and he \nnever shared any information about his work on the project in Macon, Georgia.”  (Id. \nat ¶ 83.)  Therefore, Amory “had superior knowledge about [the projects he worked \non], and CMI and its principals were forced to rely on [him] to a substantial degree.”  \n(Id. at ¶ 84.) \n59. The allegations also are insufficient to give rise to a fiduciary \nrelationship between Amory and CMI  based on Amory’s role as a project manager .  \nPlaintiffs state only that Amory shared limited information about the CBOC projects \nhe managed with Sasser and Crenshaw, the officers and directors of CMI.  Plaintiffs, \nhowever, do not allege that Amory refused to share information about the projects \nwith Sasser and  Crenshaw or somehow dominated or controlled Sasser, Crenshaw, \nand CMI with respect to managing CBOC projects.  Nor do they allege facts showing \nthat Amory held all the financial power or technical knowledge with regard to  \nmanaging CBOC p rojects.  Therefor e, the allegations fail to give rise to a fiduciary \nrelationship between CMI and Amory with regard to his role as a project manager.  \nSee Sandhills Home Care, L.L.C. v. Companion Home Care - Unimed, Inc. , 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 61, at *55 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 1,  2016) (stating that the mere fact \nthat an employer delegated responsibility or “placed confidence” in an employee is \nnot enough to create a fiduciary duty, unless the facts show “that the employer [ ] was \n \nsomehow subjugated to the improper influences or d omination of his employee.” \n(citations and quotations omitted)). \n60. In conclusion, the Plaintiffs have failed to allege the existence of a \nfiduciary relationship between Amory and CMI or CM, LLC.  Therefore,  Amory’s \nmotion to dismiss CMI and CM, LLC’s breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud \nclaims should be GRANTED. \nii. Breach and Injury \n61. The Court now turns its attention to whether Plaintiffs sufficiently \nalleged a breach of fiduciary duty by Amory against ACTS and ACTS Investments  \nand whether Plaintiffs allege that the breach proximately caused injury to ACTS or \nACTS Investments .  Plaintiffs state that Amory breached his fiduciary duties to \nACTS and ACTS Investments  by acquiring and taking their trade secrets  and \nconfidential information to his new employe r.  (ECF No. 78, at ¶ 78.)  Additionally, \nPlaintiffs state that Amory breached his fiduciary duties to ACTS by carrying out the \nfraudulent overpayment scheme; waiting until after receiving a $150,000 distribution \nfrom ACTS to announce his departure; and gi ving an unwarranted raise and bonus \nto former ACTS employee King.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 78–79.)   Amory argues that Plaintiffs \nfailed to allege a breach of fiduciary duty because (1) only CMI owned the trade \nsecrets at issue; (2) the Amended Complaint fails to explain how Amory’s \nparticipation in the fraudulent overbilling scheme constituted a breach of his duties \nto ACTS; (3) Amory remains a 25% owner of ACTS and the Amended Complaint does \nnot allege he was not entitled to the distribution or that he would not have received \n \nit had he announced his resignation earlier; and (4) the Amended Complaint does not \nallege that Amory knew that Ki ng’s raise and bonus were unwarranted.   (ECF No. \n90, at pp. 17–19.)  Amory also argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that they \nsuffered any cognizable harm.  Id. \n62. The Court first concludes that Plaintiffs  have sufficiently stated a \nbreach of fiduciary duty by Amory against ACTS and ACTS Investments arising from \nhis alleged misappropriation of their QuickBook files.  Amory owed fiduciary duties \nto ACTS as an officer, and to ACT S Investments as a Manager.  The Amended \nComplaint states that ACTS and A CTS Investments owned their individual \nQuickBook files, which they consider trade secrets, and that Amory misappropriated \nthis information and took it to his new employer in the construction industry.  (ECF \nNo. 78, at ¶¶ 29, 78.)  Further, Plaintiffs alleg e they have suffered substantial \ndamages as a result of this breach and are entitled to over $25,000 in damages.  These \nallegations are sufficient, at this stage,  to allege that Amory breached his fiduciary \nduties to ACTS and ACTS Investments by wrongfully taking their trade secrets with \nthe intention of using them to compete with Plaintiffs.  RoundPoint Mortg. Co. v. \nFlorez, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *24–26 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 18, 2016) (concluding \nthat the plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim survived a motion to dismiss where \nthe plaintiff contended that the defendant, a former employee of plaintiff, took \n“improper steps ,” including allegedly misappropriating trade secrets, to facilitate \ncompetition against the plaintiff).   \n \n63. The Court also concludes that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Amory \nbreached his fiduciary duty to ACTS by engaging in the fraudulent overpayment \nscheme.  Generally, the existence of a fiduciary relationship creates a duty to fully \ndisclose material facts.  Vail v. Vail, 233 N.C. 109, 116, 63 S.E.2d 202, 207 (1951) (“[A] \nconfidential of fiduciary relation imposes upon the one who is trusted the duty \nto . . . disclose all material facts affecting the relation.” ).  Here, Plaintiffs allege that \nAmory intentionally withheld information about the fraudulent concealment scheme \nfrom other officers and directors of ACTS in breach of his duty to disclose.  This is \nsufficient to allege that Amory breached his fiduciary duty to ACTS.   Furthermore, \nPlaintiffs allege that they suffered actu al damages on account of the fraud because \nthey were “forced to expend time and resources” to investigate the fraudulent scheme \nand because the scheme placed ACTS and CMI’s professional reputation in jeopardy.  \nThese allegations of actual damages were suff icient to put Amory on notice of the \nalleged harm caused by his breach a nd to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty \nwith respect to the fraudulent overpayment scheme.   \n64. Finally, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs fai l to allege that Amory \nbreached his fiduciary duty to ACTS by receiving a $150,000 distribution before \ndeparting from the company, or by paying ACTS employee King a bonus and giving \nher a raise.  Amory remains a 25% owner of ACTS and Plaintiffs failed to al lege in \nany way that he was not entitled to receive the distribution at issue from ACTS.  Nor \nhave Plaintiffs cited any authority for the proposition that leaving a company after \nreceiving an ownership distribution constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.  \n \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs present no more than a bare allegation that the raise and \nbonus Amory paid to Patti King was “unwarranted.”  Plaintiffs do not provide \nsupporting allegations  that Amory was aware  that King was unqualified or \nundeserving of the rais e or bonus.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed to allege that \nAmory breached his fiduciary duty to ACTS by accepting his $150,000 distribution \nbefore resigning his employment with ACTS , or by paying King a raise and bonus  \nwhile she was employed by ACTS.  \niii. Personal Benefit \n65. Amory next argues that Plaintiffs’ claims for  breach of fiduciary duty \nand constructive fraud should be dismissed because (1) Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary \nduty claim does not allege that Amory sought to benefit himself; and (2) Plaintiff s’ \nconstructive fraud claim fails to allege with particularity that Amory sought to benefit \nhimself.   \n66. Amory relies on the Supreme Court case of King v. Bryant  for the \nproposition that a claim for breach of fiduciary duty must allege that the defendant \nsought personal benefit.  369 N.C. 451, 795 S.E.2d 340 (2017).  In Bryant, the court \nwrote that “ before liability for breach of fiduciary duty can exist, it must be shown \nthat the defendant sought to benefit himself at the expense of  the other party.”  Id. \nat 465, 795 S.E.2d at 349.  The Bryant court also stated in a footnote that “[t]he \nelements of a claim for breach of fiduciary relationship are the same as those for \nconstructive fraud.”  Id. at n.3.   \n \n67.  The Court notes that the holding in Bryant is difficult to reconcile with \nthe many North Carolina appellate court  and business court  decisions which \nrecognize a distinction between breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud \nclaims, most notably that “wrongful benefit is . . . an element of constructive fr aud \nand not of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty .”  White, 166 N.C. App. at 294, 603 \nS.E.2d at 155–56 (citing Barger, 346 N.C. at 666, 488 S.E.2d at 224) (i nternal \nquotations omitted)); e.g., Hauser v. Hauser , 252 N.C. App. 10, 16, 796 S.E.2d 391, \n395 (2017) (“The primary difference between pleading a claim for constructive fraud \nand one for breach of fiduciary duty is the constructive fraud requirement that the \ndefendant benefit himself.” (citation and quotations omitted)); Trillium Ridge Condo. \nAss’n v. Trillium Links & Vill., LLC , 236 N.C. App. 478, 502, 764 S.E.2d 203, 220  \n(2014) ( same); Ellison v. Alexander , 207 N.C. App. 401, 408, 700 S.E.2d 102, 108  \n(2010) (same); Can-Dev, ULC v. SSTI Centennial, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 9, at *21 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 25, 2018) (same) ; Azure Dolphin, LLC v. Barton , 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 90, at *23–24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 2, 2017) (“[C]auses of action [for breach of \nfiduciary duty and constructive fraud] are different and require Plaintiffs to prove \ndifferent elements.”).   \n68. The requirement that a fiduciary seek to benefit himself appears \nparticularly problematic in the context of claims based on breach of statutory duties \nby corporate directors and officers for failure to exercise a  duty of care transacting \nthe business of the corporation or LLC , which may not involve any benefit to the \ndirector.  See, e.g., Seraph Garrison, LLC v. Garrison , No. COA14-1166, 2016 N.C. \n \nApp. LEXIS 1376, at *12–16 (2016) (holding a c orporate president’s failure to pay \npayroll taxes owed by corporation to state and federal tax authorities for three years \nwas a breach of fiduciary duties imposed on corporate officers by G.S. § 55-8-42(a)). \n69. In any event, the Court need not address in this case the impact of \nBryant on the elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty since the Amended \nComplaint sufficiently alleges that Amory personally benefitted from his alleged \nbreaches, and states a claim for breach of fiduciary  duty, even  under the Bryant \nCourt’s recitation of the claim.   Plaintiffs allege that Amory “took advantage of his \nfiduciary relationship . . . in order to benefit himself financially by . . . using Plaintiffs’ \ntrade secrets to compete unfairly against Plaintiffs” and that “Amory personally \nbenefitted from [the fraudulent] overpayment scheme.”  (ECF No. 78, at ¶¶ 73, 109.) \nWhile the claim of personal benefit may not be borne out by the facts revealed in \ndiscovery, the allegations are minimally sufficient at this early stage of the case to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss. \n70. In conclusion, Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated claims against Amory \nfor breach of his fiduciary duties to ACTS and ACTS Investments by \nmisappropriating their alleged trade secrets  with the intent to compete and by \ncarrying out the fraudul ent overpayment scheme.  Amory’s motion to dismiss those \nclaims should be DENIED.   Amory’s motion to dismiss all other breach of fiduciary \nduty claims brought by Plaintiffs, however, should be GRANTED.   \n71.    The Court also is not persuaded by  Amory’s argument that the \nelement of personal benefit necessary to a claim for constructive fraud must be \n \nalleged with particularity since Amory does not cite, and the Court is unable to locate, \nany authority supporting that proposition.  (ECF No. 90, at pp. 19 –20.)  The Court \nhas concluded that Plaintiffs adequately allege that Amory personally benefitted \nfrom the breaches of fiduciary duty. \n72. In conclusion , ACTS and ACTS Investments have  also sufficiently \nalleged constructive fraud claims against Amory for his alleged misappropriation of \ntheir QuickBook files  with intent to compete , and ACTS has sufficiently alleged a \nconstructive fraud claim against Amory for his participation in the fraudulent \noverpayment scheme.  Amory’s motion to dismiss those claims should be DENIE D.  \nAmory’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ other constructive fraud claims, however, \nshould be GRANTED. \nD. Actual Fraud \n73. In their fourth claim for relief, CMI and ACTS  bring a claim of actual \nfraud against Amory arising from the fraudulent overpayment scheme. 2  Plaintiffs \nallege that: (1) Amory made false representations of material fact to Sasser when he \nstated, on at least four different occasions, that overpay ments to the Bank were \nmistakes; (2) the false representations were reasonably calculated to deceive  and \nmade with the intent to deceive Sasser; (3) Sasser was deceived and reasonably relied \nupon Amory’s representations by wiring excess payments back to the owners of the \nGeorgia LLC; and (4) that as a result of the false representations CMI and ACTS \n                                            \n2 Plaintiffs’ fraud claim does not state that it was brought solely on behalf of ACTS and CMI, \nbut Plaintiffs allege that ACTS and CMI were the only entities to suffer damages from the \nscheme.  (ECF No. 78, at ¶¶ 76 –77, 118.)  Thus, the Court will treat the claim as being \nbrought on behalf of ACTS and CMI.  \n \nContracting incurred costs for professional services in excess of $25,000.  (ECF No. \n78, at pp. 20–21.)  Amory argues that the claim must be dismissed because Plaintiffs \nfailed to allege the elements of reliance or injury.  (ECF No. 90, at p. 12.)   \n74. The elements of a claim for actual fraud are: “(1) false representation or \nconcealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made with \nintent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the injured \nparty.”  Collier v. Bryant , 216 N.C. App. 419, 430 –31, 719 S.E.2d 70, 80  (2011) \n(citation and quotations omitted).  Further, claims for actual fraud must be pled with \nparticularity.  Terry, 302 N.C. at 84–85, 273 S.E.2d at 678–79.  “[I]n pleading actual \nfraud the particularity requirement is met by alleging time, place and content of the \nfraudulent representation, identity of the person making the representation and \nwhat was obtained as a result of the fraudulent acts or representations. ”  Id. at 85, \n273 S.E.2d at 678.  “ Dismissal of a claim for failure to plead with  particularity is \nproper where there are no facts whatsoever setting forth the time, place, or specific \nindividuals who purportedly made the misrepresentations. ”  Town of Belhaven v. \nPantego Creek, LLC, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 1164, at *15, 793 S.E.2d 711, 718 (2016).   \n75. Here, Plaintiffs have alleged the necessary elements of a claim for actual \nfraud with the requisite particularity.  Plaintiffs’ allegations state that Amory , on \nfour occasions  in the fall of 2017, made misrepresentations  to Sasser  that \noverpayments by the Bank to ACTS were “mistakes” when they were actually part of \nan intentional scheme to defraud the bank.  (ECF No. 78, at ¶¶ 53–77.)  Furthermore, \nthe allegations detail that Amory’s false representations were intended to mislead \n \nSasser into wiring the Bank’s overpayments back to the owners of the Georgia LLC, \nwhich Sasser in fact did on three occasions.  (Id.)  Lastly, the allegations state that \nas a result of Amory’s intentional misrepresenta tions and failure to disclose the \noverpayment scheme to CMI and ACTS, the companies were forced to spend time and \nresources investigating what went on to protect CMI and ACTS.   \n76. Contrary to Amory’s argument, Plaintiffs have alleged both reliance and \ndamages.  First, the allegation that Sasser in fact wired overpayments back to the \nLLC after Amory misrepresented to Sasser that the overpayments were “mistakes” \nis sufficient to show that Sasser relied on Amory’s false statements.  See Hunter v. \nGuardian Life I ns. Co. of Am. , 162 N.C. App. 477, 481, 593 S.E.2d 595, 599  (2004) \n(stating that the element of reliance can be inferred from allegations that the plaintiff \nwas actually deceived by and acted upon the misleading statements).  Lastly, \nPlaintiffs identified the specific ways that Amory’s fraudulent acts caused damage to \nthem: CMI and ACTS  “were forced  . . . to expend time and resources [(over \n$25,000)] . . . to investigate and document the [fraudulent overpayment scheme], and \nto negotiate agreements for the winding up the Macon CBOC project and all \nassociated agreements.”  (ECF No. 78, at ¶¶ 76, 118.)  This is a sufficient allegation \nof damages, as plaintiffs in North Carolina have a duty to mitigate their damages \nand may recover as damages reasonable mitigat ion expenses.  Smith v. Martin, 124 \nN.C. App. 592, 600–02, 478 S.E.2d 228, 233 –34 (1996) (noting that “[a] plaintiff has \nthe duty to avoid or minimize th e consequences of the defendant’ s wrong [,]” and \n \nconcluding that the trial court did not err in awarding  the plaintiff re asonable \nmitigation expenses).   \n77. In conclusion, Amory’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ actual fraud claim \nshould be DENIED. \nE. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices \n78.  In their fifth claim for relief, Plaintiffs allege that Amory \nmisappropriated CMI’s trade secrets “in order to compete unfairly against Plaintiffs” \nin violation of the UDTPA.  (ECF No. 78, at ¶ 120.)   Plaintiffs argue that since they \n“have sufficiently stated a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, . . . Plaintiffs \nhave sufficiently stated a claim for a UDTP [A] violation.”  (ECF No. 91, at p. 21.)  \nPlaintiffs are incorrect.  To state a claim for violation of the UDTPA, a plaintiff must \nshow that “(1) defendant committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) the \naction in question was in or affecting commerce, and (3) the act proximately caused \ninjury to the plaintiff.”  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 656, 548 S.E.2d at 711.  While a claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets can support a claim for violation of the UDTPA , it \nmust meet all three of the elements of an unfair trade practices claim.  Drouillard v. \nKeister Williams Newspaper Servs., Inc., 108 N.C. App. 169, 172, 423 S.E.2d 324, 326 \n(1992) (“If the violation of the Trade Secrets Protection Act satisfies [the] three prong \ntest, it would be a violation of  [G.S.] § 75-1.1.”).  Accordingly, the Court must decide \nwhether Plaintiffs have alleged the three elements of the claim. \n79. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ allegations that Amory \nmisappropriated trade secrets sufficient ly states an unfair or deceptive act.  In \n \naddition, Amory does not contend that Plaintiffs fail to allege an injury.   Instead, \nAmory argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for violation of the UDTPA \nbecause they do not allege Amory or BridgePoint is competing with Plaintiffs.  (ECF \nNo. 90, at p. 20 .)  The Court interprets this as an argument  that Plaintiffs have not \nalleged facts supporting an allegation that Amory’s misappropriation of trade secrets \nis “in or affecting commerce.” \n80. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that “Amory’s violation of \n[the UDTPA] was in or affecting commerce .” (ECF No. 78, at ¶ 122.)   However, the \nCourt is not required to accept  this conclusory allegation where it is not otherwise \nsupported by allegations of fact . Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & \nHuman Servs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005) .  Plaintiffs allege \nthat Amory is “using Plaintiffs’ confidential and trade secret information to compete \nunfairly against Plaintiffs,” (id. at ¶ 109), but  don’t allege facts regarding how Amory \nis competing with them .  Plaintiffs don’t allege that Amory  has disclosed the trade \nsecrets to his new employer, BridgePoint.  There also is no allegation that Amory has \nused any trade secrets to prepare or submit proposals to the VA for projects on which \nPlaintiffs are bidding, nor that BridgePoint has suddenly started bidding on VA \nprojects or otherwise soliciting the VA .  Plaintiffs also have not alleged that Amory \nor BridgePoint has interfered with  relationships between Plaintiffs and the VA or \nbetween Plaintiffs and their employees.   These types of allegations are usually \n \npresent in cases in which an employer makes a claim for violation of the UDTPA \nbased, at least in part, on a former employee’s misappropriation of trade secrets.3   \n81. Elsewhere in the Amended Complaint,  Plaintiffs seemingly undercut \ntheir allegation that Amory is actually using CMI’s trade secrets to compete with \nPlaintiff, alleging instead that  “with the information Amory \nacquired . . . BridgePoint . . . could begin to unfairly compete with Plaintiffs \nimmediately.”  ( Id. at ¶ 90 ; see also ¶ 12 ( “Plaintiffs are informed and believe that \nAmory is preparing to cause Plaintiffs millions of dollars in damages by using their \nown trade secrets and confidential information to compete unfairly against them.” ); \n¶ 87 (“If Amory is allowed to take the trade secrets he has stolen and deliver them to \nBridgePoint or another of Plaintiffs’ competitors, thus allowing the competitor to \nimmediately comp ete against CMI for VA CBOC projects, Plaintiffs will suffer \nirreparable harm.”) (emphasis added to each quote).) \n                                            \n3 See e.g., Southern Fastening Sys. v. Grabber Constr. Prods., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *7 –\n8, 29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 28, 2015) (plaintiff’s UDTPA claim survived a motion to dismiss \nwhere the plaintiff sufficiently alleged a misappropriation of trade secrets claim, inc luding \nallegations that defendant had contacted over 40 of the plaintiff’s customers and that 17 of \nthe plaintiff’s former customers had either reduced or stopped doing business with plaintiff); \nAm. Air Filter Co. v. Price, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 55, at * 8–9, 31–32 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 26, \n2017) (refusing to dismiss plaintiff’s UDTPA claim where plaintiff alleged that defendant was \nworking for a competitor and that defendant was soliciting business from customers of \nplaintiff); Bldg. Ctr., Inc.,  2016 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *30 (dismissal of plaintiff’s claim for \nviolation of UDTPA denied where plaintiff alleged that defendant -competitor hired the \nplaintiff’s salespersons and solicited plaintiff’s customers to take their business); Window \nGang Ventures, Corp. v. Salinas, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *5–6, 55 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 2, \n2019) (plaintiff’s UDTPA claim survived a motion to dismiss where plaintiff alleged that the \ndefendant launched a competing business utilizing the plaintiff’s customer lists, phone \nnumbers, and tr ade secrets and that the defendant “intentionally diverted plaintiff’s \ncustomers and revenue” to the new business). \n \n82. In determining what constitutes unfair or deceptive conduct “in or \naffecting commerce,” the Supreme Court of North Carolina has held that the \nUDTPA’s provisions apply to “interactions between market participants,” but not to \nconduct that is “contained sole ly within a single business.”  White, 364 N.C. at  53, \n691 S.E.2d at 680.  Therefore, where “the unfairness of [a defendant’s] conduct [does] \nnot occur in his dealings with other market participants[,]” the defendant’s conduct \nis not in or affecting commerce and is outside the purview of the UDTPA.  Alexander \nv. Alexander, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 1252, at *10, 792 S.E.2d 901, 905 (2016) (quoting \nWhite, 364 N.C. at 54, 691 S.E.2d at 680 (quotations omitted)).  Plaintiffs allege that \nAmory acquired CMI’s trade s ecrets without authorization  and is using them to \ncompete, but do not allege additional specific facts showing that Amory has used or \ndisclosed the trade secrets in a way that creates an “interaction between market \nparticipants,” that would support the allegation that Amory’s wrongful conduct is “in \nor affecting commerce  and not merely “ contained solely within a single business.”   \nWhite, 364 N.C. at 53, 691 S.E.2d at 680. \n83. Nevertheless, North Carolina is a notice pleading state, and \nA complaint sufficiently states a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted when it gives sufficient notice of the events \nor transactions which produced the claim to enable the \nadverse party to understand the nature of it and the basis \nfor it, to file a responsive pleading, and by us ing the rules \nprovided for obtaining pretrial discovery to get any \nadditional information he may need to prepare for trial. \n \nSpoor v. Barth, 811 S.E.2d 609, 612, 2018 N.C. App. LEXIS 93, at *6 (2018).  “The \nsystem of notice pleading affords a sufficiently liberal construction of complaints so \n \nthat few fail to survive a motion to dismiss.”  Wray v. City of Greensboro, 370 N.C. 41, \n46, 802 S.E.2d 894, 898 (2017) (quoting Ladd v. Estate of Kellenberger, 314 N.C. 477, \n481, 334 S.E.2d 751, 755 (1985)) .  Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that Amory is using \nCMI’s trade secrets to compete, albeit without specific explanation of such \ncompetition, and the Court must reluctantly conclude that the allegation is barely \nsufficient to provide Amory with sufficient notice of the nature of the claim to \nwithstand Amory’s motion to dismiss.  Accordingly, Amory’s motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claim for violation of the UDTPA should be DENIED.     \nF. Computer Trespass \n84. In their sixth claim for relief, Plaintiffs assert that Amory violated G.S. \n§ 14-458, and seek to impose civil liability against him .  G.S. § 14 -458 governs the \ncrime of computer trespass.  According to Plaintiffs, Amory committed a computer \ntrespass by “ma[king] or caus[ing] to be made an unauthorized copy of computer data \nbelonging to Plaintiffs and stored in the Box Account owned by Plaintiffs.”  ( Id. at \n¶ 127.)  In so doing, Plaintiffs assert “Amory used his company computer and the Box \nAccount in a manner exceeding the right or permission granted to him by Plaintiffs.”  \n(Id. at ¶ 128.)  Plaintiffs further allege that they’ve “sustained substantial damage as \na result of Amory’s computer trespass.”   \n85. Amory argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege a claim because they (1) do \nnot have a cause of action under § 14 -458 because they do  not allege they suffered \ninjury to their “property or person”; (2) fail to identify their damages with reasonable \ncertainty; (3) have not shown that Amory was “without authority” to access the Box  \n \nAccount files; and (4) do not identify any company policy or agreement that prohibited \nAmory from downloading the Box Account files.  (ECF No. 90, at pp. 22–25.)   \n86. Under G.S. § 14 -458(c), “[a] ny person whose property or person is \ninjured by reason of a [c omputer trespass] may sue for and recover any damages \nsustained and the costs of the suit pursuant to  G.S. 1-539.2A.”  Property, as used in \nthe statute, means “financial instruments, information, including electronically \nprocessed or produced data, and computer software and computer programs in either \nmachine or human readable form, and any other tangible or intangible item of value.”  \nG.S. § 14-453(8).  Relevant here, a computer trespass includes the unlawful use of a \ncomputer or computer network without authority and with the intent to “[m]ake or \ncause to be made an unauthorized copy, in any form, including, but not limited to, \nany printed or electronic form of computer data, computer programs, or computer \nsoftware residing in, communicated by, or produce d by a computer or computer \nnetwork.”  G.S. § 14-458(a)(5).  “[A] person is ‘without authority’ when [ ] the person \nhas no right or permission of the owner to use a computer, or the person uses a \ncomputer in a manner exceeding the right or permission[.]”  G.S. § 14-458(a).   \n87. There is very little guidance from North Carolina courts on how a civil \nclaim for computer trespass should be analyzed at the 12(b)(6) stage.  Nevertheless, \nthe Court concludes that Plaintiffs have done enough here to state a claim for \ncomputer trespass.  Plaintiffs allege that Amory’s downloading of their computer data \nfrom the Box Account to his personal device(s) exceeded the right or permission \ngranted to him by Plaintiffs and resulted in damage to them.  See Spirax Sarco, Inc. \n \nv. SSI Eng’g, Inc., 122 F. Supp. 3d 408, 417–18 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 10, 2015) (stating that \nthe plaintiff companies ’ allegations that “[the defendant] intentionally used his \n[company-issued] laptop to download vast quantities of computer files to his own \nmedia devic es and Dropbox account, without authorization  and . . . deleted vast \nquantities of computer files from [company -issued] laptop without authorization”  \nwere “sufficient to state a claim [for computer trespass] under North Carolina law”).  \nThese allegations put Amory on notice of his actions which are at issue, allow him to \nunderstand the nature of Plaintiffs’ claim, and enable him to answer and prepare for \ntrial.  Wake County v. Hotels.com, L.P., 235 N.C. App. 633, 646, 762 S.E.2d 477 , 486 \n(2014).  Therefore, Amory’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ computer trespass claim \nshould be DENIED.  \nG. Punitive Damages  \n79. In their seventh and final claim for relief, Plaintiffs allege a claim for \npunitive damages.  (ECF No. 78, at ¶¶ 132–135.)  Amory argues the claim should be \ndismissed because, inter alia, it was not pled with particularity. \n80. Punitive damages are recoverable “only if the claimant proves the \ndefendant is liable for compensatory damages” and the aggravating factor of (1) fraud; \n(2) malice; or (3) willful or wanton conduct “was present and was related to the injury \nfor which compensatory damages were awarded.”  G.S. § 1D-15.  North Carolina Rule \nof Civil Procedure 9(k) requires a plaintiff to aver with particularity the aggravating \nfactor that supports an award of punitive damages.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(k).  The \nparticularity requirement is satisfied by allegations of “facts or elements showing the \n \naggravating circumstances which would justify the award of  punitive damages .”  \nWiley v. L3 Communs. Vertex Aero., LLC, 251 N.C. App. 354, 367, 795 S.E.2d 580, 590 \n(2016) (citation and quotations omitted). \n81. Here, Plaintiffs allege that “Amory’s acts described [in the Amended \nComplaint]” were undertaken  with personal ill will toward Plaintiffs, with \nintentional disregard of and indifference to their rights, and that he knew or should \nhave known that his conduct was likely to  cause damage or harm to them.  The \nAmended Complaint alleges claims against Amory for constructive and actual fraud \nand misappropriation of trade secrets.  Those claims have survived Amory’s motion \nto dismiss, support a claim for compensatory damages, and allege facts or elements \nthat show the potential presence of the aggravating factors of fraud and willful or \nwanton conduct.  See G.S. § 66-154(c); see also Collier v. Bryant, 216 N.C. App. 419, \n434, 719 S.E.2d 70, 82 (2011) (“[P]unitive damages can be awarded if either actual or \nconstructive fraud is shown.”).  Thus, Amory’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ punitive \ndamages claim should be DENIED. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nTherefore, it is ORDERED that: \n1. Amory’s motion to dismiss each Plaintiff’s misappropriation of trade secrets \nclaim related to their QuickBook files is DENIED.  Amory’s motion to \ndismiss CMI’s misappropriation of trade secrets claim, with respect to the \nCMI Process and its component parts, is DENIED.  To the extent CM, LLC, \nACTS or ACTS Investments attempt to state a misappropriation of trade \n \nsecrets claim based on the CMI Process and its component parts , Amory’s \nmotion to dismiss is GRANTED. \n2. Amory’s motion to dismiss ACTS and ACTS Investments’ breach of \nfiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims based on his misappropriation \nof their trade secrets is DENIED.  \n3. Amory’s motion to dismiss ACTS’ breach of fiduciary duty and constructive \nfraud claim based on his  participation in the fraudulent overpayment \nscheme is DENIED.  Amory’s motion to dismiss ACTS ’ breach of fiduciary \nduty and constructive fraud claim based on his decision to resign shortly \nafter receiving a $150,000 distribution is GRANTED.  Amory’s motio n to \ndismiss ACTS’ breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud claim based \non his decision to give a promotion and raise to Patti King is GRANTED. \n4.
