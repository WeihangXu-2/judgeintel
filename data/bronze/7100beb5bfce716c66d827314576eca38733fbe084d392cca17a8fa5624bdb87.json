Stat. § 1A -1, Rule 12(b)(6)  (hereinafter the General Statutes will be \nreferred to as “G.S.” and the Rules of Civil Procedure will be referred to as \n“Rule(s)”), but only recites those facts included in the complaint that are relevant to \nthe Court’s determination of the Motion.   See, e.g., Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs \nGrp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).1 \nA. Summary of Dispute \n2. In this case, Plaintiff Thomas Accardi 2 (“Accardi”) challenges the \nmethod by which Hartford calculates the “actual cash value”  (“ACV”) for property \ndamage claims under Hartford homeowners’ insurance policies.  Hartford calculates \nACV by determining the current cost of repair or replacement of the damaged \nproperty, depreciating the repair or replacement cost by a n amount based on the \nage and condition of the property immediately prior to the damaging event , and  \nsubtracting from that amount the insured’s deductible. \n3. Accardi claims “Hartford routinely understates [ACV] by depreciating \nthe labor component of repair costs instead of only the physical item that is subject \n                                                 \n1 The facts recited herein are drawn exclusively from the Complaint (ECF No. 3) and the \nPlaintiff’s insurance policy.  (ECF No. 8.2.) \n \n2 Accardi purports to bring his claim on behalf of an as -yet unidentified class of similarly \nsituated individuals insured by Hartford who allegedly were underpaid on their claims \nbecause labor costs were depreciated from their benefit payments.   (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 2–3.)  \nAccardi has not yet moved for class certification, an d, as a result, the  class-based \nallegations are not properly before the Court at this time. The Court addresses only \nAccardi’s individual allegations for breach of contract.   \n \n \n \nto wear, tear, and obsolescence. ”  (Compl., ECF No. 3, at ¶ 1.)  Accardi argues that \nHartford should not depreciate the labor cost s because “labor does n ot depreciate \nover time.”   (Id. at ¶ 26.)  Accardi characterizes this dispute as a “single legal \nquestion, common to all members of the class . . . [c]an an insurer obligated to \nreimburse [ACV] under materially identical policy language refuse to pay amoun ts \nit attributes to the depreciation of labor?”  (Id. at ¶ 2.) \n4. Hartford contends that ACV, as commonly used and as used in \nHartford policies, has a plain meaning that includes depreciation of both the labor \nand material components of the current repair or replacement cost .  Hartford \nargues that this definition is consistent with the purpose  of indemnity insurance , \nwhich is designed to restore the insured to the pre -damage position.  Hartford \nfurther argues that depreciating both material and labor is consistent with North \nCarolina law, and that there are no North Carolina cases that support Accardi’s \ncontention that labor costs should be excluded from depreciation. \nB. The Policy and Accardi’s Claim \n5. Accardi owns a home in Fuquay Varina, North Carolina (the “Home”).  \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶ 11.)  At all times relevant to the Motion, the Home was insured \nunder a  homeowners insurance policy provided by Hartford (“The Policy”) .  (Ins. \nPol’y, ECF No. 8.2.)  The Home was damaged in a hail storm on or about September \n1, 2017.  ( ECF No. 3, at ¶ 11 .)  “The roof, siding and garage of the Home were \ndamaged in the storm and required repair and restoration.”  (Id.)   \n \n \n6. The Policy is a hybrid ACV/replacement cost policy.3  Under The \nPolicy, when an insured property suffers covered damage, Hartford is required to \npay Accardi the ACV for the damaged property.  The ACV is calculated by finding \nthe total current repair or replacement cost for the damaged property, reducing that \ntotal cost for depreciation, and then reducing that amount by Accardi’s deductible .  \n(ECF No. 8.2, at p. 15.)  Hartford pays Accardi this amount as the ACV.  If Accardi \nchooses to have the repairs performed, and the repairs cost more than the amount \ninitially paid as the ACV, then Hartford will reimburse Accardi for the amount he \nactually incurred for the repair or replacement up to the amount that was initially \ndepreciated when arriving at the ACV.  (Id. at pp. 32–33, 46.)  If Accardi chooses not \nto make the repairs, Hartford does not reimburse him for depreciation.   \n7. The Policy exempts wind and hail damage to the roof from this \nrecovery scheme, and Accardi is  not entitled to reimbursement for depreciation for \nthese types of damages to his roof  regardless of whether he undertakes expense to \nrepair or replace the roof.  (Id. at p. 15.) \n8. After the Home was damaged and his claim was accepted by Hartford, \nHartford sent an inspector out to Accardi’s  property to evaluate the claim.  \nHartford’s inspector estimated that the  total repair or replacement cost for the \ndamage to Accardi’s house, including damage to his roof,  was $10,287.28.  (ECF No. \n                                                 \n3 “Traditionally, insurers have provided two different types of property insurance for \nhomeowners.  One is the ACV policy, and the other is a replacement cost policy. . . .   The \nmost prominent form of homeowner’s coverage is currently a hybrid between the two  types \nof policies.  Coverage is first provided on an ACV basis until the repairs are completed.  \nThen, a supplemental payment is made so the total cost of the repair or replacement is \npaid, less the deductible.”  Jessica Peterman, Actual Cash Value and De preciation of Labor \non Homeowner’s Policies, 82 No. L. Rev. 551, 556 (2017). \n \n \n3, at ¶ 17; Ex. A, at p. 5.)  The estimated repair cost included both labor and \nmaterials.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 17. )  Hartford then applied depreciation of $3,043.92 to \nreduce the estimated cost to $7,243.36.  (Id. at ¶ 23.)   The amount calculated for \ndepreciation included depreciation for labor, materials, and sales taxes on \nmaterials.4  Finally, Hartford subtracted the $500 deductible applicable under The \nPolicy, arriving at a total ACV payment of $6,743.36.  (Id.)  Accardi does not allege \nthat he made the repairs to the Home or that he sought reimbursement of any \ndepreciation. \n9. Accardi does not argue that Hartford should not have reduced the ACV \nfor depreciation, only that Hartford  cannot include in the depreciation an amount \nattributable to  labor.  Accardi alleges that depreciation of labor costs when \ncalculating ACV is a breach of Defendant’s obligations under The Policy because \n“labor does not depreciate in value over time” and, therefore  cannot be a component \nof depreciation.  (Id. at ¶¶ 26, 29–30.)     \n10. The term ACV appears several times in The Policy, but ACV is not \ndefined in the definitions section .  (ECF No. 8.2, at pp. 1 9–20.)  However, a n \naddendum to The Policy entitled “Important Information About Your Roof \nCoverage” states: \nYou will not e your policy  includes Actual Cash Value \n(ACV) Loss Settlement for covered windstorm or hail \nlosses to your Roof.  This means if there is a covered \nwindstorm or hail loss to your roof, [Hartford] will \ndeduct depreciation from the cost to repair or \nreplace the damaged roof .  In other words, [Hartford] \n                                                 \n4 Accardi does not challenge the amount depreciated for taxes in this lawsuit. \n \n \nwill reimburse for the [ACV] of the damaged roof \nsurfacing less any applicable policy deductible. \n \n(Id. at p. 15 (emphasis added).)   The Policy does not expressly define the term \n“depreciation.” \n11. The Complaint alleges a single claim for breach of contract (ECF No. 3, \nat ¶¶ 48–54).  Hartford filed the Motion on April 27, 2018.  (ECF No. 8.)  Hartford \nalso filed an accompanying Brief in Support of its Motion.  (ECF No. 9.)  On May 25, \n2018, Accardi filed his Brief in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss.  (ECF \nNo. 19.)  On June 18, 2018, Hartford filed a Reply.  (ECF No. 24.)  The Court held a \nhearing on the Motion on July 26, 2018.  The Motion is now ripe for disposition.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n12. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \ntrue are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some \nlegal theory, whether properly labeled or not.”   Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 N.C. \nApp. 669, 6 70, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).  Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports \nplaintiff’s claim; (2) when the complaint reveals on its face the absence of fact \nsufficient to make a go od claim; [or] (3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint \nnecessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 \nS.E.2d 222, 224 (1985).  The Court construes the complaint liberally and accepts all \nallegations as true.  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 \n(2009).  However, the Court is not required “to accept as true allegations that are \n \n \nmerely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  \nGood Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C . Dep’t of Health & Human Servs. , 174 N.C. App. 266, \n274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005).   In addition, t he Court may consider documents \nwhich are the subject of plaintiff’s complaint and to which the complaint specifically \nrefers, including the contract that forms the subject matter of the action.  Oberlin \nCapital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60, 554 S.E.2d 840, 847 (2001). \n13. Accardi’s only claim is for breach of contract.  “The elements of a claim \nfor breach of contract are (1) existence of a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms \nof [the] contract.”  McLamb v. T.P. Inc., 173 N.C. App. 586, 588, 619 S.E.2d 577, 580 \n(2005).  “An insurance policy is a contract between the parties, and the intention of \nthe parties is the controlling guide in its inter pretation.”  Rouse v. Williams Realty \nBldg. Co., 143 N.C. App. 67, 69, 544 S.E.2d 609, 612 (2001) (citation omitted). \nUnder North Carolina law the construction and \napplication of the policy provisions to the undisputed facts \nis a question of law for the co urt.  Where the policy \nlanguage is c lear and unambiguous, the court’ s only duty \nis to determine the legal effect of the language used and \nto enforce the agreement as written.   Furthermore, in the \nabsence of an ambiguity, the language used must be given \nits plain, ordinary, and accepted meaning.   No ambiguity \nexists in a contract unless the court finds that the \nlanguage of the parties is fairly and reasonably \nsusceptible to either of the constructions for which the \nparties contend. If the court determines th at the contract \nis not ambiguous, the court must enforce the contract as it \nwas written and may not remake the contract under the \nguise of interpreting the ambiguous provisions. \n \nCone Mills Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 114 N.C. App. 684, 686–87, 443 S.E.2d 357, 359 \n(1994) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  Nevertheless, \n \n \nit is fundamental that that which is plainly or necessarily \nimplied in the language of a contract is as much a part of \nit as that which is expressed.  If it can be p lainly seen \nfrom all the provisions of the instrument taken together \nthat the obligation in question was within the \ncontemplation of the parties when making their contract \nor is necessary to carry their intention into effect, the law \nwill imply the obligation and enforce it.  \n. . . \nHowever, no meaning, terms, or conditions can be implied \nwhich are inconsistent with the expressed provisions. \n \nLane v. Scarborough, 284 N.C. 407, 410–11, 200 S.E.2d 622, 624–25 (1973) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted); see also Shelton v. Duke Univ. Health Sys., \n179 N.C. App. 120, 124, 633 S.E.2d 113, 116 (2006) (quoting Lane).   \nIII. ANALYSIS \n14. The issue for determination by  the Court is an extremely narrow one.   \nAccardi concedes that The Policy is a valid contr act, and that The Policy provides \nfor payment of the ACV  to Accardi under the facts of this case.  Accardi also \nconcedes that ACV is properly arrived at by depreciating the total repair or \nreplacement cost by some amount.  Accardi’s sole argument is that the cost of labor \ncannot be depreciated in determining ACV.  Therefore, the question before the \nCourt is whether the terms of The Policy are unambiguous in providing that \ndepreciation for labor can be included in calculating the ACV. \n15. In support of thei r respective positions, the Parties make lengthy \nacademic arguments.  Accardi relies primarily on scholarly writings, treatises, and \nother non -case law sources that state labor, unlike physical property,  cannot \nphysically deteriorate over tim e and, therefo re, should not be depreciated.   (ECF \n \n \nNo. 19, at pp. 5 –7.)  Hartford counters with its own law review article  and treatises \nsupporting its view that depreciation necessarily includes depreciation for labor \ncosts.   (ECF No. 9, at pp. 9, 12; ECF No. 24, at pp. 5, 8.)  The Court does not find \nthese scholarly and other writings to be dispositive of the issue. \n16. Both Parties also cite to a raft of court decisions from other \njurisdictions purportedly supporting their arguments.  (ECF No. 9, at p p. 17 –20; \nECF No. 19, at pp. 8 –12.)  Many of the cases are fact intensive, involve policy \nlanguage different from The Policy, arise in jurisdictions with instructive statutory \nor regulatory guidance on the meaning of ACV, or arise in jurisdiction s with no \nprior case law interpreting the term ACV.  (Id.)  Nevertheless, on balance, the Court \nfinds the reasoning of the court s in the decisions cited by Hartford to be more \npersuasive.  See, e.g., In re State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 872 F.3d 567 (8th Cir. 2017); \nPapurello v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 144 F. Supp. 3d 746 (W.D. Pa. 2015). \n17. Finally, both sides argue that only their interpretation truly serves the \nprinciples of indemnity underlying insurance coverage .  Accardi argues that true \nindemnification requires Hartford to pay Accardi the estimated depreciated cost for \n“used materials” plus the total current cost of the labor needed to “install [the \nhypothetical used] materials at no cost to” Accardi.   (ECF No. 19, at p. 17 .)  \nHartford argues that in North Carolina, indemnity requires Hartford to pay the \nhomeowner an ACV equal to the fair market value o f the damaged propert y \nimmediately prior to the loss, and that i n most cases paying the homeowner for the \ndepreciated cost of the materials but the full curre nt labor costs of repair will result \n \n \nin the homeowner receiving more than fair market value and constitutes a \n“windfall” to the insured.  (ECF No. 9, at pp. 11 –15.)  Although both of these \narguments have some appeal, the Court concludes, as discussed furth er below, that \ndetermining ACV by deducting for the depreciation of labor costs is more consistent \nwith the principles of indemnity. \n18. The Cour t has thoroughly considered  the Parties’ arguments and \nconcludes, on the facts of this case and based on the underlying law of North \nCarolina, that the term ACV as used in The Policy  is not “reasonably susceptible to \nmore than one interpretation,” and that the term ACV unambiguously includes \ndepreciation for labor costs.   See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Chatterton , 135 N.C. App. \n92, 94, 518 S.E.2d 814, 816 (1999) ;  Cone Mills Corp.  v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 114 N.C. \nApp. 685, 687, 443 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1994) (“No ambiguity exists in a contract unless \nthe court finds that the language of the parties is fairly and reasonably susceptible \nto either of the constructions for which the parties contend.”). \n19. First, although ACV is not contained in the definitions section, The \nPolicy contains a definition of ACV.  The roof coverage addendum states that  ACV \nwill be calculated by deducting depreciation “from the cost to repair or replace.”  \n(ECF No. 8.2, at p. 15.)  In addition, The Policy provides for “replacement cost at the \ntime of loss without deduction for depreciation” for limited types of pe rsonal \nproperty and contrasts replacement cost  with ACV coverage applicable  to the \nproperty under certain circumstances.   (Id. at pp. 44 –45.)   When an insuranc e \npolicy  \n \n \ncontains a definition of a term used in it, this is the \nmeaning which must be given to that term wherever it \nappears in the policy, unless the context clearly requires \notherwise. . . . In determining the meaning of a term, \nresort may be had to ot her portions of the policy and all \nclauses of it are to be construed, if possible, so  as to bring \nthem into harmony.  \nRouse, 143 N.C. App. at 70, 544 S.E.2d at 612 (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted).   The definition of ACV in the roof coverage addendum should be \nread in harmony with the use of that term elsewhere in The Policy.   Finally, while \ncontending that the lack of a definition of ACV in the Policy is somehow significant, \nAccardi concedes that deducting some amount from the cost to repai r or replace for \ndepreciation is an appropriate definition of ACV.  Therefore, the Court concludes \nthat the term ACV in The Policy is unambiguous and that calculation of ACV \nincludes a deduction for depreciation. \n20. The Court further finds that the term “ depreciation” as used in \ndetermining ACV is not  ambiguous.  The Policy does not distinguish between \ndepreciation for labor costs and materials  costs and require that they be treated \ndifferently.  See Riggins v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. , 281 F. Supp. 3d 785, 788–89  \n(W.D. Missouri 2017)  (holding that depreciation as used in homeowner’s policy \nincluded depreciation of labor costs, in part, based on fact that “ nothing in \nPlaintiff's policy language limits or excludes labor from the depreci ation \ncalculation”).  Accardi’s argument for a definition of depreciation that excludes labor \ncosts would require the Court to read into Th e Policy a nonexistent provision  \nexcluding labor costs from depreciation .   The Court cannot rewrite The Policy in \nthis way.  Woods v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. , 295 N.C. 500, 506, 246 S.E.2d 773, \n \n \n777 (1978) ( “[I]f the meaning of the policy is clear and only one reasonable \ninterpretation exists, the courts must enforce the contract as written; they may not, \nunder the guis e of construing an ambiguous term, rewrite the contract or impose \nliabilities on the parties not bargained for and found therein.”).  \n21. The language in The Policy  also must be interpreted in light of North \nCarolina appellate case law .  The North Carolina Court of Appeals has held that \n“[t]he term ‘actual cash value’ means the fair or reasonable cash price for which the \nproperty could be sold in the market in the ordinary course of business, and not at \nforced sale, or what property is wor th in money, allowing for depreciation.”  Surrat \nv. Grain Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. , 74 N.C. App. 288, 293, 328 S.E.2d 16 , 20  (1985) \n(emphasis added).   In Surratt, the Court also held that ACV is “synonymous” with \nfair market value.   Id.  While Surrat does no t directly address the question of \ndepreciating labor costs in determining ACV, t here are no reported North Carolina \ncases that have held or even suggest that the term depreciation does not include all \ndepreciation, including depreciation of labor costs.  \n22. Finally, the Court concludes that the only reasonable interpretation of \ndepreciation as it is applied in determining ACV in The Policy must include \ndepreciation for labor costs.   Accardi concedes that depreciation should be \ninterpreted to mean “the dec rease in home or property value since the time it was \nbuilt or purchased due to age or wear.”   (ECF No. 3, ¶ 22; emphasis added.)  The \nvalue of a house, or a component part of a house such as a roof, garage or the siding, \nis more than simply the costs of t he materials used; the value necessarily includes \n \n \nthe cost of the labor used to assemble and finish the materials.  Papurello v. State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co. , 144 F. Supp. 3d 746, 770 (W.D. Pa. 2015)  (holding that the \nvalue of covered property under the insu rance policy necessarily includes the labor \ncosts involved in assembling property).  In this Court’s view, it does not make \nlogical sense to separate the cost of labor from that of physical materials when \nevaluating the depreciation of a house or its component parts.  The labor costs must \nbe considered in determining the current value.  As appropriately summarized by \nDefendant: \nAccardi’s policy does not insure against damage to \nmaterial or labor costs; it insures against damage to \n“property.” Pr operty, like Accardi’s roof or flashing or \npaint, is the product of both material inputs and labor \ninputs. Its value is the product of those inputs. But when \nthe property ages, its physical condition declines, \nreducing its present value. This present value  can be \nestimated by calculating the cost (both in material and \nlabor) to replace the property today, but for older \nproperty, this estimate only works if the entire \nreplacement costs are depreciated. These present -day \ncosts are depreciated so that the tota l replacement cost \ntoday can be used as a measure of the property’s current \nvalue. \n \n(ECF No. 9, at p. 13.) \n \n23. Accardi proposes that ACV is properly calculated by depreciating from \npresent cost of repair or replacement  of the property for wear and tear to materials, \nbut not depreciating for the cost of the labor to assemble or install those materials, \nand reimbursing the homeowner for the full current cost of the labor that would be \nneeded to make the repairs.  (ECF No. 19, at pp. 16–18.)  This proposed definition of \nACV gives the insured substantial benefits of a replacement cost policy, without \n \n \nrequiring the homeowner to make the actual repairs.  The Policy allows Accardi to \nrecover some of the labor costs that were depreciated in arriving at the ACV for \ncertain types of covered losses if Accardi actually makes the repair and the cost of \nrepair exceeds the ACV payment.   \n24. Accardi’s insistence that ACV should include an up -front award of full \nlabor costs of repair is illogical.  Accardi did not purchase a replacement cost \ninsurance policy; he purchased a hybrid ACV/replacement cost policy .  A policy that \npaid full repair or replacem ent cost for all losses would undoubtedly cost Accardi \nsubstantially more in premium payments because of increased risk exposure placed \non Hartford.  To allow Accardi to purchase, pay lower premiums for, and make \nclaims under a hybrid  insurance policy, yet  receive reimbursements like someone \nwho chose a replacement cost policy, would allow  Accardi to receive a windfall.   \nGilbert v. N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Cos., 155 N.C. App. 400, 404, 574 S.E.2d 115, \n118 (2002) (interpreting similar insurance policy provision permitting the insurer to \npay the homeowner the ACV, and not the full repair and replacement cost unless \nand until the insured made actual repairs, and holding that an interpretation of the \ncontract allowing f or payment of repair or replacement cost regardless of whether \nrepairs were actually made would “allow plaintiffs to reap a windfall  profit from a \nloss”). \n25. The Court concludes that the term ACV as used in The Policy  is not \nreasonably susceptible to the interpretation proposed b y Accardi, and is \nunambiguous.  The Court  further concludes that Hartford did not breach the terms \n \n \nof The Policy when it depreciated both material and labor costs in the calculation of \nthe ACV of Plaintiff’s claim.  Accardi’s claim  for breach  of contract should be  \ndismissed. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n26. Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract is \nGRANTED, and Plaintiff’s claim is DISMISSED, WITH PREJUDICE. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of October, 2018. \n \n        /s/ Gregory P.
