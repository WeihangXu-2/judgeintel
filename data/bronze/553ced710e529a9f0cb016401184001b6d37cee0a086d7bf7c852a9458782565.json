Butler.\n \n \nI.\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n \n{3}\n             \nThese two shareholder derivative actions were filed in Orange County Superior Court.\n  \nThe cases\nwere designated complex business cases and assigned to the undersigned Special Superior Court Judge for\nComplex Business Cases by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated\nDecember 14, 2004.\n  \nThe two cases were consolidated with consent of all parties on April 25, 2005.\n \nPlaintiffs’ Consolidated Shareholder Derivative Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) was filed on March\n31, 2005.\n{4}\n             \nSeveral related class actions have been filed in the Middle District of North Carolina against\nPozen\n, Inc. and Dr. John R. \nPlachetka\n, its Chief Executive Officer, alleging violations of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\n  \nThose actions remain pending.\n  \nSee In re \nPozen\n Sec. \nLitig\n., 386 F. Supp. 2d 641\n(M.D.N.C. 2005) (denying defendants’ motion to dismiss).\nII.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA.\nTHE PARTIES\n{5}\n             \nPlaintiff Philip Stein is, and at all relevant times has been, a common stock shareholder of \nPozen\n.\n \nPlaintiff Michael \nRosenstock\n is, and at all relevant times has been, a common stock shareholder of \nPozen\n.\n{6}\n             \nNominal Defendant \nPozen\n is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of\nDelaware\n, with its headquarters located in Chapel Hill, \nOrange \nCounty\n, \nNorth Carolina\n.\n  \nPozen\n is a\npharmaceutical company which has specialized in the development of a portfolio of drugs for the global\nmigraine market.\n{7}\n             \nDefendant John R. \nPlachetka\n (“\nPlachetka\n”) is, and at all relevant times has been, President and\nChief Executive Officer of \nPozen\n.\n  \nPlatchetka\n is a member of the Board of Directors of \nPozen\n.\n  \nPlatchetka\nhas served as Chairman of the Board of Directors since January 2001.\n{8}\n             \nDefendant Kristina M. \nAdomonis\n (“\nAdomonis\n”) is, and at all relevant times has been, Senior Vice\nPresident, Business Development of \nPozen\n.\n{9}\n             \nDefendant John E. \nBarnhardt\n (“\nBarnhardt\n”) is, and at all relevant times has been, Vice President,\nFinance and Administration of \nPozen\n.\n  \nBarnhardt\n was the Interim Chief Financial Officer of \nPozen\n from\nJanuary 2004 until August 2004.\n \n{10}\n         \nDefendant Matthew E. \nCzajkowski\n (“\nCzajkowski\n”) was the Chief Financial Officer and Senior\nVice President, Finance and Administration of \nPozen\n at all relevant times until January 2004.\n{11}\n         \nDefendant Andrew L. Finn (“Finn”) was the Executive Vice President, Product and Development\nof \nPozen\n at all relevant times until March 27, 2003.\n{12}\n         \nDefendant Peter J. Wise (“Wise”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of the Board of\nDirectors of \nPozen\n.\n  \nWise has served as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors since January 2001.\n \n{13}\n         \nDefendant Bruce A. \nTomason\n (“\nTomason\n”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of the\nBoard of Directors of \nPozen\n.\n{14}\n         \nDefendant Ted G. Wood (“Wood”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of the Board\nof Directors of \nPozen\n.\n{15}\n         \nDefendant Paul J. Rizzo (“Rizzo”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of the Board of\nDirectors of \nPozen\n.\n{16}\n         \nDefendant Kenneth B. Lee (“Lee”) is, and at all relevant times since December 2002 has been, a\nmember of the Board of Directors of \nPozen\n.\n{17}\n         \nDefendant James R. Butler (“\nButler\n”) is, and at all relevant times since July 2003 has been, a\nmember of the Board of Directors of \nPozen\n.\n{18}\n         \nDefendant Jacques F. \nRejeange\n (“\nRejeange\n”) is, and at all relevant times since January 2004 has\nbeen, a member of the Board of Directors of \nPozen\n.\n{19}\n         \nThe \nPozen\n Board of Directors thus consisted of one insider—\nPlachetka\n—and seven outside\ndirectors—Wise, Finn, Thomason, Wood, Rizzo, Lee, \nButler\n, and \nRejeange\n.\n  \nNone of the outside directors\nare accused of insider trading nor are any false or misleading statements directly attributed to them.\nB.\nOVERVIEW OF THE FACTS\n{20}\n         \nPlaintiffs allege the following facts which, for the purposes of this motion to dismiss, will be\ntreated as true.\n  \nGenerally stated, plaintiffs complain of insider trading on the part of several of \nPozen’s\nofficers and of statements made by \nPlachetka\n which misled the investment community as to what clinical\nstudies revealed about the safety and efficacy of two drugs being developed by \nPozen\n and their chances of\ngaining FDA approval.\n{21}\n         \nDuring the period throughout which the alleged wrongdoing occurred, \nPozen’s\n lead products were\nMT 100 and MT 300.\n  \nMT 100 \nwas a “\nproprietary formulation containing \nmetoclopramide\n hydrochloride\nand naproxen sodium” which was designed “to enhance the effectiveness and duration of migraine\nsymptom relief provided by both drugs, with fewer adverse side effects than other migraine therapies.”\n \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 4-5.)\n   \nMT 300, a “pre-filled syringe containing\ndihydroergotamine\n \nmesylate\n, or DHE,” was designed “to provide long-lasting pain relief for patients via a\nconvenient \ninjectable\n therapy for severe migraine attacks.”\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 4 &\n6.)\n{22}\n         \nPozen\n submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(“FDA”) for MT 300 in December 2002.\n  \nIn July 2003, \nPozen\n submitted an NDA for MT 100, which was\ncompleted in January 2004.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 6-7.)\n{23}\n         \nThe \nNDAs\n for both MT 100 and MT 300 were ultimately rejected by the FDA, and the rejection\nletters were disclosed to the public on June 1, 2004, and October 20, 2003, respectively, resulting in\nsignificant losses to the value of \nPozen\n stock.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 10-11.)\n{24}\n         \nPlaintiffs allege that, prior to the rejections, defendants “artificially inflated the prices of \nPozen\nsecurities by concealing critical material information regarding the details of both the safety and efficacy\nof MT 100 and MT 300.”\n  \nMore specifically, they claim that “[d]\nefendants\n concealed key adverse\ninformation regarding known adverse effects and safety issues, as well as the design, execution and\ninterpretation of studies necessary to satisfactorily assess safety and efficacy.”\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\nDerivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 9.)\n{25}\n         \nAs a result of the concealment, plaintiffs allege \nPozen\n securities traded at artificially inflated\nprices which ultimately caused millions of dollars in damage to the company.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\nDerivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 13.)\nC.\nINSIDER TRADING\n{26}\n         \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint focuses primarily on alleged insider trading by several of \nPozen’s\nofficers, only one of whom, \nPlachetka\n, is a member of the Board of Directors.\n  \nSpecifically, four of\nPozen’s\n officers—Plachetka, \nAdomonis\n, \nBarnhardt\n, and \nCzajkowski\n—are alleged to have sold shares of\nPozen\n stock while in possession of undisclosed material adverse information.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\nDerivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 17-20, 153, 159-63.)\n \n{27}\n         \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant \nPlachetka\n was granted 668,750 options to purchase \nPozen\n stock\nduring the relevant period and that he sold 250,000 shares for proceeds of $4,250,000.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\nDerivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 17.)\n  \nPlaintiffs give no indication of what percentage of \nPlachetka’s\n total ownership\nof \nPozen\n stock the 250,000 shares constituted.\n  \nThe Amended Complaint does not specifically state what\nadverse non-public information \nPlachetka\n possessed at the time of sale.\n  \nPlaintiffs simply claim that\n“[b]\necause\n of his position” in the company—as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the\nBoard of Directors—\nPlachetka\n:\nknew of adverse non-public information about the business of \nPozen\n, as well as finances,\nmarkets and present and future business prospects, via access to internal corporate\ndocuments, conversations and connections with other corporate officers and employees,\nattendance at management and Board of Directors meetings and committees thereof and via\nreports and other information provided to him in connection therewith.\n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 17.)\n           \n{28}\n         \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant \nAdomonis\n was granted 131,250 options to purchase \nPozen\n stock\nduring the relevant period and that she sold 69,925 shares for proceeds of $947,162.\n  \n(Consol. Derivative\nCompl\n. ¶ 18.)\n  \nPlaintiffs give no indication of what percentage of \nAdomonis\n’ total ownership of \nPozen\nstock the 69,925 shares constituted.\n  \nThe Amended Complaint does not specifically state what adverse\nnon-public information \nAdomonis\n possessed at the time of sale.\n  \nPlaintiffs simply claim that “[b]\necause\n of\nher position” in the company, \nAdomonis\n:\nknew\n the adverse non-public information about the business of \nPozen\n, as well as finances,\nmarkets and present and future business prospects, via access to internal corporate\ndocuments, conversations and connections with other corporate officers and employees,\nattendance at management meetings and via reports and other information provided to her\nin connection therewith.\n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 18.)\n      \n{29}\n         \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant \nBarnhardt\n was granted 92,450 options to purchase \nPozen\n stock\nduring the relevant period and that he sold 77,148 shares for proceeds of $1,109,134.\n  \n(Consol. Derivative\nCompl\n. ¶ 19.)\n  \nPlaintiffs give no indication of what percentage of \nBarnhardt’s\n total ownership of \nPozen\nstock the 77,148 shares constituted.\n  \nPlaintiffs simply claim that “[b]\necause\n of his position” in the\ncompany, \nBarnhardt\n:\nknew\n the adverse non-public information about the business of \nPozen\n, as well as finances,\nmarkets and present and future business prospects, via access to internal corporate\ndocuments, conversations and connections with other corporate officers and employees,\nattendance at management meetings and via reports and other information provided to him\nin connection therewith.\n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 19.)\n{30}\n         \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendant \nCzajkowski\n was granted 187,500 options to purchase \nPozen\n stock\nduring the relevant period and that he sold 25,000 shares for proceeds of $425,000.\n  \n(Consol. Derivative\nCompl\n. ¶ 19.)\n  \nPlaintiffs give no indication of what percentage of \nCzajkowski’s\n total ownership of \nPozen\nstock the 25,000 shares constituted.\n  \nThe Amended Complaint does not specifically state what adverse\nnon-public information \nCzajkowski\n possessed at the time of sale.\n  \nPlaintiffs simply claim that “[b]\necause\nof his position” in the company, \nCzajkowski\n:\nknew\n of adverse non-public information about the business of \nPozen\n, as well as finances,\nmarkets and present and future business prospects, via access to internal corporate\ndocuments, conversations and connections with other corporate officers and employees,\nattendance at management meetings and via reports and other information provided to him\nin connection therewith.\n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 20.)\n{31}\n         \nPlaintiffs do not indicate what non-disclosed material information any of these directors possessed\nat the time of any of these sales.\n  \nNowhere in the Amended Complaint do plaintiffs allege the existence of\nany specific knowledge on the part of any of these defendants at the time of any specific sale; nor do\nplaintiffs point to any specific sources of such information.\n  \nThe extent of plaintiffs’ allegations of insider\ntrading is that four of \nPozen’s\n officers owned and sold stock during a three-year period and that because\nof their positions in the company they must have known some adverse non-public information at some\nunstated time during the same period.\nD.\nTHE MISSTATEMENTS\n{32}\n         \nIn addition to allegations of insider trading by \nPozen\n officers, the Amended Complaint asserts a\nfailure of the Board of Directors to properly supervise the conduct of and statements made by company\nofficers during the period between October 10, 2000, and December 2004.\n  \nWhile the Amended\nComplaint attempts to attribute the statements to individual outside directors, it fails to do so adequately.\n \nRather, all the direct quotations are from officers, specifically \nPlachetka\n.\n{33}\n         \nThe Amended Complaint recites a 45-page long string of allegedly improper statements made by\nPozen\n officers relating to the development of MT 100 and MT 300.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n.\n¶¶ 59-151.)\n{34}\n         \nPlaintiffs allege that the first of these statements occurred on October 10, 2000, when the\ncompany filed an SEC Form S-1/A in connection with its Initial Public Offering.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\nDerivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 59.)\n  \nThere, the company described the benefits of MT 100.\n  \nPlaintiffs claim that the\nform was misleading because it failed to note that an ingredient in MT 100 was “known to stimulate\nlactation and the production of breast milk.”\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nConpl\n. ¶¶ 59-61.)\n  \nPlaintiffs\nallege that the misstatements were intended to conceal concerns about a possible link between drugs\ncapable of stimulating \nprolactin\n production and breast cancer.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 62.)\n \nFurthermore, plaintiffs allege that the company misled investors by stating that it had entered into an\nagreement with the FDA “to deviate from the requirement of two successful clinical trials to demonstrate\nthat the product candidate meets with standards for approval.”\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 65.)\n{35}\n         \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, between January 26, 2001, and February 18, 2004, the\ncompany issued some 25 press releases regarding the development of MT 100 and MT 300 and its\nongoing efforts to gain FDA approval.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 59-151.)\n  \nNone of these\npress releases are alleged to have been authored by any particular person—in each instance, the Amended\nComplaint only generally states that the defendants collectively caused the company to issue them.\n \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 59-151.)\n  \nPlaintiffs allege that these press releases demonstrate a\ncontinued effort by the company to conceal concerns about the efficacy of the two drugs as well as safety\nissues, such as the possible connection to breast cancer. (Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 59-151.)\n \nThe Amended Complaint contends that these statements were designed to mislead the market and conceal\n“the fraudulent and defective nature of the NDA filings.”\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 111.)\n{36}\n         \nIn addition to press releases, the Amended Complaint includes excerpts from five conference calls\nat which Defendant \nPlachetka\n made allegedly misleading statements regarding the safety and efficacy of\nMT 100 and MT 300.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 59-151.)\n \n \nE.\nALLEGED WRONGDOING\nBY THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS\n{37}\n         \nIn addition to claims of alleged insider trading by \nPozen’s\n officers, plaintiffs contend that by\nconcealing information relating to the safety and efficacy of MT 100 and MT 300, defendants breached\ntheir fiduciary duties of good faith, fair dealing, loyalty, and due care; grossly mismanaged and abused\ntheir ability to control the corporation; wasted corporate assets; and were unjustly enriched.\n  \nFor the most\npart the only wrongful actions tied to any specific defendant relate to the alleged incidents of insider\ntrading.\n  \nIn fact, with the exception of Defendant \nPlachetka\n, plaintiffs do not allege any wrongful action on\nthe part of any specific member of \nPozen’s\n Board of Directors.\n{38}\n         \nOther than a single incident of insider trading, the extent of plaintiffs’ specific factual allegations\nas to Defendant \nPlachetka\n is that he concealed material non-public information regarding MT 100 and MT\n300 in various press releases and conference calls.\n  \nHowever, the complaint fails to identify how or when\nMr. \nPlachetka\n came to know such non-public information.\n  \nPlaintiffs merely assert that \nPlachetka\n must\nhave known this information due to his position in the company, access to corporate documents, and\nattendance at various meetings.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 17.)\n{39}\n         \nAt no point in the complaint do plaintiffs allege any specific wrongful action undertaken by the\nBoard acting as a whole.\nIII.\nMOTION TO DISMISS\n{40}\n         \nThis matter comes before the Court on the defendants’ motion to dismiss.\n  \nDefendants base their\nmotion to dismiss on two separate grounds.\n  \nFirst, defendants argue that dismissal is warranted because\nplaintiffs failed to make a pre-suit demand on \nPozen’s\n Board of Directors, as required by \nDelaware\n law,\nand have not demonstrated in the alternative that such demand should be excused.\n  \nSecond, defendants\nassert that plaintiffs’ claims are deficient as a matter of law.\n  \nThe Court concludes that plaintiffs’ claims\nshould be dismissed because no demand was made. Consequently, there is no need to reach defendants’\narguments that plaintiffs’ claims are legally deficient.\n \nA.\nTHE DEMAND REQUIREMENT\n{41}\n         \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss is based primarily on plaintiffs’ failure to make a pre-suit demand\non the corporation.\n  \nPlaintiffs argue that demand should be excused under \nDelaware\n law because such\ndemand would have been futile.\n  \nBecause \nPozen\n is a \nDelaware\n corporation, the issue of whether demand\nshould be excused here is properly governed by \nDelaware\n law.\n  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-7-47 (2004); \nKamen\nv. Kemper Fin. \nServs\n., Inc.\n, 500 \nU.S.\n 90, 95-96 (1991).\n{42}\n         \nThe derivative suit “permits an individual shareholder to bring a suit ‘to enforce a \ncorporate\n cause\nof action against officers, directors, and third parties.’”\n  \nKamen\n, \n500 \nU.S.\n at 95 (quoting \nRoss v. Bernhard\n,\n396 \nU.S.\n 531, 534 (1970)).\n   \nIn order to deter abuse, states universally require shareholders to exhaust all\nintracorporate\n remedies before taking advantage of the derivative action and show that “the corporation\nitself had refused to proceed after suitable demand.”\n  \nRoss, \n396 \nU.S.\n at 534; s\nee\n \nKamen\n, 500 \nU.S.\n at 102\nn.7 (citing D. \nDeMott\n, Shareholder Derivative Actions § 5:03, p. 23 (1987)).\n{43}\n         \nThe demand requirement is premised on the idea that the decision of whether to bring a lawsuit is\na business one that is properly in the hands of the corporation’s directors, whose role it is to manage the\nbusiness and affairs of the corporation.\n  \nAronson v. Lewis\n, 473 A.2d 805, 811 (Del. 1984).\n  \nIts purpose is\nto ensure that the derivative action remains an exception to the general rule that the appropriate party to\nbring suit is the corporation acting through its directors.\n  \nId.\n at 811-12.\n  \nTherefore, under Delaware law,\n“the right of a stockholder to bring a derivative action does not come into being until he has made a\ndemand on the corporation to institute such an action, that such a demand has been refused, or until the\nplaintiff stockholder has demonstrated that such a demand would have been futile.”\n  \nStepak\n v. Dean\n, 434\nA.2d 388, 390 (Del. Ch. 1981).\n{44}\n         \nPlaintiffs here concede that they filed suit without first making demand on \nPozen’s\n Board of\nDirectors.\n  \nThey instead argue that demand would have been futile and that therefore their failure to make\nsuch demand should be excused.\nB.\nDEMAND FUTILITY\n \n{45}\n         \nTo survive a motion to dismiss in a case where demand is not first made on the corporation, a\nplaintiff must plead facts \nwith \nparticularity\n that demonstrate\n the reasons why demand would have been\nfutile.\n  \nAronson\n, 473 A.2d at 815; \nBrehm\n v. Eisner\n, 746 A.2d 244, 254 (Del. 2000).\n  \nThe “pleadings must\ncomply with stringent requirements of factual particularity that differ substantially from [traditional\npleading requirements.\n  \nThe demand requirement] is not satisfied by \nconclusory\n statements or mere notice\npleading. . . .

Perot\n, 539 A.2d 180, 188 (Del.\n1988).\n{53}\n         \nMost of plaintiffs’ grounds for excusal assert a financial interest on the part of one or more of\nPozen’s\n directors.\n  \nA director is financially interested where “he or she will receive a personal financial\nbenefit from a transaction that is not equally shared by the stockholders.”\n  \nRales\n, 634 A.2d at 936 (citing\nAronson\n, 473 A.2d at 812; \nPogostin\n, 480 A.2d at 624).\n  \nA director is also deemed interested where a\ndecision of the board “will have a materially detrimental impact on a director, but not on the corporation\nand the stockholders.”\n  \nRales\n, \n634 A.2d at 936\n.\n  \nAll of this boils down to a question of whether the\ndecision to bring suit would have material consequences for the director himself that differ from those that\nwould fall on the corporation.\n  \nFor his failure to make demand to be excused, a plaintiff must demonstrate\nthat a majority of the directors have a direct and material interest in the transaction or the conduct alleged.\n \nOrman\n v. Cullman\n, 794 A.2d 5, 23 (Del. Ch. 2002).\n{54}\n         \nAt the time the original Complaint was filed, \nPozen’s\n Board was composed of eight directors:\n \nJohn R. \nPlachetka\n, Peter J. Wise, Bruce A. \nTomason\n, Ted G. Wood, Paul J. Rizzo, Kenneth B. Lee, Jr.,\nJames R. Butler, and Jacques F. \nRejeange\n.\n  \nSeven of the eight directors whose independence is challenged\nare outsiders.\n  \nFor purposes of this opinion, the Court considers Mr. \nPlachetka\n to be an interested director\nand focuses on the seven outside directors.\n  \nThe plaintiffs argue in their complaint that one or more of\nthese outside directors is financially interested for the following reasons:\n1.\n         \nDefendant \nPlachetka\n himself engaged in alleged illegal insider trading while in possession\nof material, non-public information (Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶\n157(\na));\n2.\n         \nFour of the directors, Defendants \nTomason\n, Wood, Lee, and Rizzo, were members of the\nBoard’s Audit Committee, which recommended that the Board include improperly audited\nconsolidated financial statements in various filings with the SEC (Consol. \nS’holder\nDerivative \nCompl\n. ¶157(d));\n3.\n         \nThe entire Board participated in, approved, or permitted the wrongs alleged;

and\n6.\n         \nThe company’s liability insurance policy does not cover suits brought by the company\nagainst the directors directly.\n  \nTherefore, if the directors were to authorize suit, they would\nopen themselves up to uninsured liability.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 157(q).)\nThese arguments are considered in turn.\n{55}\n         \nFirst, plaintiffs base their charge of directorial interest on incidents of alleged illegal insider\ntrading by Defendant \nPlachetka\n.\n  \nAs noted above, for the purposes of this opinion, Mr. \nPlachetka\n is\nconsidered interested.\n  \nAs the insider trading argument only applies to \nPlachetka\n, the Court need not\naddress this ground for demand excusal.\n[1]\n{56}\n         \nSecond, plaintiffs allege that four of the eight defendants were interested in light of their position\non the Board’s Audit Committee.\n  \nThe primary thrust behind the strict demand excusal test set forth in\nRales\n and \nAronson\n is a pointed rejection of the idea that directors are biased per se merely on account of\ntheir position in a company’s corporate governance structure.\n  \nSee Aronson\n, 473 A.2d \nat 815 n.8\n.\n  \nAny\nassertion that a director is interested on account of his status within the corporation’s corporate structure\nmust be supported by particularized facts which would allow the court to conclude that that particular\nboard is structurally biased.\n  \nId\n.\n{57}\n         \nHere, plaintiffs complain of self-interest on the part of the four members of the Audit Committee.\n \nPlaintiffs point to the fact that the committee “is responsible for oversight of the financial reporting\nprocess and system of internal control over financial reporting, and selects and oversees the performance\nof, and approves in advance the services provided by, \nPozen’s\n independent public accountants.”\n  \n(Consol.\nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 157(d).)\n  \nHowever, the plaintiffs fail to tie these duties, or any failure to\nuphold them, to any of the misconduct which is the basis of plaintiffs’ complaint.\n{58}\n         \nThe crux of the plaintiffs’ complaint is that the company misinformed its shareholders as to the\nsafety and efficacy of MT 100 and MT 300.\n[2]\n  \nPlaintiffs do not complain of any misconduct relating to\nthe supervision of any of \nPozen’s\n financial statements or internal financial controls, nor do they explain\nhow certain directors’ status as members of the Audit Committee should enable or require them to evaluate\nthe accuracy of statements regarding the safety and efficacy of MT 100 or MT 300.\n{59}\n         \nThe problem with plaintiffs’ attack on the disinterestedness of a majority of the directors here is\nthat the practical effect of the ruling they seek would make it impossible to find a disinterested and\nindependent board anywhere.\n  \nPlaintiffs would have the Court rule that the members of the Audit\nCommittee cannot be independent and disinterested simply because they were members of the Audit\nCommittee.\n  \nAudit committees of publicly traded companies are required to have independent and\ndisinterested directors comprise the committee.\n  \nIt makes no sense to require audit committees to be made\nup of independent and disinterested directors and then find them not to be independent and disinterested\nbecause they are on the audit committee.\n  \nSimilarly, it makes no sense to hold that other independent\ndirectors are not independent because their compensation or nomination is dependent on the action of\nother directors on an audit, compensation, or nominating committee—committees generally populated by\nindependent directors.\n  \nThe Amended Complaint is devoid of any specific pleading that the members of\nthe Audit Committee had any oversight of the public statements made by management to analysts.\n  \nThey\ndid not give their prior approval, nor were they present when the statements were made, and the statements\nmade by management were in the normal course of management’s responsibility.\n  \nPlaintiffs’ allegations as\nto the interestedness of these four directors on account of their membership on the Audit Committee are\nmerely \nconclusory\n and are insufficient to allow this Court to find that demand is excused here.\n{60}\n         \nThird, plaintiffs assert that the entire board lacks disinterest because as a whole it participated in,\napproved, or concealed the wrongs alleged and/or benefited directly from those wrongs.\n  \nDelaware\n courts\nhave consistently held, however, that blanket allegations that the directors participated in or approved the\nalleged misconduct are insufficient to establish interest.\n  \nSee, e.g., \nRales\n, 634 A.2d at 936;\n Kaufman v.\nBelmont\n, 479 A.2d 282, 288 (Del. Ch. 1984) (“[M]ere approval of a corporate action . . . will not\ndisqualify the director from subsequently considering a pre-suit demand to rectify the challenged\ntransaction.”); \nHaber v. Bell\n, 465 A.2d 353, 359 (Del. Ch. 1983) (“[A]llegations that the members of the\nBoard of Directors ‘approved or acquiesced in’ the actions which plaintiffs attack are . . . not sufficient to\nexcuse demand for redress before suit.”); \nDecker v. Clausen\n, 1989 Del. Ch. LEXIS 143, at *7-8 (Del. Ch.\nSept. 8, 1989) (noting that allegations that directors participated in or approved the alleged wrongs as a\nshowing of directorial interest “have been rejected consistently by [Delaware] courts”).\n{61}\n         \nClearly, the directors are not required to ensure that \na pharmaceutical company with NDA filings\npending publicly speculate\n as to all the possible problems the FDA might find in its NDA.\n  \nJust as clearly,\ndirectors who are aware that management’s public statements are false should take action.\n  \nIt is easy to\nlook back with 20-20 hindsight after an NDA is rejected and say the directors should have known that the\nNDA would be rejected and why.\n  \nInvestors in pharmaceutical companies, especially those engaged in\nresearch and development, should know that FDA approval is not easy to obtain and that there are often\nsetbacks and rejections in the application process as well as clinical failures.\n  \nOnly by going through the\nNDA process can a drug company know specifically the concerns the FDA has concerning a particular\ndrug application.\n  \nThe directors are not required to have the same level of scientific knowledge attributable\nto management; nor are directors responsible for the management of the application process.\n  \nThat job\nbelongs to management.\n  \nAbsent specific knowledge to the contrary, the board of directors of a\npharmaceutical company may rely upon management’s assessment of the safety and efficacy of the\ncompany’s products and its assessment of progress in the FDA approval process.\n  \nThe directors’\nresponsibility is to have programs in place designed to detect or discover the falsification of information\nprovided to the FDA and the public or the suppression of information which should be provided to the\nFDA by FDA guidelines.\n  \nIn that regard, the guidance provided by Chancellor Allen in \nIn\n re Caremark\nDeriv\n. \nLitig\n.\n is instructive:\n[N]o rationally designed information and reporting system will remove the possibility that\nthe corporation will violate laws or regulations, or \nthat senior officers\n or directors may\nnevertheless sometimes be misled or otherwise fail reasonably to detect acts material to the\ncorporation’s compliance with the law.\n  \nBut it is important that the board exercise a good\nfaith judgment that the corporation’s information will come to its attention in a timely\nmanner as a matter of ordinary operations, so that it may satisfy its responsibility.\n  \nThus, I\nam of the view that a director’s obligation includes a duty to attempt in good faith to assure\nthat a corporate information and reporting system, which the board concludes is adequate,\nexists, and that failure to do so under some circumstances may, in theory at least, render a\ndirector liable for losses caused by noncompliance with applicable legal standards.\n698 A.2d 959, 970 (Del. Ch. 1996).\n{62}\n         \nThe Amended Complaint does not allege any specific knowledge of wrongdoing by the directors;\nnor does it call into question the company’s corporate information and reporting system.\n  \nPlaintiffs merely\nput forth \nconclusory\n allegations that defendants participated in, approved, or benefited from the alleged\nwrongdoing.\n  \nAs such allegations have been roundly rejected by \nDelaware\n courts, this Court cannot find\ndemand excusal on that basis.\n{63}\n         \nFourth, plaintiffs raise the bootstrap argument that in order to bring suit defendants would be\nforced to sue \nthemselves\n.\n  \nSuch an argument, if accepted, would utterly obliterate the demand\nrequirement.\n  \nPerhaps no allegation of directorial interest has been more often asserted or more\nconsistently rejected in the courts of \nDelaware\n.\n  \nSee Aronson\n, 473 A.2d at 818 (stating that “a bare claim\nof this sort raises no legally cognizable issue under \nDelaware\n corporate law”); \nBrehm\n, 746 A.2d at 257, n.\n34; \nPogostin\n, 480 A.2d at 625.\n  \nThis Court rejects the argument as well.\n{64}\n         \nFifth, plaintiffs argue that demand here would have been futile because, if the directors were to\nbring suit against themselves, they would open themselves up to liability in other related litigation.\n \nSpecifically, plaintiffs argue that prosecuting suit on behalf of the company against themselves would\nopen the directors up to future civil litigation for securities laws violations and would harm them in the\nclass actions currently pending in federal district court.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 157(n) & (p).)\n \nAgain, these assertions are merely \nconclusory\n and have similarly been rejected by \nDelaware\n courts.\n  \nSee,\ne.g.,\n \nDecker\n, 1989 \nDel.\n \nCh.\n LEXIS 143, at *8 (holding that “the suggestion that demand is excused\nbecause the directors . . . are defending related litigation is without merit.”); \nsee also Allison v. Gen.\nMotors Corp.\n, 604 F. Supp. 1106, 1113 (D. Del. 1985).\n{65}\n         \nSixth, plaintiffs assert that the directors are interested because the company’s liability insurance\ndoes not cover suits brought directly by the company against the directors.\n  \nPlaintiffs argue that the\ndirector defendants have a vested interest in ensuring that the lawsuit is derivative, rather than direct, in\nnature because derivative actions, unlike direct actions, are covered under the policy.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\nDerivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 157(q).)\n{66}\n         \nThis argument has commonly been made in \nDelaware\n courts, but to no avail.\n  \nFor instance, the\nDelaware Chancery Court in \nDecker v.

The law in \nDelaware\n is well-settled on this point.”).\n  \nIn order to overcome the\npresumption of independence a plaintiff must “plead facts that would support the inference that . . . the\nnon-interested director would be more willing to risk his or her reputation” than to jeopardize his\nrelationship with the person with whom he is allegedly entangled.\n  \nBeam\n, \n845 A.2d at 1052\n.\n{78}\n         \nPlaintiffs have sought to identify three contexts in which such relationships arose here.\n  \nFirst,\nDefendants \nPlachetka\n, Wise, and \nButler\n were all at one time employed as executives at \nGlaxo\n, Inc.\n \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 157(h\n)(\ni).)\n  \nIt is unclear from the Amended Complaint, however,\nwhether they were ever there at the same time or ever worked together.\n  \nSecond, Defendant Lee and a\nPozen\n executive both held positions at Ernst & Young, LLP for some unspecified period of time prior to\nMarch 1997.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 157(h\n)(\nii).)\n  \nIt is unclear from the Amended\nComplaint, however, whether the two were ever there at the same time, worked at the same location, or\never worked together.\n  \nThird, Defendant Lee is employed as a managing partner of a venture capital fund\nwhich is one of \nPozen’s\n investors.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶ 157(h\n)(\niii).)\n  \nMr. Lee’s\naffiliation with a shareholder, however, is far more compatible with independence than a lack thereof.\n{79}\n         \nThe allegations here fall woefully short of pleading the type of relationships that would\nsufficiently call into question any of these directors’ independence under \nDelaware\n law.\n  \nPlaintiffs’ bare\nallegations of past and current business relationships fall far short of the heightened pleading required by\nBeam v. Stewart\n.\n  \nPlaintiffs do not plead any facts with particularity that would indicate how any of these\nrelationships would interfere with any director’s ability to properly consider a demand; nor do they\nprovide any indication that any one of these directors would be more willing to risk his professional\nreputation than to jeopardize the relationship described.\n  \nPlaintiffs’ cursory allegations of business and\npersonal relationships are therefore insufficient to excuse demand.\n{80}\n         \nPlaintiffs have failed to plead particularized facts sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to\nwhether a majority of \nPozen’s\n Board of Directors could have exercised its independent and disinterested\nbusiness judgment in responding to demand.\n  \nTherefore, plaintiffs’ failure to make demand on \nPozen’s\nBoard is not excused.\n{81}\n         \nFor the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted.\n[3]\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\n{82}\n         \nBased upon the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that defendants’\nmotion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims is granted and plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed with prejudice.\n[4]\n \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the ____ day of ______________, 2005.\n[1]\n   \n            \nEven on the merits, plaintiffs’ insider trading claims are tenuous at best.\n  \nUnder \nDelaware\n law, in order for a plaintiff to\nrecover on an insider trading claim\n “it must be shown that each sale by each individual defendant was entered into and completed\non the basis of, and because of, adverse material non-public information.”\n  \nStepak\n v. Ross\n, 1985 WL 21137, at *5 (Del. Ch. Sept. 5,\n1985).\nPlaintiffs have failed to plead facts sufficient to satisfy this standard.\n  \nThe Amended Complaint does not set forth a single\nparticularized allegation explaining what inside knowledge \nPlachetka\n traded on and how he came across such information.\n \nPlaintiffs simply plead that, because of \nPlachetka’s\n position as President, CEO, and director; access to corporate documents; and\nmeetings and conversations with other insiders, he “knew of adverse non-public information.”\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative\nCompl\n. ¶ 17.)\n  \nThe Amended Complaint cites only one date on which \nPlachetka\n sold shares of \nPozen\n stock and fails to tie that\nevent to any specific knowledge on the part of \nPlachetka\n.\n  \n(Consol. \nS’holder\n Derivative \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 105, 153.)\n                \nFurther, there are insufficient facts to allow a reasonable inference as to what the purpose of the sale was or whether it\nwas made on the basis of any non-public information.\n  \nWhile plaintiffs tout the size of the sale, they fail to provide any indication\nas to what the percentage of \nPlachetka’s\n total ownership of \nPozen\n stock the sale comprised.\n  \nPlaintiffs merely plead that \nPlachetka\nmade a single sale of \nPozen\n stock during the relevant period and assert a \nconclusory\n allegation that the sale was based on some\ninformation to which he would have had access given his status in the company.\n  \nThe allegations of insider trading levied against\nthree other members of \nPozen\n management, which mirror those brought against \nPlachetka\n, are equally suspect and likewise fall far\nshort of the type of pleading necessary to mount such a claim.\n \n[2]\n That complaint is the essence of the class action pending in federal court.\n \n[3]\n \n              \nIn light of the Court’s ruling on the demand requirement, it is unnecessary to reach defendants’ arguments as to the\nadequacy of plaintiffs’ claims.\n  \nEven if demand were excused, however, it is unlikely that any of plaintiffs’ claims would survive a\nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b\n)(\n6).\n  \nPlaintiffs’ claims of insider trading are suspect in that they fail to plead the amount of\nshares sold in each transaction relative to the total holdings of the alleged insider trading defendant.\n  \nMoreover, in no case do\nplaintiffs tie any of the individual trades to any specific knowledge on the part of the individual seller.\n  \nSee \nStepak\n v. Ross\n, 1985\nWL 21137, at *5 (Del. Ch. Sept. 5, 1985) (stating that for a plaintiff to recover on an insider trading claim “it must be shown that\neach sale by each individual defendant was entered into and completed on the basis of, and because of, adverse material non-public\ninformation”).\n \nPlaintiffs’ fiduciary duty, abuse of control, and gross mismanagement claims would also likely fail because they fall short\nof the strict pleading requirements necessary to overcome the presumptions of the business judgment rule.\n  \nPlaintiffs’ waste of\ncorporate assets claim would also likely be dismissed for failure to plead “an exchange so disproportionately small as to lie beyond\nthe range at which any reasonable person might be willing to trade.”\n  \nWhite v. Panic\n, 783 A.2d 543, 554 (Del. 2001).\n  \nPlaintiffs’\nunjust enrichment claims would also likely fail because the complaint does not allege (1) that amounts were paid to the defendants\nwithout justification or (2) the absence of a remedy at law, both of which are required by Delaware law.\n  \nSee Cantor Fitzgerald,\nL.P. v. Cantor\n, 724 A.2d 571, 585 (Del. Ch. 1988).\n \n[4]\n \n              \nPlaintiffs have asked the Court for leave to amend the complaint.\n  \nHowever, it is well-settled under \nDelaware\n law that,\nas a general rule, a plaintiff should not be afforded the opportunity to amend the complaint where he or she fails to properly plead\ndemand futility.\n  \nSee White\n, 783, A.2d at 555 (noting that this rule is designed to encourage plaintiffs “to investigate their claims\nbefore filing a complaint so that they have a basis at the outset to make particularized factual allegations in the complaint”).\n  \nThe\nDelaware Supreme Court has crafted a “narrow exception” to this general rule “where the Court . . . announces a new rule of law\nor clarifies pleading standards that apply to the plaintiffs [sic] cause of action.”\n  \nId.\n  \nThis Court does not seek to modify any aspect\nof \nDelaware\n law as it pertains to demand futility.\n  \nTherefore, the Amended Complaint must be dismissed \nwith prejudice\n.\n                \nThe Court notes that it was within the plaintiffs’ powers as \nPozen\n shareholders to avail themselves of information that\nmay have allowed them to plead facts with sufficient particularity to survive the defendants’ motion.\n  \nWhile not entitled to\ndiscovery in order to prove demand futility, had plaintiffs brought a motion under Section 220 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law seeking inspection of \nPozen’s\n books and records, they may have discovered facts that would have allowed them\nto raise a reasonable doubt as to the directors’ disinterest and independence.\n  \nSee\n \nDel.\n Code Ann. tit.\n \n8, § 220 (2004).\n  \nWhile\nstopping short of requiring plaintiffs to conduct an inspection of the corporation’s books and records before commencing a\nderivative action, \nDelaware\n courts have offered strong words for plaintiffs who, after failing to do so and filing inadequate\npleadings, cause “substantial cost to the parties and the judiciary.”\n  \nBeam\n. \n845 A.2d at 1057.\n  \nSee, e.g., White\n, 783 A.2d at 549-50;\nRales\n, 634 A.2d at 934 n. 10; \nBeam v. Stewart\n, 833 A.2d 961, 981 (Del. Ch. September 30, 2003) (noting that “it is troubling to\nthis Court that, notwithstanding repeated suggestions, encouragement, and downright admonitions over the years both by this\nCourt and by the Delaware Supreme Court, litigants continue to bring derivative complaints pleading demand futility on the basis\nof precious little investigation beyond perusal of the morning newspapers”).\n "
