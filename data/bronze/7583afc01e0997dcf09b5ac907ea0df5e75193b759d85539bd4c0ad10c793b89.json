On January 19, 2016, the Court held a hearing on the Motion. \nTHE COURT, having considered the Motion, Plaintiff's opposition to the Motion, the \naffidavits and evidence provided by the parties, the arguments of counsel, and other \nappropriate matters of record, FINDS and CONCLUDES as follows: \nA. Factual and Procedural Background. \n1. Plaintiff Protective Life Insurance Company (\"Protective\") is a Tennessee \ncorporation.  Plaintiff sells life insurance and other insurance products. \n2. Defendant NationsCredit Financial Servic es Corporation (\"NFS\") is a North \nCarolina corporation.  NFS is a residential mortgage lender. \n3. NationsCredit Insurance Agency, Inc. (\"NIA\") apparently is a \"captive\" \ninsurance agency of Bank of America, and fo rmerly, of Nationsbank.  NFS and NIA were at \nall times relevant to this matter subsidiaries of Equicredit Corporation of America, which is \na subsidiary of Bank of Americ a, and are \"affiliate companies.\" 1 NIA is not a residential \nmortgage lender.  NIA is not a party to this lawsuit. \n                                                 \n1 Costamanga Aff. ¶ 3; First Hickey Aff. ¶ 5. \n \n \n4. From March through May 1997, Protecti ve and NIA negotiated the Agency \nAgreement and the Administrative Accountin g Agreement (\"Administrative Agreement\"). 2  \nThe parties executed the Agency Agreement on May 1, 1997, and the Administrative \nAgreement on May 28, 1997.  The Agreements were  signed by Protective and by NIA.  NFS \nwas not expressly named as a party to either agreement, and did not sign the Agreements.  \nThe Agreements contained identical arbitration  provisions. Those provisions stated, in \npertinent part, as follows: \nAll disputes and differences made between the parties to which an amicable \nunderstanding cannot be reached are to be decided by arbitration. Punitive \ndamages against the parties shall not be awarded in, under, or as a part of any \nsuch proceeding, but punitive damages assessed against [Protective] in a civil \nproceeding brought by a third party ma y be recovered from the Agent in \narbitration if the facts establish a right of indemnification. The arbiters, who \nshall regard this Agreement from the standpoint of practical business and \nequity rather than from that of strict law, are empowered to fully interpret this \nAgreement and the obligations upon the parties created thereunder.3 \n \n5. In or around the same time that the Agreements were executed, Protective \nissued to NFS a \"Single Premium Group Policy,\" with an effective date of May 1, 1997 (\"Group \nPolicy\").\n4  NIA was not named as a party to or an insured under the Group Policy.  The Group \nPolicy defined NFS as the \"Creditor,\" required Protective to furnish NFS with certificates of \ninsurance to be delivered to each insured,  and required NFS to pay the premiums to \nProtective.5 \n6. In or around May 1997, Protective also issued to NIA a \"Single Premium Group \nNet Pay-Off Policy\" (\"Net Pay-Off Policy\"). 6  The Net Pay-Off Policy was nearly identical to \nthe Group Policy except for the maximum benefits  payable.  The effective date of coverage \n                                                 \n2 First Hickey Aff., Exs. A and B; the Agency and Administrative Agreements collectively are \nhereinafter referred to \"the Agreements\". \n3 Id. at § 19. \n4 Pl.'s Opp. to Mot. to Compel, Ex. 3. \n5 Id. \n6 Id. \n \n \nunder the Net Pay-Off Policy was May 28, 1997.7 The Net Pay-Off Policy defined NIA as the \n\"Creditor\" and required NIA to pay the premiums to Protective. \n7. There is no dispute that the purpose of the relationship created by the \nAgreements and policies was to permit NFS to offer and sell credit life and disability policies \nto borrowers to whom NFS ma de residential mortgage loans . Protective underwrote and \nprovided the policies of insurance.  In the event a borrower died or became disabled, the policy \nwould pay off the borrower's mortgage. The re lationship benefited each of the parties: \nProtective received premiums on the policie s sold by the lender, NIA received an \nadministrative fee, and NFS \"as the lender, re ceived a benefit throug h lower default rates \nand customer satisfaction.\"8 \n8. The Agreements provided that NIA was responsible for obtaining the requisite \nlicensing for individuals selling its insurance products, and that Protective would appoint \nthese individuals as its agents.  It is undispu ted that the individuals primarily appointed to \nact as Protective's agents were NFS loan officers responsible for residential mortgage loans.  \nThe agreements also provided that NIA had autho rity to deliver certificates of insurance on \nbehalf of Protective to debtors who met certain health requirements.  Finally, the agreements \nprovided that NIA would pay the premiums co llected to Protective, and that NIA would \nreceive an administrative fee for the policies it sold. \n9. NFS' loan officers sold credit life and disability insurance policies issued by \nProtective to North Carolina borrowers from May 1, 1997, to April 30, 1999. \n10. In 2002, a group of NFS' North Carolina borrowers filed a lawsuit against NFS \nfor alleged unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of the duty of good faith and fair \ndealing, and unjust enrichment related to the sale of the insurance policies written by, among \n                                                 \n7 Id. \n8 Id. Ex. 4, interrogatory nos. 49 and 51. \n \n \nothers, Protective. ( Juanita Richardson, Robert and Gloria  Gower, and Joyce M. Smith v. \nBank of America, N.A. and NationsCredit Financial Services Corporation (Durham County, \n02-CVS-2398); \"the Richardson lawsuit\").  The Richardson lawsuit subsequently was certified \nas a class action.  The trial court ultimately determined that many of the policies written by \nProtective and issued to NFS' borrowers were unlawful and in violation of public policy.  After \nthe trial court's orders were affirmed on appeal, the parties reached a settlement, with class \nmembers' claims to be paid from a settlement fund not to exceed $36,907,263.33.  The \npayment amount of each individual claim was determined according to  formulas contained \nwithin the settlement agreement, derived from the trial court's determination of the measure \nof damages.  The payment amount did not include an allowance for punitive damages, but \ndid include treble damages as allowed by the North Carolina Unfair Trade Practice Act, N.C. \nGen. Stat.  §§ 75-1.1 \net seq.  NationsCredit funded the settlement agreement in March 2009. \n11. The Agency and Administrative Agreements contained identical \nindemnification provisions which provide, in pertinent part, as follows: \n[Protective] agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the [NIA] from and against \nall damages, losses, claims, legal expenses, attorneys' fees, judgments, \nsettlement costs or demands arising out of or related in any way to the \nadministration of the policies and the administration of claims, but excluding \nliability arising out of all denials of claims and terminations of coverage to \nwhich the [NIA] or an affiliate thereof gives prior consent. Without limiting the \ngenerality of the foregoing, the indemnification of either party shall extend to \nand include punitive damages.\n9 \n \n12. In a letter dated February 16, 2005, NFS demanded that Protective indemnify \nNFS for the losses associated with its settlement of the class action lawsuit pursuant to the \nindemnification provisions in the Agency and Administrative Agreements.  Protective denied \nthat it was obligated to indemnify NFS. \n \n                                                 \n9 First Hickey Aff., Exs. A and B at §16. \n \n \n13. On March 18, 2015, NFS served a Notice of Dispute and Commencement of \nArbitration on Protective.  Protective refused to participate in the arbitration and, on April \n19, 2015, filed this declaratory judgment action.  Protective seeks declarations that (a) no \nvalid arbitration agreement exists between Pr otective and NFS, (b) \"[s]hould the court \nconclude that a valid arbitration agreement exists between [Protective and NFS] . . . that all \nclaims [NFS] seeks to assert against [Protecti ve] are barred by the applicable statute of \nlimitations,\" and (c) \"[s]hould he court conclu de that a valid arbitration agreement exists \nbetween [Protective and NFS] … that [NFS'] indemnity claims seeking treble (punitive) \ndamages are not within the scope of the arbitration agreement and thus cannot be \narbitrated.\"10 \n14. On June 29, 2015, NFS filed the Motion to Compel Arbitration pursuant to the \nFederal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. §3 and Rule 12(b)(1) of the North Carolina Rules \nof Civil Procedure.  NFS contends that it is an intended third party beneficiary of the Agency \nand Administrative Agreements and, accordingl y, is entitled to enforce the arbitration \nobligations in those agreements against Protective.   \nB. Discussion and Analysis. \ni. Arbitrability of NFS' Indemnification Claim. \n15. NFS moves to compel Protective to ar bitrate the indemnity claims under the \nAgency and Administrative Agreements on the grounds that NFS is an intended third-party \nbeneficiary of those agreements entitled to enforce the arbitration provisions. Alternatively, \nNFS contends that Protective should be e quitably estopped from denying that NFS is \nentitled to arbitrate because Protective under stood the nature of the relationship between \nNFS and NIA, the agreements were intended to  permit NFS to sell Protective's insurance \n                                                 \n10 See Compl. \n \n \nproducts to its NFS' borrowers, and Protective ma de \"millions of dollars\" from NFS' sale of \nthe insurance products. \n16. The Court's first task is to determine the law applicable to deciding the issues.  \nThe contracts provide that they will be governed by \"Title 9 of the U.S. Code [FAA], the laws \nof the State of Tennessee and the applicable regulations of the Insurance Department of the \nState of Tennessee.\"\n11  North Carolina courts enforce cont ractual choice of law provision as \nlong as the parties have a reasonable basis for their choice, and the law of the chosen state \ndoes not violate a fundamental public policy of North Carolina. Cable Tel Servs. v. Overland \nContracting, Inc., 154 N.C. App. 639, 643-44 (2002); Torres v. McClain, 140 N.C. App. 238, \n241, 535 S.E.2d 623, 625 (2000).  The parties agree that the FAA12 and Tennessee law apply \nto the determination of the Motion to Compel Arbitration.  Bailey v. Ford Motor Co. , 2015 \nN.C. App. LEXIS 1032 * 8 (N.C. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2015) (\"If the parties affirmatively chose \nthe FAA to govern an agreement to arbitrate, then the FAA will apply to that agreement.\")  \nProtective is a Tennessee corporation, so ther e exists a reasonable basis for the application \nof Tennessee law, and application of the FAA and Tennessee law do not violate any \nfundamental policy of North Carolina. \n17. Accordingly, this Court must determine (i) whether an agreement to arbitrate \nexists and, if it does, (ii) whether the agreement encompasses the dispute at issue.  \nSee Glass \nv. Kidder Peabody & Co. , 114 F.3d 446, 453 (4th Cir. 1997); Blackmon v. LP Pigeon Forge, \nLLC, 2011 Tenn. App. LEXIS 473 * 36 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 25, 2011) (\"A party moving to \ncompel arbitration must show both the existe nce of a valid agreement to arbitrate and a \ndispute that falls within the scope of such agreement.\").  The parties do not dispute that the \n                                                 \n11 First Hickey Aff., Exs. A and B at § 23. \n12 The Court finds that the Agency and Administrative Agreements are contracts \"involving commerce\" \nand the FAA applies to those agreements.  King v. Bryant, 225 N.C. App. 340, 344 (2013). \n \n \nAgency and Administrative Agreements cont ain valid and binding arbitration clauses.  \nRather, the issue is whether NFS, as a non-sig natory, is entitled to enforce the arbitration \nprovisions in those agreements.  This questio n is subsumed in the question of whether an \nagreement to arbitrate exists between NFS and Protective, and is a matter of Tennessee \nlaw.13  See Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624, 631 -32 (2009) (holding that a \nnon-party can enforce an arbitration agreement if the relevant state contract law allows him \nto enforce the agreement). \n18. Under Tennessee law, contracts \"are pres umed to be executed for the benefit \nof the parties thereto and not third persons.\"  Chaves v. Bank of America, 2014 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 90800 (E.D. Tenn. July 3, 2014) (citing Owner-Operator Indep. Drivers Ass'n v. \nConcord, 59 S.W.3d 63, 68 (Tenn. 2001)).  Accordingly, one who seeks third-party beneficiary \nstatus bears the burden of proving from the terms of the contract itself or the circumstances \nsurrounding the contract's execution that  he is entitled to recover.  Rutherford County v. \nCity of Murfreesboro, 304 S.W.2d 635, 637 (Tenn. 1957); Oman Constr. Co. v. Tennessee \nC.R. Co., 370 S.W.2d 563, 577 (Tenn. 1963).  A third party is an intended beneficiary of a \ncontract, when:  \n(1) the parties to the contract have not otherwise agreed; (2) recognition of a \nright to performance in the benefici ary is appropriate to effectuate the \nintention of the parties; and (3) terms of the contract or the circumstances \nsurrounding performance indicate that either: (a) the performance of the \npromise will satisfy an obligation or discharge a duty owed by the promisee to \nthe beneficiary; or (b) the promisee inte nds to give the beneficiary the benefit \nof the promised performance.  \n \nOwner-Operator, 59 S.W.3d at 70; Goot v. Metropolitan Gov't of Nashville and Davidson \nCounty, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 708 * 46-47 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2005). \n                                                 \n13 Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel p. 10; Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel, p. 6. \n \n \n19. In applying the intended third-party beneficiary test, the courts' primary focus \nis the intent of the contracting parties. Owner-Operator, 59 S.W.3d at 70. There must be \n\"clear and direct\" evidence that the benefit is  intended to flow to the third party.  Id. at 69.  \n\"If . . . the benefit flowing to the third party is not intended, but is merely incidental, the \nthird party acquires no right to enforce the contract.\" Id. at 69-70.  In order for a third party \nto derive a benefit from a contract between tw o other parties, \"it must appear . . . that the \ncontract was made and entered into directly or primarily fo r the benefit of such third \nperson.\"  Id. at 69 (citing Abraham v. Knoxville Television, Inc., 757 S.W.2d 8, 11 (Tenn. Ct. \nApp. 1988)); Chaves, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90800 at *   (same); Burke v. Regions Bank, \n2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5826 * 8-9 (W.D. Tenn. Jan. 15, 2013); TIG Ins. Co. v. Titan \nUnderwriting Managers, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 777 *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008).  An intended \nbeneficiary's rights are measured by the contract itself, thus courts must analyze third-party \ncontract claims by construing the contract as a whole rather than in a piecemeal fashion. \nGoot, 2005 Tenn. App. LEXIS 708 at *47. \n20. With regard to the first factor under the Owner-Operator test, the Agency and \nAdministrative Agreements do not expressly state that NFS, or any other third-party, is not \nan intended beneficiary of the agreements. The lack of such an express provision is some \nevidence that the parties did not intend to exclude NFS from asserting rights under the \nAgreements.  See TIG Ins. Co., 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 777 at *9 (concluding that the \ndefendant was not an intended third-party be neficiary where contract contained express \nprovision stating that it did not create rights in any third party); AmSouth Erectors, L.L.C. \nv. Skaggs Iron Works, Inc., 2003 Tenn. App. LEXIS 551 at * 11 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2003) \n(same).  Nevertheless, NIA argues that the Agreements, each construed as a whole, establish \nthat the Protective and NIA did not intend for NFS to be a third party beneficiary.  First, \nneither the Agency nor Administrative Agr eements expressly mention NFS.  Neither \n \n \nagreement expressly place any obligations on, or  grant any benefits, to NFS.  In addition, \nthe Agreements restrict the parties' rights to assign the \"[a]greement and any rights arising \n[thereunder]\" without the written consent of the other party.14  Owner-Operator, 59 S.W.3d \nat 71 (recognizing that, while not dispositive of  the issue, anti-assignment provisions in a \ncontract \"demonstrate that the terms of the contract were intended to only benefit the \nparties to the contract\"; citing First Tennessee Bank Nat'l A ss'n v. Thoroughbred Motor \nCars, Inc., 932 S.W.2d 928, 931 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1996)).  Protective further points out that \nthe arbitration provision itself is uniquely worded, limiting its application to \"[a]ll disputes \nand differences made between the parties. \"15  Protective contends that this language is \nevidence of the parties' intention that the ar bitration rights under the Agreements were \nexplicitly limited to disputes between Protective and NIA. \n21. The parties differ as to the import of the indemnity provisions in the \nAgreements in determining whether NFS was an intended beneficiary.  The indemnity \nprovisions allow Protective to seek indemn ity for claims or losses arising from \"the \nsolicitation, sale or servicing of any insurance product of the Company through [NIA] or its \naffiliates,\" but limits Protective to indemnifying only NIA for losses arising from Protective's \n\"administration of the policies and the administration of claims.\" 16  Protective argues that \nthe indemnity provision must be interpreted to mean that that while NIA's affiliates might \nbe responsible for indemnifying Protective, NIA's affiliates are excluded as parties for whom \nNIA can seek indemnity from Protective. 17  On the other hand, NFS contends that the \nindemnity provisions establish that Protective  expressly recognized that NIA's \"affiliates,\" \n                                                 \n14 Agreements § 20. \n15  Id.  ¶ 19 (emphasis added). \n16 Agreements § 16. \n17 Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel pp. 10-11. \n \n \nincluding NFS, would be soliciting, selling, and  servicing of Protective's insurance, and \naccordingly were intended beneficiaries of the Agreements.18 \n22. The second Owner-Operator factor that must be considered is whether \npermitting NFS to enforce the Agreements wo uld \"effectuate the intention of the parties.\" \n59 S.W.3d at 70.  NFS contends that the entire nature of the relationship between Protective \nand NIA shows that the intent behind the Ag reements was to provide NFS with authority \nto sell Protective's life and disability policies to NFS' \"debtors\" (borrowers). 19  I t  i s  \nundisputed that NIA did not make loans and did not have borrowers or \"debtors.\" 20  \nProtective appointed NFS' loan officers as agents for Protective under the Agreements,21 but \nit is not clear whether Protective knew that the individuals being appointed were employees \nof NFS and not NIA. \n23. NFS also argues that the Agreements are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the \nGroup Policy issued by Protective to NFS under  which it was able to provide the policies of \ninsurance and that the Agreements and the Group Policy must be considered together.22 The \nCertificates of Insurance issued by Protective listed \"NationsCredit/Affiliates\" as the \"First \nBeneficiary\".23 The benefits paid out by Protective were paid to NFS, and not to NIA.24 NFS \npresented testimony, which Protective did not rebut, that the relationship between \nProtective, NFS, and NIA as NFS' \"captive\" in surance agency was \"typical and routine for \nthe [home mortgage lending] industry.\"25 \n                                                 \n18 Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel p. 14. \n19 Agreements § 1. \n20 First Hickey Aff. ¶ 10. \n21 Id. ¶ 13 \n22 Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel pp. 14 – 15. \n23 First Hickey Aff. ¶¶ 14 and 16; Ex. D. \n24 Id. ¶ 16. \n25 Id. ¶ 18. \n \n \n24. The Agreements and the Group Policy co ntained conflicting requirements as \nto whether NIA or NFS was responsible fo r delivering the premiums collected from \nborrowers to Protective.  The evidence on this  question also appears to be conflicted.  NFS \nprovided affidavit testimony that it \"delivered to Protective the premiums it collected on the \npolicies.\"26  Protective counters, however, that this assertion is contradicted by sworn \ninterrogatory responses made by NFS in the Richardson lawsuit in which NFS stated that \nNIA \"received\" the premiums paid by NFS' borrowers and \"disbursed\" them to Protective.27  \nProtective argues that NFS' response in Ric hardson is further evidence that NIA, but not \nNFS, was the intended beneficiary under the Agreements. \n25. Protective contends that it would not \"effectuate the parties' intent\" to allow \nNFS to enforce the Agreements as a third-pa rty beneficiary because NFS \"had a separate \ncontract with Protective – the [ ] Group Policy issued by Protective to Financial Services on \nMay 1, 1997 - from which Financial Se rvices derived a direct benefit.\" 28  The Group Policy \ndefined the rights and obligations as between Protective and NSF and it did not contain an \narbitration agreement, but did contain a merger clause stating that it constituted the \"entire \ncontract\" between the parties.29    Protective contends that in the Richardson lawsuit, NFS \nadmitted that the only benefit it derived under the Agreements was \"lower default rates and \ncustomer satisfaction\" of its borrowers. 30  Protective argues that these were at best \nincidental, but not direct, benefits. 31  Since NFS derived a \"direct benefit\" from the Group \n                                                 \n26  Id. ¶ 15. \n27 Pl.'s Ex. 4, Interog. 49. \n28 Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel p. 11. \n29 Id. pp. 11-12; The Court notes that the Agreements do not contain merger clauses or other language \nindicating that they constitute the entire agreement between the parties. \n30 Pl.'s Ex. 4, Interog. 51. \n31 Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel p. 15. \n \n \nPolicy, \"recognizing [NFS] as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreements would not further \nthe objectives of Protective and [NIA] in making the Agreements.\"32 \n26. Protective cites to evidence that it was the Net Pay-Off Policy that was at issue \nin the Richardson lawsuit and that resulted in the loss underlying NFS' indemnity claim and \nthat the Certificates of Insurance relied upon by  NFS each indicate that they were issued \nunder the Net Pay-Off Policy issued to NIA, and not the Group Policy. 33 Accordingly, \nProtective argues that \"the Group Policy issued by Protective to [NFS] is not clear and direct \nevidence that [NFS] was an intended third-pa rty beneficiary of the Agreements between \nProtective and [NIA] since Protective also issued a separate [ ] Net Pay-Off Policy to [NIA].\"34  \n27. With regard to the third factor, NFS does not contend that requiring Protective \nto arbitrate NFS' claims would \"satisfy an obligation or discharge a duty owed by the [NIA] \nto the [NFS]\".  Instead, it relies on the second part of third factor and contends that the \n\"terms of the contract or the circumstanc es surrounding performance\" indicate NIA \n\"intend[ed] to give [NFS] the benefit of the promised performance\" under the Agreements.  \nId.  As noted above, the terms of the contracts themselves lend some support to NFS' position \nthat NIA intended that NFS would benefit from Protective's performance since the \nAgreements do not expressly exclude third part y rights and the language of the indemnity \nprovision recognizes that NIA's \"affiliates\"  may be involved in soliciting and selling \nProtective's policies.  More significantly , however, the circumstances surrounding the \nperformance of the Agreements establishes that  NIA entered into the contracts to benefit \nNFS.  It is undisputed that NIA did not have \"debtors\" to whom it could sell the death and \ndisability policies.  NFS presented evidence that NIA existed primarily to serve as an agent \n                                                 \n32 Id. p. 12. \n33 Id. pp. 16-17; Pl.'s Ex. 6; First Hickey Aff., Ex. D. \n34 Id. p. 17. \n \n \nto insurance companies to facilitate NFS' sale  of credit life and disability insurance to its \nborrowers.35 NIA got NFS' loan officers appointed as agents of Protective so that they could \nsolicit and sell Protective's policies to NFS' borrowers.  In addition, the insurance sold \nthrough NIA to NFS' borrowers pursuant to th e Agreements paid benefits directly to NFS \nupon the death or disability of the borrower.  The circumstances surrounding the \nperformance establish that NIA intended Protective's performance under the Agreements to \nbenefit NFS. \n28. Having considered the applicable fa ctors, the Court must now determine \nwhether there is \"clear and direct\" evidence that the parties intended the Agency and \nAdministrative Agreements to benefit NFS as a third-party. \nTIG Ins. Co. v. Titan \nUnderwriting Managers, 2008 Tenn. App. LEXIS 777 *7-8; Owner-Operator, 59 S.W.3d at \n69-70.  Although the Agreements do not cont ain express provisions excluding third-party \nrights, they also do not contain language clea rly providing that NFS was intended to be a \nbeneficiary. The Court cannot conclude that the terms of the Agreements, standing alone, \nprovide clear and direct evidence that the parties intended NFS to be a beneficiary.  \n29. When the Agreements are considered in  the proper context of the parties' \nbusiness relationship, however, the Court concludes that the record evidence shows that the \nAgreements were intended to benefit NFS such  that NFS is a third-party beneficiary under \nthose Agreements. As noted above, the record evidence shows that the purpose of the \ninsurance policies sold in this business rela tionship was to protect NFS' borrowers from \ndefault in the event of death or disability. Th e ultimate benefit of this arrangement clearly \nruns to NFS in the form of additional security  for their loans. Additionally, it is clear from \nthe record evidence that NIA's primary purpose, if not its only purpose, was to facilitate the \n                                                 \n35 Second Hickey Aff. ¶ 4. \n \n \nissuance of Protective policies to NFS' debtors. As such, although there is some evidence that \nthe parties did not expressly agree to treat NFS as a third-party beneficiary, the close-knit \nnature of the relationship between Protective , NFS, and NIA as reflected in the record \nevidence shows that Protective and NIA did not agree to preclude NFS from obtaining third-\nparty beneficiary status under the Agreements.  \n30. The Court also concludes that allowi ng NFS to enforce the arbitration \nprovision in the Agreements would effectuate the intent of the parties. The primary objective \nof the parties' business arrangement was to allow NFS to sell Protective's insurance policies \nto NFS' borrowers as it is undisputed that NIA was not a mortgage lender and had no debtors. \nThe Agreements set out many of the terms upon which NFS' agents were ultimately \nauthorized to sell those policies. The evidence  shows that NIA intended to give NFS the \nbenefit of Protective's performance, and that NFS was an intended third-party beneficiary of \nthe Agreements. \n31. Ultimately, the Court concludes that the record evidence shows all three \nelements of the \nOwner-Operator third-party beneficiary test are satisfied, and that NFS \nshould be entitled to avail itself of the arbi tration provision in the Agreements. Having so \nconcluded, the Court now turns to Protective's arguments concerning the arbitrability of the \nspecific dispute at issue. \nii. Protective's Statute of Limitations Defense.  \n32. Protective argues that the NFS' claim for indemnity falls outside of the scope \nof the arbitration agreement because it is barred by the statute of limitations. 36  Protective \n                                                 \n36 In its Opposition to the Motion to Compel Arbitration, Protective also suggests that NFS' claim is \nbarred by the equitable doctrine of laches.  In the Complaint, Protective sought a declaration that NFS' \nclaim is barred by the statute of limitations, but not a declaration regarding the application of laches \nto the claim.  Even if the Court concluded that it could properly rule on a laches defense, Protective \nconcedes that laches requires a showing of \"prejudice to the defending party,\" but fails to state how, or \neven if, it has been prejudiced by any delay. Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel p. 31. \n \n \ncontends that NFS' claim accrued on or about September 21, 2005, when Protective sent NFS \na letter that \"properly denied\" the demand for indemnification, and that NFS' claim is barred \nby the six year statute of limitations applicable to breach of contract actions.37  NFS contends \nthat timeliness defenses to its claim, includ ing the statute of limitations and laches, are \nissues of procedural arbitrability that must be decided by the arbitrator and not this Court.  \nIn addition, NFS argues that its claim for indemnification did not accrue until March 28, \n2009 when it funded the settlement. \n33. Preliminarily, the parties disagree as to whether this Court's authority to rule \nupon the statute of limitations issue is one of federal or state law.  The case decisions under \nthe FAA are clear; the issue of application of a statute of limitations and other challenges to \nthe timeliness of claims in arbitration is for the arbitrator to determine, and not for the court. \nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has held: \nIf \"the court determines that an agreem ent exists and that the dispute falls \nwithin the scope of the agreement, it then must refer the matter to arbitration \nwithout considering the merits of the di spute.\" All other issues raised before \nthe court not relating to these two de terminations fall within the ambit of \n\"procedural arbitrability.\" \n \nGlass v. Kidder Peabody & Co. , 114 F.3d 446, 453 (4th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).  \nAccordingly, \"questions of mere delay, laches, statute of limitations, and untimeliness raised \nto defeat the compelled arbitration are issues of procedural arbitrability exclusively reserved \nfor resolution by the arbitrator.\" Id. at 456; see also Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds , 537 \nU.S. 79, 84-85 (2002) (issues including whether cl aims were timely raised are to be decided \nby the arbitrator). \n34. Protective contends that the question of whether the statute of limitations bars \nNFS' indemnity claim is for the Court, and not the arbitrator, to decide.  In support of its \n                                                 \n37 Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel pp. 30 – 32. \n \n \nargument, Protective cites the Tennessee Court of Appeals decision in Spann v. Am. Express \nTravel Related Servs. Co., 224 S.W.3d 698 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006). 38  In Spann, the plaintiffs \nchallenged to an arbitration provision on the grounds that it was unconscionable.  The court, \nhowever, did not address the question of whether the court or an arbitrator should decide the \nissue, noting that the parties had expressly stat ed \"that they did not intend to arbitrate the \nvalidity of the [arbitration provision] and that . . . they would prefer to have the \nunconscionability challenge . . . resolved by the courts rather than an arbitrator.\"  \nId. at 708. \n35.  Nevertheless, Protective apparently  contends that since the court in Spann \nrecognized that \"the FAA requires courts to enforce written agreements to arbitrate in \ncontracts affecting interstate commerce 'save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity \nfor the revocation of any contract,'\" Id. at 709, this Court should rule on its state statute of \nlimitations defense.  The Court disagrees.  Protective's statute of limitations defense goes to \nneither whether \"a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties\" nor whether \"the \nspecific dispute falls within the substantive scope of that agreement\".  Glass, 114 F.3d at 453.  \nRather, whether or not the statute of limitat ions bars NFS' claim for indemnification is \nproperly decided by the arbitrator.  Cooper Carry, Inc. v. Opry Mills, L.L.C. , No. 3:05 0297, \n2005 WL 1871109, *1 (M.D. Tenn. Aug. 3, 2005) (holding that issues such as time limitations \nand waiver are issues of \"procedural arbitrabilit y\" for the arbitrator, and not the court, to \ndecide). \niii. Arbitrability of claim for punitive damages.  \n36. Protective also contends that NFS' cl aim for indemnification falls outside of \nthe scope of the agreement because the arbitration clause excludes \"claims for punitive \ndamages.\"39  The damages for which NFS seeks indemnification are based, in part, on the \n                                                 \n38 Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel p. 31. \n39 Pl.'s Opp. Mot. Compel pp. 23, 26. \n \n \navailability of treble damages under Chapter 75 of the North Carolina General Statutes \n(\"UDTPA\").  Protective argues that the tre ble damages available under the UDTPA are \npunitive in nature, and accordingly, NFS' cl aim for indemnity falls outside the scope of \narbitration provision and is not arbitrable. 40  NFS contends, inter alia, that (a) determining \nwhether punitive damages are available under the arbitration agreement would violate the \nFAA by requiring the Court to rule on an i ssue that is for the arbitrator, and (b) the \narbitration provision only excludes an award of  punitive damages in claims brought by the \nparties \"against one another\" and not claims for indemnity. \n37. The availability of punitive damages for claims arising under the Agency and \nAdministrative Agreements is, at a minimum,  difficult to discern.  Section 19 of the \nAgreement, governing arbitration, provides in relevant part that \"[p]unitive damages against \nthe parties shall not be awarded in, under, or as  a part of any such proceeding, but punitive \ndamages assessed against the [Protective] in a civil proceeding brought by a third party may \nbe recovered from the Agent in arbitration if th e facts establish a right of indemnification.\"  \nThe arbitration provision does not expressly provide for the recovery of punitive damages by \nthe Agent in an indemnification claim brought against Protective.  On the other hand, the \nindemnification provision (section 16) contained in the agreements does not seem to limit \nindemnification for punitive damages to indemnity claims brought by Protective, stating that \n\"the indemnification of \neither party shall extend to and include punitive damages.\" (emphasis \nadded).41  It is difficult to see how these two provisions could be reconciled. \n                                                 \n40 At the hearing, Protective's counsel conceded that at least a portion, in this case probably one-third, \nof the amount for which NFS seeks indemnity is compensatory, and not treble, damages. \n41Read together, these provisions appear to create an anomaly that permits both parties to seek to \nrecover punitive damages awarded against it through an indemnity claim, but authorizes an arbitrator \nto award such damages only in an indemnity claim brought by Protective.  At the hearing, Protective's \ncounsel suggested that this simply meant that the Agent would have to seek indemnity for punitive \ndamages through a court action and not in arbitration.  In such a scenario, however, Protective would \nundoubtedly contend that the Agent was required to arbitrate its indemnity claim under the \n \n \n38. A more fundamental problem, however, ex ists with Protective's position.   \nProtective's contention that the arbitration provision in the Agency and Administrative \nAgreements excludes from arbitration \"claims for punitive damages\" is simply incorrect \nbased on the plain language of the provision.  While the arbitration provision states punitive \ndamages \"shall not be awarded in, under, or as pa rt of any [arbitration] proceeding,\" it does \nnot state that claims seeking punitive damages as a remedy cannot be made in arbitration.  \nRather, the language appears to create a limit ation on the arbitrator's authority to award \npunitive damages as a remedy for claims brou ght in arbitration.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the punitive damages language in  the arbitration provision is not a limit on \nthe scope of the claims that may be arbitrate d.  Instead, the question of whether NFS may \nrecover the treble damages component of its in demnity claim is an issue of interpretation \nbest committed to the authority the parties' ga ve the arbitrator to \"fully interpret [the \nAgreements] and the obligations upon the parties created thereunder.\"42 \n39. Ultimately, the Court concludes that NF S is a third-party beneficiary under \nthe Agreements, and is therefore entitled to arbitrate its dispute with Protective under those \nAgreements. Neither Protective's statute of lim itations defense, nor its position regarding \npunitive damages warrant a different conclusi on. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed \nabove, the Court concludes that the Motion to Compel Arbitration should be GRANTED. \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: \n 40 NationsCredit Financial Services Corpor ation's Motion to Compel Arbitration \nis GRANTED. \n                                                 \nagreements, thus forcing the Agent into a forum where it arguably cannot recover the punitive \ndamages.  \n42 First Hickey Aff.
