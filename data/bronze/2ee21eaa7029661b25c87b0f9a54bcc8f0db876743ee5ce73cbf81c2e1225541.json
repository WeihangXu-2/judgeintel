PEARSALL,\n \n                                    \nDefendants.\nORDER AND OPINION\n \n \n{1}\n             \nThis case highlights a basic duality in our economic system and the business laws which govern that\nsystem. Our system is dependent on both competition and ethics. The preservation and promotion of fair\ncompetition is one of the primary goals of our business laws. Competition fuels the engines of our economic\nsystem. Without it, productivity gains, innovation, efficiency and economy would be severely diminished;\nemployees would have fewer opportunities for betterment; investors would receive smaller returns on their\ncapital; and consumers would pay more for their purchases. Competition, like any fuel not properly\ncontained and utilized, can become destructive.\n  \nTo insure that competition is beneficial instead of\ndestructive, our business laws impose certain constraints on competition. One of the key mechanisms for\nimposing those constraints is state unfair competition laws. In this case, the Court is called upon to determine\nwhether certain conduct of the defendants is outside the bounds of fair, ethical competition, and thus violates\nNorth Carolina’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“U.D.T.P.A.”), N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.\n  \nThe Court\nconcludes that in certain instances the competitive actions of the defendants have exceeded the bounds of fair\nand ethical competition and thus violated that statute.\n  \nPlaintiffs have been damaged in the amount of five\nmillion dollars, which amount is trebled pursuant to the statute.\n{2}\n             \nDrawing that boundary and determining appropriate damages for the out of bounds activity has been\ndifficult in this case. The primary difficulties arise from (1) the failure of the plaintiff corporation to take\neven the most rudimentary steps to protect itself from the very competition about which it now complains,\n(2) the highly competitive nature of the aerial work platform leasing industry, (3) the key role service and\npeople play in an industry characterized by a uniformity of physical product, (4) the failure of the defendants\nto testify fully and truthfully, and (5) the overlapping impact of both fair and unfair competition on the\ndamages issues.\n{3}\n             \nThe Court has previously granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on the plaintiff’s claims\nfor breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. \nSee\n \nSunbelt Rentals, Inc. v.\nHead & Engquist Equipment, L.L.C.\n, 2002 NCBC 4 (No. 00 CVS 10358, Mecklenburg County Super.

(“Plant\nServices”), including its division BPS Equipment Rental and Sales (“BPS”).\n  \nThe purchase was\nconsummated on June 1, 2000.\n  \nBPS had been in the business of renting, selling and installing construction\nand industrial aerial work platform equipment and scaffolding since 1939.\n  \nPrior to its acquisition by Sunbelt,\nBPS was headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, and operated 24 branches located throughout the southeast\nand south central United States.\n{6}\n             \nDefendant Head & Engquist Equipment, L.L.C. (“H&E”) is a Louisiana corporation doing business in\nvarious states throughout the United States, including North Carolina, where one of its divisions, Hi-Lift\n(“Hi-Lift”), has a branch.\n  \nHi-Lift competes with Sunbelt in the AWP leasing business.\n{7}\n             \nDefendant Robert Hepler (“Hepler”) is a citizen and resident of Florida and served as president of BPS\nand as a director and officer of Plant Services from 1992 until his employment ended on December 14,\n1999.\n  \nAfter leaving his position at BPS, Hepler was employed as president of H&E’s Hi-Lift division.\n \nHepler performs essentially the same duties and responsibilities as president of the Hi-Lift division as he did\nas president of BPS.\n{8}\n             \nDefendant Douglas Kline (“Kline”) is a citizen and resident of Florida, and from 1992 until the end of\nhis employment on December 14, 1999, Kline served as vice president of finance and chief financial officer\nof BPS.\n  \nKline joined the Hi-Lift division as its executive vice-president and chief financial officer as part of\na package agreement he and Hepler made with H&E.\n  \nKline performs essentially the same duties and\nresponsibilities for Hi-Lift as he did as chief financial officer for BPS.\n{9}\n             \nDefendant Michael Quinn (“Quinn”) is a citizen and resident of Georgia.\n  \nFrom 1989 until January 5,\n2000, he was a member of the BPS senior management team, acting primarily as product manager for BPS\nand its predecessor companies.\n  \nAt one time he was branch manager of the BPS Atlanta branch.\n  \nOn January\n5, 2000, Hi-Lift employed Quinn as its product manager and as vice president for its Eastern region.\n  \nQuinn\nperforms essentially the same duties and responsibilities for Hi-Lift as he performed for BPS.\n{10}\n         \nDefendant Gregg Christensen (“Christensen”) is a citizen and resident of Texas.\n  \nChristensen was\ndirector of operations at BPS’s Western division from approximately 1992 until he left that position on\nJanuary 14, 2000.\n  \nHe also was branch manager for the BPS Dallas branch until November 1999.\n  \nAfter\nleaving BPS, Christensen became Hi-Lift’s vice president for its Western division.\n  \nChristensen performs\nessentially the same duties and responsibilities for Hi-Lift as he performed for BPS.\n{11}\n         \nDefendant Brian W. Pearsall (“Pearsall”) is a citizen and resident of Mecklenburg County, North\nCarolina.\n  \nHe was the branch manager for BPS in Charlotte, North Carolina until June 2000 and assumed the\nsame position with Hi-Lift when he left BPS.\n  \nHe is Rob Hepler’s brother-in-law.\n \n{12}\n         \nRentokil Initial plc (“Rentokil”) is a British company which obtained ownership of Plant Services in\nconnection with a hostile takeover in approximately 1997.\n  \nJames Wilde (“Wilde”) was the manager of\nRentokil responsible for oversight of BPS after the Plant Services acquisition.\n  \nHepler and Kline reported to\nWilde when Rentokil owned Plant Services and they were employed by BPS.\n  \nRentokil is not a party to this\nlitigation.\nThe Equipment Rental Industry\n{13}\n         \nBefore providing an overview of this case, it is helpful to outline the challenges and general practices in\nthe equipment rental industry. This action is concerned principally with equipment rentals of aerial work\nplatforms (“AWP”).\n  \nAWP equipment consists of boom lifts, scissor lifts, push-around lifts (smaller non-\nmotorized lifts) and reach forklifts. Boom and scissor lifts come in a wide range of models, sizes and\nfunctions; they are substantial pieces of equipment that cost thousands of dollars each and encompass a\nbroad variety of devices designed to lift workmen off the ground to do work on jobs that otherwise would be\nvery difficult to reach.\n  \nSometimes included within this class of equipment are “swing stages” and “mast\nclimbers,” equipment used to climb alongside buildings and other structures. Hi-Lift purports to operate\nexclusively in the AWP business.\n{14}\n         \nThe business is highly specialized.\n  \nIf not delivered, handled or operated properly, AWP equipment can\ncause substantial injury and even death.\n  \nThus, the nature of the industry is such that its workmen and sales\npeople must be highly trained in the mechanics, applications and operations of the equipment.\n{15}\n         \nThe larger equipment rental companies typically purchase or lease equipment from a limited number of\nmanufacturers.\n  \nAs of the fall of 1999, the two primary manufacturers of AWP equipment in the United\nStates were JLG Industries (McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania) and Genie Industries (Redmond, Washington).\n \nJLG and Genie (and other secondary manufacturers) sell boom lifts, scissor lifts and other AWP equipment\nin certain standard sizes with various options such as two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.\n  \nThus, the\ncompetitors in this industry offer, for all practical purposes, the same or very similar equipment to potential\ncustomers.\n  \nAs a result, prices tend to be set by the marketplace, and service and equipment availability have\nbecome significant factors affecting the success of the businesses in the area.\n{16}\n         \nAWP managers and salespeople know, from experience or simply by asking their customers, what type\nof equipment is needed by the different types of contractors for particular jobs.\n  \nFor example, electrical\ncontractors will often use smaller scissor lifts or push-around lifts that can fit through interior doorways,\nwhile glass manufacturers working on the outside of buildings need taller boom lifts which can range up to\n120 feet in height.\n  \nKnowledge of the company’s customer base contributes to higher utilization of\nequipment and better selection of the “fleet mix” for a particular market.\n  \nSuch information allows a business\nto invest in certain machines that yield better rates and profits.\n  \nA new market entrant has a significant\nadvantage if it has access to that information.\n  \nWith such information, a new entrant can maximize its initial\nfleet investment with little risk, perhaps saving millions of dollars, and can accurately project an operating\nbudget.\n \n{17}\n         \nThe potential customers for AWP equipment are general construction contractors, subcontractors (such\nas electrical, glass and painting companies) and other industrial or commercial businesses that need\nequipment to work “in the air.”\n  \nThese customers are typically identified through numerous public sources—\nincluding the yellow pages, business directories and publications (such as Dodge Reports and PEC Reports\nthat list various pending construction sites and related contractors)—and through on-jobsite trailers and direct\ncontacts with contractors. \nIt may be more difficult to determine which industrial customers are in the rental\nmarket, although the types of users—airlines, for example—are easy to determine.\n{18}\n         \nThese public directories, reports and other sources not only provide the name of potential customers but\nalso the customer’s address, phone number and the name of the person to contact.\n  \nThe Dodge Reports and\nPEC Reports go further, providing detailed information about construction projects (Dodge) and industrial\nplants (PEC).\n \n{19}\n         \nLong-term rental contracts are rare.\n  \nCompanies typically rent for periods ranging from a day to a month,\nwith weekly rentals being the most common.\n  \nEven with longer term rentals, the customer is given the\nopportunity to return the equipment prior to the end of the rental period, paying only for the time rented.\n{20}\n         \nRental companies primarily use outside sales representatives to sell and rent AWP equipment.\n  \nThese\nsalesmen typically visit job sites or company offices to attempt to rent equipment.\n  \nCustomer rental decisions\nare made on varying factors, including price, the relationship between the customer and the sales person,\navailability of equipment on the customer’s schedule, customer service, perceived dependability of the\nequipment and other considerations particular to the customer.\n  \nMany customers do business with more than\none company to maintain the flexibility and price competitiveness offered by having multiple sources of\nequipment.\n{21}\n         \nThe personal relationship between the outside salesman and the customer is particularly important for\nsuccess in this industry.\n  \nMany salesmen have been calling on the same customers for many years and\nnaturally develop close personal and/or professional relationships that increase the likelihood that the\ncustomer will rent from the salesman’s company, other factors being equal. The hiring of salesmen from\ncompetitors to take advantage of these customer relationships is not unusual in the industry.\n  \nIt would be\nunusual, however, for an entire sales force to leave an office at the same time and go to the same competitor\nand unusual for the majority of salespeople in a number of offices to leave and go to work for the same\ncompetitor at the same time.\n{22}\n         \n \nNothing in the history of the industry is indicative of mass departures of personnel from one branch to a\ncompetitor’s branch.\n  \nThe departure of a number of core-positional people at various levels of the branch\norganization, at approximately the same time, to a competitor, has a major detrimental impact on a branch\nand can adversely affect the performance of the branch.\n  \nPersonnel changes usually occur as one- or two-\nperson departures at a time.\n{23}\n         \n \nIn terms of price, historical prices have limited value.\n  \nPrices are quoted and then negotiated between\nthe outside sales representative and the customer or over the telephone with inside sales coordinators.\n  \nWhile\nsalesmen would like for prices to remain “confidential,” they understand and expect that prices will become\nknown in the market.\n  \nCustomers do not consider quoted prices to be confidential and often reveal price\nsheets and quoted prices of competitors to obtain more favorable terms.\n  \nAWP rental companies occasionally\nquote good customers a fixed price for a job or period of time; these arrangements would constitute\nconfidential information.\n  \n“Sealed bids” or other formal bidding processes are rarely used.\n  \nRecent\nconsolidation in the industry has made pricing extremely competitive and has created several large\ncompetitors.\n{24}\n         \nWell-run companies in the equipment rental business study their markets and customers and gather\nvarious financial, sales and marketing information.\n  \nThis information includes average rental rates,\nconstruction information, fleet mix records, revenue per employee, utilization rates and other measures of\noperations.\n  \nThis information is shared with employees to improve their performance.\n  \nIt is not generally\nshared with competitors.\n  \nMost of the information is based on a company’s experience and is the type of\ninformation that employees would have some general knowledge about and retain. Such information takes\nsome time to accumulate.\n{25}\n         \nEfforts to protect that information exists in the AWP rental industry include obtaining covenants not to\ncompete, placing a general confidentiality policy statement in an employee handbook and limiting access to\nthe information.\n{26}\n         \nThe industry has grown considerably over the last five to seven years through “greenfield” startups—\nstartup branches in a market where there has been no prior presence— and, more significantly, through\nconsolidation. As part of the industry consolidation, larger companies have expanded by purchasing smaller\ncompanies rather than through greenfield operations. In these acquisitions, the tangible and intangible assets\nof a branch or multiple branches are acquired, including, importantly, the entire human resource components\nand goodwill of the company.\n  \nConsolidation has caused competition to increase and margins to fall. In the\nyear 2000, acquiring companies were paying multiples of five to seven times EBITDA for the acquired\ncompany or branch.\n{27}\n         \nThe industry has historically been in short supply of trained, qualified branch managers, sales persons,\nmechanics, inside sales coordinators, drivers and other related positions.\n  \nBusinesses that are able to retain\nthose personnel develop a considerable competitive advantage based on the investment those businesses\nmake in the employees’ training, experience and customer relationships.\n{28}\n         \nIn a typical mature AWP business, the human resource component includes a branch manager, outside\nsales representatives, an inside sales coordinator, credit manager, service manager, branch administrator,\nmechanics (both inside as well as field mechanics) and drivers.\n   \nIn a typical greenfield situation, hiring all\nthese personnel and achieving a satisfactory level of competent employees takes months.\n  \nThe employment\nof a number of experienced trained people for these positions within a short time frame (30 days or less) is\natypical for this industry.\n  \nIn fact, such employment is inconsistent with normal marketplace employment\nactivity.\n{29}\n         \nIn the industry, the most important business component is the branch office.\n  \nConsequently, the branch\nmanager position is one of critically important leadership in that this person is responsible for the total\noperation of each branch.\n  \nHe or she is also responsible for the development of confidential information\nabout branch operations, its equipment fleet, its customers and employees and other related branch activities.\nSignificantly, a branch manager must be sufficiently familiar with the branch’s customers to be able to deal\nwith customers upon the departure of a sales person and thus ensure continuity in the relationship between\nthe branch and its customers.\n \n{30}\n         \nA branch manager has “very unique, very useful knowledge” of all personnel in the branch: competency\nlevels, work ethics, salary/compensation, customer relationships and other personnel related matters.\n  \nHe or\nshe is intimately involved in supervising a branch’s sales force and in effect operates as a sales manager for\neach sales force.\n  \nHe or she must also supervise the service side of the branch, including the service manager,\nthe mechanics and drivers.\n{31}\n         \nThe individuals working for the branch manager—sales personnel, mechanics and other service related\npersonnel—must act \ninterdependently\n to deliver the equipment \nand\n service to customers.\n  \nSales personnel are\nthe conduit through which businesses (branches) have relationships with customers.\n  \nAs stated by a customer\ncalled by defendant as a witness, sales personnel are the “face person” for the relationship with the\ncustomer.\n  \nThe service manager, mechanics and drivers all support the relationship with the customer by\ninitial delivery of the equipment, training a customer in the operation of the equipment, regular maintenance\nof the equipment and prompt field repair of the equipment in the event of breakdowns.\n  \nService personnel\nhave frequent and close contact with customers. The AWP business requires a high service component and\nthe presence of a strong team effort.\n{32}\n         \nAll AWP personnel undergo regular training.\n  \nSales personnel, for example, have to know the uses of the\nequipment and the most advantageous applications of it.\n  \nInside sales coordinators need to know equipment\napplications to provide appropriate advice to customers. The mechanics and service personnel have to be able\nto maintain and deliver the equipment to the satisfaction of customers, including OSHA-required\nfamiliarization.\nOverview\n{33}\n         \nBefore discussing the detailed Findings of Fact, a general overview of the core facts is helpful.\n{34}\n         \n \nDefendants Hepler and Kline were employed by BPS. They played significant roles in the creation of a\nsuccessful business at BPS renting aerial work platforms to construction companies and industrial users both\nbefore and during the time it was owned by Rentokil. BPS had rental locations in several key markets in the\nSoutheast, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Tampa-Fort Myers, Orlando, Dallas and Houston. When Rentokil\ndecided to sell BPS in 1999, it did not consult with or inform Hepler and Kline of the decision and did not\noffer them any inducement to stay with the company through consummation of any sale. Neither had a\ncontract that restricted his employment by a competitor.\n{35}\n         \nAccordingly, Hepler and Kline devised a business plan that envisioned competing directly with BPS in\nits key branches in the Southeast. A successful AWP leasing business required two key ingredients: capital\nand the right people.\n{36}\n         \nAt the heart of the plan was the conversion of the employee base of the targeted BPS branches and key\nBPS management in addition to Hepler and Kline. With the conversion of those key employees came all the\ninformation necessary to ramp up a greenfield operation more rapidly than would normally occur. The\nbranch managers were thoroughly knowledgeable about the business of each branch, including the employee\nbase, competition and pricing in the local market, the fleet mix, the customer base, and every other aspect of\nthe local operation. The service employees were already trained and knew the equipment, customers, job\nsites and safety requirements. The salesmen knew the customers, the locations of current and upcoming jobs,\nand the prevailing market prices for the equipment to go on the jobs. The credit managers knew the credit\nhistory of the customer base. Each employee brought with him or her the knowledge of the systems,\ninformation and records necessary to the smooth functioning of an AWP rental operation. Concomitantly, the\ndeparture of each of those employees left BPS with a void, which impacted its ability to compete in the local\nmarket in the short term. Significantly, not one of the employees hired by H&E, including Hepler and Kline,\nhad any form of contract containing a restrictive covenant or a covenant not to compete.\n{37}\n         \nCapital was required to purchase or lease the significant amounts of large and expensive equipment that\nconstituted the lease products of the business and to fund other startup costs. H&E provided the capital and\nfinancial backing to bring the business plan to fruition. During the six-month period between their departure\nfrom BPS and the closing of its sale to Sunbelt, Hepler and Kline together with the other defendants\nsuccessfully enticed significant numbers of the key management and skilled employees of the targeted\nbranches to leave and join the new venture with H&E. That six-month period was one of extreme\nvulnerability for BPS, but a vulnerability of BPS’s own creation.\n{38}\n         \nThree factors, discussed more fully below, have entered into the determination that defendants’ actions\n—which when taken alone or in isolation might not have been outside the bounds of fair competition—when\nviewed collectively crossed over the boundary.\n  \nFirst is the use of then BPS managers to accomplish the raid\non BPS employees. Second is the magnitude of the raid.\n  \nThird is the coordinated timing of the departures.\nBPS and Its Operations\n{39}\n         \nFive companies acquired by Plant Services were consolidated into BPS in approximately 1993 to 1994.\n \nThese included Hepler Hi-Lift, which Defendant Hepler founded, and four other companies:\n  \nAble\nEquipment Company, Safe-T-Green, Booms and Scissors, and Florida Contractor Rentals and Sales.\n{40}\n         \nDefendant Kline was the chief financial officer for Safe-T-Green and in 1994 was moved to BPS\nheadquarters in Jacksonville, Florida to become the chief financial officer for BPS, working directly under\nHepler.\n \n{41}\n         \nUnder Hepler and Kline, BPS had a senior management team which included: Doug Guy, director of\nEastern operations; Christensen, director of Western operations; Jeff Stachowiak, director of marketing, sales\nand safety; John McGraw, director of scaffolding; and Mike Quinn, product manager.\n \n{42}\n         \nDuring Hepler’s tenure as president, the senior management team met regularly, at least once per\nmonth.\n  \nAt its meetings, the senior management team discussed customers, mechanic availability, sales\npersonnel, equipment utilization, safety, marketing, product mix, average rental rates, planning and other\nmatters.\n  \nBranches were regularly evaluated branch-by-branch. Senior management regularly shared BPS\nmarketing, customer and internally developed information. This information included head counts, salary\ninformation, pricing, organizational structure, financial projections and forecasts, cost information, branch\nbudgets and customer information, including the identity, contacts and requirements of its rental customers,\npricing in effect for those customers and fleet utilization information by branch.\n  \nSenior management knew\nthat this information was confidential.\n{43}\n         \nDefendants Hepler and Kline managed the day-to-day affairs of BPS, made strategic decisions,\ndeveloped and implemented budgets and hired and fired employees.\n  \nHepler was involved in all levels of the\nbusiness.\n  \nHe frequently visited branches, discussed up and coming job sites and sales personnel and was\nactively involved with customers.\n  \nKline was involved in all aspects of the business as the result of his\nfinancial responsibilities.\n  \nIn particular, he was extensively involved with branch managers in budgeting.\n \nHepler and Kline were highly compensated.\n  \nHepler was paid a salary of $260,000 in 1999, and Kline was\npaid a salary of $160,000 to manage 24 branch operations throughout the Southeast and South Central\nUnited States.\n  \nThey had access to and knowledge of BPS’s confidential business information.\n \n{44}\n         \nDefendant Christensen, as Western regional manager for BPS, was closely involved in personnel issues,\nbudgets, fleet mix and management of the branches for which he was responsible.\n  \nHe was directly involved\nin the BPS Texas branches and, in fact, managed the Dallas branch for several years.\n  \nHe had access to all of\nBPS’s confidential business information related to his geographic area of responsibility.\n{45}\n         \nDefendant Quinn was involved in a variety of senior management issues, including budgets and, most\nimportantly for him, fleet management.\n  \nHe was intimately involved with fleet utilization, equipment\nordering, scheduling delivery dates, and equipment movement.\n  \nTransferring equipment between branches\nfacilitated utilization.\n  \nHe had access to and knowledge of BPS’s confidential business information.\n \n{46}\n         \nBPS placed special emphasis on its branches and branch managers.\n  \nAmong its most experienced branch\nmanagers at the end of 1999 were:\n  \nMark Alexander (“Alexander”) (9 years, 7 months) (Atlanta); Duke\nDrennan (“Drennan”) (18 years, 7 months) (Orlando); Beare Jones (“B. Jones”) (20 years, 5 months)\n(Tampa/Fort Myers); Abe Farrington (“Farrington”) (5 years, 3 months) (Dallas); David Hobbs (“Hobbs”) (4\nyears 3 months) (Charleston, South Carolina); and Defendant Pearsall (13 years) (Charlotte).\n  \nThese branch\nmanagers dominated their branches, recruited, hired, reviewed and fired employees, set salaries, trained and\ncertified employees, set prices and rates for customers in their markets, developed confidential information\nfor their respective markets, prepared budgets for their branches and carried out the multiple other business\nand leadership duties and responsibilities expected of a branch manager.\n  \nThe branch managers were in\ncontinuous contact with senior management.\n{47}\n         \nBranch managers regularly made presentations to their peers about their branch operations with\nemphasis on the keys to success they had found in operating their branches.\n  \nFor example, Alexander made a\npresentation to the BPS branch managers in June 1999, in which he emphasized:\n(a) the longevity and experience of his sales staff (“60 years of combined experience”);\n \n(b)\n  \nthe branch’s interdependence of its personnel and its emphasis on team work; and\n(c) the Atlanta branch’s success in retaining customers. (“\nWE DON’T LOSE CUSTOMERS.\n”)\n \n                     \n{48}\n         \nIn order to protect its information, BPS implemented an employee handbook containing a section on\nconfidential information.\n  \nIn fact, developing the handbook was the direct responsibility of Defendant Kline,\nwho rewrote, in his own handwriting, that section of the handbook dealing not only with confidentiality but\nalso with employee loyalty.\n  \nEach BPS employee was required to acknowledge receipt of the handbook in\nwriting.\n  \nVirtually all of the BPS/Sunbelt employees who left to become employed by H&E signed such an\nacknowledgment.\n  \nHepler and Kline have both separately acknowledged the presence of trade secrets in this\nindustry. Additionally, some defendants and many of their H&E employees also admitted that certain\ninformation is confidential and is not to be shared with competitors.\n{49}\n         \nBPS’s business information was treated as confidential when discussed by senior management.\n  \nEfforts\nwere made to protect it at the branches.\n  \nFor example, the war rooms had the information taken down from\nthe walls when outside people came in.\n    \nPricing was kept in special books.\n  \nBranch managers (e.g. Pearsall)\nhad specific rules about file removal from the branch office.\n  \nPasswords were required and given to only\ncertain personnel with respect to the BPS computer system.\n  \nSalesmen’s information was limited to\ncustomers for which they had responsibility.\n  \nOnly branch managers had access to information on all branch\ncustomers.\n  \nSalary information was kept under lock and key at the branches.\n \n{50}\n         \nBased on senior management discussions, the individual defendants were acutely aware that BPS lacked\ndepth in a number of its human resource requirements.\n  \nBPS senior management had frequently discussed\nthat it did not have sufficient human resource reserves for its sales people.\n  \nThe individual defendants were\nacutely aware of the intense competitive pressures regarding qualified experienced mechanics and drivers\nand knew that those positions were in short supply in all of their markets. As a result, Defendants Hepler,\nKline, Quinn, Christensen and H&E knew that the branches from which they successfully recruited BPS\npersonnel \nen masse \nwould be seriously harmed by those departures and that those branches would not have\nsufficient human resources to compete effectively with H&E until the departed employees could be replaced\nand trained.\n{51}\n         \nOver the years at BPS, the branch managers developed close personal and professional relationships\nwith many of their long-time employees, who in turn formed close relationships among themselves; there are\nexamples of shared family relationships as well, with fathers, wives, sons or brothers working in the same\nbranch.\n  \nThese relationships often mirrored those more commonly found in a family-run business.\n{52}\n         \nOutside sales representatives usually reported directly to the branch manager, as did the inside sales\ncoordinators.\n  \nThe inside sales coordinators were responsible for taking orders over the phone from\ncustomers, both those who had been solicited by the outside salesmen and others who called in to shop for\nprices over the telephone.\n  \nThe inside sales coordinators were also responsible for scheduling deliveries and\ndispatching drivers to deliver and pick up equipment which had been called “off rent.”\n  \nLarger branches had\nservice managers who reported to the branch manager.\n  \nThe service managers were responsible for\nsupervising the mechanics (both shop mechanics and field mechanics), the parts department, the shop\nforeman and, to a limited extent, the drivers.\n{53}\n         \nThe branch administrative personnel—i.e., the branch administrator, credit department employees and\nreceptionist—also ultimately reported to the branch manager. Each of the branch employees served an\nimportant function at the branch and participated in training appropriate to his or her position.\n    \nTraining for\nmechanics was handled primarily through on-the-job experience and training classes provided by the\nmanufacturers.\n  \nThe safety concerns surrounding use of the equipment made trained mechanics critical.\n \nSalesmen, to the extent they were not already experienced in the industry, were trained through experience\nand advice from the branch manager and fellow sales representatives.\n  \nDrivers with no experience were\ntrained through manufacturer classes, training videos and practice at the branch location.\n  \nThe process of\ntraining drivers typically took no more than two to three weeks.\n{54}\n         \nIn addition to routine sales efforts, sales duties at the branch level consisted of assigning salesmen to\nterritories, identifying target customers, creating “war rooms” to further identify ongoing and potential\njobsite and customer opportunities, and discussing competitive pressures. Sales meetings among the sales\nrepresentatives and the branch manager were sometimes held to discuss sales efforts throughout the branch.\n{55}\n         \nRental contract records were maintained both in the company’s computer database and in “hard copy”\nfiles maintained at the branches.\n  \nThe rental contracts typically included the name, address and telephone\nnumber of the customer; the name and contact information of the customer who had rented the equipment;\nthe price at which the equipment was being rented; the expected term of the rental; and often directions to\nthe job site where the equipment was to be used.\n  \nSometimes hand tickets were prepared which included\nvarying amounts of the information found on the typical printed rental contract.\n  \nThe rental contracts were\ndelivered to the job site with the equipment, and a contract copy was left with the customer.\n{56}\n         \nAs of the end of 1999, BPS included the following among its southeastern and Texas branch locations:\nAtlanta, Tampa, Fort Myers, Orlando, Miami, Jacksonville, Charlotte, Raleigh, Charleston, Richmond,\nDallas, Houston and Austin.\n  \nBPS had additional branches in Arizona, California and Nevada.\n  \nBy virtue of\nhis presidency at BPS and prior experience with his own business, Hepler had extensive knowledge of the\nAWP market in each of these cities.\n{57}\n         \nHepler also had long-standing personal relationships with many of the BPS branch managers.\n  \nAs of\nJanuary 2000, the branch manager of the Atlanta branch was Mark Alexander.\n  \nHepler had known\nAlexander, either as a competitor or as one of the BPS branch managers, since the early 1990’s.\n  \nThey were\npersonal friends in addition to their professional relationship. \n \nAlexander was also close to Quinn.\n{58}\n         \nThe branch manager of the Tampa and Fort Myers, Florida branches as of January 2000 was Beare Jones\n(“Jones”).\n  \nHepler and Jones were extremely close friends.\n  \nJones has worked for either Hepler or Hepler’s\nfather in the equipment rental business for nearly forty years. At the age of seven or eight, Hepler, now 46\nyears old, began working in his father’s business with Jones.\n{59}\n         \nThe long-time BPS branch manager for Charlotte was Defendant Brian Pearsall.\n  \nPearsall is, as noted\nabove, Hepler’s brother-in-law. Hepler and Pearsall had worked together for over ten years as of January\n2000.\n{60}\n         \nThe BPS branch manager for Charleston, South Carolina in January 2000 was David Hobbs (“Hobbs”).\n \nHobbs started as a BPS employee in the BPS Jacksonville office and developed a close relationship with\nHepler as he was promoted through various positions at the Jacksonville branch and later to the position of\nbranch manager in Charleston.\n{61}\n         \nThe branch manager for the BPS Orlando branch at the beginning of 2000 was Duke Drennan\n(“Drennan”).\n  \nWhile not as close personally to Drennan as he was to the other branch managers discussed\nabove, Hepler had known and worked with Drennan for over ten years as of January 2000.\n{62}\n         \nHepler also had close personal relationships with BPS employees below the branch manager level and\nfrequently played golf with the salesmen.\n{63}\n         \nIn summary, Hepler and Kline were in an ideal position to recruit BPS employees to go to work with\nH&E.\n  \nNo BPS employee was restrained by a restrictive covenant.\n{64}\n         \nThe announcement that Plant Services was for sale caused uncertainty and insecurity among the BPS\nemployees.\n  \nWhen it had previously attempted to sell Plant Services, Rentokil had purchased some protection\nagainst this vulnerability by contracting with Hepler and Kline to stay on through a transition with a new\nowner.\n  \nIn 1999 Rentokil elected not to purchase that same protection, leaving Hepler and Kline to go to\nwork for a competitor at the time BPS would be most vulnerable.\n  \nRentokil was either unaware or\nunconcerned about the close relationship between Hepler and Kline and the branch managers.\n{65}\n         \nInsecurity among the BPS employees was understandable.\n  \nThe possibility existed that BPS would be\npurchased by a large competitor who would close branches and consolidate management practices.\n   \nFour of\nthe key managers who had guided the company to success had left abruptly and without explanation.\n{66}\n         \nNot until the problems posed by Hi-Lift were apparent did Sunbelt/BPS offer “loyalty contracts” to some\nof the BPS managers. Sunbelt’s president, Bruce Dressel (“Dressel”), visited nine BPS branches and\ndiscussed with BPS branch managers Sunbelt’s desire that they stay with BPS and work for Sunbelt.\n \nDrennan assured Dressel he was “on board” with the Sunbelt acquisition. Jones did not commit but gave no\nindication that he would not be staying.\n    \nDefendant Pearsall accepted Sunbelt’s invitation to attend\nVendorfest.\n \n{67}\n         \nRentokil elected not to spend any money to protect itself against loss of employees during the period of\ntime BPS was for sale, despite the fact that its two key employees had left to join a company that would\ncompete with BPS.\n   \nThat fact was clearly known to Sunbelt when it elected to purchase BPS.\n  \nIn fact,\nDressel chided Wilde for his failure to keep Hepler and Kline on board during the transition.\n \nH&E and Hi-Lift and Its Operations\n{68}\n         \nH&E has been in existence since the 1960’s and built a reputation in the Gulf region in the crane and dirt\nmovement business. At some point in the 1990’s, H&E entered the rental business by acquiring a small fleet\nof equipment from Grove Manufacturing (“Grove”), another but smaller manufacturer of equipment.\n  \nH&E\nwas not very successful with its fleet.\n  \nIt apparently had a fleet of approximately 1,000 to 1,200 units spread\nacross at least five locations, including Gonzales, Louisiana; Memphis, Tennessee; and Houston, Dallas and\nSan Antonio, Texas.\n  \nThe fleet in Dallas was only about 250 units, and the fleet in Houston approximately\n300 units.\n  \nEngquist himself described H&E’s fleet, which operated out of locations that also had the crane\nand dirt moving business intermixed, as a problem and “struggling.”\n  \nThe Memphis and Gonzales branches,\neven though in “major markets,” were later closed.\n  \nThe Court notes that, during the events of this litigation,\nH&E provided \nno\n evidence that it opened any branch under the Hi-Lift name in any location other than those\nin which BPS had an existing branch, and that it closed the Memphis and Gonzales AWP operations, two\nmarkets in which BPS had no presence.\n{69}\n         \nWhile H&E had a minor AWP presence in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, the evidence that the fleet\nwas struggling suggests that H&E’s efforts were not formed or based on any highly developed business\ninformation.\n  \nHi-Lift had no market presence and no market information of its own about Atlanta, Charlotte,\nTampa/Fort Myers or Orlando.\n  \nThe Grove AWP equipment these branches used was not nearly as widely\nused as the Genie and JLG equipment.\n  \nThus, customers were more familiar with and wanted Genie and JLG\nequipment.\n  \nQuinn was exceptionally knowledgeable with respect to the purchasing of that equipment.\n{70}\n         \nIn mid-1999, H&E was purchased in part by an investment group, Bruckmann, Rosser and Sherrill\n(“BRS”).\n[1]\n At about the same time, ICM (located in Salt Lake City) was also purchased by BRS, thus\nlinking H&E and ICM.\n  \nIn fact, this common owner considered from the outset merging the two companies.\nThe Court further notes that the boards of directors of ICM and H&E met jointly, and Gary Bagley\n(“Bagley”), C.E.O. and president of ICM, was a member of H&E’s board of directors in part of 2000 and part\nof 2001. Further, Hepler testified that he and Kline spent a day in Jacksonville with Earl Rose, branch\nmanager, conferring about business plans to open locations in the Northwest based on the Hi-Lift plan he\nand Bagley had been discussing.\n{71}\n         \nThe broader picture for Hi-Lift and its investors is clear.\n  \nH&E and ICM each had an AWP business that\nwould benefit from the experienced management that Hepler, Kline, Quinn and Christensen could provide.\nWhen Hepler and Kline were hired, a plan was in place pursuant to which H&E would open AWP rental\noperations in Charlotte, Atlanta, Orlando and Tampa Bay-Fort Myers, and the former Grove-dominated\nAWP operations in Dallas and Houston would be converted to Genie and J&G equipment and run similar to\nthe BPS branches in those locations.\n  \nIt is also apparent that there was at a minimum the likely prospect of\nsome combination of the H&E and ICM AWP business so as to produce a company with coast-to-coast\nbranches capable of competing with the largest players in the market.\n  \nThat likelihood has come to fruition\nwith the merger of H&E and ICM and the creation of an AWP division encompassing the branches of both\nICM and H&E.\n{72}\n         \nIf carried out in a fair manner, it was a well-conceived and perfectly legitimate business plan. H&E had\nevery right to compete with BPS Sunbelt in a fair manner, and, given the experience of its management and\nthe capital resources of its financial backers, it would have been a formidable competitor under any\ncircumstances.\n  \nThe Court does not find that the existence of such a plan was an unfair trade practice.\n  \nThe\nplan was a perfectly proper competitive strategy.\n  \nThe defendants were free to compete fairly with BPS in\nany market.\n  \nBPS and its owners had the ability to provide some protection against that competition and\nelected not to pay the price to do so.\n{73}\n         \nThe implementation of the consolidation and expansion plan is where the activities occurred which give\nrise to liability in this action.\n  \nIn their testimony, defendants contended that no plan existed to raid BPS at\nspecific locations and that the defections which occurred were unsolicited and unplanned.\n  \nThe Court, as\nfinder of fact, does not find that testimony credible.\n \n{74}\n         \nHi-Lift hired Hepler, Kline, Quinn and Christensen at salaries that were commensurate with the\ndevelopment of a large organization such as has been developed by Hi-Lift.\n  \nQuinn provided the necessary\npurchasing expertise for such a large operation and expansion, and Christensen provided the West Coast\nmanagement necessary since Hepler and Kline wanted to stay on the East Coast.\n  \n{75}\n         \nHepler and the branch managers testified that there were no prior discussions or solicitation of\npersonnel.\n  \nThe Court finds that testimony is not credible and that those activities did take place.\n   \nWhat\nactually\n happened is a clear indication that these activities occurred.\n  \nIn the cases of the Charlotte, Atlanta,\nOrlando, and Tampa-Fort Myers branches, a pattern of lining up salesmen and other key employees to leave\nat the same time is apparent.\n \n{76}\n         \nIn each instance, the branch manager was offered compensation, including a signing bonus that was in\nexcess of his or her BPS compensation or covered the bonus he or she would have gotten from BPS/Sunbelt\nfor signing a loyalty contract.\n  \nThe branch manager then recruited the key or skilled employees (sometimes\nreferred to as the “A Team”) needed to open quickly.\n  \nThese key employees included the most experienced\noutside sales people, the inside sales person, the service manager, experienced mechanics and drivers, and\nthe administrative or credit manager. While the detailed information about the branches was useful, it was\nnot necessary because the recruited employees brought all their knowledge and skills with them.\n  \nHad H&E\nopened a greenfield office in one of the locations, many employees might have switched over in time.\n  \nIt is\nalso possible that BPS could have made them counteroffers from which they would have benefited and for\nwhich they would have stayed.\n  \nThat did not happen because of the wrongful conversion of employees by\nHepler and the branch managers.\n{77}\n         \nThe fact that there was no effort to fill these new positions outside BPS is a strong indicator that the\nbranch managers knew who was lined up to leave.\n  \nThe ability of Hi-Lift to begin operations at a level and at\na speed far in excess of those normally associated with a greenfield is indicative of the value these key,\nskilled, core employees brought with them.\n \n{78}\n         \nThe fact that each of the new H&E locations at former BPS branches were opened before Sunbelt\nconsummated its purchase of Plant Services is a clear indication that H&E rushed to open these branches\nwhile BPS was in the transition period and most vulnerable to a raid on its employees.\n[2]\n  \nThe timetable\ncontributed to the need to use the branch managers as recruiters prior to the establishment of a Hi-Lift\nbranch.\n{79}\n         \nMost of the individual acts standing alone would not have risen to the level of unfair competition or an\nunfair trade practice.\n  \nFor example, if BPS salesman Ken Farris had voluntarily left BPS and gone to work\nfor United Rentals in Atlanta, he could have called on his old customers, used his past knowledge and\nexperience with respect to the type of equipment they used and even promised to meet or beat BPS prices,\nknowing full well the BPS price structure, including specific prices for particular customers on a known job\nsite.\n{80}\n         \nHepler and Kline were free to go to work for a competitor.\n  \nIn doing so, they were not restricted from\ndirecting the sales people of the new employer to call on customers whom Hepler and Kline knew to be\nformer BPS customers or from using the knowledge and skills they gained while working in the industry.\n{81}\n         \nThe critical issues arise from both the expansive nature and the cumulative effects of the H&E actions.\n \nIn the context of an industry in which service may be the significant business determinant and trained\nemployees are not plentiful, the consequences of a secret wholesale raid on a competitor’s employees are\nclearly discernable in advance.\n  \nThe competitor’s revenue is likely to be impacted by the inability to service\ncustomers in a normal businesslike manner.\n{82}\n         \nThe Court finds that defendants used the BPS branch managers, while they were still employed by BPS,\nto recruit employees to leave BPS branches in a concerted and orchestrated manner, which had the dual\neffect of temporarily immobilizing the BPS branch and permitting Hi-Lift to fill the void so created to\nappropriate BPS’s business to Hi-Lift, at least temporarily.\n \nHepler/Kline Decision to Leave BPS\n{83}\n         \nThe past history of the first attempted sale of Plant Services is instructive.\n   \nPlant Services had been put\non the market for sale in 1998.\n  \nDuring the process of that potential sale, Hepler and Kline were intimately\ninvolved in the preparations for sale.\n  \nPursuant to an agreement with Rentokil, Plant Services’ parent, Hepler\nstood to make as much as four times his salary if the sale was completed—Kline, a lesser amount.\n  \nAs a\nresult, Hepler and Kline did not consider departing BPS in 1998.\n{84}\n         \nAs part of the process, Hepler and Kline made confidential presentations for Plant Services about BPS.\n \nOne of those presentations was made to Bagley, a representative of\n  \nICM, a business in the Northwest that\nhad some AWP operations.\n{85}\n         \nNo sale was made in 1998, although Ripplewood/ICM was discussing offering $800 million for Plant\nServices.\n \n{86}\n         \nRentokil decided in 1999 to put Plant Services back on the market; however, they handled the matter\nvery poorly. In August 1999, Hepler and Kline learned of the proposed sale before they were informed of it\nby Rentokil management.\n  \nHepler and Kline reacted negatively to the proposed sale of BPS.\n  \nIn fact, Hepler\ndescribed himself as being quite angry about the sale.\n  \nTheir reaction was understandable, given the 1998\narrangement and the contribution they made to BPS and the way they found out about the sale.\n{87}\n         \nAfter learning of the proposed sale of Plant Services, Hepler and Kline communicated with each other\nabout their dissatisfaction and their intention to leave BPS.\n  \nHowever, they did not communicate their\ndispleasure and desire to leave to their superiors at Rentokil.\n{88}\n         \nHepler worked out a potential consultancy with Genie Industries, one of the principal suppliers of\nequipment to BPS.\n  \nKline had no such prospects, and only had an interview lined up which did not get past a\nvideo interview.\n  \nHepler apparently made inquiry of Genie during this time as to whether it would support a\nnew venture put together by Hepler and Kline.\n{89}\n         \nAccording to Hepler, he received a call from a potential investor named Bob Williams (“Williams”) in\nAugust 1999, in response to which he and Kline developed a very specific business plan for Aerial\nEquipment Specialists (the “AES Plan”).\n  \nThis business plan:\n(a)\n        \nStated that the management of BPS was committed to the plan:\n \n“The majority of the management team is committed to AES . . . . The five senior\nmanagers (CEO, CFO, Director of Operations, Product Director and Director of\nMarketing) have worked together as a team for over six years . . ..”\n(b)\n        \nStated that specific fleet mixes for the specifically identified markets:\n“We have developed a fleet mix for each of the proposed branches, which will\ncoincide with the needs of the local rental market . . . . The equipment mix, as well as\nthe option list, was formulated by experience in each of these markets to maximize\nutilization.”\n(c)\n                \nEmphasized customer targeting as BPS had done in the past:\n“[W]e target . . .those customers for the following reasons:\n●\n    \n[T]hey . . .understand the added value concept of providing exactly what the\ncustomer needs.\n●\n    \n[T]hey are more responsible and less abusive to our products.\n●\n    \nThese customers tend to be established and will pay for services rendered\npromptly . . . .”\n     \n(d)\n        \nIdentified seven geographical locations where the company would do business;\n(e)\n        \nSpecified employee compensation and other equipment formulae for the branches;\n(f)\n         \nSet forth specific operating ratios (e.g. AWP’s per delivery driver, sales person and mechanic);\n(g)\n        \nMade projections and forecasts for each location; and\n(h)\n        \nIncluded average monthly rental rates for each of the seven branches cited, which were then used\nto develop the rental revenue in the financial model.\n{90}\n         \nThe branch locations, employee compensation and other aspects of the AES Plan are strikingly similar to\nthe plan defendants actually implemented at H&E.\n  \nThe Court concludes that Kline must have used BPS\ninformation in formulating the AES plan.\n  \nThe information in the AES Plan was accessible to Kline from\nBPS information.\n   \nIt is not information that anyone could carry in his head.\n  \nFor instance, the average\nmonthly rental rates set forth for each market and for each product group in the AES Plan are different, and\nas the AES Plan itself states, “[were] formulated by experience in each of these markets to maximize\nutilization.”\n  \nMore specifically, there are 20 products listed (12 booms and 8 scissors) and 7 markets; in other\nwords, 140 different individualized average rental rates were quoted in the AES Plan. Thus, inclusion of such\ninformation in the AES Plan manifests defendants’ intentions, from at least August 1999, to take advantage\nof information developed by BPS.\n  \nKline admitted that at the time the AES Plan was prepared, he had access\nto average rental rates for the BPS branches in Atlanta, Charlotte, Orlando, Dallas, Houston and Tampa, and\nthat gross margins were based upon his experience at BPS. However, given the commodity nature of the\nequipment and the highly competitive market, it was probably not difficult to project margins.\n \n{91}\n         \nIn testifying at trial about the AES Plan, Hepler gave very contradictory testimony.\n  \nOn one day, he\ntestified he knew nothing about the information contained under operating ratios, contending that Kline\nalone had put together that information. The next day, however, Hepler testified that he did know about\nthose ratios and that they were just generic.\n{92}\n         \nAfter the development of the AES Plan, Hepler and Kline sent the plan to Williams and made\npresentations of it to at least two other investors, one involving a trip to South Bend, Indiana.\n  \nIn those\npresentations, Hepler and Kline did not qualify the specific declarative representations contained in the plan.\n{93}\n         \nAt least as early as October 19, 1999, Defendants Hepler and Kline began consulting with attorneys\nabout their activities.\n  \nHepler and Kline gave their attorneys earlier employment agreements for review.\n  \nOn\nOctober 25, 1999, they submitted the BPS Employee Handbook and the AES Plan for review.\n  \nThey\nspecifically conferred with their attorneys regarding “potential litigation issues.”\n{94}\n         \nAccording to Hepler, he and Kline had decided to resign from BPS on the evening of November 10th in\nHouston.\n  \nBecause this dinner with James Wilde was canceled, however, they did not resign.\n{95}\n         \nAccording to Hepler, sometime before November 11, 1999, he received a call from Gary Bagley at ICM\ninquiring about his status.\n  \nBagley was aware that Plant Services was again for sale, but ICM was not\napproaching Plant Services.\n  \nAs a result of this and follow-up calls, Hepler arranged to meet Bagley in\nDallas, Texas on November 11, 1999, after having a budget meeting in Houston with Hepler’s BPS superiors\non November 10, 1999.\n  \nBruckmann and Bagley traveled to this meeting from California and Utah,\nrespectively, to meet Hepler. \n \nConversations between Bagley and Hepler indicate that there would be no\nneed for ICM to bid for Plant Services.\n  \nBy hiring Helper and Kline, ICM would be able to benefit from their\nimplementation of the AES Plan at much less cost than an acquisition of Plant Services.\n{96}\n         \nBruce Bruckmann, whose investment group owned H&E, attended the November 11, 1999 meeting\nbetween Hepler and Bagley in Dallas.\n  \nKline was not present.\n  \nDefendants characterized the meeting as an\n“employment interview.”\n  \nHepler testified at his deposition that, even though he had not discussed the\nproposition with Kline, he told Bagley and Bruckmann that he was not interested in a position unless Kline\nwas also offered a position.\n  \nHepler and Kline had consulted their attorney about the interview in advance of\nit.\n \n{97}\n         \nImmediately after the November 11, 1999 Dallas meeting, Defendants Hepler and Kline \nboth\n called\nJames Wilde, chairman and president of Plant Services and regional managing director of Rentokil, to resign\nfrom BPS.\n  \nDefendants said nothing about their competitive plans and activities.\n  \nWilde would not accept\ntheir resignations without meeting with them. Defendants Hepler and Kline, without Wilde’s knowledge,\nproceeded to tell other BPS senior management that they intended to leave.\n{98}\n         \nShortly after the November 11, 1999 meeting with Bagley and Bruckmann, Hepler began a series of\ntelephone calls with Bagley.\n  \nThese telephone calls led to a meeting in Dallas on November 23, 1999,\nattended by Hepler, Kline, Bruckmann, Bagley, Hal Rosser of Bruckmann Rosser, and others.\n  \nThe meeting\ntook place at the Admiral Club at the Dallas Airport.\n  \nEngquist met Helper and Kline for the first time at this\nmeeting.\n  \nAfter approximately two hours of discussion, Hepler and Kline were offered employment at H&E\nat salaries of $300,000 and $200,000, respectively.\n  \nThese salaries were more in line with salaries for\nmanaging a nationwide AWP operation, not just H&E’s AWP operation.\n{99}\n         \n \nEngquist testified that he hired Hepler and Kline in order to address problems with H&E’s fleet, which\nconsisted of Grove equipment.\n  \nThus, Hepler and Kline were offered a $500,000 compensation package, an\namount greater than their BPS compensation, to take over an aging fleet that was approximately a tenth the\nsize of the BPS fleet.\n{100}\n     \nSignificantly, Engquist was concerned about the availability of personnel in the business and at this\nmeeting specifically “questioned” whether Hepler and Kline would be able to obtain the “right people” to\ngrow the business.\n  \nHepler responded that he was confident that he could. Hepler and Kline’s\ndisproportionate compensation for the H&E fleet, Engquist’s statements regarding the “right people,”\nBruckmann’s repeated involvement in meeting with Hepler and the large contingency of personnel in\nattendance at the November 23 meeting in Dallas, the AES Plan and the subsequent hiring of Quinn and\nChristensen at salaries in excess of $100,000 each confirm that defendants intended to expand H&E with\nBPS personnel, and on a scope with the AES plan.\n  \nEngquist remained involved in the decision-making\nprocess that led to the hiring of Christensen, Quinn, Alexander and Hobbs and signed off on the employment\nof numerous other BPS employees, including Abe Farrington, Beare Jones, Duke Drennan, Brian Pearsall,\nSteve Mathews, Ken Moon and Dan Franz.\n{101}\n     \nHepler and Kline did not accept the job offers on the spot, contending that they had agreed to meet in\nperson with Wilde before anything happened on their resignations.\n    \nEight days later, on December 1, 1999,\nwhen James Wilde was again in the United States in Jacksonville, they officially resigned and at Wilde’s\nrequest submitted written resignations.\n  \nWilde asked Hepler and Kline to stay on to sell BPS, or stay at least\nfor a longer notice period.\n  \nHepler and Kline, after conferring with Engquist, refused. They gave BPS only\ntwo weeks’ notice.\n  \nA public announcement was made of their resignations on December 1, 1999.\n{102}\n     \nDuring the notice period, Hepler and Kline had several discussions with their attorneys.\n  \nOn December\n14, 1999, before flying to Baton Rouge that night to begin their employment at Hi-Lift, they consulted with\ntheir attorney about litigation risks, solicitation of BPS employees, and consultations with H&E concerning\nthe same.\n  \nDefendant Kline testified in his deposition that on December 15th, after discussion of BPS\nsolicitation of employees came up, Hepler and Kline and Engquist had a conversation with H&E’s attorney,\nAshley Moore.\n{103}\n     \nHepler and Kline both have testified in deposition and Hepler at trial about going to Baton Rouge on\nDecember 15th.\n  \nOn the afternoon of December 15, 1999, Engquist suggested that they fly to Dallas the next\nday to review the H&E AWP fleet at Martin Equipment. After that suggestion, according to Engquist,\nHepler and Kline began conversations with Engquist about the employment of Defendants Quinn and\nChristensen.\n{104}\n     \nAs described by both Hepler and Kline in deposition, and by Hepler at trial, Hepler and Kline raised the\nissue of employment of Quinn and Christensen with Engquist because they needed Quinn to “manage the\nfleet” and Christensen to manage the western operations, particularly the branches in Texas for H&E where\nChristensen had worked for BPS.\n  \nThey further testified that on December 15th they discussed compensation\nin excess of $100,000 each for Christensen and Quinn and that Engquist was agreeable to that\ncompensation.\n  \nIn their testimony, they suggested that Engquist meet Quinn and Christensen in Dallas the\nnext day before making any final decision.\n{105}\n     \nHepler testified that he had had no contact with Christensen and Quinn about getting together in Dallas\nuntil after the December 15th discussion with Engquist.\n  \nIn this, Kline’s deposition testimony and Hepler’s\ntrial testimony directly conflict with the testimony of their co-defendant, Quinn.\n  \nQuinn testified in his\ndeposition that when he was first contacted by telephone by Hepler to tell him that Hepler was \ngoing to\n work\nfor H&E, Hepler wanted to talk to him about employment at H&E, and would be contacting him again.\n \nQuinn further testified that shortly thereafter he received another call from Hepler setting up a meeting in\nDallas “within the next \nweek or so.\n”\n  \nQuinn’s travel itinerary shows that on December 9th he had already\nbooked a flight from Florida to Dallas arriving in the Dallas airport at 2:30 p.m. December 16th.\n  \nThis timing\nsupports Quinn’s testimony that the Dallas meeting was arranged several days in advance.\n  \nFurther evidence\nthat Quinn was conspiring with Hepler is found in Quinn’s testimony that he accepted employment with\nH&E without a specific compensation offer even though Quinn expressed doubts about Hi-Lift.\n{106}\n     \nDefendants did not present Defendant Quinn for testimony at trial.\n  \nNor did they call Defendant Pearsall,\nDrennan, Jones, Shelly Parnell, or others whose deposition testimony contradicted Hepler, Kline or\nEngquist.\n \n{107}\n     \nImmediately upon Hepler’s return from Christmas vacation, he proceeded to recruit additional BPS\nemployees.\n \n{108}\n     \nHepler and Quinn traveled to Atlanta on January 6, 2000 to meet with Alexander; Alexander was the\nAtlanta branch manager, BPS’s largest branch and among its most successful.\n  \nNotwithstanding Hepler’s\ntestimony that H&E had no definite plan at this time to open in Atlanta, Hepler and Quinn sought assurances\nthat Alexander would be “available when it came time to leave.”\n    \nHepler’s testimony about this meeting is\nnot credible.\n{109}\n     \nThe very next day, Hepler and Quinn had breakfast with Gary Maner, BPS’s national service manager.\n \nAt that time, they offered him employment to head up the rebuild facility for H&E, the same initiative that\nBPS was supposed to have achieved as a strategic initiative in 1999.\n  \nThis is another example of Hepler and\nQuinn’s use of knowledge of BPS’s business plan for the immediate benefit of Hi-Lift.\n{110}\n     \nOn January 9, 2000, Hepler, Kline and Quinn flew to Seattle, Washington to meet with Genie Industries,\nthe major supplier of AWP equipment and according to the AES Plan the “preferred supplier.”\n  \nAccording to\nHepler and Engquist, who later joined the other defendants, the purpose of this meeting was to become\nacquainted with Genie, with whom H&E had nothing but a casual business relationship at that time.\n \nAccording to Hepler, H&E was able to convince Genie that it was a sufficient size player to obtain very\nfavorable pricing and terms on equipment.\n  \nEven though it was only three days after his Atlanta recruiting\nefforts, Hepler testified that an Atlanta branch was not discussed as a real possibility at that point with\nGenie.\n  \nEngquist, however, testified that they had committed to Genie that Hi-Lift would open a branch in\nAtlanta.\n  \nFor this reason and other reasons, the Court again finds Hepler’s testimony not to be credible.\n{111}\n     \nThereafter, H&E set about communicating with JLG, another major AWP equipment manufacturer,\nabout orders to be placed with JLG.\n  \nHepler testified that with respect to both entities, they were able to\nachieve contracts that would allow them to move equipment around freely, cancel and substitute orders and\ndo other things that minimized the financial risks of purchase orders to either manufacturer.\n  \nThere were\nserious discrepancies between Hepler’s testimony and the contracts themselves.\n{112}\n     \nBased on the quantity of equipment ordered by Quinn on behalf of H&E, substantial thought had to go\ninto the ordering of the right kind of units. Utilization reports constitute a substantial competitive advantage\nand are based on knowledge of different marketplaces and their respective needs.\n  \nA review of plaintiff’s\nexhibit 522 shows that an Atlanta fleet does not fit Charlotte and a Charlotte fleet does not fit Atlanta.\n  \nFor\nexample, Charlotte has 3 times (19) more 90-foot booms than Atlanta (6).\n  \nThus, the Court concludes that\nthis type of information about fleet mix is a significant competitive advantage and gives a competitor an\nadvantage if it knows the requirements of specific markets in general and specific customers in particular.\n \nAccordingly, allocation of dollars to purchases of specific equipment is indeed critical.\n  \nThe immediate, high\nutilization rates and profits achieved by H&E as its branches opened confirm that H&E used confidential\ninformation from BPS to establish and set up their fleets in each of the markets in which it opened, just as\nDefendants Hepler and Kline stated in the AES plan and as Quinn and Christensen did every day for BPS.\n{113}\n     \nExamples of the Court’s concern with respect to credibility include, but are not limited to, the following\nexamples:\n(a)\n        \nHepler specifically testified that at the January 6, 2000 dinner in Atlanta he did not solicit or\nrecruit the BPS personnel present for H&E.\n  \nHe is flatly contradicted by Quinn on several points, including the\nfollowing:\nQ:\n  \nDid Mr. Hepler tell each of these gentlemen [Messrs. Alexander, Leavell,\nCornett, Franz and Brown] that he would like to employ them in his new venture?\nA:\n  \nI don’t know that it was told specifically to each on individually.\n  \nI don’t recall\nhow he worded it other than he would like to have all of them with this – to be part\nof this new venture\n.\n  \n(Emphasis added.)\n  \n(b)\n      \nEngquist testified:\nQ.\n  \nMr. Engquist, in your experience, how quickly could JLG deliver equipment to\nthe H&E branch?\n. . .\nQ.\n  \nFor example if you ordered something on Thursday when would it get there?\nA.\n  \nIt would probably get there \nMonday\n, \nTuesday\n.\n  \nThey had availability of\nequipment.\n \nDefendants’ order log sets forth the order date and the receipt date for all of H&E’s AWP equipment orders to\nJLG and Genie.\n  \nA casual review shows that occasionally each manufacturer did deliver on a few days’ notice.\n \nHowever, a more thorough review reveals that Engquist grossly exaggerated delivery times.\n  \nThe average time\nfrom order date to actual receipt based on Defendant H&E’s \nown\n documents shows that the \naverage delivery\ntime\n of Genie was 28.9 days and JLG 44.5 days – vastly different than “Thursday” to “Monday or Tuesday.”\n \nAdditionally, H&E’s initial orders for Atlanta, for the period from February 25 through April 15, 2000, totaled\n467 units comprised of over 30 different product models (including options)—a very large order, apparently\nintended for more branches than just Atlanta.\n  \nApproximately 1650 rental items were ordered as reflected by the\nlog, comprised of approximately 58 different JLG models and 42 different Genie models (including options).\n \nThe two most popular such models appear to be models 1932E2 (208 were ordered) and 2032E2 (121 were\nordered).\n  \nThese models’ popularity suggests that they are staples in a fleet, yet their average delivery times were\neach 54 days from the date of order.\n  \nThese delivery times, based on H&E’s order log, confirm the testimony of\nGuy Ramsey, the industry expert, on lead times.\n(c)\n        \nHepler’s expense reports concerning the February 22, 2000 breakfast in Fort Myers directly\ncontradict his testimony about soliciting salesmen with Jones.\n{114}\n     \nThe defendants used their knowledge of BPS information in the hiring and recruitment of personnel.\n  \nIn\nvirtually all cases, employees hired from BPS by H&E occurred after salary increases were offered.\n  \nHepler,\nKline, Quinn, Christensen and Pearsall used their knowledge of the skills, training, experiences and\nrelationships of BPS employees in selecting and hiring those employees.\n \n{115}\n     \nBPS’s accumulated confidential information concerning its average rental rates, average rental rates per\ntype of equipment, utilization reports per type of equipment, salary information, employee revenue by\nheadcount and similar information had significant value to BPS was developed over several years, was not\nreadily available in the marketplace and could not be easily obtained through legitimate means without great\ncost.\n   \nDefendants used their knowledge of that BPS information in the Hi-Lift business plan.\n \nThe H&E Branches\n{116}\n     \nThe Court will now review each H&E branch in the order that evidence was presented.\n  \nThe Court finds\nthat the evidence confirms a common pattern in H&E’s opening of a number of the branches that had known\nintentional adverse consequences on the corresponding BPS branch.\n   \nThe pattern can be summarized as\nfollows:\n(a)\n        \nHepler, Kline and Engquist decide to open a branch in a particular market.\n(b)\n        \nHepler, using his past relationship with, and knowledge of, BPS’s branch managers, and with the\nassistance of Quinn and/or Christensen, recruits the BPS branch managers.\n(c)\n        \nHepler, with Engquist’s approval, employs the BPS branch manager and directs that he recruit\nand employ on behalf of H&E the best BPS personnel from his branch.\n(d)\n        \nThe BPS branch manager, using his prior relationship and knowledge of BPS employees’ skills,\nsalary, relationships and training, recruits selected BPS employees to come to work for H&E.\n  \nThe branch\nmanager first recruits the branch’s top sales personnel and service manager, and may recruit mechanics and\ndrivers, although, this is usually done by the recruited service manager.\n  \nBased upon the timing and nature of the\ndepartures, the Court finds that many of the employees were recruited by branch managers while the branch\nmanagers were still employed by BPS.\n \n(e)\n        \nHepler, either meets directly, or communicates by telephone, with many of those BPS employees\nin the recruiting process, especially the salesmen.\n(f)\n         \nThe branch manager, sales personnel, service manager and some of the branch personnel all\nleave at about the same time to open an H&E branch in the same geographical area, with little or no notice to\nBPS.\n  \nShortly thereafter, the departing BPS employees are followed by other recruited mechanics, drivers and\nother personnel.\n(g)\n        \nThe H&E branch opens based on financial and fleet information put together by Kline, Quinn\nand Christensen and has immediate business.\n  \nThe financial and fleet information is based on confidential\ninformation gained during their employment with BPS.\n(h)\n        \nOn behalf of H&E, the sales representatives are immediately in the market and soliciting\ncustomers, but do not have H&E pricing information or H&E promotional materials.\n  \nNotwithstanding that, they\nare able to secure significant numbers of rental contracts for H&E immediately.\n \n(i)\n         \nThe BPS branch is left in a weakened state.\n  \nThe branch does not have sufficient trained,\nknowledgeable human resources to respond to H&E’s competition, address relationships with customers, or\nperform the routine service necessary to support the branches relationships with its customers.\n   \nBPS is required\nto rush other personnel resources to the branches to react to the emergency.\n{117}\n     \nBased on this pattern, and as will be shown more explicitly in the following findings for each branch, the\nCourt makes these summary findings:\n(a)\n        \nHepler’s testimony as to the circumstances of his meetings and communications with BPS\npersonnel are contradicted by the recruited employees’ testimony, further discrediting Hepler’s credibility.\n \nHepler is not a credible witness.\n(b)\n        \nThe fact that each new branch had “80%” utilization within weeks of opening is circumstantial\nevidence that H&E used BPS’s confidential information to tailor its branches’ rental fleets without spending the\nnecessary time, money and effort to develop the information itself.\n  \nThe utilization rate is also circumstantial\nevidence that a higher percentage of the BPS customer base was converted to H&E in the short term.\n \n(c)\n        \nIn view of the circumstances of this pattern, the Court finds, in the short term, that were it not for\nH&E’s interference with BPS employer relationships, and subsequent solicitation of BPS customers, those\ncustomers would have continued doing business with Sunbelt, or, at least, that Sunbelt would have been able to\nfairly compete for those customers’ business, an opportunity they were not afforded after H&E’s orchestrated\nconversion of BPS employees, customers and information.\n(d)\n        \nBPS, under Hepler and Kline, had built very strong customer relations at the branch level.\n  \nIt\nwould have been natural for those customers to continue doing business with BPS, subject to normal competitive\npressures.\n  \nA new start-up such as H&E could have been expected to take some customers or some business of\nsome customers over time.\n  \nThe mass exodus of key sales employees in each branch with intimate knowledge of\nthe BPS customer base permitted H&E to effectively solicit the business of that customer base while BPS was\ntrying to rebuild its sales force.\n  \nOrganized defection of service people, mechanics, drivers, inside sales reps and\ncredit manager adversely impacted BPS’s ability to service its existing customers, thereby facilitating the\nconversion of their short term business by H&E.\n  \nThe loss of each branch manager left the branch leaderless and\nadversely impacted the branch’s ability to recover from the other defections.\n  \nThe combined departure of the key\nemployees both took from BPS and transferred to H&E a vast amount of collective knowledge about the\nbusiness and customers of the branch.\n  \nThat combination gave H&E a competitive advantage it would not have\npossessed without the organized and orchestrated defections.\nCharlotte\n{118}\n     \nThe Charlotte Hi-Lift branch opened on or before June 5, 2000, with the following staff from BPS: a\nbranch manager (Brian Pearsall); an inside sales coordinator (William Huntley); a service manager (Pat\nMuldoon); a branch administrator (Michele Dougherty); a sales representative (Ken Farris); and a driver\n(Frank Evans).\n  \nWithin a week the H&E Charlotte branch added a BPS master mechanic (Lennie\nMerrington).\n   \nEach of these employees came from BPS.\n \n{119}\n     \nAlthough the possibility of a Charlotte greenfield was part of the original AES Plan and was discussed at\nthe H&E board meeting on February 10, 2000, and although a pro-forma was drawn up for Charlotte by May\n9, 2000 and Pearsall was Hepler’s brother-in-law, the defendants claim that there was no plan to open the\nCharlotte branch in 2000 until a “chain of events” took place in late May 2000 with Pearsall wanting to leave\nBPS.\n  \nDefendants’ position is not credible. Although defendants made plans as early as May to open a\nCharlotte branch, it was the last branch opened.\n  \nClearly, defendants felt they could rely on Pearsall to\nconvert himself and other employees to H&E.\n  \nIt was obviously completed in a rush so that it was done\nbefore Sunbelt took over and had an opportunity to create a relationship with the employees.\n{120}\n     \nDefendants’ documents and their own witness show that:\n \n(a) \n       \nEngquist testified that a decision to open was made by May 9, 2000, because a branch manager,\nspecifically Brian Pearsall, was available;\n(b) \n       \nDelores Kline, a real estate agent and the wife of Doug Kline, flew to Greensboro, North\nCarolina on May 9, 2000 (coincidentally the same day Engquist, Hepler and Doug Kline were in Atlanta\ndiscussing the Charlotte pro forma), and spent May 9 - 11, 2000 in Charlotte looking for a site for the H&E\nCharlotte branch;\n(c) \n       \nDelores Kline’s notes indicate she was looking for licensing reciprocity in North Carolina in\nOctober or November 1999;\n(d) \n       \nEngquist signed the certificate to do business in North Carolina on February 25, 2000;\n(e) \n       \nHepler discussed opening in Charlotte with Earl Rose on April 17, 2000; and\n(f) \n        \n159 pieces of AWP equipment, ordered as early as May 22, 2000, arrived in Charlotte between\nJune 6, 2000 and the end of June 2000.\n \n{121}\n     \nMeanwhile, Pearsall, Hepler’s brother-in-law and BPS’s Charlotte branch manager, denied in his\ndeposition knowing about the plan to open an H&E branch in Charlotte until Saturday or Sunday, May 27-\n28, 2000.\n  \nHepler claimed in his deposition that Pearsall called him at home after Pearsall had a discussion\nwith Bruce Dressel at Sunbelt’s Vendorfest, which was held over Memorial Day weekend in May 2000, and\nthat this call, which occurred on either May 27 or 28, 2000, was the beginning of the chain of events which\nled to the opening of H&E’s Charlotte branch — eight\n  \ndays later with a facility and a full staff.\n{122}\n     \nPearsall, although a resident of Charlotte, did not testify at trial and was present in Court several days.\n  \nIn\nhis deposition, he stated that he called Hepler and “told him that I wasn’t going to, I couldn’t work for\nSunbelt and at that time he [Hepler] asked me if I could, if I wanted to work with, with H&E.”\n  \nHepler, on\nthe other hand, testified at trial that Pearsall called Hepler “and said could you hire me?\n  \nI would like to\ncome to work for you.”\n{123}\n     \nIn fact, Pearsall and Hepler had been in regular communication from as early as January 14, 2000.\nBetween January 14, 2000 and March 18, 2000, Hepler called Pearsall at least eight times, including three\nphone calls Hepler made to the BPS Charlotte office totaling approximately 37 minutes.\n  \nIn view of the\nevents occurring by May 9, it is highly improbable that Hepler and Pearsall had no discussion of a Charlotte\nbranch before May 27 or 28.\n{124}\n     \n \nThe Court does not find the testimony, by deposition, or in person, of either Hepler or Pearsall to be\ncredible when taken in light of the totality of the evidence.\n  \nMoreover, Pearsall’s failure to testify calls into\nquestion his ability to rebut the testimony of several Charlotte branch witnesses about his statements and\nactivities.\n{125}\n     \n \nPearsall turned in an oral resignation on May 30, 2000 and a written resignation on May 31, 2000.\n \nPearsall said he talked to Hepler again on the night of May 30, 2000, but not again until at least June 5,\n2000.\n  \nIn his written resignation, Pearsall agreed to work a two-week notice.\n{126}\n     \nAs part of, or in lieu of, that notice, Pearsall agreed to help manage the inventory of the Charlotte\nbranch, which was to be conducted in conjunction with the acquisition of BPS by Sunbelt, during the week\nand weekend, following Memorial Day. Traditionally, James “Rocky” Busic was in charge of the inventory\nfor the scaffolding side of the Charlotte branch.\n    \nAlthough the May 2000 inventory was not a regularly\nscheduled inventory and Busic had scheduled vacation during that time, Busic approached Pearsall and asked\nto reschedule his vacation for the July 4, 2000 weekend so that he could participate in the inventory.\n  \nPearsall\ninsisted that Busic take his scheduled vacation and said to Busic “[W]hy do you care about this inventory?\nThey [Sunbelt] don’t care anything about you.”\n{127}\n     \nAt Pearsall’s insistence Busic took his vacation, only to return 8 days later on June 5, 2000, to find the\nbranch in a state of “chaotic disorder.” Pearsall did not help with the inventory as promised and left\ninexperienced BPS employees to do the inventory.\n  \nBusic was forced to re-do the inventory a few months\nlater, spending three days rather than the usual four hours doing the inventory because it had not been done\naccurately in May 2000.\n{128}\n     \nPearsall also incited the BPS employees, apparently in an effort to rally them to the H&E side, or any\nside other than BPS, by repeatedly disparaging Sunbelt to other BPS employees. Pearsall told BPS\nemployees, while he was still employed at BPS, that Sunbelt “was not a company you want to work for,”\nwere “dirt bags,” “didn’t have a good reputation about their people,” that the BPS employees might “want to\nfind another job,” that the branch would be run into the ground within “30 to 60 days,” and that Sunbelt “was\nbuying all the assets [of BPS] and not necessarily the people.”\n{129}\n     \nDefendants hired at least five BPS/Sunbelt employees for the H&E branch in Charlotte immediately\nbefore the date of Sunbelt’s acquisition; they solicited and tried to hire several more.\n  \nPearsall directed many\nof the “key” Charlotte BPS employees to leave BPS immediately.\n  \nWhile still a BPS branch manager and on\nsite at the BPS Charlotte branch, Pearsall offered jobs at H&E to two salesmen (Farris and Huntley), the\nservice manager (Muldoon) and the branch administrator (Dougherty), all of whom claim to have accepted\non the spot, and three of whom Pearsall immediately sent to work for H&E. Engquist and Hepler testified\nthat this very conduct would be improper.\n{130}\n     \nFarris and Muldoon, the top salesman of the entire BPS organization and the Charlotte branch manager\nrespectively, turned in their resignations on May 30, 2000.\n  \nPearsall directed Farris to leave the same day he\nresigned.\n  \nHe told Muldoon to leave on the morning of June 1, 2000, prior to Muldoon working a two-week\nnotice and the same day Sunbelt acquired BPS.\n{131}\n     \nLikewise, although Huntley’s resignation letter offered a notice period, Huntley never returned to BPS\nafter May 31, 2000.\n    \nInstead, he showed up for work at H&E on June 5, 2000, and immediately began\ncalling on BPS customers. Pearsall testified in his deposition that he told Huntley to make a clean break and\nleave immediately–a discussion Engquist admitted was improper, particularly for a manager who was also\ndeparting for the same competition.\n \n{132}\n     \nBruce Funderburgh was approached by Pearsall approximately 2 to 2 ½ weeks prior to the acquisition of\nBPS by Sunbelt.\n  \nThis solicitation was well before Pearsall claims to have called Hepler regarding a job at\nH&E (on May 27 or 28, 2000), and in fact coincides more logically with Ms. Kline’s visit to Charlotte to\nsecure a location for the Charlotte H&E branch in early May 2000.\n  \nIn that conversation, Pearsall told\nFunderburgh that he was going to start a new H&E branch and that several other BPS employees, including\nMuldoon, Dougherty, Frank Evans, and Ken Farris, would be going with Pearsall to H&E. The Court finds\nMr. Funderburgh’s testimony to be credible.\n \n{133}\n     \nAt trial and in his deposition, Hepler testified that he had no discussion with Pearsall about hiring any\nother BPS employees until Pearsall worked out his notice and came on board with H&E, despite the fact that\nPearsall did not come on board with H&E until at least June 5, 2000.\n  \nBy that time, at least four other BPS\nemployees had been recruited and put to work as H&E employees by Pearsall and Hepler.\n{134}\n     \nThe Court finds that, contrary to his testimony, Hepler knew of and was involved with Pearsall’s\nrecruitment of BPS employees.\n  \nHepler spoke to Farris on the day Farris resigned and was fully aware that\nPearsall was recruiting BPS employees at that time, which was long before Pearsall left BPS on June 5,\n2000.\n  \nSpecifically, the Court finds that on May 30, 2000, after instructing Farris to leave BPS immediately,\nPearsall instructed him to call Hepler.\n  \nFurthermore, Farris spoke to Hepler in Jacksonville at that time for\nthe purpose of organizing the start up of the Charlotte branch six days later.\n{135}\n     \nFurther undermining Hepler and Pearsall’s testimony concerning the timing of the opening of the\nCharlotte H&E branch and their recruitment efforts, Patrick Muldoon, the BPS service manager for\nCharlotte, was also involved in helping to solicit employees for H&E long before he left BPS.\n  \nMuldoon\nsolicited Rick Bailey, the BPS shop foreman at the time, well before the end of May 2000:\nQ: “You had been talking about H&E moving into the area with Mr. Bailey over a period of\nweeks prior to the time you left, hadn’t you?”\nA: “It may have been weeks because we knew about H&E coming to the area opening\nbranches.\n  \nIt may have been weeks before that, yes.”\n{136}\n     \n \nMuldoon told Bailey that Pearsall and several others would be starting a new H&E branch in Charlotte\nand that it was going to be a smaller operation but that “basically, everything would stay the same . . . [that\nthey] would be doing the same thing in a different place.”\n  \nMuldoon also suggested that Bailey go look at the\nH&E branch a week or so before he left.\n \n{137}\n     \nMuldoon also solicited Lennie Merrington, a master mechanic, on behalf of H&E.\n    \nMerrington came to\nwork at H&E on June 9, 2000, despite the fact that his official termination date from BPS was not until June\n19, 2000.\n{138}\n     \nLater, Muldoon, on his last day of work at BPS, solicited Ron Chambers, a road mechanic who worked\non customer owned machines, to come and work at H&E.\n    \nMuldoon asked Chambers for his phone number\nand told him that they were “going to try and keep . . . the A Team together.”\n  \nMuldoon subsequently called\nChambers at home, offered him a position at H&E, and told him that they were going to pick up two service\ntrucks for the Charlotte H&E branch.\n{139}\n     \nPearsall also, either directly or indirectly, solicited the employment of BPS road mechanics Milton\nTurner and Ron Chambers, and shop mechanics Reggie Gill and Bill Mann.\n{140}\n     \nPlaintiff called a number of Sunbelt BPS employees who testified, and demonstrated by the fact that they\nstayed on and gave Sunbelt an opportunity to compete for their talents, that the timing of the recruitment had\nsignificance.\n{141}\n     \nAll in all, when the smoke from Pearsall’s departure had cleared, at least nine of the BPS employees had\nleft and gone to H&E before the first week of Sunbelt’s ownership of BPS was over.\n  \nIf Pearsall had been\nsuccessful in employing each of the employees he solicited or who were solicited on his behalf, the AWP\nside of the Charlotte BPS branch would have lost more than 15 employees.\n{142}\n     \nThe Court finds that Pearsall used his position and influence over the employees of BPS and his\nknowledge as to their skills, salary and training to sow the seeds of fear and doubt with respect to Sunbelt and\nuse that fear and doubt to solicit them for the new H&E branch and interfere with their relationships with\nBPS and Sunbelt.\n  \nThe Court further finds that without Pearsall’s disparagement of Sunbelt and his insistence\nthat the employees leave immediately, before Sunbelt could come in and fairly compete and bargain for their\ncontinued employment, some, if not all, of the employees who left for H&E would have remained in the\nemploy of Sunbelt, at least for a sufficient period of time for Sunbelt to compete for their employment on a\nlevel playing field or assist in training their replacements.\n  \nTheir continued presence would have eliminated\nmany customer problems.\n{143}\n     \nFurther, without his “inside” position with respect to the employees, the Court doubts that Pearsall would\nhave been able, particularly without any increase in salary, and in the guise of a “lateral” move, to convince\nso many long-term employees to leave BPS.\n{144}\n     \nThe impact of the departure of these employees on the Charlotte branch was significant, as the remaining\nemployees were required to take on additional responsibilities and work long hours to try to compensate for\nthe departures.\n  \nThe branch was unable to get equipment out to customers on a timely basis because of the\nlack of trained personnel, including mechanics and drivers; equipment out on rent sat for prolonged periods\nafter it was off rent because of the lack of availability of truck drivers to pick up the equipment.\n{145}\n     \nCustomer complaints increased significantly.\n  \nSunbelt did not have a viable sales force in the field to\ncounter H&E’s sales effort in Charlotte.\n This situation exacerbated customer confusion.\n{146}\n     \nOnce Pearsall had taken a full complement of employees and information to start the H&E branch, he\nleft the BPS office in a state of chaos and disorder, without proper documentation, without a proper inventory\nhaving been conducted, and without enough information for the remaining BPS employees and new Sunbelt\nemployees to service and deal with BPS customers.\n  \nThese actions of defendants caused BPS/Sunbelt to lose\ncustomers. The Court finds his actions, and the actions of H&E and Hepler in their support, were intended to\nput the BPS branch in a state where it could not properly compete for either its employees or its customers in\nthe early days of the H&E Charlotte branch.\n \n{147}\n     \nHaving left the branch in a state of disorder, Pearsall and the other former BPS employees immediately\ntargeted BPS customers.\n \n{148}\n     \nFarris and Huntley called on, and solicited orders from, BPS customers within the first 48 hours of their\nresignations from BPS.\n  \nBoth acknowledged that they were put immediately back into their former BPS\nterritories by H&E, that they had no literature, equipment, or pricing information for H&E, but that they\nwere able to secure orders for H&E immediately.\n  \nHuntley immediately called on Universal Drywall, a BPS\ncustomer; Freeman Mechanical, a BPS customer; Davis Erecting, a BPS customer; Delta Electric, a BPS\ncustomer; and Drywall Carolina, a BPS customer.\n{149}\n     \nThe Court finds that much of Huntley’s testimony was not credible.\n  \nHis trial testimony was contradicted\nby his deposition testimony, and both were contradictory at times.\n \n{150}\n     \nFarris immediately went to BPS Charlotte’s largest job site–Corning in Midland, North Carolina, and\nbegan calling on customers of BPS at that site.\n  \nMr. Farris obtained orders from BPS customers, on behalf of\nH&E, as early as June 1, 2000, before the H&E branch was open. In fact, Kline’s June 2000 e-mail to\nBruckmann confirms that defendants’ expected Farris to switch over the Corning customers.\n{151}\n     \nFarris also acknowledged that he had no pricing or other H&E information when he went to call on BPS\ncustomers.\n  \nIn fact, Farris called on BPS customers on behalf of H&E \nwhile he was still employed by BPS\n.\n \nFarris testified that he began his employment with H&E on May 31, 2000, and he submitted his letter of\nresignation to BPS on May 31, 2000, but he also acknowledged that he solicited customers at the Corning\nsite on behalf of H&E on May 30, 2000.\n{152}\n     \nFurther, Farris’s acknowledgment of receipt of the H&E policy handbook is dated May 31, 2000 and is\nsigned by Brian Pearsall as Farris’s H&E supervisor, despite the fact that Pearsall was still employed by BPS\non May 31, 2000.\n{153}\n     \nFarris obtained orders from the following BPS customers within a week of H&E’s opening: Interstate\nElectric (order date 6/6/00); Rental Supply (order 6/7/00); Capital City Steel Erectors Supply (price quoted\nwas “off the seat of [his] pants); Gulf State Electric, Supply (order 6/6/00); Environmetrics (order 6/7/00);\nHoward Brothers Electric.\n  \nFarris’s relationships with these customers were developed while he was\nemployed at BPS.\n{154}\n     \nThe Court finds that many of these customers from which BPS lost business had long standing\nrelationships with BPS.\n  \nThese customers would have given Sunbelt the opportunity to compete fairly for\ntheir business with H&E, an opportunity that H&E’s actions may have prevented in some cases.\n{155}\n     \nH&E’s new Charlotte employees could not, at least in the beginning, have used the “Dodge” reports to\nfind and secure new customers for H&E.\n  \nThe new H&E branch did not have credit applications and related\npaperwork when it began taking rental contracts.\n  \nCredit information is an essential part of doing business\nwhen dealing with expensive equipment like the kind at issue here.\n  \nThe only way H&E could have done\nbusiness was in reliance on the BPS credit information known to the former BPS employees hired by H&E.\n{156}\n     \nTherefore, the Court finds that H&E used customer information brought to it by the BPS employees it\nbrought on board immediately—including pricing information, customer information, credit information and\ninformation related to prospective and upcoming jobs—in order to solicit and secure jobs.\n{157}\n     \nThe Court finds that there was sufficient evidence to show that BPS considered the compilation of its\ncustomer information, which took considerable time, money and effort to compile, to be confidential.\n \nFurther, the Court finds that BPS took reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of that information,\nincluding maintaining passwords on the computer system, not giving each employee a password, shredding\nof confidential documents, and requiring each employee to sign an employee handbook with a confidentiality\nprovision.\n \n{158}\n     \nFinally, the Court also finds that the BPS employees who left \nen masse\n and went to H&E had an\nopportunity to acquire and know the confidential information and to use it at H&E.\n \nOrlando\n{159}\n     \nThe Orlando Hi-Lift branch opened on or about May 22, 2000, with the following staff from BPS: a\nbranch manager (Wellington “Duke” Drennan); BPS’s complete AWP outside sales staff\n  \n(Jay Kiefer, Mark\nStuckie and Jeff Hansen); a shop foreman (Michael Waldrop); mechanics (Todd Chesser and Scott\nWaldrop); a credit manager (Patricia Uddo); a branch administrator (Brenda Drennan); and a driver (Henry\nGarver).\n  \nShortly thereafter, the H&E Orlando branch added an inside sales coordinator (Andrea Ussery) and\nanother driver (Donald Henderson).\n  \n{160}\n     \nAfter a conversation with Hepler at the 1999 national sales meeting in Dallas, Duke Drennan\n(“Drennan”), the BPS Orlando branch manager, told some of his employees that Hepler might start a\ncompany of his own and that this might be a possibility for future employment.\n  \nThe employees to whom\nDrennan made these comments—Jay Kiefer (“Kiefer”), Mark Stuckie (“Stuckie”), Jeff Hansen (“Hansen”),\nPatty Uddo (“Uddo”), Peter Casey (“Casey”), Brenda Drennan (“B.Drennan”), Steve Hicks (“Hicks”) and\nAndrea Ussery (“Ussery”)—all later left BPS to work for H&E.\n{161}\n     \nHepler called Drennan at the BPS Orlando branch in March 2000. Drennan testified that he likely\ninformed Kiefer, Stuckie, Hansen, Uddo, Casey and Hicks of this conversation with Hepler. Hepler’s\ntelephone records reflect an eight-minute telephone call to the BPS Orlando branch on March 29, 2000.\n{162}\n     \nDrennan resigned from BPS on April 29, 2000 and left BPS on May 4, 2000.\n   \nDrennan’s employment\noffer from Hepler included a salary of $105,000, higher than his salary at BPS, as well as a $25,000 signing\nbonus.\n{163}\n     \nHepler’s H&E expense records reflect meetings with Drennan in April 2000 to discuss H&E, including\nTampa and Orlando branch locations and operations. These records reflect such meetings prior to Drennan’s\nresignation from BPS.\n  \nFor example, Drennan, while still employed by BPS, again had dinner with Hepler on\nApril 13, 2000 at Christine’s restaurant in Orlando along with Delores Kline and Mike Quinn.\n  \nHepler,\nQuinn and Delores Kline were in Orlando to look at potential properties for an H&E facility in the area.\n{164}\n     \nAll of the employees that Drennan solicited on behalf of H&E in April, May or June of 2000 were BPS\nemployees. \n \n{165}\n     \nWhile still a BPS Orlando branch manager, Drennan did the following:\n(a) \n       \nIn April 2000, Drennan, after conferring with Hepler, invited BPS employees Kiefer, Stuckie,\nHansen, Uddo and Ussery to have dinner with him and Hepler.\n  \nDrennan met with these employees separately at\nBPS, informed them of his intent to leave BPS if Hepler offered him a job at H&E, and invited each individual to\nattend the dinner at the Orlando Ale House.\n(b) \n       \nDrennan testified that at this dinner Hepler discussed the prospect of H&E opening a facility in\nthe Orlando area.\n  \nHepler ended the dinner by saying he would further explore the possibility and it was agreed\nthat they would continue the discussion in the future.\n  \nOf course, Hepler testified that they did not discuss the\npossibility of an H&E Orlando branch at this dinner. Drennan’s testimony contradicts Hepler’s testimony about\nthis dinner.\n  \nThe Court finds that Hepler’s testimony is not credible and he used this meeting to recruit BPS\nemployees to H&E with Drennan’s assistance.\n \n(c)\n  \n      \nPrior to the Orlando Ale House dinner, Ussery never heard anyone at the BPS branch express a\ndesire to leave BPS.\n  \nHe testified: “[W]e all loved working there.”\n  \nThe pending sale of BPS was a subject of\ncuriosity, but not a great concern:\n  \n“We had already gone through a sale one time, and nothing changed.\n  \nIt was\njust curiosity.\n  \nEverybody was just curious.”\n \n(d)\n  \n      \nDrennan admits that he openly criticized BPS in conversations with his employees and discussed\nhis plans with regard to Rob Hepler.\n(e)\n  \n      \nDrennan, following the April 2000 meeting with Hepler, assisted BPS employees Kiefer, Stuckie,\nUddo, Hansen and Ussery in communicating with Hepler regarding employment with H&E and the details of\nsuch employment. Hepler authorized Drennan, prior to Drennan leaving BPS, to offer employment with H&E to\nBPS employees and set their H&E salaries.\n  \nDrennan did just that, discussing H&E employment with BPS\nemployees while still the BPS Orlando branch manager of. The salaries Drennan offered on behalf of H&E were\nconsistently higher than the salaries Drennan paid such employees at BPS.\n  \nDefendants, with the assistance of\nDrennan, recruited and hired 12 BPS employees required for H&E’s start up (17 total).\n \n(f)\n  \n       \nDrennan talked to Kiefer, who already had resigned from BPS, about setting up a boom for an\nH&E customer and contacting the necessary personnel to help place the boom on the job site for the customer.\n \nDrennan gave Kiefer the authority to get help with the boom and referred Kiefer to Mike Quinn.\n  \nThe boom was\non the customer’s job site before Drennan left BPS.\n \n(g)\n  \n      \nDrennan, upon being asked by one of his BPS employees if he would hire her boyfriend to come\nwork for H&E, told her that he could not approach any employees but it was all right if employees approached\nhim.\n  \nThe BPS employee in question subsequently approached Drennan at BPS, and Drennan offered him a job\nat H&E.\n   \nClearly, Drennan knew that recruiting for his employer’s competitor was wrong.\n \n{166}\n     \nDrennan took confidential business files of BPS with him to H&E, including BPS monthly goals, rental\nrevenue information, salary/wage reports and a spreadsheet reflecting average salaries, and returned those\nfiles only after the lawsuit was filed.\n{167}\n     \nNot only did Drennan take confidential files and solicit other BPS employees while he was employed at\nBPS, he also encouraged at least one employee to bring valuable, confidential BPS information and\ndocuments with him.\n \n{168}\n     \nIn late March 2000, Drennan solicited Rick Breinlinger (“Breinlinger”) at the BPS branch.\n  \nDrennan first\napproached Breinlinger at the BPS branch and told Breinlinger that he was moving to another company\nwhere he would be working with Hepler and wanted Breinlinger to come with him.\n  \nDrennan said that other\nBPS employees were also going with him and that Breinlinger was not to say anything to anybody.\n  \nDrennan\nsaid that he would get back to Breinlinger about the details, which he did.\n  \nHe called Breinlinger at home\nand invited Breinlinger to his house to discuss the details of the H&E offer.\n  \nBreinlinger met with Drennan at\nhis house on a Sunday afternoon, at which time they discussed the position, salary and vacation time H&E,\nthrough Drennan, was offering Breinlinger.\n  \nAt this meeting they also discussed the location of the H&E\nfacility and other BPS employees who Drennan had solicited from BPS.\n  \nDrennan asked about Breinlinger’s\nBPS service log book, which contained detailed information about customer contact information, how such\ncustomers conducted business, and repairs performed for customers.\n  \nHe told Breinlinger to bring the service\nlog book with him to H&E.\n  \nDrennan reiterated at this time the importance of keeping the matter quiet and\nnot discussing it with anyone.\n  \nDrennan ultimately retracted the H&E offer when Breinlinger refused to leave\nBPS without giving a two week notice.\n  \nDrennan admits he solicited Breinlinger to leave BPS to work for\nH&E.\n \n{169}\n     \nDefendants did not call Drennan as a witness to rebut or deny Breinlinger’s testimony.\n{170}\n     \nH&E salesmen in Orlando were not provided any guidance or parameters with regard to pricing on\nbehalf of H&E.\n  \nH&E Orlando did not even compile price lists until 2001.\n  \nPrior to that time, H&E salesmen\nwere expected to quote prices to customers based on “information in their head.”\n    \nDrennan has never\nspoken with Hepler or anyone else in Hi-Lift’s corporate office about pricing.\n  \nHe has always set the prices\nfor his branch.\n{171}\n     \nThe territories covered by H&E salesmen were territories that they had covered on behalf of BPS, and\nthey immediately called on the customers and job sites based on information acquired while employed by\nBPS.\n  \nFor example, as soon as Kiefer resigned from BPS, he called on R.C. Aluminum, a BPS customer at\nthe Hard Rock Café job site, a major project that he covered for BPS.\n  \nRegarding the order he received from\nR.C. Aluminum that first day, Kiefer testified, “I didn’t write it up at all.\n  \nI mean, I knew the account and\nknew R.C. Aluminum, the job.” He did not even ask for a credit application from R.C. Aluminum, despite\nH&E’s alleged policy of obtaining a credit application from every customer.\n  \nOn behalf of H&E, Kiefer\ncalled on every trailer on the Hard Rock job site, each of which he had called on for BPS.\n{172}\n     \nDrennan admits, and H&E business records show, that he has personally entertained and solicited former\nBPS Orlando customers on behalf of H&E.\n{173}\n     \nThe departure of Drennan and other BPS employees in such a short period of time left the BPS Orlando\nbranch understaffed, lacking experienced personnel, unable to service customers as it had prior to H&E’s\nraid on the branch, and caused the branch to lose considerable business from longstanding customers.\nFurther, without Kiefer, Stuckie and Hansen, its entire AWP sales force, the branch’s business slowed\nconsiderably, and many of its high volume customers began calling BPS equipment off rent and stopped\nrenting equipment from BPS.\n   \nTampa-Fort Myers\n{174}\n     \nPrior to May 2000, H&E did not have a presence in the Tampa-Fort Myers market.\n    \nThe H&E branches\nestablished in Tampa-Fort Myers were greenfields.\n \n{175}\n     \nThe Tampa and Fort Myers Hi-Lift branches opened on or before May 8, 2000 and June 5, 2000,\nrespectively, and were staffed with the following BPS personnel: a branch manager (Beare Jones); sales reps\n(John Andrachak, John Breadmore, Wade Bercaw, Scott Strawn, Jason Jones and Brian Ditoro); a service\nmanager (Doug Ashmore); inside sales coordinator (Bonnie Quasnick); drivers (James George, Jonathan\nBrunelle, and Charles Heim); an officer manager (Belinda Harrison); a shop foreman (Ronald Good); field\nmechanics (Timothy Poole, Billy Marshall, and John Clark); an erector superintendent (Nicholas Cooper); a\nshop mechanic (John Taylor);\n  \nerector foremen (Leon Beebe, Scott Price, and Mark Roesler); and erectors\n(Larry Brown, Charles Cansdale, and Eric Ruzycki).\n  \nEach of these employees were hired from BPS.\n{176}\n     \nThe market for trained and experienced drivers, mechanics and salesmen in Fort Myers and Tampa in\n2000 was very tight. Trained and experienced employees were then difficult to locate in these markets.\n{177}\n     \nBPS had existing branches in Tampa and Fort Myers in January 2000.\n  \nBPS had opened up the Tampa\nbranch in or about 1996 as a greenfield.\n  \nHepler testified about the steps undertaken at the time to create that\ngreenfield.\n  \nNone of those steps were repeated when H&E opened up its Tampa branch in May 2000.\n \nInstead of placing advertisements in the newspaper for employees, H&E used secret meetings with Hepler,\nbranch manager Beare Jones and service manager Doug Ashmore to solicit employees.\n  \nInstead of building\nslowly as business warranted, H&E opened with a full complement of employees.\n{178}\n     \nJones claims that when he learned of Defendant Hepler’s December resignation he was “shocked” by the\nnews, that it “stopped [his] heart,” and that, despite the fact that Hepler was like a brother to him, he did not\nspeak to him at all for 60-90 days after Hepler departed.\n \n{179}\n     \nThe evidence shows that contrary to his sworn testimony, Jones spoke with Hepler repeatedly throughout\nthe time period prior to Hepler leaving BPS for H&E, including three times on January 3, 2000, a thirteen\nminute conversation on January 13, two conversations on January 18 (4 and 6 minutes respectively), an\neleven minute call on February 17, three calls on February 21, two calls on March 29 (including a seven\nminute call), an April 4 call for twelve minutes, a thirty-five minute call on April 11 and three calls on April\n12. For this and other reasons stated below, the Court does not find Jones’s testimony credible and notes that\nhe did not testify at trial.\n  \nJones, Hepler and Hepler’s father had been close friends and business associates\nfor decades.\n{180}\n     \nOn February 22, 2000, a meeting occurred in Fort Myers attended by Hepler, Jones and the BPS sales\nstaff in Fort Myers and Tampa.\n  \nH&E’s business records reflect that the purpose of the meeting was to\n“discuss H&E employment offer with Jones and sales staff.”\n  \nHepler submitted that receipt for his breakfast\nto his employer and was reimbursed for the expenditure as a proper business expense.\n  \nMoreover, Hepler’s\nattempt to excuse the clear statements on the H&E expense report for this meeting by laying blame on his\nsecretary is not credible.\n  \nMs. Parnell’s testimony is clear that she always tried to be accurate, took the\ninformation that was given to her by Hepler to place on the report, did not add her own musings, and had no\nreason to believe that the information was inaccurate. Hepler also admitted that he never called anyone in\nBaton Rouge and told them anything was inaccurate or needed to be changed in the report.\n{181}\n     \nJones admitted that he invited BPS employees to attend the meeting with Hepler on February 22, 2000.\n \nFormer BPS employees Wade Bercaw, Scott Strawn, John Andrachak and John Breadmore all met at this\nearly morning breakfast meeting in Fort Myers.\n  \nTheir claim that it was a casual, non-business breakfast\namong old friends is not credible. Kevin White, branch manager of Sunbelt in Fort Myers, testified that\nBercaw stayed with him in Fort Myers the previous night and explicitly told him that he would be meeting\nwith Jones, Hepler, Andrachak, Breadmore and Strawn the next day about starting a new business in\nFlorida.\n  \nWhite was credible, and his testimony is confirmed by H&E’s business records.\n  \nHis testimony is\nalso confirmed, in part, by Bercaw, who testified that he knew the night before the meeting that Hepler,\nJones, Andrachak and Strawn would be there and that it would be held at the Shoney’s.\n  \nWhite also testified\nthat in a later conversation he was told by Bercaw that he was offered a job by Hepler at that breakfast.\n \nWhite’s testimony is also confirmed by the fact that Bercaw telephoned him some months later, after\nlearning that White had disclosed this meeting to Sunbelt’s CFO, to express his displeasure with the fact that\nhe had disclosed this clandestine meeting.\n     \nThe Court finds White’s testimony credible.\n  \nBercaw’s\ntestimony, denying that the purpose of the meeting was for employment, is not credible.\n{182}\n     \nThe testimony of Hepler and Jones regarding this February 22 meeting is inconsistent in significant\nrespects.\n  \nHepler testified several times that he knew nothing about the fact that others would attend this\nbreakfast meeting until the morning when Jones picked him up.\n   \nJones testified, however, that he discussed\nhaving these people attend when Hepler first called him to tell him he would be traveling to Fort Myers,\nseveral days before the breakfast meeting occurred.\n  \nHepler and Jones are not credible in their denials as to\nthe purpose of the meeting.\n  \nHepler recruited Jones to H&E, and then, with Jones’s assistance while Jones\nwas still a BPS employee, readily recruited other BPS employees for H&E.\n{183}\n     \nJones had knowledge of Hepler’s efforts to start new branches in Tampa and Fort Myers for H&E and\nwas an active participant in a plan to hire BPS employees to go to H&E in Tampa and Fort Myers and to\nstart-up the new branches.\n{184}\n     \nIn the span of thirty days, Jones, Bonnie Quasnick (the Tampa inside sales coordinator) and Hepler\nsolicited and hired 25 experienced BPS employees from BPS’s Tampa and Fort Myers branches; over 90\npercent of the H&E work force came from the Tampa and Fort Myers BPS branches.\n  \nJones testified that as\nthe H&E branch manager, he would have a say in the employees and structure of the branch and admitted\nthat outside sales persons, inside sales persons and the service manager are essential to a new branch. Jones\nreviewed these employees while at BPS, was knowledgeable of their BPS salaries and knew these employees\nto be good performers These employees were hired for similar positions at H&E and offered a salary increase\nto leave BPS.\n  \nAs of January 1, 2001, twenty-six of H&E’s 35 employees in Tampa/Fort Myers were former\nBPS employees.\n{185}\n     \nJones’s denials of knowledge and involvement in the defendants’ plan to recruit employees \nen masse\nfrom BPS to H&E and switch customers are not credible.\n \n(a)\n        \nEvidence shows that at the time Jones filled out his application for employment with H&E he\nlisted the position as branch manager for Tampa \nand\n Fort Myers and he also indicated that he would \nnot\n relocate\nfrom Fort Myers.\n(b)\n        \nJones also claimed to have been dissatisfied with BPS after Hepler left.\n  \nNevertheless, H&E gave\nhim a $14,000 salary increase and a $25,000 sign-on bonus to leave BPS to go to work for H&E.\n \n(c)\n        \nJones claims that at the time he resigned there was no BPS plan to open a Fort Myers branch,\nonly a Tampa branch.\n  \nIn addition to the admission on his H&E application, Jones hired two employees,\nAndrachak and Breadmore from the BPS Fort Myers branch—both of whom indicated in their H&E\nemployment application that they would not relocate from Fort Myers.\n(d)\n        \nJones testified that he had no involvement in the location of the H&E branch in Tampa.\n   \nKline\nalso denied having spoken with Jones when he went to Tampa in February 2000.\n  \nEvidence shows, however, that\nJones was in contact with Defendant Kline right before Kline’ February 27 trip to Tampa and signed a letter of\nintent for the rental of property for the H&E Hi-Lift branch.\n(e)\n        \nWhile still a BPS employee, Jones also met with Hepler on April 26, 2000, to discuss “Tampa\noperations,” and he met with Hepler on May 17, after he had resigned, to finalize the recruitments of Breadmore,\nAndrachak and Quasnick.\n(f)\n         \nMoreover, defendants’ action in ordering AWP equipment for Tampa confirms the prearranged\nplan.\n  \nOn March 31, 2000, defendants placed an order for 99 units for Tampa with JLG. As confirmed by the\nevents in almost each location, defendants would not have placed such an order without the branch manager\n(Jones) in place.\n{186}\n     \nBPS employees in Tampa were also recruited by Doug Ashmore, the former BPS service manager under\nJones.\n  \nBilly Marshall, Ron Good and Timothy Poole, all experienced\n  \nservice mechanics, worked under\nAshmore.\n  \nAshmore testified that it was important to the business to have experienced mechanics.\n  \nAll three\nof these mechanics were hired the same day by H&E; Good and Poole left BPS without notice in the early\nmorning hours on June 1.\n  \nSunbelt did not have the opportunity to speak with these employees about\ncontinued employment at the branch.\n{187}\n     \nAshmore denied, under oath, that he solicited any employees to leave BPS for H&E while employed at\nBPS.\n   \nBilly Dobbs, who Ashmore claims is a trusted friend and worked under Ashmore, testified that\nAshmore solicited him as part of the “chosen few” for H&E while Ashmore was still with BPS.\n  \nDobbs also\ntestified that the mechanics agreed that they would leave early in the morning, Monday, June 1, without\nnotice.\n  \nLibby Oleson, an assistant to the inside sales coordinator and Quasnick, also testified that she had\nconversations with Ashmore during the time he was employed by BPS.\n  \nThese conversations show that he\nhad been coordinating with Jones regarding the solicitation of BPS employees for the new H&E branch.\n \n{188}\n     \nThe testimony of other former BPS employees in Tampa and Fort Myers, now H&E employees, is not\ncredible, and further supports a finding that the defections were planned and orchestrated while the current\nH&E employees were still BPS employees.\n(a)\n        \nAndrachak and Breadmore, former BPS sales representatives from the BPS Fort Myers branch,\nand now H&E employees, testified that they resigned from BPS without a job offer from defendants.\n  \nBreadmore\nwas the sole breadwinner for the family, and he and his wife required insurance through his work.\n  \nBoth testified\nthat, although they did not know the purpose of their trip to Tampa, they traveled two and half hours from Fort\nMyers to Tampa to meet with Jones and Hepler and while in Tampa they were offered a job, which they\naccepted.\n  \nAt the time they accepted the offer, they supposedly did not know anything about the job or where it\nwould be located, even though they were not willing to move from Fort Myers.\n  \nFinally, although testifying that\nwhen they left BPS they did not have an offer in hand, their employment applications with H&E state that the\nreason they left BPS was for a “new” or “better” job.\n(b)\n        \nAndrachak’s employment termination date with BPS was May 26, yet Andrachak submitted an\nexpense report to H&E for reimbursement of expenses incurred beginning May 15.\n \n(c)\n        \nSimilarly, Quasnick’s last day of work at BPS was May 22, 2000 (with a termination date of June\n2), yet she signed her both her W-4 and H&E employment application on May 19, 2000.\n  \nThe May 19 date on\nher employment application was crossed out and changed to May 22.\n  \nQuasnick testified that she did not start at\nH&E until May 23, 2000.\n  \nShe also testified that when she spoke with Hepler and Jones at dinner prior to her\nresigning, there was no discussion of Strawn and Bercaw.\n    \nJones testified that he told Quasnick at that dinner\nthat he had been speaking with Strawn and Andrachak.\n      \n(d)\n        \nAshmore filled out his H&E application for employment on May 22 and signed his H&E\nemployee handbook acknowledgment on May 25.\n  \nAshmore, however, continued working at BPS until two days\nafter Jude Yimin of Sunbelt had arrived at the branch, all the time soliciting BPS employees to leave the branch\nfor H&E.\n \n{189}\n     \nAfter successfully bringing over the BPS employees, defendants immediately began building a revenue\nstream by targeting longstanding customers of BPS in Tampa and Fort Myers and “switching” them over to\nH&E.\n  \nEvidence shows, and Jones admits, that efforts were made by H&E to switch customers from BPS to\nH&E almost immediately following the departure of the BPS employees to H&E\n.\n  \nThe evidence also shows\nthat BPS had longstanding customers in Fort Myers (customers of BPS as early as 1994 and 1995 when\nWhite was employed at BPS) and Tampa and that relationships between sales representatives with customers\nwas fostered by BPS.\n    \nIn May and June 2000, the BPS branches experienced a decline in AWP lease\ncontracts while H&E experienced a concurrent rise in contracts with these same customers.\n{190}\n     \nSubstantial evidence shows that pricing and customer contact information at the branches was\nconfidential information, although customers themselves did not treat pricing as confidential.\n  \nWhite testified\nthat he understood that the BPS branch had special or preferred pricing for customers, based on a number of\nfactors, including volume of business given by that customer, and that this information was confidential\nwhen he was an outside salesman at the BPS Fort Myers branch under Jones in 1994-95.\n  \nBercaw admitted\nto using special pricing at BPS, which was exclusive for the customer and maintained for at least six\nmonths.\n  \nIn addition, the BPS employees who went to H&E signed acknowledgments of the BPS, and later\nthe H&E handbooks, which contained confidentiality sections.\n \n{191}\n     \nIn 2000, BPS was the largest rental company in Fort Myers.\n  \nBy taking BPS employees and leaving the\nBPS branch in disarray, H&E was able to rapidly gain market share in the Fort Myers’ market and BPS lost\nmarket share in Tampa at a fast rate.\n{192}\n     \nThe massive departure of employees from BPS to H&E in such a short period of time left the BPS (now\nSunbelt) branches in Fort Myers and Tampa in a total state of disarray. The H&E employees involved in the\nsolicitation of these employees were indifferent to the impact of their actions on the BPS branches.\n \n{193}\n     \nThe evidence shows that at the time that H&E was contacting BPS customers, BPS was not in a position\nto compete in the marketplace.\n  \nSalesmen are vital to the business and act as the company representative with\nthe customer. With the mass exodus of employees from the BPS Fort Myers and Tampa branches, BPS did\nnot have experienced outside sales representatives who knew the customer base and contacts to call on\ncustomers and present the facts concerning the acquisition.\n  \nAt the same time, however, H&E had their sales\nforce (the former BPS sales team) in the field immediately calling on customers.\n{194}\n     \nDefendants’ conduct was undertaken for the purpose of harming BPS/Sunbelt and gaining a competitive\nadvantage over Sunbelt in the Tampa/Fort Myers markets.\n  \nIn summary, the Court finds the following facts:\n(a)\n        \nOver 90 percent of the H&E employees in Tampa and Fort Myers came from BPS and were hired\nin a thirty-day period, leaving the BPS branches with virtually no employees.\n  \nGiven Hepler’s experience and\npast involvement in starting up a greenfield branch in Tampa and his knowledge of BPS personnel\nvulnerabilities, Hepler knew that defendants’ actions would have a debilitating effect on the Sunbelt’s ability to\ncompete.\n(b)\n        \nHepler arranged a meeting in February 2000 for the purpose of discussing the opening of\nbranches in Tampa and Fort Myers\n   \nThis meeting was attended by the same BPS employees who became the\nfirst employees of H&E.\n  \nDefendants’ and their witnesses’ denials that the meeting was for the purpose of\nrecruitment are not credible.\n   \n(c)\n        \nThe speed by which H&E established itself in Fort Myers and Tampa, a market in which BPS had\nsignificant market share, demonstrates that H&E’s actions were calculated as part of a plan.\n  \nBy year-end 2000,\nH&E had profitable branches in Tampa and Fort Myers.\n \n(d)\n        \nJust as Sunbelt was undertaking efforts to recover in Fort Myers by hiring Kevin White as the\nbranch manager, Jones made a threatening comment to him to discourage his taking a job with BPS.\n  \nHepler\ntelephoned White to offer him a position in Texas.\n  \nWhite had not spoken with Hepler in six years and had not\nbeen talking with him about a position in Texas.\n  \nIn fact, White had had no experience in Texas.\n  \nThe only\napparent reason for offering him a job was to keep experienced employees from going to work for Sunbelt in\nFort Myers.\n \n(e)\n        \nJones denied that he did anything intentional to harm Sunbelt.\n  \nHe testified that proof of his\ncontention was that he had not gone after ICM, the largest industrial customer of BPS in Tampa and a customer\nthat Bercaw described as having a verbal, exclusive partnership with BPS/Sunbelt.\n  \nIn fact, not more than a week\nafter Bercaw started at H&E, he was calling on ICM trying to obtain their business with the full knowledge and\nsupport of Jones.\n  \nWhen shown his deposition testimony at trial, Bercaw reluctantly admitted that he was trying\nto establish the same type of verbal, exclusive partnership with ICM that BPS/Sunbelt enjoyed.\n  \nContrary to his\nsworn testimony, Jones personally went after ICM’s business; he just wasn’t successful in his efforts.\n \n{195}\n     \nAs a direct and proximate result of defendants’ actions, the BPS/Sunbelt branches in Tampa and Fort\nMyers were left in a debilitated state.\n \n(a)\n        \nExperienced employees in the branches, such as Andrachak (outside sales), Breadmore (outside\nsales), Strawn (outside sales), Bercaw (outside sales), Jason Jones (inside sales), Bonnie Quasnick (inside sales),\nBrian Ditoro (inside sales), Doug Ashmore (service mechanic), Ron Good (mechanic) and Tim Poole\n(mechanic), were gone to H&E within days of each other.\n(b)\n        \nIn Fort Myers, the only remaining outside salesman, Tim Kennedy, was moved to the branch\nmanager position, leaving no outside sales staff until the branch hired Scott Williams, who had no experience\nwith AWP rentals, and Frank Hight, who was later terminated for poor performance.\n  \n(c)\n        \nIn Tampa, the only remaining AWP outside salesman, Dennis Carpenter, had only recently\nmoved into that position from his prior position as a driver, and he had no AWP sales experience.\n  \nBPS/Sunbelt\nfilled the inside sales/dispatch position in Fort Myers with a person who sold copiers and had no AWP\nexperience.\n(d)\n        \nDrivers and mechanics were hired with no AWP experience.\n \n(e) \n       \nAs Billy Dobbs testified, positions were filled with just “warm” bodies, sometimes by family\nmembers who had no training or experience with AWP’s.\n  \nLibby Oleson moved into the inside sales coordinator\nposition, to replace Quasnick, although at the time Ms. Oleson had no experience in crucial aspects of the job\nsuch as setting prices and giving advice regarding the type of AWP equipment best suited to a customer’s job.\nJeff Brown, who was hired in July 2000 to act as an AWP outside salesman in Tampa, could not take on his\nsales responsibilities for the first several months because he had to assume other responsibilities—such as\nassisting Ms. Oleson with the inside sales function, handling field service problems and advising customers on\nrental needs—caused by the rapid departures of BPS employees for the H&E branches.\n \n(f)\n  \n       \nIt took the Sunbelt Tampa branch two and a half years to rebuild its sales staff with experienced\nsales people.\n{196}\n     \nAs a direct and proximate result of the massive departure of BPS employees to H&E in May 2000, the\nFort Myers and Tampa branches experienced significant problems with the operation of its business that\ncaused it to lose customers.\n \n(a)\n        \nResponse time for servicing equipment in the field increased from a matter of hours before the\ndepartures to sometimes days.\n  \nSimilar difficulties were encountered in Tampa.\n \n(b)\n        \nAWP equipment was not serviced or timely delivered, and customers called in to order\nequipment off rent when the jobs had not been completed.\n(c)\n        \nAWP equipment in Fort Myers could not be located for months.\n \n(d)\n        \nDue to the absence of drivers, equipment was not picked up in a timely manner in Tampa,\ncausing additional customer complaints and loss of business.\n  \n(e)\n        \nEmployees in the BPS/Sunbelt branch in Tampa worked long shifts, sometimes 14 to 15 hour\ndays, to keep the branch open.\nDallas\n{197}\n     \nAs of the beginning of 2000, Defendant H&E did not have a branch in Dallas, Texas that specialized in\nthe sale or rental of equipment.\n  \nIn establishing the budget for the Dallas branch, H&E employees treated it\nas a greenfield.\n{198}\n     \nThe Dallas Hi-Lift branch opened no later than March 20, 2000 and, within two days of the opening, had\nthe following staff from BPS:\n  \na branch manager (Abe Farrington), a service manager (Jeff Billups), outside\nsales reps (Steve Matthews and Ken Moon), mechanics (Tim Green and Tony Herriage) and a driver (Darrell\nHerriage).\n  \nWithin two weeks, H&E added another BPS mechanic (Allen Green) and in the next two months,\nanother BPS mechanic (Curtis Billups) and a BPS driver (Chris Brown).\n{199}\n     \nChristensen, a senior member of the BPS management team, worked out of the Dallas branch and\nworked closely with Abe Farrington (“Farrington”), who in 1999 became the BPS Dallas branch manager.\n \nChristensen left his employment with BPS on January 14, 2000.\n{200}\n     \nIn January 2000, BPS had many experienced and trained employees in the key positions in its Dallas\nbranch.\n  \nFarrington had been employed by BPS since December 1994 and had been the branch manager\nsince early 1999.\n  \nFarrington oversaw the other employees of the branch. \n \n \nJeffrey Billups had been\nemployed at BPS since May 1996.\n  \nSteve Matthews, an outside AWP sales representative, and Ken Moon,\nthe outside AWP sales representative for industrial accounts, had been employed by BPS since April 1997\nand January 1999, respectively.\n  \nThomas Green, Allen Green and Tony Herriage were trained AWP\nmechanics that had been employed at BPS since May 1997, October 1996 and April 1997, respectively.\n \nDarrell Herriage, an experienced AWP driver, had been employed at BPS since May 1997.\n  \nEach of these\nBPS employees was solicited by Christensen or Farrington and left BPS for employment at H&E in March or\nApril 2000.\n{201}\n     \nIn a span of 35 days, all of these BPS employees were on the payrolls at H&E.\n  \nWith one exception, each\nBPS employee was offered more money to go from BPS to H&E.\n  \nFor example, Farrington, who accepted\nemployment with H&E no later than March 4, received a $5,000 increase to join H&E as its Dallas branch\nmanager.\n  \nThe fact that H&E had to pay more for these employees to go to H&E belies defendants’\ncontention that these employees left out of concern over their future employment at BPS.\n  \nIndeed, Matthews\ntestified that he was satisfied with his job at BPS. All of these BPS employees were placed in positions at\nH&E that were similar to those they held at BPS.\n{202}\n     \nChristensen also attempted to recruit other BPS employees who did not leave BPS for H&E.\n  \nFor\nexample, Christensen attempted to create a suspended scaffolding department by recruiting Monty Huffman\nof BPS to join H&E.\n  \nChristensen intended Huffman to then recruit the two other employees that worked\nunder him at BPS, Robert Landry and Larry Sible.\n  \nHuffman, Landry, nor Sible left BPS for H&E.\n  \nH&E did\nnot thereafter, independently, develop a suspended scaffolding business because, as Christensen testified,\nMr. Huffman declined his offer and stayed with BPS/Sunbelt.\n  \nThe team of Christensen and Farrington\nsolicited and hired other BPS employees to join H&E during the period of April through September 2000.\n \nDuring that period, they hired six additional BPS employees for the new H&E Branch.\n \n{203}\n     \nHepler and Christensen had conferred with respect to planning a new venture.\n  \nFor example, following\nHepler’s trip to meet with Rentokil personnel in the United Kingdom in August 1999, the National Sales\nMeeting occurred for BPS.\n  \nChristensen and Hepler attended this meeting.\n  \nDuring a break at this meeting,\nChristensen and Hepler took Linda Gomez, an outside AWP salesperson, to the side and asked her about the\nlargest projects going on in the Dallas market and for her thoughts on where to locate a new branch.\n  \nAt the\ntime, Hepler was aware that Rentokil was putting BPS up for sale and BPS was not opening a new branch in\nDallas.\n  \nHepler’s comment about a new branch could only relate to a new business venture and one about\nwhich Christensen knew.\n{204}\n     \nAt the same time Hepler and Kline were taking steps to market their new company to prospective\ninvestors and meeting with Bruce Bruckmann, John Engquist and Gary Bagley, operations in the Dallas\nbranch began to suffer, providing some circumstantial evidence that attention was diverted from operating\nthe business to the development of a new company.\n  \nThese operational problems increased in December\n1999.\n \n{205}\n     \n \nHepler announced his resignation to BPS employees on December 1, 1999 and continued his\nemployment with BPS until December 14, 1999.\n  \nIn his testimony, Christensen attempted to minimize his\ncontacts with Hepler, but telephone records show that Christensen called BPS headquarters in Jacksonville\nand had lengthy conversations during this period in which Hepler was still employed at BPS.\n \n \nBeginning on\nDecember 15 (after Hepler left BPS), Christensen directed his calls to Hepler’s cell phone, calling him on\nnumerous occasions leading up to Christensen’s termination of his employment with BPS.\n  \nTelephone\nrecords also show that at the same time Christensen was calling the Jacksonville headquarters following\nHepler’s announced resignation, he also made calls to Farrington and Quinn.\n{206}\n     \nHepler met with Christensen on December 16, 1999 in Dallas, Texas with John Engquist, purportedly to\ndiscuss his employment with H&E.\n  \nChristensen received a $20,000 salary increase to $125,000 to join H&E\nand a $25,000 sign-on bonus.\n  \nTelephone records show that after this meeting, Christensen, Hepler and\nQuinn had numerous telephone calls with each other and that Christensen continued to call the BPS branch in\nDallas. Again, Christensen in his testimony attempted to minimize these contacts.\n   \nTelephone records show\nat least 18 calls between Hepler and Christensen during the period of December 15 to January 14, the date\nChristensen left his employment with BPS.\n{207}\n     \nOn January 11, 2000, prior to his January 14 termination date, Christensen telephoned Delores Kline and\nthen began working with her to identify suitable properties in Dallas for the new Hi-Lift branch.\n  \nThese\nefforts led to Defendant Kline signing a letter of intent for the rental of property in Dallas on February 11,\n2000.\n{208}\n     \nNo later than January 18, 2000, Defendant Hepler had directed Christensen to begin soliciting\nexperienced BPS employees for the new Hi-Lift branch in Dallas.\n  \nIt was “challenging” to find skilled\nemployees in the Dallas marketplace.\n  \nChristensen quickly looked to the BPS Dallas branch for these\nemployees.\n  \nChristensen and Farrington had access to confidential salary information for employees in the\nBPS Dallas branch.\n{209}\n     \nChristensen never obtained the services of headhunters or placed advertisements in newspapers, but\ninstead used BPS as his primary source for employees.\n  \nOn several occasions in February and March 2000,\nChristensen met with groups of BPS employees for lunch and dinner recruitment meetings.\n   \nOne such\nmeeting was attended by six BPS employees. Another lunch was attended by three of BPS’s outside sales\npersonnel.\n  \nNo persons other than these BPS employees and Christensen were invited or attended these\nexclusive meetings.\n  \nThe exclusive nature of these group recruitment efforts strongly supports the finding\nthat these meetings were not open to the general public but were part of a plan to seek mass departures of\nemployees from BPS.\n  \nChristensen interviewed no “candidates,” other than Farrington, for the Dallas branch\nmanager slot.\n  \nThrough Christensen and Farrington, defendants recruited and hired nine key BPS employees\nin Dallas, including its branch manager, service manager, several mechanics and two of its outside salesmen.\n \nDuring at least at one of these meetings, Christensen expressed his negative view of Rentokil’s ownership of\nBPS.\n   \nAll of this conduct is outside the norm of recruitment effort in this industry.\n{210}\n     \nPricing appeared to have more significance in the Texas market than in other BPS markets.\n  \nIn January\n2000, BPS had customers with whom it had longstanding relationships, including Potter Concrete, Mills\nElectrical, Barnsco, Term Sheetmetal, Walker Engineering, Oak Cliff Glass and Electric, Drywall Interiors,\nHaley Greer, North Star Fire Protection and Ram Steel.\n  \nPrior to that time, BPS personnel, including\nChristensen and Farrington, made presentations to BPS customers to establish special relationships whereby\npreferential pricing would be provided to these customers and, in return, the customer would provide 100\npercent of its business to BPS.\n  \nOne example of such a presentation was that made to Mills Electric.\n   \nThese\npresentations led to the formation of a “gentleman’s agreement” between the customer and BPS.\n  \nBPS had\nevery expectation that based on these agreements that it would continue to do business with these customers\nin the future.\n  \nAmong the customers for which these “gentleman’s agreements” were established was Mills\nElectric and Ram Steel, both of which were in the top five customers for the BPS branch in rental volume in\n1999.\n{211}\n     \nThe preferential pricing set by BPS for these customers was considered confidential at BPS. Customer\ncontact information was also considered confidential at the BPS branch and gave BPS a competitive\nadvantage over the competition. Christensen told Linda Gomez on various occasions that the pricing was to\nbe hand delivered to insure that the customers understood that the pricing was to be held in confidence. Linda\nGomez testified that in her experience customers honored that request and did not share this preferential\npricing with BPS competitors under this “gentleman’s agreement.”\n  \nPreferential pricing remained in place for\na year and then was reviewed to determine whether it should be adjusted.\n  \nGomez testified that the special\npricing gave BPS a competitive advantage over the competition.\n  \nChristensen admitted that he would not\nshare any information with a competitor and would not disclose BPS customer information so that it loses its\nconfidentiality and Farrington admitted that he encouraged sales representatives not to disclose pricing to the\ncompetition.\n  \nChristensen, Farrington and Matthews each acknowledged their receipt of the BPS handbook\nwhich contained the confidentiality section.\n \n{212}\n     \nThe Court finds Ms. Gomez’s testimony to be credible.\n  \nThe Court also notes that Christensen and\nFarrington did not testify at trial to rebut plaintiff’s evidence.\n{213}\n     \nEvidence shows that the defendants engaged in improper conduct intended to gain unfair advantage over\nBPS.\n  \nAfter Farrington and other BPS employees left for H&E, BPS discovered confidential information\nmissing from the branch.\n  \nFarrington maintained a binder of preferential pricing in his office.\n  \nFollowing his\ndeparture, that binder could not be located. Matthews produced in discovery customer contact information\nthat he took with him from BPS—despite being told by Christensen not to take any BPS documents with\nhim.\n  \nMatthews left binders containing only blank pieces of paper when he was required to leave information\nconcerning customer contacts and new job starts.\n  \nCustomer profiles maintained by Gloria Silva could not be\nlocated at BPS within a week after she left BPS for H&E.\n  \nIn addition, Matthews’ cell phone, paid for by\nBPS, was programmed to forward incoming calls to him when employed at H&E.\n  \nThe cell phone could not\nbe disabled because the phone had been locked out and the access code was unknown.\n{214}\n     \nMathews resigned from BPS without giving any notice on March 20 and joined a sales meeting with\nFarrington at H&E that day.\n  \nMatthews also that day called on BPS customers, including Drywall Interiors,\nand admitted that he had no pricing information from H&E. Christensen called on Mills Electric and Haley\nGreer after the H&E branch opened, and Matthews immediately sought after other BPS customers, such as\nOak Cliff Glass.\n{215}\n     \nFollowing the departures of Farrington and the other BPS employees to H&E in March 2000, longtime\ncustomers of BPS, including Potter Concrete, Ram Steel, Mills Electric, Cherry Paint, Gorman & Associates,\nWilliams Insulation, and Oak Cliff Glass, stopped doing business with BPS and instead placed their AWP\nrental orders with H&E.\n  \nThe speed at which H&E switched long time customers of BPS to H&E is shown\nby the decline in contracts with Oak Cliff Mirror & Glass, Potter Concrete and Williams Insulation in March\nand April 2000 and the concurrent rise in contracts with those customers at H&E.\n  \nThe evidence shows that\nBPS had “gentleman’s agreements” with these customers and reasonable expectations of continuing to do\nbusiness with these customers prior to defendants’ solicitation of the BPS employees to H&E and related\nconduct.\n  \nIndeed many of the BPS customers that were lost to H&E were customers with whom Linda\nGomez, not Mathews or Moon, had established relationships belying the suggestions that customers simply\nfollowed the sales representatives to H&E.\n{216}\n     \nThe rapid departures of Farrington, Billups and the other BPS employees to H&E’s Hi-Lift branch in\nDallas had a debilitating effect on the BPS branch in Dallas, including the loss of longstanding customers.\nWith the departure of Farrington, Matthews and Moon, the outside AWP sales presence was reduced to one\nexperienced and trained AWP salesperson, Ms. Gomez.\n  \nMr. Lane, an outside AWP salesman, had to assume\nduties as the new branch manager.\n  \nBesides Gomez, the only other AWP outside salesman was Scott\nDouglas, an apprentice with little experience.\n  \nEquipment was not serviced and delivered in a timely manner,\nleading to customer dissatisfaction.\n  \nAs a result of the defendants’ conduct, some longtime customers of the\nBPS Dallas branch stopped placing orders with BPS/Sunbelt.\n{217}\n     \nWhile BPS business was suffering, the Dallas Hi-Lift branch grew rapidly.\n  \nIt was profitable in 2000.\nChristensen and Farrington received bonuses for their performance in 2000 because the company exceeded\nthe plan for 2000.\n{218}\n     \nThere is evidence that the same pattern of conduct found at other branches existed at the Dallas branch.\n \nThe Court finds the following:\n(a)\n        \nTelephone records indicate that Hepler and Christensen called the BPS Dallas branch after\nChristensen tendered his resignation, but prior to his leaving BPS, at a time when Farrington was employed at\nBPS.\n  \nFarrington did not deny that he spoke with Christensen on the telephone at the BPS branch at the time in\nquestion.\n(b)\n        \nChristensen met with Farrington on at least two occasions before Farrington left BPS.\n  \nOn the\nfirst such known occasion, they discussed when Farrington would need to leave BPS, which suggests that the\npreliminary discussions had long passed.\n \n(c)\n        \nChristensen used BPS as his primary personnel source for the Hi-Lift Dallas branch.\n(d)\n        \nChristensen testified that risk and uncertainty exist with starting a new company and that he\nconsidered that uncertainty in deciding to accept employment with H&E.\n  \nOne of those risks was establishing\nitself by reputation, “the new-guy-on-the-block syndrome.”\n  \nChristensen admitted that he brought employees\nfrom BPS to make the company profitable and that that gave him greater comfort with his decision to go to\nH&E.\n(e)\n        \nFarrington testified that he reviewed the property then used by Martin Equipment, another\ndivision of H&E, to determine whether it could be used for the Hi-Lift operations, and that his assessment was\nthat it would not work.\n  \nHe further testified that afterward he met with Delores Kline to identify another location\nfor the branch, which turned out to be the branch that Hi-Lift operates out of in Dallas.\n    \nFarrington testified that\nnone of this occurred while he was employed by BPS. Farrington’s last day with BPS was either March 14 or 17,\n2000.\n  \nIf Farrington were correct, then work on identifying this new property would had to have occurred after\nMarch 14.\n  \nH&E, however, signed a letter of intent with respect to the lease of this property on \nFebruary 11,\n2000.\n{219}\n     \nFarrington testified that prior to resigning on March 4, he did not know that Christensen was meeting\nwith other BPS employees, and he denied having any role in the recruitment of BPS employees while he was\nhimself employed by BPS.\n  \nIndeed, Farrington admitted that it would have been improper for him to solicit\nemployees while employed by BPS. Yet, an H&E expense record filled out by Christensen shows that\nFarrington met with Christensen and Billups \ntogether\n on March 3, 2000 (while Farrington was the branch\nmanager of BPS).\n  \nWhen confronted with this document, Farrington admitted that maybe he was “in the\nsame building” with Billups but that he had nothing to do with his recruitment.\n  \nReluctantly, Farrington\nadmitted that he was aware that Christensen was discussing Billups going to H&E. Christensen testified that\nhe met with both Farrington and Billups together and it was at this lunch that they discussed when Farrington\nwould leave BPS for H&E.\nHouston and San Antonio\n{220}\n     \nHouston\n.\n  \nAs with Dallas, Christensen was intimately involved in the solicitation of employees for the\nnew H&E Hi-Lift branch in Houston, Texas.\n{221}\n     \nH&E had a small fleet in Texas at its South Texas Equipment subsidiary.\n  \nSouth Texas was better known\nas a crane and earth moving equipment company than a AWP rental company.\n  \nPrior to 2000, the South\nTexas fleet consisted largely of aging Grove equipment. Utilization of the Grove fleet did not meet\nEngquist’s expectations.\n  \nBecause of its Grove fleet, the South Texas AWP mechanics had not attended\nspecial training by Genie or JLG prior to January 2000.\n  \nChristensen testified that when he first met with\nJohn Engquist he was told that H&E had not been very successful in the rental market and that is why they\nwere looking to bring on Hepler, Kline, Quinn and himself: to develop a new H&E rental division.\n \n{222}\n     \nThe Houston branch manager, Rodriguez, testified that Engquist did not speak to him prior to November\n1, 1999 about expanding the operations in Houston or opening up in other markets. Rodriguez’s testimony\nconfirms that the creation of the H&E Hi-Lift division was only explored after Hepler and Kline approached\nBruckmann, Bagley and Engquist.\n \n{223}\n     \nIn February and March 2000, Christensen met with BPS employees in Houston for the purpose of\nsoliciting them to H&E.\n  \nChristensen, later with the assistance of Rodriguez, solicited and hired eight\nexperienced BPS employees to the Houston branch, nearly one-third of the H&E work force in Houston. The\nformer BPS employees were hired for similar positions at H&E and, with one exception, were given pay\nincreases to go to H&E.\n  \nNo headhunters nor advertisements in newspapers were used for building the new\nHi-Lift branch.\n{224}\n     \nH&E expanded its customer base rapidly in 2000 concurrent with its hiring of employees from BPS.\n \nSignificantly, no contracts were produced by H&E for many customers at the branch until the period after\nApril 2000.\n  \nH&E’s business with Brown & Root nearly tripled between January and April 2000.\n  \nBy\nOctober 2000, after hiring eight employees from BPS, H&E doubled its rental revenue in Houston from the\nsame time the prior year.\n  \n{225}\n     \nSan Antonio.\n   \nHepler, with Christensen’s assistance and input, solicited David Hobbs, BPS’s branch\nmanager in Charleston, South Carolina for a new Hi-Lift branch in Texas.\n  \nHobbs received a substantial pay\nincrease—$20,000, plus a $27,000 moving expense payment—to leave BPS for H&E. The day after\nChristensen left BPS, he traveled to Jacksonville to meet with Hepler and Rodriguez and then traveled to\nSavannah, Georgia to meet with Hobbs and Alexander. Hepler had given Christensen responsibility for\nsoliciting Hobbs.\n  \nFollowing the meeting with Hobbs in Savannah, Hepler and Christensen continued their\nconversations with Hobbs to solicit him to H&E, and Christensen kept Hepler abreast of his progress.\n  \nHobbs\nwas on board quickly though, and signed H&E employment forms in late January 2000 indicating his\nacceptance of employment at that time.\n  \nThen Christensen, with Hobbs’ assistance, solicited Gloria Silva\n(Ysassi) from BPS to H&E.\n \n{226}\n     \nThe recruitment of Hobbs is a good example of the difficult interplay of fair and unfair competition.\n  \nIf\nnothing else had happened, the hiring of David Hobbs to leave BPS in Charleston and move to a new Hi-Lift\nbranch in San Antonio would not be a problem.\n  \nThe same could be said of the hiring of Gloria Silva (Ysassi)\nto be credit manager in San Antonio.\n  \nStanding alone, each hire would not provide grounds for an unfair\ntrade practices claim.\n  \nWhen put in the context of the overall raid of BPS employees, the two hires provide\nadditional evidence of a deliberate effort to orchestrate mass defections from BPS to H&E and to appropriate\nthe intellectual knowledge base of Sunbelt.\n{227}\n     \nWhile having some minor impact, the defendants’ actions in the Houston-San Antonio market were not\nas devastating as the actions taken in the other BPS branch markets targeted by H&E.\n  \nThey are evidence,\nhowever, of the pervasive effort of H&E to siphon off most of the key employees of BPS.\nAtlanta\n{228}\n     \nThe Atlanta Hi-Lift branch opened on or about March 15, 2000.\n  \nThe following BPS personnel were\neither on-board at the opening or working with Hi-Lift within two weeks of opening:\n  \na branch manager\n(Mark Alexander); a full AWP outside sales staff\n  \n(David Leavell, Bill Kenyon, Dan Franz and James\nCornett); a service manager (James Brown); a shop foreman (Dan McMahan); mechanics (Paul Fredrickson,\nMichael Mullen and Roger Dempsey); a credit manager (Andrew Warshaw); a parts coordinator (Clinton\nMcMahan); and drivers (Nathaniel West and David Waddell).\n  \nShortly thereafter, the Atlanta Hi-Lift branch\nadded an administrative assistant (Rhonda Rathel).\n   \nEach of these employees was hired from BPS.\n{229}\n     \nHepler and Quinn arranged to meet with Alexander, the nine-year existing manager of the BPS Atlanta\nbranch, on January 6, 2000 to begin the plan leading to the opening of the H&E Atlanta branch.\n  \nAt lunch,\nHepler told Alexander he wanted to open an H&E branch in Atlanta and wanted assurance that Alexander\nwould consider becoming the branch manager.\n  \nAlexander was given responsibility for hiring employees at\nthe new H&E branch.\n{230}\n     \nA dinner was arranged that night with four long-term BPS employees that worked under Alexander at\nthe Atlanta branch:\n  \nAtlanta’s two most successful salesmen, David Leavell (“Leavell”) and Jim Cornett\n(“Cornett”), the Atlanta service manager James Brown (“Brown”) and Alexander’s “right-hand man at the\nbranch,” Dan Franz (“Franz”), the scaffolding manager.\n  \nHepler and Alexander claim that the dinner was\nAlexander’s idea to get old friends together and deny that recruitment was.\n   \nThis testimony sharply conflicts\nwith co-defendant Quinn’s testimony that Hepler set this dinner up to recruit these BPS employees for H&E.\nOnce again, Hepler’s credibility is at issue, and for the multiple contradictions between Hepler and other\nsworn testimony, the Court again finds Hepler is not credible.\n{231}\n     \nQuinn testified that the dinner was arranged for the express purpose of recruiting BPS employees to\ncome work for H&E.\n  \nHepler’s only explanation when confronted at trial with Quinn’s testimony was that\nQuinn’s recollection was inaccurate.\n  \nAlexander admits that he falsified his expense report for this Atlanta\ndinner (to hide the fact that Hepler and Quinn attended) and submitted it to BPS for payment.\n  \nThe fact that\nsimilar meetings were held with the key employees in other branches with the branch managers present\nindicates a pattern of using the branch managers to solicit, plan and organize the defections.\n{232}\n     \nH&E business records show that employee benefits information was requested for Mark Alexander on\nJanuary 7, 2000, and that insurance networks were already in place for the Atlanta employees.\n{233}\n     \nHepler subsequently arranged a meeting with Alexander in Savannah on January 20, 2000, at which time\nHepler showed Alexander a detailed business plan for the Hi-Lift division that contained projections for all\nbranches.\n  \nRegarding the plan he reviewed with Hepler on January 20, Alexander testified:\n  \n“[Hepler] and\nDoug [Kline] had put together a one-year—I believe a one-year, three-year, five-year growth plan and that\nthe return on investment was very, very achievable.\n  \nI asked to look at it.\n  \nHe showed it to me, pulled it out of\nhis briefcase, and the numbers I saw were achievable in my opinion.”\n  \nHepler denies showing Alexander a\nbusiness plan that night and, when confronted at trial with Alexander’s testimony, claimed that Alexander’s\nrecollection was inaccurate.\n  \nDefendants did not call Alexander as a witness.\n{234}\n     \nHepler assured Alexander on January 20 that the necessary capital was available for the H&E start-up.\n \nWith respect to capital, Hepler explained to Alexander “that it was all arranged, that not all of it was one\nhundred percent secured yet and some of that was contingent upon the fact the we come out—\nthat Hi-Lift\ncome out of the box pretty strong\n.\n  \nBut that he was confident that that wasn’t going to be a problem.”\n(Emphasis added.) That evidence confirms at least the need for swift conversion of the necessary BPS\nemployee base.\n{235}\n     \nAt the Savannah meeting, Hepler offered Alexander a job as the Atlanta branch manager, which\nAlexander accepted at that time.\n  \nAlexander’s salary would increase from $103,500 at BPS to $105,000 at\nH&E, and he also received a $25,000 signing bonus.\n  \nAlexander assured Hepler that he could hire the\nnecessary people for the branch.\n  \nWhen asked at deposition who he had in mind that night to recruit,\nAlexander immediately responded with eleven names, all of whom he hired from BPS for the Atlanta\nstartup.\n \n{236}\n     \nThe next day, January 21, 2000, Alexander resigned from BPS and immediately spoke with Brown about\nhis resignation.\n   \nAlexander used Brown as an inside source to set up meetings and solicit BPS employees.\n \nBrown expressed to at least one BPS employee (Galvond) his intent to harm BPS by gutting the BPS branch\nto the ground.\n  \nBrown not only solicited BPS employees on behalf of H&E he also, while still employed by\nBPS, encouraged at least one BPS employee to take confidential BPS files and information home with him in\nanticipation of leaving BPS to work for H&E.\n  \nBrown also indicated to Galvond that his reason for taking his\nBPS laptop computer home with him each night was for the purpose of compiling confidential BPS\ninformation for use at H&E.\n{237}\n     \nAlexander arranged a lunch with Brown on February 8, 2000, prior to Brown’s resignation from BPS.\n \nAt this lunch Brown showed Alexander a list of BPS employees Brown wanted to recruit from BPS to work\nfor H&E.\n  \nBrown told Alexander at this lunch that the instability at BPS caused by Alexander’s resignation\nwould help his efforts to recruit BPS employees for H&E.\n  \nAlexander testified in deposition that it would be\nimproper for Brown to recruit BPS employees for H&E while still employed at BPS.\n{238}\n     \nWhile still employed by BPS, Alexander spent time with Doug and Delores Kline trying to locate a\nfacility for H&E to open its Atlanta branch.\n  \nA factor Alexander considered in locating a facility for H&E\nwas to find a location that would make it easier to recruit BPS employees.\n{239}\n     \nWhen Brown began his employment with H&E, he told Alexander that he had already been in contact\nwith several BPS employees he was recruiting for H&E and undertook the role of overseeing recruitment of\nemployees for H&E.\n  \nAlexander gave him authority to make employment offers on behalf of H&E.\n \n{240}\n     \nBetween late February and early April 2000, at least 13 more BPS employees solicited by Alexander and\nBrown left BPS and began work with H&E. On opening day, every employee of H&E’s Atlanta branch had\nbeen hired from BPS.\n{241}\n     \nThe H&E branch in Atlanta was virtually identical to the former BPS Atlanta branch with respect to its\nemployees, customer base and structure.\n  \nIn addition to all employees being former BPS employees,\nemployees’ responsibilities at H&E were virtually the same as at BPS.\n  \nFormer salesmen were assigned the\nsame territories at H&E that they had at BPS, called on BPS customers and based pricing on information and\nexperience acquired at BPS.\n  \nIn effect, H&E’s Atlanta branch operated as the former BPS branch—used the\nsame\n employees to conduct the \nsame\n business with the \nsame\n customers.\n{242}\n     \nOnly ninety days after Hepler and Kline departed from BPS, on or about March 23, 2000, H&E opened a\ngreenfield branch in Atlanta, where it previously had no operations, with all the necessary employees to sell,\nservice and deliver equipment.\n{243}\n     \nIn building a fleet for H&E’s Atlanta branch, Quinn placed orders based on information and knowledge\nacquired at BPS concerning the Atlanta market instead of conducting market studies and evaluations, a\nprocess that Hepler testified is necessary for any greenfield operation.\n \n{244}\n     \nCornett testified in deposition that he covers the same territory for H&E that he covered for BPS and is\nstill using his BPS customer list at H&E.\n  \nCornett admitted that he likely called on BPS’s biggest customers\nfirst, with no pricing information or marketing materials from H&E.\n  \nAlexander admitted that he did not\nestablish rental rates for H&E’s Atlanta branch until July 2000, four months after the branch opened.\n  \nPrior\nto that point, salesmen priced equipment based on past experience, with no guidance from H&E.\n  \nWhen\nLeavell began his employment with H&E, there were no meetings in which the sales staff discussed rental\nrates, sales strategy or marketing strategy—Alexander simply instructed the salesmen to go do their jobs.\n \nLeavell took with him to H&E, however, notes that he had taken at BPS regarding BPS customers, including\ncontacts.\n{245}\n     \nFurther evidence that H&E’s Atlanta branch as well as other AWP branches operated as the former BPS\nbranch is a June 12, 2000 H&E memo from Mark Alexander to “All branch managers,” copied to\nDefendants Kline, Quinn and Christensen, in which Alexander, stated:\nLast Tuesday I had a meeting with Jeff Farmer with MLS & Assoc. I know\nthe entire former BPS crowd remembers that MLS was our printing supplier for\nmany years. . .\n . \nThe good news for us is that . . . [MLS] has all of the marketing\nbrochures we ever produced and none of this is copyrighted or trademarked. . . .\nJeff and I have another meeting tomorrow at which time he is going to bring the\nfirst draft of the monthly order form we were receiving every month from MLS.\n \nBy the end of the week you should be receiving this form by fax at your branch.\n{246}\n     \nThe loss of its branch manager and key personnel to H&E in such a short period of time caused turmoil\nin the BPS Atlanta branch.\n  \nBPS was forced to bring in personnel from other branches in order to deal with\nthe situation; they were unable to respond to customer needs and requests in a timely fashion; the condition\nof equipment in the yard suffered; and customers began calling BPS equipment off rent at a high rate.\n  \nAs a\nresult, BPS lost a significant amount of business, and the volume of equipment being rented slowed\nconsiderably because BPS lacked qualified people to rent it, lacked qualified people to repair it, and lacked\nqualified people to deliver it.\n{247}\n     \nDespite being a greenfield operation in a market in which H&E previously had no presence, the H&E\nstart-up branch in Atlanta did not struggle but was profitable by July 2000, exceeding the budgets that had\nbeen set for it by year-end.\n  \nReflecting the existence of and execution of the Plan, while Sunbelt’s revenue at\nthe Atlanta branch from the BPS customers was dropping dramatically (often to zero), H&E’s revenue from\nthese same customers rose from zero to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nH&E Today\n{248}\n     \nAs the result of the employment activity by Defendants Hi-Lift, Hepler, Kline, Quinn and Christensen,\nHi-Lift is substantially different today than H&E’s aerial work platform division was as of December 31,\n1999.\n  \nNot only was the H&E AWP fleet aging, it had not been very productive for H&E.\n  \nAs of December\n31, 1999, H&E’s AWP fleet had only generated rental revenue of $7.2 million, a gross profit of only $2.5\nmillion and a pre-tax loss of $289,000.\n  \nThe results of H&E’s employment of Hepler, Kline, Christensen and\nQuinn and their conspiratorial activities, were that Hi-Lift realized $23.4 million dollars in rentals by\nDecember 31, 2000, a gross profit of $16.9 million and a pre-tax profit of $3.4 million.\n  \nThis profit occurred\nnotwithstanding that two of the branches in the Hi-Lift division did not open until the middle of March 2000,\nfollowed by two more in May and one in June.\n  \nThus, through the opening of branches where Hi-Lift had no\nprior presence and the employment of BPS personnel at those branches and the “struggling” branches which\nH&E operated in Texas, Hi-Lift achieved over three times the rental revenues it previously had and turned a\nloss into a substantial profit.\n  \nThe turnaround totaled $3.7 million in one year.\n{249}\n     \nEven more remarkable is the speed at which Hi-Lift achieved profit before taxes (and before corporate\nallocations) and exceeded budget/projections.\n  \nBy July 14, 2000, Defendant Kline reported that Hi-Lift had\n$153,000 profit before taxes in June (before corporate allocations) and had exceeded the budget/projection\nfor the time-frame.\n  \nFurther, Kline reported that Charlotte utilization, which was at 58 percent, was not\nalarming because of Hi-Lift’s expectation that the “Corning job would utilize most of the remaining\nequipment very shortly.”\n \n{250}\n     \nSimilarly, a month later, Kline further reported that the Hi-Lift division had achieved $613,000 in profit\nbefore taxes (and before corporate allocations) and that “all branches were profitable in July.”\n  \nAs\nsignificantly, as Kline had reported in June, utilization by branch and across the entire fleet was\nextraordinarily high.\n  \nBy July 26, the Charlotte fleet, six weeks after opening, was at a 74 percent utilization\nlevel and quickly moved to 80 percent.\n  \nHi-Lift had 2,746 units in the fleet as of August 9th and a 79 percent\nutilization for the entire fleet.\n{251}\n     \nHi-Lift rentals increased by $30.8 million, or 130 percent, to $55.4 million in fiscal year 2001 over fiscal\nyear 2000.\n  \nThus, in fiscal year 2001, Hi-Lift had almost eight times the revenue it had as of December 31,\n1999.\n  \nAs stated by an industry expert, such results are “astounding.”\n  \nMoreover, the Court finds that these\nresults confirm a number of points including:\n(a)\n        \nThe mass departures severely injured Sunbelt, a result that could only have been intended by\ndefendants or the product of callous disregard for the consequences.\n(b)\n        \nSunbelt/BPS confidential business information was used by defendants; otherwise, their\npersonnel could not have been assembled so much business so quickly and efficiently.\n(c)\n        \nSunbelt’s expected repeat business was quickly and effectively appropriated by defendants.\n(d)\n               \nDefendants’ activities were unfair, unethical and anticompetitive.\n(e)\n                \nThe actions resulted in a dramatic $3.7 million turnaround in performance in one year.\nII.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n{252}\n     \nTruth matters.\n{253}\n     \nTo the extent there may have developed in the business community a sense that in business litigation it is\nacceptable to render less than truthful testimony, that trend is one which must be reversed.\n  \nThe primary\nbusiness of the courts is ascertaining the truth.\n  \nThose who impede that work by providing less than\ncomplete, honest testimony should not be surprised to find their conduct unrewarded by the legal system.\n \nEvery witness who takes an oath is compelled to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n  \nThose who fail to honor that oath leave all their credibility on the courthouse steps.\n  \nA healthy economic\nsystem requires a strong legal system that permits, promotes and protects fair competition while prohibiting\nand punishing conduct that threatens the vitality of that competitive system.\n  \nFinding the truth is an essential\npart of the work of our legal system.\n  \nEvery witness is compelled to cooperate fully and truthfully in that\nsearch.\n{254}\n     \nThe Court, as Finder of Fact, had the opportunity to judge the testimony of the live witnesses firsthand.\n \nThat is significant in this case where the testimony of defendants and the inferences to be drawn from their\nactions are in conflict.\n  \nDefendants chose not to present live testimony from Defendants Kline, Christensen,\nQuinn and Pearsall, nor did branch managers Jones, Drennan and Alexander appear live.\n  \nThe Court has\nreviewed their proffered deposition testimony.\n  \nThe Court finds credibility issues as to defendants’ witnesses\nwith respect to two key subject areas:\n  \nthe existence of a plan to raid BPS at its key branches in an\norchestrated manner and the use of the branch managers to do so.\n  \nIn both subject areas, the uncontroverted\nactions speak louder than words of denial. On numerous occasions, Mr. Hepler’s testimony was contradicted\nby his own employees, his own documents or the credible testimony of others.\n{255}\n     \nSunbelt has the burden on each of its claims of proving by “the greater weight of the evidence” that\ndefendants’ actions caused the damages that Sunbelt claims were the result of the massive departure of its\nemployees and consequent conversion of customers and trade secrets.\n  \nSunbelt need not have a particular\nquantity of evidence in order to prove its claims; it must simply show that, considering all of the evidence,\nthe facts necessary to find in its favor are more likely than not to exist. \nSee, e.g., Joyner v. Garrett\n, 279 N.C.\n226, 236, 182 S.E.2d 553, 560 (1971) (holding that the law relating to burden of proof is equally applicable\nto jury and non-jury trials).\n{256}\n     \nAs a general matter, the Court notes that the failure of four defendants, and a number of H&E employees\nwho figure prominently in defendants’ plan and conspiracy, to testify at trial in a civil matter is a “pregnant\ncircumstance” for the Court to consider.\n  \nJacobs v.

Rob Hepler likewise admitted that such conduct was unethical.\n        \nUndermining the entire\nstructure of a branch by secretly soliciting key employees at various levels of the organization to leave \nen\nmasse\n to H&E with the inevitable consequence of crippling the branch, and then using the same employees\nto blitz BPS customers for business with H&E is not ethical competitive behavior. Building fully functional\nand profitable greenfield branches in a matter of days, rather than months, through orchestrated, \nen masse\n,\nsecret recruitment efforts by key insiders is not ethical behavior in competition.\n{270}\n     \nCompetitor A may not use existing management employees of Competitor B to secretly solicit \nen masse\ndefections to Competitor A’s business while those managers or key employees are still employed by\nCompetitor B, particularly where Competitor A knows that the coordinated \nen masse\n defections will impair\nCompetitor B’s ability to function and provide at least a temporary competitive advantage to Competitor A in\nthe marketplace.\n  \nCompetitor A could openly solicit any employee of Competitor B who was not bound by a\ncontract containing a restrictive covenant so long as the new employee does not use confidential business\ninformation and trade secrets of Competitor B.\n  \nThe employee could be offered more money.\n  \nThere would\nbe no limit on the number hired.\n  \nHere it is the surreptitious recruitment of \nen masse\n defections timed to\ndisrupt Competitor B’s business and take advantage of the employees’ knowledge of confidential business\ninformation which crosses over the line of fair competition.\n \n{271}\n     \nThe Court also considered the deliberate acts of disruption committed by the departing employees as\nwell as the derogatory comments made by the branch managers and other key employees.\n  \nFurther, the\nmanipulation of the employee departures in the form of mass resignations was also unfair and calculated to\nhandicap BPS in such a way that Hi-Lift could take competitive advantage of the situation it had unfairly\ncreated.\n  \nIt eliminated the opportunity for BPS to compete for the employees on a level playing field.\n{272}\n     \nThe Court is not holding that Hi-Lift could not hire BPS employees, be they executives, branch\nmanagers, salesmen or mechanics.\n  \nHad Hi-Lift opened a branch office prepared for business and then\nadvertised for employees, any BPS employee could have been solicited and hired.\n  \nPrior to opening a branch\noffice, Hi-Lift could have advertised in trade publications that it was seeking experienced employees.\n  \nAny\nBPS employee could have chosen to respond to that advertisement.\n  \nIndeed, many BPS employees may have\napplied for employment with Hi-Lift.\n  \nIn its haste and its effort to take advantage of BPS before Sunbelt\ncould close its purchase, Hi-Lift overstepped the bounds of ethical and fair competition.\n \n{273}\n     \nAn example of activity by Hi-Lift that would not fall into the category of unfair trade practice was the\nhiring of David Chapman.\n  \nHe ran the Charleston branch for BPS and was a friend of Hepler.\n  \nHe was hired\naway from BPS to run the Houston branch for Hi-Lift.\n  \nHe did not hire any Charleston employees and was\ncontractually free to work wherever he desired.\n  \nHi-Lift did not commit any unfair trade practice by hiring\nhim, and his hiring had no adverse impact on the Charleston branch other than the loss of his personal\nexperience.\n  \nHi-Lift did not have a competing branch in Charleston.\n{274}\n     \nThe appellate court decisions dealing with unfair competition and conversion of business and employees\ndemonstrate an awareness that competition is healthy and not to be unduly discouraged.\n  \nThose decisions\nalso evidence a desire to permit employees the greatest freedom of movement in order to maximize their job\nopportunities.\n  \nSee, e.g., Dalton, \n353 N.C. 647, 548 S.E.2d 704; \nHiatt v.

Kuykendall\n, the North Carolina Supreme Court\nclarified its ruling in \nHooks.\n \n[I]n a recent decision, [this Court] held that in some situations a competitor may\nhire an employer's former employees without being liable for tortious interference\nwith contract.\n  \nIn \nHooks\n, plaintiff's employees had terminable at will contracts with\nplaintiff, had signed covenants not to compete, and subsequently went to work for\none of plaintiff's competitors.\n  \nThis Court held that hiring the competitor's former\nemployees and assigning them to the same territory they had worked in their prior\nemployment was not a tortious interference with contract.\n  \nWe held in \nHooks\n that a\nclaim for tortious interference with contract would not lie where a defendant had\nonly \"offered the plaintiff's employees job opportunities which induced them to\nterminate their terminable at will contracts and, by locating these employees in\ntheir previously assigned territories, induced them to breach the non-competition\nclauses contained in their contracts with the plaintiff.\"\n  \nWe concluded that the fact\nthat the plaintiff and defendant were in competition was sufficient to justify the\ndefendant \"in offering the plaintiff's employees new jobs and locating them in\ntheir previously assigned territory.\" In \nHooks\n, however, we also emphasized that\n\"'[t]he privilege [to interfere] is conditional or qualified; that is it is lost if\nexercised for a wrong purpose. In general a wrong purpose exists where the act is\ndone other than as a reasonable and \nbona fide\n attempt to protect the interests of the\ndefendant which is involved.'\"\n322 N.C. at 662, 370 S.E.2d at 387 (internal citations omitted).\n{278}\n     \nDefendants would like to avail themselves of the notion that competition justifies their actions.\n  \nSee\nChildress v. Abeles\n, 240 N.C. 667, 84 S.E. 2d 176 (1954).\n  \nHowever, defendants should have used lawful\nmeans to pursue their ends.\n  \nSee, e.g., id.\n; \nHooks\n, 322 N.C. 643, 370 S.E.2d 375.\n{279}\n     \nBased on the above findings of fact, and pursuant to North Carolina law, there is extensive evidence\nshowing that the actions of defendants were unfair, unethical, and immoral; those actions proximately caused\nSunbelt’s injury; those actions were of and affecting commerce; and, thus, the Court finds that these actions\nconstitute unfair trade practices or unfair methods of competition under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.\nTortious Interference\n{280}\n     \nThe Court will not deal with the tortious interference claims separately, as each is subsumed in the\nholding of unfair competition. \n \nIf an appellate court were to find that defendants’ conduct was not barred as\nunfair competition, it would be difficult to find that it was “tortious interference” since there would have\nbeen a determination that the competitive actions were fair and protected.\nTrade Secrets\n{281}\n     \nThe application of the law of misappropriation of trade secrets is difficult to apply in this case because of\nthe nature of the industry, the vast experience of the BPS/Sunbelt employees hired away by Hi-Lift and the\ndifficulty of proving specific use of the information. Here, the use of confidential business information by\nHi-Lift would have been coextensive with the unfair competition that the Court has found to exist by virtue of\nthe unlawful \nen masse\n appropriation of the employee base. The damages for misappropriation would be\nincluded in the unfair trade practice damages for all practical purposes.\n  \nSee Drouillard,\n 108 N.C. App. 169,\n423 S.E.2d 324.\n{282}\n     \nUnder the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act (“Trade Secrets Act”),\n“Trade secret” means business or technical information, including but not limited\nto a formula, pattern, program, devise, compilation of information, method,\ntechnique, or process that:\n1.\n      \nDerives independent actual or potential commercial value from not being\ngenerally known or readily ascertainable through independent development\nor reverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic value from its\ndisclosure or use; and\n2.\n      \nIs the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to\nmaintain its secrecy.\nN.C.G.S. § 66-152 (2001).\n{283}\n     \nThe factors which trial courts should apply in determining whether information is properly classified as a\ntrade secret have been clearly enunciated by the appellate courts. The six primary factors are: (1) the extent\nto which the information is known outside the business, (2) the extent to which it is known inside the\nbusiness, (3) the measures taken to guard the secrecy of the information, (4) the value of the information to\nthe business and to the competitor, (5) the expenditure of time and money in developing the information and\n(6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could properly be acquired or duplicated by others.\n  \nSee\nByrd’s\n, 142 N.C.

As previously noted, there was an advantage to Hi-Lift to get the new Hi-Lift branches\nopen in the BPS markets before Sunbelt could close its transaction. The rapidity with which the old BPS\ncustomers were identified, called upon and converted to Hi-Lift, despite the lack of business information and\nguidance from Hi-Lift management, provides strong circumstantial evidence that at least some of BPS\nconfidential information was used to solicit customers.\n{287}\n     \nThe evidence shows that the individual defendants knew BPS/Sunbelt’s trade secrets and had access to\nthem, and each had the opportunity to acquire them for disclosure and use. Prior to appropriating BPS\nemployees, \nen masse\n, H&E had \nno customers\n in North Carolina, Georgia, or Florida.\n  \nDespite this fact, the\n“new” H&E operations made a significant profit in their first year of operation—based on their taking of\nBPS/Sunbelt employees, trade secrets and customers—and the BPS branches experienced a concurrent,\nsubstantial decrease in business.\n  \nThis occurrence alone is circumstantial evidence of the defendants’ use and\ndisclosure of BPS trade secret information. \nSee, e.g., Byrd’s\n, 142 N.C. App. at 377, 542 S.E.2d at 693\n(finding that evidence defendant acquired several of plaintiff’s customer contracts after opening a competing\nbusiness was “sufficient circumstantial evidence to sustain a finding that defendant knew of the confidential\ninformation, had the opportunity to acquire it for his own use and did so.”)\n  \nHere, testimony supports that\nDefendant Pearsall misappropriated confidential customer information of BPS—testimony that Pearsall\nnever rebutted.\n  \nIn addition, testimony of witnesses located in Tampa/Fort Myers, Dallas and Atlanta\nsupports that confidential customer information was misappropriated by BPS employees who left and went\nto H&E.\n  \nIndeed, in Tampa, identical confidential pricing was used by Ms. Quasnick after she went to H&E,\nand in Dallas, Steve Mathews took sales notes with him, even though he was purportedly instructed not to do\nso by Christensen.\n{288}\n     \nBased on the above the Court finds that (1) BPS/Sunbelt’s compilation of information, including its\nspecial pricing information, customer information (identity, contacts and requirements of its rental\ncustomers), personnel and salary information, organizational structure, financial projections and forecasts,\nutilization rates, fleet mix by market, capital and branch budget information, and cost information, when\ntaken together constitutes trade secrets and (2) that the defendants misappropriated BPS/Sunbelt’s trade\nsecret information unlawfully. \n \nCivil Conspiracy\n{289}\n     \nA claim for civil conspiracy “requires the showing of an agreement between two or more persons to do\nan unlawful act or to do a lawful act in an unlawful way that results in damage to the claimant.” \n \nSee, e.g.,\nDalton v. Camp\n, 138 N.C. App. 201, 213, 531 S.E.2d 258, 266 (2000), \nrev’d on other grounds\n, 353 N.C.\n647, 548 S.E.2d 704 (2001).\n{290}\n     \nSunbelt must also show an “overt act’ committed by at least one conspirator in furtherance of the\nconspiracy.\n  \nId\n. at 212, 531 S.E.2d at 267.\n    \n{291}\n     \nCircumstantial evidence is sufficient, in many cases, to prove an action for conspiracy.\n  \nSee, e.g., id.\n at\n214, 531 S.E.2d at 267.\n{292}\n     \nIn this case, the evidence presented at trial shows more than a mere suspicion or conjecture of an\noverarching unlawful plan for \nen masse\n departures of BPS employees and customers, the use of trade secrets,\nand the consequent stifling of BPS/Sunbelt’s ability to effectively compete with H&E in the early stages of\nH&E’s entrance into the markets at issue.\n  \nThe considerable shift of BPS employees and customers to H&E\nwithin a very short time period, the almost “instant” H&E greenfield branches that sprung up, and the use of\ncertain BPS confidential information constitutes significant circumstantial evidence that the “raid” of BPS\nwas planned and agreed to long in advance of its actual implementation.\n \n{293}\n     \nPlaintiff has shown sufficient circumstantial and direct evidence of an overall plan by H&E and Hepler,\nKline and the other individual defendants, to cripple or eliminate BPS/Sunbelt as a competitor in the AWP\nbusiness in at least seven markets.\n  \nMany of the actions against BPS by the individual defendants were taken\nwhile each was still employed there.\n  \nThe strikingly similar pattern of taking the human resources from the\nbranches through a “pyramid” scheme and the “secret” meetings held with Sunbelt employees supports a\nfinding that there was an agreement.\n  \nThese actions are unlawful and constitute a conspiracy in furtherance of\nthe acts as described above.\n \n{294}\n     \nIn light of the Court’s findings of fact, and the laws of North Carolina with respect to civil conspiracy,\nthe Court finds that defendants agreed among themselves, while most were still employed by BPS, to do a\nlawful act—to compete and solicit employees—in an unlawful way, and that defendants’ actions have caused\nsignificant damages to the plaintiff.\nU.D.T.P.A. Damages and Attorney Fees\n{295}\n     \nThe Court concludes that BPS was damaged by conduct that the Court has found to violate the\nU.D.T.P.A. statute.\n  \nSuch conduct includes unfair actions of defendants in using the BPS/Sunbelt branch\nmanagers and other BPS/Sunbelt employees to recruit others to leave BPS/Sunbelt in a coordinated departure\nto staff new offices of Hi-Lift.\n{296}\n     \nThe amount of damages plaintiff has proven was proximately caused by defendants’ unlawful actions.\nSee, e.g., Process Components, Inc. v. Baltimore Aircoil Co\n., 89 N.C.

App. at 604, 439 S.E.2d at 802 (quoting \nIn re Burris\n, 263 N.C. 793, 795, 140 S.E.2d 408, 410\n(1965)).\n{301}\n     \nIn the case before this Court, defendants deliberately used key inside managers to orchestrate a plan of\nconversion of employees that would have the known and desired impact of disrupting BPS/Sunbelt’s\noperations in a way that would provide a competitive advantage for Hi-Lift as it jump-started its new\nbranches.\n  \nThe evidence in this record shows that, pursuant to their unlawful plan, defendants used BPS’s\ntime, resources, and trade secrets while they were still employees of the plaintiff.\n \n{302}\n     \nOne of the keys to profitability in the AWP business is reaching a critical mass of business that can\nsupport the overhead and maximize fleet usage.\n  \nHepler and Kline were well aware of the need to get to that\ncritical mass quickly because BPS had commissioned a specific study which showed the critical usage and\nrevenue points at its branches.\n  \nThey referenced that target point in their business projections.\n  \nSlowly\nbuilding business through the usual methods associated with greenfield operations would have meant a\nsignificant delay in reaching the revenue and usage targets necessary for profitability.\n  \nThe secret wholesale\nraid on the BPS/Sunbelt employee base using the branch managers was designed to and did minimize the\ntime required to reach the critical mass and was a key component in defendants’ plan.\n  \nAs a result,\nprofitability was achieved at a rate far swifter than the industry norm.\n  \nThe rapid achievement of high levels\nof revenue also facilitated borrowing and negotiating with equipment suppliers.\n  \nThose factors provided the\nmotivation to secretly use the branch managers and others to carry out the plan to convert the employee base\nand customer business quickly and by surprise.\n \n{303}\n     \nThe focus on hitting the key BPS branches before a new owner could take control and make efforts to\nretain the employees and customers explains the need to use the branch managers to pre-position the\ndepartures.\n  \nNowhere was that more evident than the last minute actions relating to the Charlotte branch\nwhich occurred just before the Sunbelt closing.\n  \nIt is a fair inference that Charlotte was left until last because\nMr. Hepler had the most confidence in the commitment of his brother-in-law to make the changeover.\n \n{304}\n     \nPlaintiff’s damages are based in part on the incremental profits it lost as a result of defendants’ unethical\nand unlawful conduct and in part on the expenses resulting from the mass departures orchestrated by\ndefendants. It is also based in part on the benefit Hi-Lift received.\n{305}\n     \nBPS/Sunbelt was damaged by the conduct the Court has found to violate the unfair trade practices\nstatute. That conduct took place in commerce.\n  \nBPS/Sunbelt lost employees it may not have otherwise lost.\n \nAs a result, BPS/Sunbelt incurred expense in hiring and training new employees.\n  \nIt lost efficiency in its\noperation and lost business as a result of the disruption to its business and the advantage created for Hi-Lift\nby having the old BPS salesmen out soliciting business when BPS/Sunbelt had its sales force suddenly\ndepleted.\n   \nBPS/Sunbelt thus experienced a loss of efficient use of its fleet for a period of time until it could\nget trained sales people and trained mechanics and drivers who could service its accounts.\n  \nBPS/Sunbelt lost\nbusiness, incurred expenses and thus lost profits as a result of defendants’ unfair conduct.\n  \nThe majority of\nthe damage occurred at the Atlanta, Charlotte, Orlando and Fort Myers-Tampa branches.\n  \nThe impact of the\nunfair competition was minimal at the Texas branches but existed to some extent.\n{306}\n     \nIf the actions of the branch managers were not taken with the intent of disrupting Sunbelt’s business,\nthey were taken with the knowledge and callous disregard of the harm they would cause.\n  \nThe Court finds\nthe actions were intended to disrupt Sunbelt’s business.\n{307}\n     \nConversely, Hi-Lift derived a substantial benefit from its unfair conduct.\n  \nIt’s acquisition of a trained\nwork force eliminated training costs and a learning curve for new employees and produced a safer operation.\n \nIt obtained market information in the presence of the sales force, customer contacts and relationships,\ninformation on customer credit history, current pricing information, current fleet mix information, and an\ninstant “team” useful to the efficient operation of an AWP rental business.\n{308}\n     \nBecause of defendants’ unlawful actions, Hi-Lift was able to start greenfield operations at a significantly\nfaster pace and to appropriate the short-term business customers of BPS/Sunbelt because of the disability\ncreated by the coordinated mass departures.\n  \nHi-Lift created a profit of approximately $3.4 million in its first\nyear, a unique and remarkable result attributable in large part to the wholesale appropriation of key\nBPS/Sunbelt employees and the knowledge base they brought with them.\n \n{309}\n     \nThe damages which were proximately caused by those actions included loss of trained employees, the\ncost of replacing those employees, loss of customers and business due to inefficient service resulting from\nthe loss of staff, loss of efficient use of its fleet in the affected branches, and general business disruption.\n{310}\n     \nBPS/Sunbelt was a sufficiently large organization that it could and did replace the lost employees, and its\nnew employees were trained and had the equipment and tools to compete with Hi-Lift in the long run.\n  \nHi-\nLift was entitled to compete fairly with BPS/Sunbelt.\n  \nThe success that the management team had at BPS\nwas a clear indication of their capability, and they had sufficient capital backing.\n  \nIn the long term, it was\nclear that Hepler and Kline would provide stiff competition.\n  \nBPS could have protected itself against that\ncompetition but did not.\n  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the compensable damages are limited to the short-\nterm period of time and expenses it took BPS /Sunbelt to compensate for the actions which the Court has\nfound to be unfair.\n  \nFor most of the positions, six months was an adequate period of time to hire and train\nnew employees and have them on the job with competitive capabilities.\n  \nMany could be hired and trained\nquicker.\n  \nAt that point the companies were on a fair competitive basis and it would not be unexpected that\nHi-Lift would take some market share from BPS/Sunbelt.\n  \nTherefore the Court has not attributed all lost\ncustomers to unfair competition.\n{311}\n     \nThere has been significant evidence that many of defendants’ rentals made in its “new” markets were\nmade to the same customers and in the same geographic areas as plaintiff’s rentals would have been.\n  \nSee\nRoane-Barker\n, 99 N.C. App. at 40, 392 S.E.2d at 670.\n  \nSince it could compete lawfully, at least some of\nthose sales would have been made in any event.\n  \nAccordingly, the Court has not accepted in full the damage\ncalculation proffered by plaintiff’s expert.\n{312}\n     \nThe clear prospect that Hi-Lift would have taken some market share from BPS in their overlapping\nmarkets combined with the overlap of unfair competition and trade secret misappropriation makes the\ndamage assessment more complicated. As a matter of public policy, the Legislature has endorsed that\nconcept that damages can be determined by actual loss to the plaintiff or unjust enrichment of the defendant\nin the case of misappropriation of trade secrets.\n  \nSee\n N.C.G.S. § 66-154.\n  \nThat policy is equally applicable\nwhere the unfair trade practice and misappropriation claims: (1) intermingle, (2) support both claims, and (3)\ncause damage.\n  \nFor that reason, the Court has considered the profit derived by Hi-Lift from its unusually\nrapid expansion and achievement of profitability in the first year in determining damages.\n{313}\n     \nThe plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of five million dollars by the unfair trade practices of\ndefendants.\n  \nThis is the amount to be trebled in this case; it is the amount the Court concludes represents the\nactual damages in this case directly flowing from the Chapter 75 violations, including the use of confidential\nbusiness information. The damages are based upon the number of employees unfairly appropriated by Hi-\nLift, their value and the disruption and expense their coordinated departures inflicted on BPS/Sunbelt, as\nwell as the benefit received by Hi-Lift.\n  \nThe damages result from actions in the Atlanta, Charlotte, Orlando\nand Tampa-Fort Myers markets for the most part, with some smaller allocation for the Texas markets.\n  \nThe\nextent of the appropriation is set out above in the Findings of Fact.\n  \nThe damages resulted from the\ncoordinated efforts of all the defendants which were part of an overall strategy designed to hit BPS/Sunbelt\nduring the transition period before a transaction could be closed between Rentokil and Sunbelt and to convert\ncustomers quickly to take advantage of profitable fleet utilization.\n{314}\n     \nPlaintiff is also entitled to its attorney fees pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 75-16.1 and § 66-152, and to treble\ndamages pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 75-16 to -16.1 (“\nthe presiding judge may, in his discretion, allow a\nreasonable attorney fee to the duly licensed attorney representing the prevailing party . . . upon a finding . . .\nthat: (1) The party charged with the violation has willfully engaged in the act or practice, and there was an\nunwarranted refusal by such party to fully resolve the matter which constitutes the basis of such suit. . . .”); \n§\n66-152 (\n“if willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to\nthe prevailing party”); \n§ 75-16 (“\nIf any person shall be injured or the business of any . . . corporation shall be\nbroken up . . . or injured by reason of any act or thing done by any other person, firm or corporation in\nviolation of the provisions of this Chapter,\n  \n. . . if damages are assessed in such case judgment shall be\nrendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for treble the amount fixed by the verdict.”).\nTrade Secrets and Damages\n{315}\n     \nThe Court has also not dealt separately with the damages for theft of trade secrets.\n  \nThere are several\nreasons for that omission.\n  \nFirst, while there is some direct evidence of the purloining of documents or other\nwritten confidential information, the reality is that Hi-Lift hired the people from BPS/Sunbelt who had the\nexpertise to run an AWP business effectively and they hired the salesmen who knew the customers and the\nmarket.\n  \nPricing information was of fleeting long-term value as the market was intensely competitive.\n  \nShort-\nterm pricing or special account pricing was of more value.\n  \nMost of the information about fleet usage was in\nthe heads of the key management people hired away.\n  \nThey knew the essential needs to get up and running,\nand, if they did not, the salesmen who were hired knew the customer requirements.\n  \nUndoubtedly there were\ninstances in which Hi-Lift salesmen simply charged what they knew the customer was paying BPS/Sunbelt,\nbut the customer was free to provide them with that information in any event.\n{316}\n     \n \nThe damages resulting from the use of trade secrets also were subsumed in the damages the Court has\nfound to flow from the unfair competition.\n  \nIt was the orchestrated and deceptive solicitation of the\nemployees who possessed the key information and value that caused the damages.\n  \nThe information on\nutilization rates by market, average rental rates by market, and customer information, including credit\nworthiness, constituted information which one or more of the individuals hired by Hi-Lift carried in their\nheads and were a part of their work experience.\n  \nThe total usurpation of that knowledge base by unfairly\nusing insiders created the specific liability and damage.\n  \nThe use of the branch managers and department\nheads to recruit other “A Team” players could only have been accomplished by the use of confidential\ninformation about their skills and pay levels.\n  \nEach employee unfairly solicited by defendants brought with\nhim or her a piece of the BPS information bank needed to convert the customer base to Hi-Lift, at least on a\nshort-term basis.\n  \nIt is clear that defendants did not “independently develop” the information used when each\nbranch was started.\n  \nThere is no evidence that market surveys, pricing trend analyses, trade information,\nemployee interviews, advertisements for employees or upcoming construction work information was\ngathered by anyone at H&E in any of the new markets.\n  \nRather, all that information was readily available\nbecause of the orchestrated changeover of BPS employees to Hi-Lift.\n \nLaches\n{317}\n     \nThe Court must also examine the defendants’ defense of laches, as presented in this case.\n{318}\n     \nThe Court finds plaintiff’s claims are not barred by laches.\n{319}\n     \nThe doctrine of laches requires a showing that:\n  \n(1) the petitioner negligently failed to assert an\nenforceable right within a reasonable period of time, and (2) the propounder of the doctrine was prejudiced\nby the delay in bringing the action. \nCostin v. Shell\n, 53 N.C. App. 117, 120, 280 S.E.2d 42, 44 (1981) (citing\nBuilders Supplies v. Gainey\n, 282 N.C. 261, 192 S.E.2d 449 (1972); \nRape v. Lyerly\n, 287 N.C. 601, 215 S.E.2d\n737 (1975)).\n{320}\n     \nLaches is an equitable defense and is not available in actions at law; therefore plaintiff’s legal claims\nshould not be barred by laches.\n  \nCoppersmith v. Upton\n, 228 N.C. 545, 548, 46 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1948)\n(quoting\n U.S. v. Mack\n, 295 U.S. 480 (1935)) (“The doctrine of laches . . . is ordinarily regarded as an\nequitable defense, and it has been held that the plea is not tenable in a court of law and on a legal demand,\n‘the court being governed by the statute of limitations.’”)\n{321}\n     \nLaches is an affirmative defense and the burden of proof is on the party who pleads it. \nTaylor v. Raleigh\n,\n290 N.C. 608, 622, 227 S.E.2d 576, 584 (1976).\n \n{322}\n     \nThe facts and evidence show that the effects of defendants’ plan did not emerge until months after\nHepler and Kline’s departure.\n{323}\n     \nPlaintiff did not delay in initiating its lawsuit; it did so as soon as defendants’ plans were clear and when\nSunbelt took over at a closing of the purchase transaction.\n  \nDefendants, fully aware of BPS’s transitional\nperiod between execution of the contract and closing, took full advantage of it.\n{324}\n     \nDefendants cannot show that they were prejudiced by plaintiff’s alleged delay in the initiation of the\nlawsuit.\n{325}\n     \nThe statute of limitations applicable to a misappropriation of trade secrets claim is three years.\n  \nN.C.G.S.\n§\n  \n66-157.\n   \nPlaintiff commenced this action well before the expiration of this period.\n  \nSee, e.g., Creech v.\nCreech\n, 222 N.C. 656, 663, 24 S.E.2d 642, 647 (1943).\nCounterclaims\n{326}\n     \nIn its counterclaim, Defendant H&E has alleged among other things that Sunbelt “resented H&E’s lawful\nsuccess,” “wanted to avoid having to compete with H&E for employees and customers,” that “[Sunbelt’s\ncomplaint] allegations are patently false,” and that therefore this action is a “sham, filed solely for purposes\nof interfering with H&E’s relationships with its employees, customers and vendors.”\n{327}\n     \nH&E further alleges that Sunbelt, by filing a lawsuit, “unlawfully sought to intimidate, harass and scare\nsmaller H&E into wasting its resources and ceasing to lawfully recruit and hire Sunbelt’s employees, pursue\ncustomers and otherwise compete with Sunbelt.”\n{328}\n     \nDefendant H&E’s allegations in its counterclaims are not supported by the evidence.\n  \nThe findings of\nfact recited above are more than sufficient to justify the filing of a lawsuit.\n  \nMoreover, Defendant H&E has\nnot produced evidence that it was prevented from pursuing, recruiting and hiring Sunbelt’s employees,\npursuing customers and otherwise competing with Sunbelt.\n  \nTo the contrary, the significant evidence is that\nDefendant H&E in fact continued and continues to hire Sunbelt employees, has enjoyed remarkable success\nwith customers and has been extraordinarily profitable in short order.\n{329}\n     \nThe Court must also determine the fate of Defendant H&E’s \ncounterclaim against plaintiff, which alleges\nthat the filing of this lawsuit by Sunbelt is a “sham,” and was done solely for the purpose of interfering with\nH&E’s relationships with its employees, customers and vendors in violation of N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.\n \n{330}\n     \nInitially, the Court notes that Sunbelt’s claims are immunized by the\n \nNoerr-Pennington\n doctrine, which\nis derived from the First Amendment right to petition the government and immunizes legislative, executive\nand judicial activity from antitrust liability, even if the activity is designed to eliminate competition. \nSee, e.g.,\nUnited Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington\n, 381 U.S. 657 (1965) (holding that exercising the right to seek\nredress from the courts is immune from claims under state and federal anti-competitive statutes alleging\ninjury resulting from the mere prosecution of the lawsuit).\n{331}\n     \nSunbelt has a constitutional right to seek judicial redress of its injuries.\n  \nSunbelt’s allegations in the\nComplaint were well grounded in law and fact, and the evidence presented at trial has shown that defendants\norchestrated mass resignations of managers and employees of BPS and diverted business to H&E’s new\noffices using confidential and proprietary information of BPS.\n  \nSunbelt has stated valid claims and, as a\nmatter of law, cannot be held liable under Chapter 75 for any incidental effects the lawsuit may have had on\nH&E Hi-Lift’s business. \nSee, e.g., Static Control Components, Inc. v. Darkprint Imaging, Inc.\n, 2001 WL\n293661 (M.D.N.C., Feb. 9, 2001); \nMerck & Co., Inc. v. Lyon\n, 941 F.Supp. 1443, 1447 (M.D.N.C. 1996);\nByrd’s,\n 142 N.C. App. 371, 542 S.E.2d 689.\n{332}\n     \nTherefore, in light of the findings of fact as set forth above, the Court concludes that Sunbelt brought this\nsuit with the realistic expectation that its claims would succeed against the defendants, that the suit was\n“reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome,” and that therefore the suit is immunized under the\nNoerr-Pennington \nDoctrine. \nSee Baltimore Scrap Corp. v. The David Joseph Co.\n, 237 F.3d 394 (4\nth\nCir.2001) (“If an objective party can conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable\noutcome, the suit is immunized under \nNoerr\n, and an antitrust claim premised on the sham exception must\nfail.”).\n{333}\n     \nNevertheless, the \nNoerr-Pennington\n Doctrine does contain a “sham” exception, and, in order to\ndetermine whether Defendant H&E can succeed on its counterclaim, the Court must determine if it has met\nthe two prongs of that exception: \n(1) whether H&E has shown that no reasonable litigant could realistically\nexpect success on the merits of the claims involved here; and (2) whether H&E has shown that Sunbelt\nsubjectively\n lacked a reasonable belief that it could succeed on the merits and brought this case for an\nimproper or malicious purpose. \nSee Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries,\nInc.\n, 508 U.S. 49 (1993) (“\nPRE\n”).\n{334}\n     \nDefendants have presented no facts or evidence to show that Sunbelt subjectively believed the lawsuit\nwas anything but a valid and legal claim for damages caused by the defendants.\n  \nCertainly there has been no\nevidence that this lawsuit was brought for any improper purpose.\n \nSee also, U\nnited States v. Ward\n, 618 F.\nSupp. 884 (E.D.N.C. 1985) (“A party to a lawsuit has a right to use the procedures of the courts to advocate\nits position, even if such activities cause direct injuries to competitors . . . . Only actions undertaken without\na genuine intent to influence the outcome of the dispute being adjudicated are a sham.”)\n{335}\n     \nFurthermore, defendants have not presented evidence showing that the lawsuit is objectively baseless, or\na “sham.”\n  \nSunbelt’s evidence of H&E’s wrongful actions has been detailed and specific.\n  \nAs set forth above\nin the Court’s findings of fact, Sunbelt has shown sufficient evidence for the Court to find defendants liable\nto Sunbelt for damages on its claims.\n  \nTherefore, it follows that Defendant H&E has shown no evidence that\nSunbelt’s allegations are objectively baseless.\n  \nPRE\n, 508 U.S. at 60.\n  \nAs such, H&E’s counterclaim must be\ndismissed.\n{336}\n     \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendant H&E’s counterclaim fails and is therefore dismissed.\nIII.\nCONCLUSION\n{337}\n     \nThe Court concludes that the application of treble damages is appropriate in this case. It is necessary to\nprevent defendants and others from profiting from unfair practices. Defendants’ actions were deliberate and\ntaken to gain business advantage. Rather than compete in a fair manner, defendants orchestrated the\nclandestine raid of BPS by the branch managers while the sale to Sunbelt was still pending. The massive\nnature of the raid facilitated the achievement of the critical mass necessary for profitability. Defendants have\nbenefited from their actions, establishing a viable and profitable business overnight. While they would likely\nhave been successful in the long run, their unfair practices accelerated and enhanced their success. The\nimposition of treble damages where unfair actions are taken to maximize profits serves the specific purpose\nfor which the treble damage provisions were enacted. The fact that defendants tried to hide their actions by\nproviding less than truthful testimony has also contributed to the Court’s decision.\n{338}\n     \nFinal judgment will not be entered in this matter until any motion for attorney fees has been heard.\n \nPlaintiff will have thirty days from today’s date to file a motion for attorney fees with supporting\ndocumentation, and defendants will have thirty days after service to respond.\n  \nThe Court will then enter a\njudgment.\n{339}\n     \nSO ORDERED this 2nd day of May 2003.\n \n \n \nBen F. Tennille\nSpecial Superior Court Judge\n   \nfor Complex Business Cases\n \nBruckman, Rosser and Sherrill (“BRS”) is an equity investment partnership.\n[2]\n The sale of Plant Services is discussed more fully elsewhere in this opinion."
