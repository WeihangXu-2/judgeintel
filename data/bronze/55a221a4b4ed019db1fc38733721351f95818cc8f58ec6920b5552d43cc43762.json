The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motions. \n3. Plaintiffs New Friendship Used Clothing Collection, LLC (“New \nFriendship”), AD &D Partners, LLC (“AD&D ”), Daniel P. Green (“Green”), Alex \nHusted (“Husted”), and David J.R. Milliner (“Milliner”) (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) \nfiled their Verified Complaint on December 2, 2016 and their Verified First Amended \nComplaint (the “Amended Complaint”) on March 20, 2017.      \n4. This action was designated as a mandatory complex business case by order \nof the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated December 5, 2016 \nand assigned to the undersigned by order of Chief Business Court Judge James L. \nGale dated December 6, 2016.  \n5. On April 21, 2017, Katz filed his answer to the Amended Complaint (“Katz’s \nAnswer”).   \n6. On April 24, 2017, Katz filed his motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \nof the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”).   \n7. On May 8, 2017, Greenfield and Friendship filed their motion to dismiss \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).   \n \n \n8. The Motions have been fully briefed, and the Court held a he aring on the \nMotions on July 19, 2017.  The Motions are now ripe for resolution.  \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. The Parties \n9. New Friendship is a North Carolina limited liability company with its \nregistered office in Wake County, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 6, ECF No. 21.)   \n10. AD&D is a New Jersey limited liability company with its principal place of \nbusiness in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.  ( ECF No. 21  at ¶ 7 .)  Green, Husted, and \nMilliner are equal members of AD&D.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 17.)  AD&D, Green, Husted, \nand Milliner are collectively referred to herein as the “AD&D Plaintiffs.” \n11. Friendship is a North Carolina limited liability company with its registered \nand principal office in Wake County, North Carolina.  ( ECF No. 21 at ¶ 13.)  Susan \nGreenfield, who is not a party to this action, is Greenfield’s wife and the sole member \nand manager of Friendship.  ( ECF No. 21 at ¶ 36.)  Plaintiffs allege that Greenfield \noperates Friendship and is effectively its manager.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 38−39.)     \nB. AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz Enter into a Joint Venture \n12. Used clothing wholesalers place containers or donation bins in shopping \ncenter parking lots, periodically collect their contents, and then transport the \ncontents to a warehouse where the contents are sold to  domestic or overseas sorting \nfacilities and retailers.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 19.)  The wholesale trade of used clothing is \nestimated to be a $3 billion industry.  ( ECF No. 21 at ¶ 20.)  Green, Husted, and \n \n \nMilliner sought to join this industry by identifying  and acquiring  existing used \nclothing businesses.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 21.)     \n13. In December 2015, Green, Husted, and Milliner  formed AD&D for the \npurpose of exploring business opportunities in the wholesale used clothing industry.  \n(ECF No. 21 at ¶ 18.)  For this purpose, Green, Husted, and Milliner had developed \nfinancial models to evaluate potential acquisitions of used clothing businesses by \nusing company data and subjecting it to varied sensitivity assumptions and \nstatistical modeling in order to justify a  valuation, forecast performance, and obtain \nfinancing.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 22.)   \n14. In February 2016, AD&D Plaintiffs attended the annual Secondary \nMaterials and Recycled Textiles (“SMART”) conference in Florida to explore potential \nbusiness opportunities.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 26−27.)  At that time, Katz was chairman \nof SMART’s Bin Committee.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 29.)  Although AD&D Plaintiffs had \npreviously spoken with Katz on a conference call, AD&D Plaintiffs first met Katz in \nperson at the SMART conference.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 30.)  Katz’s family has been in \nthe used clothing business for decades, operating over 2,000 collection bins in more \nthan six states.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 28.)  \n15.  After the SMART conference, Katz expressed to AD& D Plaintiffs his \ninterest in consolidating the wholesale used clothing industry.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 31.)  \nAfter hea ring about AD&D Plaintiffs’ goals and the financial models they had \ndeveloped, Katz sought to establish a business bond with AD&D Plaintiffs.  (ECF No. \n21 at ¶ 32.)  Soon thereafter, AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz were working together to \n \n \nidentify and jointly acquire suitable businesses.  ( ECF No. 21 at ¶ 33.)  Due to their \njoint efforts, AD&D Plaintiffs shared their financial models with Katz  and provided \nKatz with full access to their password -protected, shared computer drive containing \nall proprietary work files in connection with each proposed acquisition.  (ECF No. 21 \nat ¶¶ 34, 50.) \nC. AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz Pursue Acquisition of Friendship \n16. Katz id entified and brought Friendship to AD&D Plaintiffs’ attention.  \n(ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 35.)  Plaintiffs allege that Katz had previously spoken with \nGreenfield about purchasing Friendship, but that Katz had been unable to do so \nwithout AD&D Plaintiffs’ financial models.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 42−43.) \n17. In June 2016, AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz negotiated with Greenfield about \na possible acquisition of Friendship while simultaneously exploring other \nopportunities in various states.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶¶ 44−45.)  At this time, AD&D \nPlaintiffs, Katz, and Greenfield entered into nondisclosure agreements regarding \ntheir negotiations over the acquisition of Friendship.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 47.) \n18. In August 2016, AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz traveled to North Carolina and \nmet with Greenfield to discuss the acquisition of Friendship.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 48.) \n19. On August 18, 2016, Green e -mailed Greenfield a proposal under which \nAD&D Plaintiffs and Katz would purchase Friendship.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 53.)  Under \nthe proposal, the purchase price was to be partially financed by a note.  (ECF No. 21 \nat ¶ 53.) \n \n \n20. On August 19, 2016, Green and Greenfield discussed the proposal by \ntelephone.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 54.)  Later that same day, Green e -mailed another \nproposal to Greenfield that stated a higher purchase price, which was still to be \npartially financed by a note.  ( ECF No. 21 at ¶ 55.)  Greenfield responded by e -mail \nstating “[e]verything seems [to] be acceptable.  I would like to sleep on it tonight and \nmake sure this is the right mo ve for me and my wife.  Let’s plan on getting the ball \nrolling on Monday morning.”  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 56 (second alteration in original).)   \n21. On August 22, 2016, Greenfield called Green stating that he agreed to the \nterms of the August 19 proposal.  ( ECF No. 21 at ¶ 57.)  Thereafter, Green e-mailed \nHusted, Milliner, and Katz stating “[Greenfield] called, some detail questions but he’s \nhappy and we have a deal!”  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 58.)  That same day, Greenfield again \ncalled Green to confirm the deal, and they agreed to negotiate the acquisition terms \nthat remained open.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 59.)  Greenfield told Green that he wanted to \nclose the acquisition by September 30, 2016.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 59.)  Green agreed \nthat AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz would aim to close the acquisition by that date.  (ECF \nNo. 21 at ¶ 59.)   \n22. AD&D Plaintiffs’ counsel drafted an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) for \nthe acquisition of Friendship.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 60.)  Plaintiffs allege that “[t]he [APA] \nprovides a blueprint for the acquisition of a used clothing business and incorporates \nconfidential and proprietary strategies that the AD&D Plaintiffs have developed over \ntime for acquiring such businesses, which are not generally known to others. ”  (ECF \nNo. 21 at ¶ 67.)   \n \n \n23. On September 1, 2016, AD&D Plaintiffs’ counsel e -mailed a draft APA to \nGreenfield’s counsel  for AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz’s purchase of Friendship , and \nGreen e-mailed a copy of the draft to Greenfield.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 61.)  Plaintiffs \nallege that the draft  APA contained all the material  terms of the acquisition and \nprovided for a closing date of September 30, 2016.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 62.)  \n24. From September 1, 2016 through September 19, 2016, the parties \nnegotiated the APA, and AD&D Plaintiffs and their counsel created revised versions \nof the APA and sent them to Greenfield.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 63.)  During this time, \nGreenfield repeatedly stated that he expected to complete the deal with  AD&D \nPlaintiffs and Katz and close by September 30, 2016.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 64.) \n25. During the ir negotiations with Greenfield , Green, Husted, Milliner , and \nKatz formed New Friendship for the sole purpose of acquiring Friendship.  (ECF No. \n21 at ¶ 72.)  On September 12, 2016, New Friendship’s Articles of Organization were \nfiled, identifying Green, Husted, Milliner, and Katz as New Friendship’s members.  \n(ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 74−75.)   \n26. Plaintiffs allege that, in August and September 2016, Green, Husted, \nMilliner, and Katz discussed the terms of a potential operating agreement for New \nFriendship and exchanged drafts thereof.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 76.)  In the midst of these \ndiscussions, on September 19, 2016, Green e-mailed Katz stating that Green, Husted, \nand Milliner did not think further economic changes to the draft operating agreement \nin Katz’s favor were warranted.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 89.)  An operating agreement was \nnever executed.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 77.)     \n \n \nD. Katz Pursues Acquisition of Friendship \n27. On or before September 20, 2016, Katz called Greenfield, and Greenfield \nsuggested that Katz purchase Friendship for himself.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 90.) \n28. On September 20, 2016, Katz e -mailed Greenfield a draft term sheet \nproposing that a company controlled by Katz, K4 Ventures Inc. (“K4”), acquire \nFriendship.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 93.)  That same day, Greenfield forwarded Kat z’s e-\nmail to Susan Greenfield.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 94.)   \n29. On September 21, 2016, Katz responded to Green’s September 19 e -mail \nstating, in part, “I was deeply disappointed by your note.  I gave it considerable \nthought over the last two days.  It is apparent  to me that our goals and vision for a \npotential partnership are not aligned on the key issues.”  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 95.)  That \nsame day, Green responded to Katz’s e -mail stating, in part, “[w]hile we are \ndisappointed in your conclusion, we accept that you had a different view of a business \nrelationship than we did.”  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 97.)  Further, Green warned Katz in the \ne-mail not to use AD&D Plaintiffs’ trade secrets or otherwise interfere with the \nacquisition of Friendship by AD&D Plaintiffs or New Frie ndship.  ( ECF No. 21 at  \n¶¶ 96−97.)  Additionally, AD&D Plaint iffs withdrew Katz’s access to the  shared \ncomputer drive containing their confidential and proprietary information.  (ECF No. \n21 at ¶ 117.)  \n30. On September 22, 2016, Greenfield e -mailed Katz and st ated “I will be \ncalling [Green] this morning, you may hear from him soon.  I will not mention our \ntentative deal.  I am just going to say that I am not comfortable with the [promissory] \n \n \nnote.”  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 101.)  Later that day, Plaintiffs allege that Greenfield called \nGreen and, consistent with his e -mail to Katz, stated that he was uncomfortable \nfinancing part of the purchase price with a note and would not proceed with the \nacquisition of Friendship unless the purchase price was entirely financed wit h cash.  \n(ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 102.)  Plaintiffs allege that Greenfield did not inform Green that \nKatz was pursuing an acquisition of Friendship and concealed his true reason for \nrenouncing the agreed-upon terms of AD&D Plaintiffs’ acquisition —that Greenfield \nhad a tentative deal with Katz , under which Greenfield believed he would receive \nmore money than under AD&D Plaintiffs’ offer.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 102, 108.)   \n31. Also on September 22, 2016, Katz and Greenfield exchanged a series of e -\nmails relating to the potential acquisition of Friendship by Katz.  Katz e-mailed \nGreen two updated term sheet s, and Greenfield e -mailed Katz the most recent \nversion of the APA that had been prepared by AD&D Plaintiff s.  ( ECF No. 21 at  \n¶¶ 103, 109, 122.)  Additionally, Greenfield put Katz in contact with Greenfield’s and \nFriendship’s banker at SunTrust so that Katz could obtain a loan to finance the \nacquisition.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 104.)  In order to expedite Katz securing a loan, Susan \nGreenfield, at Greenfield’s request, e -mailed Friendship’s financial information \ndirectly to SunTrust.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 105−07.)   \n32. On September 26, 2016, Greenfield forwarded Susan Greenfield an e-mail \nfrom Katz that described their negotiations of Katz’s acquisition of Friendship.  (ECF \nNo. 21 at ¶ 124.)  The e -mail included numerous attachments, including versions of \n \n \nthe APA prepared by AD&D Plaintiffs that had been revised to facilitate Kat z’s \nacquisition.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 124.) \n33. On September 27, 2016, Greenfield e -mailed Katz stating that he planned \nto call Green the next day to tell Green that he had another offer to purchase \nFriendship.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 110.) \n34. On September 28, 2016, Greenfield called Green and informed Green that \nanother party offered to acquire Friendship.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 111.)  Greenfield \nrefused to tell AD&D Plaintiffs that the other party was Katz.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 111.)   \n35. On October 24, 2016, AD&D Plaintiffs filed an action against Katz in \nfederal court in Pennsylvania.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 132.)  Greenfield received a copy of \nAD&D Plaintiffs’ complaint by e-mail.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 133.) \n36. On October 28, 2016, Greenfield forwarded Susan Greenfield an e -mail \nfrom Katz tha t contained revised  versions of the APA that had been prepared by \nAD&D Plaintiffs and drafts of exhibits to the APA.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 125.) \n37. On October 30, 2016, Susan Greenfield e-mailed Greenfield her comments \nand questions about the APA , specifically me ntioning that Katz was being sued by \nAD&D Plaintiffs.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 135.) \n38. On December 16, 2016, SunTrust agreed to loan Katz the necessary funds \nto acquire Friendship.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 141.) \n39. On February 6, 2017, Katz resigned as a manager of New Friendship.  (ECF \nNo. 21 at ¶ 88.) \n \n \n \nE. Claims for Relief \n40. On July 24, 2017, Green, Husted, and Milliner voluntarily dismissed their \nclaims for misappropriation of trade secrets and conversion.   (ECF No. 45.)   The \nvoluntary dismissal states that “Plaintiffs’ po sition now is that Plaintiff [AD&D] \nexclusively owns the trade secrets and tangible property at issue in the trade secret \nand conversion claims.”  (ECF No. 45.)  As a result, the Amended Complaint asserts \nthe following claims for relief:  \n Misappropriation of trade secrets, brought by AD&D against Katz  \n(“First Claim”), (Am. Compl. 20, ECF No. 21);  \n Conversion, brought by AD&D against Katz (“Second Claim”), (ECF \nNo. 21 at 24);  \n Breach of fiduciary duty, brought by AD&D Plaintiffs against Katz  \n(“Third Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 25); \n Constructive fraud, brought by AD&D Plaintiffs against Katz  \n(“Fourth Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 26);  \n Breach of fiduciary duty, brought by New Friendship against Katz  \n(“Fifth Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 27);  \n Constructive fraud, brought by New Friendship against Katz (“Sixth \nClaim”), (ECF No. 21 at 28);  \n Tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, brought \nby all Plaintiffs against Katz (“Seventh Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 29);  \n \n \n Unfair and deceptive trade practices (“UDTP”), brought by all \nPlaintiffs against Katz (“Eighth Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 30);  \n Misappropriation of trade secrets, brought by AD&D against \nGreenfield and Friendship (“Ninth Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 31);  \n Conversion, brought by AD&D against Greenfield and Friendshi p \n(“Tenth Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 33);  \n Breach of the duty to negotiate in good faith, brought by all Plaintiffs \nagainst Greenfield and Friendship (“Eleventh Claim”), (ECF No. 21 \nat 34);  \n Aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, brought by all \nPlaintiffs against Greenfield and Friendship (“Twelfth Claim”), (ECF \nNo. 21 at 36);  \n Aiding and abetting constructive fraud, brought by all Plaintiffs \nagainst Greenfield and Friendship  (“Thirteenth Claim”), ( ECF No. \n21 at 38); \n Civil conspiracy, brought by all Plaintiffs against all Defendants  \n(“Fourteenth Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 40); and  \n UDTP, brought by all Plaintiffs against Greenfield and Friendship  \n(“Fifteenth Claim”), (ECF No. 21 at 41).  \n41. Katz’s Motion seeks dismissal of all claims brought by Green, Huste d, and \nMilliner on the grounds that they lack standing (Third, Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Claims).  (Partial Mot. Dismiss Pls.’ First Am. Compl. by Def. Katz ¶ 1 , \n \n \nECF No. 32.)  Katz’s Motion further seeks to dismiss all claims brought by AD&D and \nAD&D Plaintiffs, (ECF No. 32 at  ¶ 2), and New Friendship’s claims for tortious \ninterference with prospective economic advantage (Seventh Claim), UDTP (Eighth \nClaim), and civil conspiracy (Fourteenth Claim), (ECF No. 32 at ¶ 3).   \n42. Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion seeks dismissal of all claims asserted \nagainst Greenfield and Friendship  for failure to state a claim .  (Defs. Greenfield & \nFriendship’s Mot. Dismiss 1 , ECF No. 35 .)  In the alternative, Greenfield and \nFriendship’s Motion seeks to dismiss all claims brought by Green, Husted, and \nMilliner on the grounds that they lack standing  (Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth, \nFourteenth, and Fifteenth Claims).  (ECF No. 35 at 1.)             \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \n43. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6 ), the Court \nreviews the allegations of the Amended Complaint  in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs.  The Court’s inquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the \ncomplaint, treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which rel ief may be \ngranted under some legal theory.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank of N.C., 85 N.C. App. \n669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).  The Court construes the Amended Complaint \nliberally and accepts all factual allegations as true.  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. \n572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009).   The Court is not required “to accept as true \nallegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005).  The Court can also ignore \n \n \na party’s legal conclusions set forth in its pleading.  McCrann v. Pinehurst, LLC, 225 \nN.C. App. 368, 377, 737 S.E.2d 771, 777 (2013). \n44. Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12 (b)(6) is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports [the] claim; (2) when the complaint \nreveals on its face the absence of fact s ufficient to make a good claim;  [or] (3) when \nsome fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the . . . claim.”  Oates v. JAG, \nInc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985); see also Jackson v. Bumgardner, \n318 N.C. 172, 175, 347 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1986).  Otherwise, “a complaint should not \nbe dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff is entitled \nto no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.”  \nSutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) (emphasis omitted). \nIV. ANALYSIS \nA. Timeliness of Katz’s Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim \n45. As an initial matter, the Court is confronted with an issue on which there \nis no decisional guidance  from our appellate courts .  Plaintiffs argue that Katz’s \nMotion for failure to state a claim  should be denied because it was  filed after Katz \nfiled his answer to the Amended Complaint and, as a result, it is untimely under Rule \n12(b).  (Pls.’ Br. Resp. Defs.’ Mots. Dismiss 4−5, ECF No. 41.) \n46. Rule 12(b) provides that “[e]very defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief \nin any pleading  . . . shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is \nrequired[.]”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(b).  At the same time, a defense of failure \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted may be made by motion.  Id.  A \n \n \nmotion asserting such defense, however, “shall be made before pleading if a further \npleading is permitted.”  Id. (emphasis added).  Therefore, under the express language \nof Rule 12(b), a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim must be made \nbefore filing a responsive pleading .  If a party fails to make a Rule 12(b) motion for \nfailure to state a claim before filing a responsive pleading, however, the defense is not \nwaived; rather, the party may raise the defense: (1)  in any pleading permitted or \nordered under Rule 7(a); (2) by motion for judgment on the pleadings ; or (3) at trial.  \nId. § 1A-1, Rules 12(b), 12(h)(2). \n47. The North Carolina Rules are modeled after the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure (“Federal Rule(s)”).  Sutton, 277 N.C. at 99, 176 S.E.2d at 164 .  Decisions \nunder the Federal Rules are pertinent for guidance in interpreting the North Carolina \nRules, and it is customary for North Carolina courts to look to such decisions in \ninterpreting the North Carolina Rules.  Bryson v. Sullivan, 330 N.C. 644, 655, 412 \nS.E.2d 327, 332 (1992); Dickens v. Puryear, 302 N.C. 437, 442, 276 S.E.2d 325, 329 \n(1981). \n48. Similar to Nor th Carolina Rule 12(b), Federal Rule 12(b)  provides that \n“[e]very defense to a claim for relief in any pleading must be asserted in the \nresponsive pleading if one is required[,]” but that a defense for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief can be gran ted may be made by motion.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).  As \nunder North Carolina Rule 12(b),  a motion under Federal Rule 12(b) for failure to \nstate a claim “must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.”  Id. \n(emphasis added).  Moreover, like North Carolina Rule 12(h)(2), if a party fails to \n \n \nmake a motion under Federal Rule 12(b) for failure to state a claim  before filing a \nresponsive pleading, then the party may raise the defense: (1) in any pleading under \nFederal Rule 7(a); (2) by motion for judgment on the pleadings ; or (3) at trial.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(h)(2).  Therefore, federal decisions interpreting Federal Rules 12(b) and \n12(h) are instructive on this Court’s interpretation of Rules 12(b) and 12(h) of the \nNorth Carolina Rules.   \n49. Despite the clear language of Federal Rule 12(b) that a motion asserting a \ndefense listed therein must be made before filing a responsive pleading , various \nfederal courts have applied the timing provision differently.  Some federal courts have \nallowed a defendant to simultaneously file an answer to the complaint and a motion \nto dismiss for failure to state a claim  under Federal Rule 12(b).  See Beary v. West \nPubl’g Co. , 763 F.2d 66, 68  (2d Cir. 1985) (stating that plaintiff’s contention that \ndefendant waived its right to file a Federal Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure \nto state a claim by filing an answer was frivolous as “nothing in [Federal Rule 12(b)] \nprohibits the filing of a motion to d ismiss with an answer”); Beebe v. Williams Coll., \n430 F. Supp. 2d 18, 21  (D. Mass. 2006)  (stating that although it was technically \nimproper for defendant to file an answer and simultaneously move to dismiss  for \nfailure to state a claim, the error was immaterial because the defense was mentioned \nin the answer); Kuhlmeier v. Hazelwood Sch. Dist., 578 F. Supp. 1286, 1290 (E.D. Mo. \n1984) (“[T]he preferred rule to apply in situations where a defendant files his \n[Federal] Rule 12(b) motion simultaneously with his answer is that the motion should \n \n \nbe view[ed] as having preceded the answer and thus as having been interposed in a \ntimely fashion.” (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted)).   \n50. Additionally, some federal courts have allowed a defendant to file a  post-\nanswer Federal Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss as long as the defendant raised the \ndefense in his answer.  See Puckett v. United States , 82 F. Supp. 2d 660, 663  (S.D. \nTex. 1999) (“ Technically, a post -answer [Federal] Rule 12(b)(6) motion is untimely \nand some other vehicle, such as a motion for judgment on the pleadings or for \nsummary judgment, must be used to challenge the failure to state a claim for relief.  \nHowever, c ourts do not mechanically or routinely deny any motion made after a \nresponsive pleading as untimely.  If the defendant has previously included in the \nanswer the defense raised in the motion, thereby giving notice, then courts generally \nallow [Federal] Rule 12(b)(6)  motions filed after the answer. ” (citation omitted) \n(quotation marks omitted)); Stein v. Kent State Univ. Bd. Trs., 994 F. Supp. 898, 902 \n(N.D. Ohio 1998) (“While normally a party must file a [Federal] Rule 12(b)(6) motion \nbefore filing an answer, or simultaneously with filing the responsive pleading, courts \nhave allowed untimely motions if the defense has been pre viously included in the \nanswer.” (quotation marks omitted) ); Lugo-Modesto v. Balmaceda , No. 94 -\n2634(DRD), 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23336, at *10−11  (D.P.R. July 7, 1997) (“Courts \nin this circuit have held that t he post-answer filing of a motion to dismiss under \n[Federal Rule] 12(b)(6) does not warrant the denial of said motion where the \ndefendant, as here, has raised as an affirmative defense the allegation that the \ncomplaint fails to state a claim.”).  See generally 5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur \n \n \nR. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1361 (3d ed. 2004) (“A strict interpretation \nof the timing provision’s language leads to the conclusion that the district judge must \ndeny any [Federal] Rule 12(b) motion made after a responsive pleading is interposed \nas being too late.  However, federal courts have allowed untimely [Federal Rule 12(b)] \nmotions if the defense has been previously included in the answer.”).       \n51. Conversely, other federal courts, including the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and the North Carolina federal district courts, have held that a Federal Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss filed after an answer is untimely and, in accordance with \nFederal Rule 12(h)(2), construe such motion as a motion for judgment on the \npleadings under Federal Rule 12(c).  See Burbach Broad. Co. v. Elkins Radio Corp. , \n278 F.3d 401, 405  (4th Cir. 2002) (construing defendant’s post-answer Federal Rule \n12(b)(6) motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule 12(c)); \nDixon v. Prudential Prime Props., No. 4:16-CV-233-D, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60068, \nat *9 n.3 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 10, 2017) (“A party must file a [Federal] Rule 12(b)(6) motion \nbefore filing its answer.

Strach, 216 F. Supp. 3d 597, 613 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (“Where . . . Defendants have \nfiled an Answer, a [Federal] Rule 12(b)(6) motion should be viewed as a [Federal] \nRule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (quotation marks omitted) ); \nLockhart v. Coastal Int’l Sec., Inc., 905 F. Supp. 2d 105, 112 (D.D.C. 2012) (construing \na post-answer Federal Rule 12(b) motion as a motion for judgment on the pleadings); \n \n \nXerox Corp. v. Apple Comput. , Inc., 734 F. Supp. 1542, 1543  (N.D. Cal. 1990)  (“An \nuntimely motion to dismiss is treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings. ”); \nPaul v. McGhee, 577 F. Supp. 460, 462 (E.D. Tenn. 1983) (“Since defendants answered \nthe complaint before submitting the [Federal Rule] 12(b)(6) motion, the motion is \nuntimely.  Therefore, the Court will consider def endants’ motion as a motion for  \njudgment on the pleadings under [Federal Rule 12(c)].”). \n52. Katz argues that this line of federal decisions  under Federal Rule 12(b) —\nthat is, the treatment of a post -answer motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim \nas a motion for judgment on the pleadings—does not apply to Rule 12(b) of the North \nCarolina Rules.  (Reply Br. Supp. Partial Mot. Dismiss 2 n.1 , ECF No. 42 .)  Katz \ncontends that this principle does not apply because , unlike Federal Rule 12(b),  the \nthird sentence of North Carolina Rule 12(b) provides —after stating that a motion \nasserting any defense listed in Rule 12(b)(1)−(7) shall be made before pleading—that \n“[t]he consequences of failure to make such a motion shall be as provided in sections \n(g) and (h).”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule 12(b).  As discussed above, however, both \nFederal Rule 12(h)(2) and North Carolina Rule 12(h)(2) provide that the defense of \nfailure to state a claim may be made in any pleading under Rule 7(a), by motion for \njudgment on the pleadings, or at trial.  Indeed, the basis on which federal courts have \ntreated post-answer motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim as motions for \njudgment on the plead ings is the language set forth in Federal Rule 12(h)(2).  See, \ne.g., Dixon, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60068, at *9 n.3  (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2) ); \n \n \nLockhart, 905 F. Supp. 2d at 112 (same); Paul, 577 F. Supp. at 462 (same).  Further, \nthe comment to North Carolina Rule 12 states:  \nThe third sentence in section (b) has as its purpose the clarification of \nthe preceding sentence.  Ordinarily, of course, a motion making any of \nthe listed defenses should be made before pleading.  But the failure to \ndo so is not preclusive in all circumstances and as to all defenses, as \nsections (g) and (h) of this rule make clear.  \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule 12 cmt.   The Court does not agree with Katz that the \nadditional clarifying language in North Carolina Rule 12(b), which states that Rules \n12(g) and 12(h) provide the consequences of failing to make a timely motion under \nRule 12(b) , precludes treating an untimely Rule 12(b)(6) motion as a Rule 12(c) \nmotion—as Rule 12(h)(2) expressly provides.            \n53. The Court concludes that, under the express language of Rule 12(b), and in \nthe absence of case law from our appellate courts interpreting such language to mean \notherwise, a Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim  must be filed \nprior to an answer.  The Court further concludes that, under Rules 12(b) and 12(h)(2), \na post -answer Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may, if \nappropriate, be considered as a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings.     \n54. Here, Katz filed his answer to the Amended Complaint on April 21, 2017.  \nThe answer asserts as a first defense “Motion to Dismiss Under Rule 12(b)(6).”  \n(Answer 29, ECF No. 31.)  Thereafter, on April 24, 2017, Katz filed his Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss and a brief in support.  Pursuant to Rule 7.2 of the General Rules \nof Practice and Procedure for the North Carolina Business Court (“BCR”), all motions \nmust be set out in a separate document.  Therefore, to the extent that Katz argues \n \n \nthat the Rule 12(b)(6) defense asserted in his answer is a timely Rule 12(b) motion, it \nis not a proper motion under BCR 7.2.  As a result, a motion to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim was not before this Court until Katz’s Motion was filed on April 24, \n2017—three days after Katz filed his answer.  Therefore, Katz’s Motion is untimely.     \n55. Katz nonetheless argues that his motion was timely filed by the deadline \nset forth in the Court’s April 18 , 2017 Case Management Order.  (Reply Br. 3, ECF \nNo. 42.)  Under the Case Management Order, the parties were to file all motions to \ndismiss or other preliminary or pre-discovery motions on or before May 31, 2017.  This \ndeadline, however, does not obviate application of the Rules, which plainly state that \na Rule 12(b) motion for failure to state a claim must be made before filing an answer.   \n56. Therefore, Katz’s Motion, to the extent it seeks dismissal for failure to state \na claim, is untimely under Rule 12(b) .  Accordingly, the Court addresses whether \nKatz’s Motion may properly be considered as a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the \npleadings.   \n57. “After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, \nany party may move for judgment on the pleadings.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule \n12(c).  “[T]he pleadings are not closed until all defendants have filed an answer, even \nwhen one defendant has filed a motion to dismiss instead of answering.”  Garvey v. \nSeterus, Inc., No. 5:16-cv-00209-RLV, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97373, at *35 (W.D.N.C. \nJune 23, 2017) (alteration in original); see also Gillespie v. City of Battle Creek , 100 \nF. Supp. 3d 623, 628  (W.D. Mich. 2015) (stating that the pleadings were not closed \nbecause one defendant had not filed an answer); E. Coast Test Prep  LLC v. \n \n \nAllnurses.com, Inc., No. 15-3705 (JRT/JSM), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176900, at *2 (D. \nMinn. Dec. 20, 2016) (“Some courts have exercised discretion to allow a motion for \njudgment on the pleadings before all defendants ha ve answered in only limited \ncircumstances, such as when a p laintiff fails to serve one of the defendants. ” \n(quotation marks omitted)); Moran v. Peralta Cmty. Coll. Dist., 825 F. Supp. 891, 894 \n(N.D. Cal. 1993) (“[Federal Rule] 12(c) motions may not be brought until the pleadings \nare closed.  Ordinarily, this means that a [Federal] Rule 12(c) motion must await the \nanswers of all defendants.”). \n58. Here, Greenfield and Friendship have not filed an answer to the Amended \nComplaint and, thus, the pleadings are not closed.  As a result, the Court cannot \nconstrue Katz’s Motion as one for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).  \nSee Garvey, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97373, at *34−35  (concluding that defendant’s \nFederal Rule 12(c) motion was premature because not all defendants had filed \nanswers to the complaint and denying such motion without prejudice); see also \nGillespie, 100 F. Supp. 3d at 628  (concluding that defendants’ Federal Rule 12(c) \nmotion was premature because not all defendants had filed answers to the complaint, \nbut nevertheless considering the motion as a post -answer Federal Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion).  Therefore, the Court denies Katz’s Motion , to the extent it seeks dismissal \nof any of Plaintiffs’ claims for failure to state a claim, without prejudice to refiling the \nmotion under Rule 12(c) after the pleadings are closed. \n \n \n \n \nB. Green, Husted, and Milliner’s Standing \n59. Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion seeks dismissal of Green, Husted, and \nMilliner’s claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing.   (Defs. Greenfield & \nFriendship’s Mot. Dismiss 1 , ECF No. 35 .)  Likewise, Katz’s Motion alternatively \nmoves to dismiss Green, Husted, and Milliner’s claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) on \nthe grounds that they lack stand ing.  (Partial Mot. Dismiss 1 n.1 , ECF No. 32 .)  \nUnlike a Rule 12(b) motion for failure to state a claim, Rule 12(h)(3) provides that \n“[w]henever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks \njurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 1A -1, Rule 12(h)(3).  “Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court’s proper \nexercise of subject matter jurisdiction.”  Neuse River Found., Inc. v. Smithfield Foods, \nInc., 155 N.C. App. 110, 113, 574 S.E.2d 48, 51 (2002).  Therefore, the Court properly \nconsiders Katz’s Motion to the extent it seeks to dismiss Green, Husted, and Milliner’s \nclaims for lack of standing under Rule 12(b)(1).   \n60. Defendants argue that Green, Husted, and Milliner do not have standing \nto assert any claims against Defendants because all claims belong to AD&D or New \nFriendship.  (Br. Supp. Partial Mot. Dismiss by Def. Katz 7−10 , ECF No. 33 ; Mem. \nSupp. Defs. Greenfield & Friendship’s Mot. Dismiss 6−7 , ECF No. 36 .)  It is a well -\nsettled principle of North Carolina law that shareholders of a corporation cannot \npursue individual causes of action for wrongs or injuries to the corporation.  Barger \nv. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 658, 488 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1997); Corwin v. \nBritish Am. Tobacco PLC , 796 S.E.2d 324, 338 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016).  There are two \n \n \nexceptions: (1) when there  is a special duty between the wrongdoer and the \nshareholder; and (2) when the shareholder suffered an injury separate and distinct \nfrom the injury suffered by the corporation and the other shareholders.  Barger, 346 \nN.C. at 658, 488 S.E.2d at 219; Corwin, 796 S.E.2d at 338; Levin v. Jacobson, 2015 \nNCBC LEXIS 111, at *14−15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 7, 2015) (stating that for purposes \nof whether a member of an LLC can assert an individual claim, “members of an LLC \nare treated like corporate shareholders and man agers are similar to directors”); see \nRussell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law § 34.04[5] (7th \ned. 2016) (“A derivative action on behalf of an LLC will be governed by essentially the \nsame rules that apply to a derivative action o n behalf of a corporation.  Therefore, \nwhether the member must bring the suit individually or on behalf of the LLC turns \non whether the alleged injuries were caused directly to the member or are a \nconsequence of breaches of fiduciary duty that harmed the LLC.” (footnote omitted)). \n61. For the special duty exception to apply, “the duty must be one that the \nalleged wrongdoer owed directly to the shareholder as an individual” —a duty that \nwas personal to the shareholder and separate and distinct from the fiduciary duty \nowed to the corporation.  Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 220.  In Barger, our \nSupreme Court set forth an illustrative, non -exclusive list of situations in which a \nspecial duty may be found.  Such list included when the wrongful actions of the party \ninduced plaintiff to become a shareholder, the wrongdoer violated his fiduciary duty \nto the shareholder, the wrongdoer performed individualized services directly for the \nshareholder, and the wrongdoer undertook to advise shareholders independently of  \n \n \nthe corporation.  Id.  “A fiduciary duty may constitute a ‘special duty’ when owed \ndirectly to a party.”  Corwin, 796 S.E.2d at 338. \n62. It is well settled that a manage r of a limited liability company owes \nfiduciary duties to the company, not to the individ ual members.  N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 57D-3-21(b); Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 474, 675 S.E.2d 133, \n137 (2009).  Further, members of a limited liability company do not owe fiduciary \nduties to each other or to the company, except a controlli ng member owes fiduciary \nduties to minority members.  Kaplan, 196 N.C. App. at 473, 675 S.E.2d at 137.  These \nprinciples, however, do not control the determination of the Motion s under the \nspecific allegations of the Amended Complaint.   \n63. Here, the Amended Complaint alleges that AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz \nconsummated a joint venture and, accordingly, Katz owed fiduciary duties to each of \nthe AD&D Plaintiffs by virtue of his status as a participant in the joint venture.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 177−79, ECF No. 21.)  A joint venture is an association of persons to engage \nin and carry out a business for profit.  Se. Shelter Corp. v. Btu, Inc. , 154 N.C. App. \n321, 327, 572 S.E.2d 200, 204 (2002).  A joint venture is a kind of partnership and is \ngoverned by substantially the same rules that govern partnerships.  Pike v. Wachovia \nBank & Tr. Co., 274 N.C. 1, 9, 161 S.E.2d 453, 460 (1968).  “[T]he essential elements \nof a joint venture are (1) an agree ment to engage in a single business venture with \nthe joint sharing of profits, (2) with each party to the joint venture having a right in \nsome measure to direct the conduct of the other through a necessary fiduciary \n \n \nrelationship.”  Se. Shelter Corp. , 154 N .C. App. at 327, 572 S.E.2d at 204 (citation \nomitted) (quotation marks omitted).   \n64. As to the first element, such agreement may be express or implied.  Id.; \nCompton v. Kirby , 157 N.C. App. 1, 11, 577 S.E.2d 905, 912 (2003)  (“A partnership \nmay be inferred from all the circumstances, so long as the circumstances demonstrate \na meeting of the minds with respect to the material terms of the partnership \nagreement.”).  “[T]he parties must combine their property, money, efforts, skill, or \nknowledge in some common un dertaking.”  Se. Shelter Corp., 154 N.C. App. at 327, \n572 S.E.2d at 204.  \n65. The Amended Complaint alleges that AD&D, Green, Husted, Milliner, and \nKatz entered into a joint venture to identify and jointly acquire suitable businesses \nwith the joint sharing of profits.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶¶ 33, 177−78.)  The Amended \nComplaint contains factual allegations stating that they combined their efforts, \nknowledge, and experience to acquire suitable businesses, including Friendship, at \nleast until September 21, 2016 when Ka tz e-mailed Green stating that their goals \nwere no longer aligned.  For example, AD&D contributed its financial models, Katz \nbrought Friendship to AD&D Plaintiffs’ attention, and, thereafter, AD&D Plaintiffs \nand Katz traveled to North Carolina to meet with  Greenfield and discuss acquiring \nFriendship.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 2, 34−35, 44, 46.)  Green ultimately sent Greenfield a \nproposal for the acquisition of Friendship by AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz.  (ECF No. 21 \nat ¶¶ 53, 55.)  Green, Husted, Milliner, and Katz formed New Friendship for the sole \npurpose of acquiring Friendship.  (ECF No. 21 at  ¶¶ 72−73.)  Additionally, the \n \n \nAmended Complaint alleges that AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz were exploring joint \nacquisitions in other states as far south as Florida.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 45.)   \n66. Therefore, the Court concludes that, at this stage of the proceeding, the \nallegations sufficiently state that AD&D, Green, Husted, Milliner, and Katz entered \ninto a joint venture such that Katz owed a fiduciary duty, and thus a special duty, to \neach Green, Husted, and Milliner  separate and apart from  any fiduciary duty Katz \nmay have owed to AD&D or New Friendship.  Accordingly, the Court concludes, based \non the allegations of the Amended Complaint, that Green, Husted, and Milliner have \nstanding to assert their claims against Katz.  See Munger v. State, 202 N.C. App. 404, \n410, 689 S.E.2d 230, 235 (2010) (“[I]f the trial court confines its evaluation [of \nstanding] to the pleadings, the court must accept as true the plaintiff’s allegatio ns \nand construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”); Neuse River Found., \nInc., 155 N.C. App. at 113, 574 S.E.2d at 51 (“[E]ach element [of standing] must be \nsupported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the \nburden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the \nsuccessive stages of the litigation.”).   \n67. Green, Husted, and Milliner assert, together with AD&D and New \nFriendship, claims against Greenfield and Friendship for aiding and abetting  a \nbreach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting constructive fraud, UDTP, and breach \nof the duty to negotiate in good faith.  As  discussed more fully below, the aiding and \nabetting claims are based on Greenfield and Friendship’s alleged participation in \nKatz’s alleged breach of his fiduciary duty to Plaintiffs, including Green, Husted, and \n \n \nMilliner.  Similarly, the UDTP claim is based, in part, on the aiding and abetting \nclaims.  The Court has concluded that, at the pleading stage, the Amended Complaint \nsufficiently alleges that Katz owed a fiduciary duty, and thus a special duty, to Green, \nHusted, and Milliner.  As such, the Court likewise concludes that Green, Husted, and \nMilliner have standing to assert their aiding and abetting claims, and thus their \nUDTP claim, against Greenfield and Friendship based on their alleged participation \nin Katz’s breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud. \n68. As to Green, Husted, and Milliner’s claim for breach of the duty to negotiate \nin good faith , for the reasons explained below, this claim is more appropriately \nconsidered as one for breach of contract based on an agreement to continue \nnegotiating in good faith.  Plaintiffs allege that AD&D Plaintiffs on the one hand, and \nGreenfield and Friendship on the other, agreed to negotiate in good faith the terms \nof the acquisition that remained open.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 262.)  Plaintiffs allege that \nGreenfield and Friendship breached this agreement by abandoning their negotiations \nwith AD&D Plaintiffs.   (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 90, 100−02.)   These allegations are \nsufficient, at the pleading stage, to state that Green, Husted, and Milliner—as parties \nto the alleged agreement—have standing to assert their claim against Greenfield and \nFriendship for breach of that agreement.       \n69. As such, the Motions to dismiss Green, Husted, and Milliner’s claims for \nlack of standing are denied.  \n \n \n \n \nC. Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion \n1. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets (Ninth Claim) \n70. Greenfield and Friendship argue that AD&D’s claim for m isappropriation \nof trade secrets fails to state a claim because the Amended Complaint does not \nidentify a trade secret with sufficient particularity, and the Amended Complaint fails \nto allege reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of any alleged trade secret.  (Mem. \nSupp. Defs. Greenfield & Friendship’s Mot. Dismiss 7−11.) \n71. The North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act (“TSPA”) defines “trade \nsecret” as \nbusiness or technical information, including but not limited to a formula, \npattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, \ntechnique, or process that:  \n \na. Derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not \nbeing generally know n or readily ascertainable through independent \ndevelopment or reverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic \nvalue from its disclosure or use; and \n \nb. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances \nto maintain its secrecy.  \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 66 -152(3).  The TSPA defines “misappropriation” as “acquisition, \ndisclosure, or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied authority or \nconsent, unless such trade secret was arrived at by independent development, reverse \nengineering, or was obtained from another person with a right to disclose the trade \nsecret.”  Id. § 66-152(1).  “To plead misappropriation of trade secrets, ‘a plaintiff must \nidentify a trade secret with sufficient particularity so as to enable a defendant  to \ndelineate that which he is accused of misappropriating and a  court to determine \n \n \nwhether misappropriation has or is threatened to occur.’”  VisionAIR, Inc. v. James, \n167 N.C. App. 504, 510−11, 606 S.E.2d 359, 364 (2004) (quoting Analog Devices, Inc. \nv. Michalski, 157 N.C. App. 462, 468 , 579 S.E.2d 449, 453 (2003)); Bldg. Ctr., Inc. v. \nCarter Lumber, Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 21, 2016).  \n72. AD&D alleges that Greenfield and Friendship misappropriated the APA \nthat AD&D Plaintiffs shared with Greenfield and Friendship pursuant to the ir \nnegotiations of an acquisition of Friendship  by AD&D Plaintiffs .  (ECF No. 21 at  \n31−32.)  The Amended Complaint identifies the specific dates on which the APA was \nfirst e-mailed to Greenfield and Frie ndship, as well as the time period over which \nvarious drafts of the APA were e -mailed to Greenfield and Friendship by Green and \nAD&D Plaintiffs’ counsel.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 61−63.)  The Court concludes that, at \nthe Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the Amended Complain t identifies the alleged trade secret \nwith sufficient particularity to enable Greenfield and Friendship to delineate that \nwhich they are accused of misappropriating and to enable this Court to determine \nwhether misappropriation has occurred. \n73. “Generally, only where efforts to maintain secrecy of the allegedly \nmisappropriated trade secrets were completely absent have North Carolina courts \ndismissed claims at the 12(b)(6) stage. ”  Bldg. Ctr., Inc. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 79, at \n*14.  Here, the Amended Complaint alleg es that AD&D stored the APA  on a \npassword-protected computer drive and disclosed  it only to the other parties to the \nnegotiations.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 68.)  AD&D Plaintiffs withdrew Katz’s access to the \ncomputer drive after Katz e -mailed Green on September 2 1, 2016 stating that their \n \n \ngoals were no longer aligned.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 117.)  The Amended Complaint further \nalleges that, in June 2016, AD& D Plaintiffs, Katz, and Greenfield entered into \nnondisclosure agreements regarding their negotiations “over the acquisition of \nFriendship.”  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 47.)  Taking the allegations as true and construing \nthem in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs , as the Court must at this stage, such \nnondisclosure agreements concerning AD&D Plaintiffs, Katz, and Greenfield and \nFriendship’s negotiations over the acquisition of Friendship conceivably include the \nAPA, which the parties exchanged and frequently revis ed pursuant to their \nnegotiations over the acquisition.   \n74. Therefore, the Court concludes that, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the \nAmended Complaint sufficiently alleges that AD&D took reasonable efforts to \nmaintain the secrecy of the APA.  As a result, Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion to \ndismiss AD&D’s Ninth Claim for misappropriation of trade secrets is denied. \n2. Conversion (Tenth Claim) \n75. AD&D alleges that Greenfield and Friendship wrongfully converted the \nAPA.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 251−53.)  Greenfield and Friendship argue that the Amended \nComplaint fails to state a claim for conversion because it does not allege that AD&D \nwas deprived of use of the APA.  (Mem. Supp.  Defs. Greenfield & Friendship’s Mot. \nDismiss 12−13, ECF No. 36.)   \n76. Conversion is (1) an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of \nownership over goods or personal property belonging to another, and (2) a wrongful \npossession or conversion by defendant, regardless of the subsequent application of \n \n \nthe converted property.  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs., \nLLC, 365 N.C. 520, 523, 723 S.E2d 744, 747 (2012).  “The essence of conversion is not \nthe acquisition of property by the wrongdoer, but a wrongful deprivation of it to the \nowner . . . .”  Id. at 530, 723 S.E.2d at 751.   \n77. “[T]he weight of authority [] treats electronic documents as personal \nproperty subject to a claim for conversion. ”  Addison Whitney, LLC v. Cashion, 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 51, at *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 9, 2017).  As Judge Conrad explained \nin Addison Whitney, however, \n[t]he more difficult question is what action constitutes a  conversion of \ncomputerized information.  Electronic documents are easy to copy at the \nstroke of a key or click of a button, and storage medi a are abundant, \nvaried, and relatively inexpensive.  Businesses and individuals \nroutinely store copies of files remotely on servers or in the cloud —\ninstant redundancy that greatly minimizes the risk of losing valuable \ninformation due to either misfortune or malfeasance.  In other words, a \nthief may steal a copy, but the information itself is hard to destroy. \n \nId. at *16−17.  This Court has concluded that merely making a copy of, as opposed to \ndeleting, electronically stored information does not support a co nversion claim \nbecause the owner is not deprived of possession or use of the information.  Id. at *17; \nRCJJ, LLC v. RCWIL Enters., LLC , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 46, at *53 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJune 20, 2016); RoundPoint Mortg. Co. v. Florez, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *55 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 18, 2016); Horner Int’l Co. v. McKoy, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 68, at *6−8 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 18, 2014).    \n78. Like the plaintiff in Addison Whitney, Plaintiffs here rely on Bridgetree, Inc. \nv. Red F Mktg. LLC , No. 3:10 -cv-00228-FDW-DSC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15372 \n(W.D.N.C. Feb. 5, 2013) , arguing that Greenfield and Friendship’s wrongful \n \n \npossession of tangible copies of the APA is sufficient to support a conversion claim \nregardless of whether AD&D still has possession and access to the APA in electronic \nform.  (Pls.’ Br. Resp. Defs.’ Mots. Dismiss 22, ECF No. 41.)   \n79. The Court agrees with the reasoning set forth in  Addison Whitney, RCJJ, \nRoundPoint, and Horner and finds Bridgetree not controlling here.  Further, as aptly \nnoted by Judge Conrad,  \nthe acquisition of paper photocopies does not ordinarily give rise to a \nconversion claim where the owner retained the original.  The Court sees \nno reason that businesses operating in a paperless environment should \nbe placed in a more favorable legal positi on than businesses that store \ndocuments the old fashioned way. \n   \nAddison Whitney, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 51, at *18 (citation omitted). \n80. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that AD&D’s conversion claim \nmust be dismissed.  AD&D’s conversion claim pertains entirely to  Greenfield and \nFriendship’s wrongful possession of a tangible copy of the APA that Plaintiffs sent to \nGreenfield and Friendship by e-mail.  The Amended Complaint does not allege that \nGreenfield and Friendship deprived AD&D of possession or access to the APA; rather, \nit alleges that the APA was reduced to tangible form, over which Greenfield and \nFriendship wrongfully assumed and exercised ownership.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 253.)  The \nallegations of the Amended Complaint are therefore  insufficient to state a claim for \nconversion.  Accordingly, Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion as to AD&D’s Tenth \nClaim for conversion is granted. \n \n \n \n \n3. Breach of Duty to Negotiate in Good Faith (Eleventh Claim) \n81. As a preliminary matter, although the Eleventh Claim is labeled “breach of \nduty to negotiate in good faith,” the claim alleges breach of an agreement to negotiate \nin good faith and, as such, is more appropriately considered as a claim for breach of \ncontract.  Plaintiffs allege that  \n[o]n or around August 22, 201 6, the AD&D Plaintiffs on the one hand, \nand Greenfield and Friendship on the other, agreed on the principal \nterms of an acquisition of Friendship that would involve the AD&D \nPlaintiffs and agreed to negotiate in good faith to resolve any open terms \nand finalize that acquisition. \n   \n(ECF No. 21 at ¶ 262.)  Greenfield and Friendship argue that the factual allegations \nof the Amended Complaint make clear that any alleged agreement to negotiate in \ngood faith was b etween AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz  on the one hand, and Greenfield \nand Friendship  on the other.  ( Mem. Supp.  Defs. Greenfield & Friendship’s Mot. \nDismiss 14−16, ECF No. 36; Greenfield & Friendship’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss \n4−6, ECF No. 43 .)  According to Greenfield and Friendship, there is therefore no \nenforceable agreement to negotiate in good faith solely between Greenfield and \nFriendship on the one hand, and AD&D Plaintiffs on the other, to support Plaintiffs’ \nclaim.  (ECF No. 36 at 14−16; ECF No. 43 at 4−6.) \n82. A valid contract requires assent, mutuality of obligation, and definite \nterms.  Charlotte Motor Speedway, LLC v. Cty. of Cabarrus, 230 N.C. App. 1, 7, 748 \nS.E.2d 171, 176 (2013).  Although the North Carolina appellate courts have not \naddressed whether North Carolina law recognizes a claim for breach of an implied \nagreement to negotiate in good faith, this Court has recognized that an express \n \n \nagreement to negotiate in good faith may support a breach of contract claim.  \nRecurrent Energy Dev. Holdings, LLC v. SunEnergy1, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 18, \nat *45−46 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 7, 2017) (distinguishing a claim for breach of a duty \nto negotiate in good faith arising out of the parties’ negotiations and conduct, on the \none hand, from an express agreement to negotiate in good faith, on the other hand); \nsee also Remi Holdings, LLC v. IX WR 3023 HSBC Way L.P., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 110, \nat *18−19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 12, 2016) (distinguishing an unenforceable letter of \nintent from a binding agreement to negotiate in good faith); RREF BB Acquisitions, \nLLC v. MAS Props., L.L.C., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *57 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 9, \n2015) (“The Court sees no reason that an agreement to continue negotia ting in good \nfaith would not be enforceable, provided that it met all of the requirements for \ncontract formation under North Carolina law.”). \n83. Here, Plaintiffs allege that on August 22, 2016, AD&D Plaintiffs on the one \nhand, and Greenfield and Frien dship on the other, agreed to negotiate in good faith \nthe terms of the acquisition that remained open.   (ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 262 .)  This \nallegation is sufficient, at the pleading stage, to state a valid agreement to negotiate \nin good faith.   \n84. While Plaintiffs also allege that the agreement to negotiate in good faith \nwas entered into between AD&D Plaintiffs and Katz on the one hand, and Greenfield \nand Friendship on the other , this does not preclude Plaintiffs’ claim.  First, as \ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs also allege  that AD&D Plaintiffs , without Katz, entered \ninto an agreement with Greenfield and Friendship to negotiate open terms in good \n \n \nfaith.  Second and last, even assuming the agreement was betwee n both AD&D \nPlaintiffs and Katz on the one hand, and Greenfield and Friendship on the other, the \nallegations are sufficient, at the pleading stage, to state that Greenfield and \nFriendship breached this agreement as to AD&D Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs allege that \nGreenfield and Friendship agreed to partially finance the purchase price with a note, \nbut then one month later refused to go forward with the deal unless the purchase \nprice was entirely financed by cash.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶¶ 102, 112, 264.)  Further, \nPlaintiffs allege that after the parties agreed to negotiate in good fa ith, Greenfield \nsuggested to Katz that Katz purchase Friendship for himself and told Katz that he \nwould not mention Greenfield and Friendship ’s tentative deal with Katz to Green, \nbut would instead tell Green he was not comfortable with financing the purcha se \nprice by a note.  ( ECF No. 21 at  ¶¶ 90, 100−02.)  Plaintiffs contend that Greenfield \nand Friendship refused to negotiate the open terms of the acquisition and abandoned \nthese negotiations to pursue a deal with Katz and Katz alone.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 265.) \n85. The Court concludes that, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the allegation s are \nsufficient to state a claim for breach of an agreement to negotiate in good faith.  \nTherefore, Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion as to Plaintiffs’ Eleventh Claim is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \n \n4. Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty  and Aiding \nand Abetting Constructive Fraud  (Twelfth and Thirteenth  \nClaims) \n \n86. Plaintiffs assert claims against Greenfield and Friendship for aiding and \nabetting Katz’s breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting Katz’s constructive \nfraud.  (ECF No. 21 at 36−39.) \n87. It remains unclear whether North Carolina recognizes  a claim for aiding \nand abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.  E.g., Transatlantic Healthcare, LLC v. Alpha \nConstr. of the Triad, Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 21, at *25 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 9, 2017); \nKrawiec v. Manly, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *40 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 22, 2016); Veer \nRight Mgmt. Grp., Inc. v. Czarnowski Display Serv., Inc. , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 13, at \n*6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 4, 2015); BDM Invs. v. Lenhil, Inc., 2014 NCBC LEXIS 6, at \n*49 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 20, 2014).  Likewise, it is unsettled whether North Carolina \nrecognizes a claim for aiding and abetting constructive fraud.  Bradshaw v. Maiden, \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 80, at *39 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2015).  If North Carolina were \nto recognize such a claim, however, courts have concluded that the claim would be \nsimilar to a claim for aiding and abetting a brea ch of fiduciary duty.  Id.  Indeed, \nPlaintiffs base their aiding and abetting constru ctive fraud claim on the same \nallegations on which they base their claim for aiding and abetting a breach of \nfiduciary duty.  (Compare ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 269−82, with ECF No. 21 at ¶¶ 283−96.)   \n88. Although it remains open whether North Carolina recognizes a cl aim for \naiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, if North Carolina were to recognize \nsuch a claim, then “the elements would include: (1) violation of a fiduciary duty by \n \n \nthe primary party; (2) knowledge of the violation by the aiding and abetting pa rty; \nand (3) substantial assistance by the aider and abettor in achieving the primary \nviolation.”  Veer Right Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *8.  \n89. Plaintiffs argue that, at a minimum, the Court should defer ruling on \nPlaintiffs’ aiding and abetting claims as this Court did in Veer Right.  (Pls.’ Br. Resp. \n34, ECF No. 41 .)  In Veer Right, Judge Gale concluded that because plaintiff \nadequately pleaded its civil conspiracy claim to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and \nbecause discovery as to the conspiracy claim and the aiding and abetting claim \nappeared to substantially overlap, “an early ruling on the aiding and abetting claim \nwould yield no apparent cost efficiencies.”   Veer Right Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 13, at *8.  As a result, Judge Gale deferred ruling on defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss plaintiff’s aiding and abetting claim.  Id. at *8−9.   \n90. Similarly, in Bradshaw, Judge Bledsoe declined to dismiss plaintiffs’ aiding \nand abetting constructive fraud claim, concluding that  \nthe current uncertainty concerning the viability of a claim for aiding and \nabetting constructive fraud under North Carolina law and the \nanticipated overlapping discovery on P laintiffs’ claims for aiding and \nabetting constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, gross negligence and \ngrossly negligent misrepresentation  . . . are sufficiently similar to the \ncircumstances in Veer Right to compel similar treatment.   \n \nBradshaw, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 80, at *40−41. \n  \n91. Here, as the aiding and abetting claims and the civil conspiracy claim focus \non Greenfield and Friendship’s participation in Katz’s breach of fiduciary duty and \nconstructive fraud, the Court believes that, as in Veer Right and Bradshaw, \nanticipated discovery on the aiding and abetting claims substantially overlaps with \n \n \nanticipated discovery on the civil conspiracy claim.  Further, North Carolina law on \nthe viability of a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty is no mor e \ncertain than it was when this Court decided Veer Right and Bradshaw, and, as \ndiscussed below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a civil \nconspiracy claim to withstand Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion.  As a result, the \nCourt, in its discretion, declines to dismiss Plaintiffs’ aiding and abetting claims  at \nthis time, without prejudice to revisiting the claims by later motion practice.    \n5. Civil Conspiracy (Fourteenth Claim) \n92. Plaintiffs assert a civil conspiracy claim against Defe ndants based on \nPlaintiffs’ claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud.  (ECF No. 21 at \n¶ 298.)  Greenfield and Friendship argue that the Amended Complaint fails to state \na claim for civil conspiracy because the factual allegations are insu fficient to allege \nan agreement between Katz on the one hand, and Greenfield and Friendship on the \nother, to do an unlawful act.   (Mem. Supp. Defs. Greenfield & Friendship’s Mot. \nDismiss 21−22, ECF No. 36.) \n93. The purpose of a conspiracy claim is to associate  defendants together to \nimpose joint and several liability on the conspirators for injury resulting from the acts \nof any one conspirator done in furtherance of the conspiracy.   Neugent v. Beroth Oil \nCo., 149 N.C. App. 38, 53, 560 S.E.2d 829, 838 (2002).  There is not a separate cause \nof action for civil conspiracy—if the underlying claim fails, the conspiracy claim must \nalso fail.  Strickland v. Hedrick, 194 N.C. App. 1, 19, 669 S.E.2d 61, 73 (2008).  Under \nNorth Carolina law, “[t]he elements of a civil  conspiracy are: (1) an agreement \n \n \nbetween two or more individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act in an \nunlawful way; (3) resulting in injury to plaintiff inflicted by one or more of the \nconspirators; and (4)  pursuant to a common scheme.”  Id. at 19, 669 S.E.2d at 72.   \nFurther, \n[a] threshold requirement in any cause of action for damages caused by \nacts committed pursuant to a conspiracy must be the showing that a \nconspiracy in fact existed.  The existence of a conspiracy requires proof \nof an agreement between two or more persons.  Although civil liability \nfor conspiracy may be established by circumstantial evidence, the \nevidence of the agreement must be sufficient to create more than a \nsuspicion or conjecture in order to justify submission to a jury.  \n \nS.N.R. Mgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC, 189 N.C. App. 601, 609, 659 S.E.2d \n442, 449 (2008) (quoting Dove v. Harvey, 168 N.C. App. 687, 690−91, 608 S.E.2d 798, \n801 (2005)). \n94. Plaintiffs alle ge that, after Greenfield and Friendship agreed to AD&D \nPlaintiffs’ proposal to acquire Friendship and to continue negotiating terms that \nremained open, Greenfield suggested to Katz that Katz purchase Friendship for \nhimself.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 90.)  Plaintiffs contend that thereafter, Katz proceeded to \npursue an acquisition of Friendship on his own.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 91.)  The Amended \nComplaint alleges that, in furtherance of Katz’s acquisition of Friendship, Greenfield \ntold Katz that he would not tell Green  about Greenfield and Friendship’s tentative \ndeal with Katz; rather, Greenfield would instead tell Green that Greenfield was not \ncomfortable with the promissory note.   (ECF No. 21 at  ¶ 101.)   The Amended \nComplaint alleges that from the time  Greenfield sugg ested to Katz that Katz \npurchase Friendship for himself  and continuing until after this  action was filed , \n \n \nGreenfield and Friendship on the one hand, and Katz  on the other, engaged in \nextensive negotiations for Katz, and Katz alone, to acquire Friendship in violation of \nhis fiduciary duties to Plaintiffs .  (ECF No. 21 at  ¶¶ 90−94, 103−09, 122−25, 134, \n137−44.)   \n95. The Court concludes that, at the pleading stage, these allegations are \nsufficient to state an agreement between Defendants facilitating Katz’s breach of \nfiduciary duty.  See Veer Right Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *9 (“This \nCourt has allowed a conspiracy claim based on an agreement facilitating an \nunderlying breach of fiduciary duty.”); see also Thomas & Howard Co. of Shelby, Inc. \nv. Am. Mut. Liability Ins. Co. , 241 N.C. 109, 115, 84 S.E.2d 337, 341 (1954)  (“The \npleader must . . . allege the facts from which the alleged conspiracy may be inferred \nand the alleged unlawful acts agreed upon.  However, the purpose of the complaint is \nto allege the substantive and constituent facts of the cause of action, not to narrate \nthe evidencing supporting them.”).  Therefore, Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion as \nto Plaintiffs’ Fourteenth Claim for civil conspiracy is denied. \n6. UDTP (Fifteenth Claim) \n96. Plaintiffs assert a UDTP claim against Greenfield and Friendship based on \nPlaintiffs’ claims for breach of the duty to negotiate in good faith, aiding and abetting \na breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting constructive fraud, and civil \nconspiracy, as well as AD&D’s claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and \nconversion.  (ECF No. 21 at ¶ 307.)     \n \n \n97. In order to state a UDTP claim, Plaintiffs must allege (1) an unfair or \ndeceptive act or practice, (2) in or affecting commerce, (3) which proximately c aused \ninjury to Plaintiffs.  Belcher v. Fleetwood Enters., Inc. , 162 N.C. App. 80, 85, 590 \nS.E.2d 15, 18 (2004).  A breach of contract will only constitute an unfair or deceptive \nact or practice if a party shows substantial aggravating circumstances attending the \nbreach.  Se. Shelter Corp. , 154 N.C. App. at 330, 572 S.E.2d at 206.  The internal \nconduct of individuals occurring within a single business is not in or affecting \ncommerce so as to fall within the scope of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75 -1.1.  White v. \nThompson, 364 N.C. 47, 53, 691 S.E.2d 676, 680 (2010).  Misappropriation of trade \nsecrets may constitute a UDTP in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1.  E.g., Ge Betz, \nInc. v. Conrad, 231 N.C. App. 214, 236, 752 S.E.2d 634, 650 (2013).   \n98. Greenfield and Friendship argue that “Plaintiffs’ claim for [UDTP] should \nbe dismissed because all the underlying cl aims used to support the existence of a[]  \n[UDTP] are fatally defective[.]”  (Mem. Supp. Defs. Greenfield & Friendship’s Mot. \nDismiss 23, ECF No. 36.)  Greenfield and Friendship further argue that Plaintiffs’ \nUDTP claim should be dismissed because “[t]he Am ended Complaint does not show \nthat Friendship and Greenfield did anything more than make a business decision \nabout what risk it was willing to take with respect to a seller-financed note[.]”  (ECF \nNo. 36 at 23.) \n99. As discussed above, the Court has concluded that the allegations of the \nAmended Complaint are sufficient to state the claims asserted therein, save and \nexcept for AD&D’s Tenth Claim for conversion.  As Greenfield and Friendship did not \n \n \nargue or provide any other basis on which Plaintiffs’ UDTP claim  should be \ndismissed, the Court need not further consider the sufficiency of the factual \nallegations to support Plaintiffs’ UDTP claim.  Therefore, Greenfield and Friendship’s \nMotion as to Plaintiffs’ Fifteenth Claim for UDTP is denied.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n \n100. For the foregoing reasons, the Court ORDERS as follows: \nA. The Court DENIES Katz’s Motion. \nB. The Court GRANTS Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion as to \nAD&D’s Tenth Claim for conversion and dismisses this claim with \nprejudice. \nC. The Court DENIES Greenfield and Friendship’s Motion as to all \nother claims.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 18th day of August, 2017. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L.
