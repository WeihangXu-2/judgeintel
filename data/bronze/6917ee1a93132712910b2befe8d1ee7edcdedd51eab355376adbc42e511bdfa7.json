Plaintiff Atlantic Coast Conference (the “ACC” or the “Conference”) initiated \nthis litigation late on the afternoon of 21 December 2023  seeking a judicial \ndetermination that two media rights agreements between the ACC and its members \nare valid and enforceable.  The ACC argues that it did so only when it became a \npractical certainty that Defendant Board of Trustees of Florida State University \n(“FSU” or the “FSU Board”) would file a lawsuit the following day to challenge the \nenforceability of those agreements, which, by their terms, prohibited the FSU Board \nfrom seeking such relief.  As the ACC expected, the FSU Board filed suit against the \nACC in Florida the next day, allegedly breaching the agreements. \n2. This matter is now before the Court upon the FSU Board’s Motion to \nDismiss (the “Motion to Dismiss”) or, in the Alternative, Stay the Action (the “Motion \nto Stay”; together, the “Motions”) , filed on 7 February 2024 in the above -captioned \ncase.1 \n \n1 (Def.’s Mot.

The Court does not make findings of fact on the Motions.  Rather, the Court \nrecites the allegations asserted and documents referenced in the Complaint and FAC \nthat are relevant to the Court’s determination of the Motions. \n5. The ACC is a North Carolina unincorporated nonprofit association created \nunder Chapter 59 B of the North Carolina General Statutes to “enrich and balance \n \n2 (Compl. Declaratory J. [hereinafter “Compl.”], ECF Nos. 2 (sealed), 3 (public redacted).) \n \n3 (First Am. Compl.

The \n“most senior executive officer of [each ] Member[ ]” serves as a Director on the ACC \nBoard,6 and “each Director shall have the right to take any action or any vote on \nbehalf of the Member it represents[.]” 7  FSU  has been a Member of the ACC since \n1991.8 \n6. On 8 July 2010, the ACC entered into a Multi-Media Agreement (the “2010 \nMulti-Media Agreemen t”) with ESPN , Inc. and ESPN Enterprises, Inc. (together, \n“ESPN”), granting ESPN exclusive distribution rights to certain ACC Member \n \n4 (FAC ¶¶ 1, 38 (quoting FAC Ex. 1 § 1.2.1 [hereinafter “ACC Const.”], ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), \n12.1 (public unredacted)).)  Exhibits 1–9 to the Complaint were refiled as Exhibits 1 –11 to \nthe FAC.  (Exhibit 5 to the Complaint was split between Exhibits 5 and 8 to the FAC; Exhibit \n6 to the Complaint was split between Exhibits 6 and 9 to the FAC.)  For ease of reference, all \ncitations in this opinion will be to the exhibits to the FAC. \n \n5 (See FAC ¶ 1.)  The current ACC Members, with their year of admission to the Conference, \nare: Clemson University (1953), Duke University (1953), the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill (1953), North Carolina State University (1953), the University of Virginia (1953), \nWake Forest University (1953), the Georgia Institute of Technology (197 8), Florida State \nUniversity (1991), the University of Miami (2004), Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State \nUniversity (2004), Boston College (2005), the University of Notre Dame (excluding football \nand ice hockey) (2013), the University of Pittsburgh (2013), Syracuse University (2013), and \nthe University of Louisville (2014).  (See FAC ¶¶ 32–36.) \n  \n6 (ACC Const. § 1.5.1.2; see FAC ¶¶ 1, 40.)  \n \n7 (ACC Const. § 1.5.1.1; see FAC ¶¶ 1, 40.) \n \n8 (See FAC ¶¶ 8, 36.) \n \nInstitution sporting events in exchange for specified payments. 9  The ACC Board of \nDirectors unanimously approved this agreement.10   \n7. In 2012, “collegiate athletic conferences began to experience significant \ninstability and realignment[.]” 11  The ACC was no exception.  Late that year, the \nUniversity of Maryland announced its withdrawal from the ACC.  Shortly thereafter, \nthe ACC elected to add four new Member Institutions. 12  During this same period, \nthe ACC Board voted to significantly increase the amount a Member must pay if it \nchose to leave the Conference “to more appropriately compensate the Conference for  \nsome of the potential losses [ ]” associated with the Member’s withdrawal. 13  It was \nagainst this backdrop in 2013 that the ACC and ESPN agreed to an extension of the \n2010 Multi-Media Agreement through 2027.14 \n8. “[I]n order to secure a long -term media rights agreement and thus ensure \nthe payment of predictable sums over time,” the current and incoming ACC Member \nInstitutions, including FSU, entered into an Atlantic Coast Conference  Grant of \n \n9 (See FAC ¶¶ 13 n.2, 42–43.) \n \n10 (See FAC ¶ 42.) \n \n11 (FAC ¶ 55.) \n \n12 (See FAC ¶ 54.)  The four new Members were the University of Notre Dame (excluding \nfootball and ice hockey), the University of Pittsburgh, Syracuse University, and the \nUniversity of Louisville. \n \n13 (FAC ¶ 48; see FAC ¶¶ 47, 49–52.) \n \n14 (See FAC ¶¶ 44, 54.) \n \nRights Agreement (the “Grant of Rights”) with the ACC in April 2013. 15  Under the \nGrant of Rights,  \neach of the Member Institutions is required to, and desires to, \nirrevocably grant to the Conference, and the Conference desires to \naccept from each of the Member Institutions, those rights granted \nherein[:] \n \n. . . . \n \nGrant of Rights.  Each of the Member Institutions hereby (a) irrevocably \nand exclusively grants to the Conference during the Term . . . all rights \n(the “Rights”) necessary for the Conference to perform the contractual \nobligations of the Conference expressly set forth in the ESPN \nAgreement, regardless of whether such Member Institution remains a \nmember of the Conference during the entirety of the Term[.] \n \n. . . . \n \nAcknowledgements, Representations, Warranties, and Covena nts.  \nEach of the Member Institutions acknowledges that the grant of Rights \nduring the entire T erm is irrevocable and effective until the end of the \nTerm regardless of whether the Member Institution withdraws from the \nConference during the Term or otherwis e ceases to participate as a \nmember of the Conference in accordance with the Conference’s \nConstitution and Bylaws.  . . . Each of the Member Institutions \ncovenants and agrees that . . . it will not take any action, or permit any \naction to be taken by others subject to its control, including licensees, or \nfail to take any action, that would affect the validity and enforcement of \nthe Rights granted to the Conference under this Agreement.\n16 \n \n9. The ACC negotiated a Second Amendment to the 2010 Multi -Media \nAgreement in 2014, incorporating the ACC’s new Members and increasing the fees \npaid to the Conference, which were then distributed to the Member Institutions, \n \n15 (FAC ¶ 56; see FAC ¶¶ 57, 66–67, 69; FAC Ex. 2 [hereinafter “Grant of Rights”], ECF Nos. \n11 (sealed), 12.2 (public unredacted).) \n \n16 (Grant of Rights 1, ¶¶ 1, 6; see FAC ¶¶ 61–64.) \n \nincluding FSU. 17  In 2016, the ACC “sought to generate additional revenue for its \nMembers through a netwo rk partnership with ESPN[  ]” that would “establish the \nACC Network, broadcast more ACC events, and share in the revenues of this new \nnetwork.”18  To this end, the ACC and ESPN negotiated two new agreements in 2016: \nan Amended and Restated ACC -ESPN Multi-Media Agreement and an ACC -ESPN \nNetwork Agreement (together, the “ESPN Agreements”).19 \n10. ESPN, however, conditioned its participation in the ESPN Agreements on \neach Member Institution’s agreeing to extend the term of the Grant of Rights.20  After \nnumerous Board and other meetings, the ACC Members, including FSU, executed a \n2016 Amendment to ACC Grant of Rights Agreement with the ACC (the “Amended \nGrant of Rights” ; together with the Grant of Rights, the “Grant of Rights \nAgreements”) on 18 July 2016 that, according to the ACC, extended the term from 30 \nJune 2027 to 30 June 2036. 21  The ESPN Agreements were executed a few days \nlater.22  Both ESPN Agreements “stipulate that their terms and conditions cannot be \n \n17 (See FAC ¶¶ 70–73; FAC Ex. 3, ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), 12.3 (sealed).) \n \n18 (FAC ¶ 77.) \n \n19 (FAC ¶¶ 78–82; see FAC Ex. 5 [hereinafter “2016 Multi-Media Agreement”], ECF Nos. 11 \n(sealed), 12.5 (sealed); FAC Ex. 6 [hereinafter “ACC Network Agreement”], ECF Nos. 11 \n(sealed), 12.6 (sealed).) \n \n20 (See FAC ¶ 84; FAC Ex. 7 at 1 [hereinafter “Am. Grant of Rights ”], ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), \n12.7 (public unredacted).) \n \n21 (See FAC ¶¶ 83, 87, 91–105; Am. Grant of Rights ¶ 2.) \n \n22 (FAC ¶ 78; see 2016 Multi-Media Agreement 1; ACC Network Agreement 1.) \n \ndisclosed to the public and impose a confidentiality obligation on the Conference.” 23  \nThe ACC was permitted to disclose the ESPN Agreements to its Member Institutions, \n“provided that each [Member] Institution shall agree to maintain the confidentiality” \nof the agreements. 24  To maintain the confidentiality of the ESPN Agreements, the \nACC allowed its Members to view the agreements only at the Conference’s North \nCarolina headquarters and conditioned access on the Member’s promise to maintain \nthe confidentiality of the agreements.25 \n11. Although FSU’s “distributions from the ACC more than doubled” since it \nentered into the Grant of Rights, 26 in early 2023, the FSU Board “began to advocate \nfor more money for the university through unequal sharing of revenue[,]” contending \nthat FSU’s “ ‘brand’ entitled it to more revenue.” 27  In response, in May 2023, the \nACC “endorsed the concept of distributing a larger share of post -season revenues to \nthe Members that generated those revenues[.]”28  But FSU continued to push for “an \n \n23 (FAC ¶  106; see FAC Ex. 8 ¶  25.11 [hereinafter “2016 Multi -Media Agreement \nConfidentiality Provision”], ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), 12.8 (public unredacted); FAC Ex. 9 ¶ 18.11 \n[hereinafter “ACC Network Agreement Confidentiality Provision ”], ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), \n12.9 (public unredacted).) \n \n24 (FAC ¶ 108 (quoting 2016 Multi-Media Agreement Confidentiality Provision ¶ 25.11; ACC \nNetwork Agreement Confidentiality Provision ¶ 18.11).) \n \n25 (See FAC ¶¶ 138–40, 161–62.) \n \n26 (FAC ¶ 111.) \n \n27 (FAC ¶ 120; see FAC ¶¶ 117–19, 120–21.) \n \n28 (FAC ¶ 122.) \n \nunequal share of all Conference revenue,” 29 and the FSU Board discussed \nwithdrawing from the ACC at a 2 August 2023 Board meeting.30 \n12. Events came to a head on 21 December 2023, when the FSU Board notified \nthe public that it would hold an emergency meeting the following day. 31  The ACC \nalleges that, “[w]ith the knowledge of [the FSU Board]’s clear intention to breach the \nGrant of Rights and Amended Grant of Rights[  ]” by filing “a preempti ve lawsuit \nagainst the ACC in Leon County, Florida,” 32 the ACC filed its original Complaint \nunder seal in Mecklenburg County Superior Court later that day, seeking a \ndeclaration that the Grant of Rights Agreements are valid and enforceable contracts \nand a declaration that the FSU Board is estopped from challenging or has waived any \nright to challenge the Grant of Rights Agreements  by accepting the benefits \nthereunder.33   \n13. According to the ACC, the FSU Board Chair indicated at the 22 December \n2023 Board meeting that (i) “each of the [FSU] Board Members had been privy to \n‘individual briefings’ over the course of several months[,]” 34 (ii) “he had spoken \nindividually with all [FSU] Board Members for the purpose of securing the necessary \n \n29 (FAC ¶ 124 (emphasis omitted).) \n \n30 (See FAC ¶¶ 129–32.) \n \n31 (See FAC ¶ 143.) \n \n32 (FAC ¶¶ 148–49.) \n \n33 (Compl. ¶¶ 116–46.) \n \n34 (FAC ¶ 154.) \n \nvotes to proceed to litigation[,]”35 and (iii) “a Complaint to be filed by [the FSU Board] \nhad been transmitted to all [FSU Board] Members several days before.”36  At the end \nof the meeting, the FSU Board authorized the filing of the Florida complaint, and it \nwas filed publicly in the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit in and for Leon \nCounty, Florida later that same day (the “Florida Action”).37 \n14. On 17 January 2024, the ACC filed its FAC, alleging damages and asserting \nclaims for monetary relief against the FSU Board for breach of the Grant of Rights \nAgreements, breach of a  contractual obligation to protect confidential information , \nbreach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing \nunder the ACC ’s Constitution and Bylaws, in addition to the same two declaratory \njudgment claims asserted in the original Complaint.38 \n15. The FSU Board subsequently filed an Amended Complaint for Declaratory \nJudgment in the Florida Action on 29 January 2024, asserting claims against the \nACC for unreasonable restraint of trade under Fla. Stat. § 542.18; unenforceable \npenalties under the Grant of Rights  Agreements and the ACC Constitution; breach \nof various contracts; breach of fiduciary duty ; fundamental failure or frustration of \ncontractual purpose; unenforceable contracts as to the Grant of Rights Agreements ; \n \n35 (FAC ¶ 155.) \n \n36 (FAC ¶ 153.) \n \n37 (See FAC ¶¶ 168, 170; FAC Ex. 16 at 1 [hereinafter “Fla. Compl.”], ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), \n12.16 (sealed).) \n \n38 (See FAC ¶¶ 173–273.) \n \nand unconscionable penalty provisions in violation of Florida public policy  in the \nGrant of Rights Agreements and the ACC Constitution.39  For each of its claims, the \nFSU Board sought a judicial determination that the Grant of Rights Agreements were \nunenforceable against FSU or that FSU was relieved and excused from performance \nunder those agreements. 40  The FSU Board also sought as relief for each claim a \njudicial decree that FSU “be deemed to have issued its formal notice of withdrawal \nfrom the ACC under section 1.4.5 of the ACC Constitution effective August 14, \n2023.”41  The FSU Board has not alleged damages or sought monetary relief on any \nclaims it has asserted against the ACC in the Florida Action.42 \n16. On 7 February 2024, the FSU Board timely filed the Motion s, seeking to \ndismiss the FAC under Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), 12(b)(6), and 12(b)(7) or, in the \nalternative, seeking to stay this action in favor of the pending Florida Action.43 \n17. After full briefing, t he Court held a hearing on the Motion s on 22 March \n2024 at which all parties were represented by counsel  (the “Hearing”).  The Motions \nare now ripe for resolution.44 \n \n39 (FSU Bd.’s Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. Ex. 1 ¶¶ 227–74 [hereinafter “Fla. Am. Compl.”], ECF \nNos. 19.1 (sealed), 28 (public redacted).) \n \n40 (See Fla. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 241, 246, 250, 256, 261, 270, 274.) \n \n41 (Fla. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 241, 246, 250, 256, 261, 270, 274.) \n \n42 (See Fla. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 241, 246, 250, 256, 261, 270, 274.) \n \n43 (Def.’s Mots. ¶¶ 2–3.) \n \n44 The Court also heard arguments at the Hearing on the ACC’s Amended Motion to Seal, \n(ECF No. 9), and Motion to Seal Summary Exhibit ECF No. 24.2, (ECF No. 25) .  The Court \nwill resolve these sealing motions by separate order. \n \nII. \nMOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO RULES 12(b)(1) AND 12(b)(2) \n18. Moving under Rule 12(b)(1), the FSU Board challenges the ACC’s standing \nto bring suit in North Carolina on two grounds: (i) the ACC filed suit before an actual \nor justiciable controversy arose; and (ii) the ACC failed to satisfy a necessary \ncondition precedent prior to initiating this action. 45  The FSU Board additionally \nargues that, under Rules 12(b)(1) and/or 12(b)(2), it cannot be sued in North Carolina \nbecause the FSU Board has not waived its sovereign immunity except within the \nboundaries of the State of Florida pursuant to Fla. Stat. §§ 768.28(1) and 1001.72.\n46   \nA. Legal Standard \n19. “Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court’s proper exercise of subject \nmatter jurisdiction[,]” In  re Z.G.J., 378 N.C. 500, 504 (2021) (citation omitted) , and \n“must be addressed, and found to exist, before the merits of the case are judicially \nresolved[,]” In re T. B., 200 N.C. App. 739, 742 (2009) (cleaned up).  “Rule 12(b)(1) \nrequires the dismissal of any action ‘based upon a trial court’s lack of jurisdiction over \nthe subject matter of the claim.’ ”  Watson v. Joyner-Watson, 263 N.C. App. 393, 394 \n(2018) (quoting Catawba Cnty. v. Loggins, 370 N.C. 83, 87 (2017)).  The plaintiff bears \nthe burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.  See Harper v. City of Asheville, \n160 N.C. App. 209, 217 (2003).  In ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of standing \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the Court “may consider matters outside the pleadings” in \n \n45 (Def.’s Mots. ¶¶ 2(a), (b).) \n \n46 (Def.’s Mots. ¶ 2(c).) \ndetermining whether subject matter jurisdiction exists, Harris v. Matthews, 361 N.C. \n265, 271 (2007), and must “view the allegations [of the pleading] as true and the \nsupporting record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party[,]” Mangum v. \nRaleigh Bd. of Adjustment, 362 N.C. 640, 644 (2008). \n20. In North Carolina, the appropriate rule for consideration of a motion to \ndismiss on the grounds of sovereign immunity has been  somewhat unsettled.  See, \ne.g., Battle Ridge Cos. v. N. C. Dep’t of Transp., 161 N.C. App. 156, 157 (2003) (“Our \ncourts have held that the defense of sovereign immunity is a Rule 12(b)(1) defense.  \nOur courts have also held that the defense of sovereign immunity is a matter of \npersonal jurisdiction that would fall under Rule 12(b)(2).”  (cleaned up)); Farmer v. \nTroy Univ. , 382 N.C. 366, 369– 70 (2022) (reviewing a motion to dismiss on the \ngrounds of sovereign immunity  under Rules 12(b)(2) and  12(b)(6)).  Our Court of \nAppeals, however, recently clarified  that an assertion of  “[sovereign] immunity \nshould be classified as an issue of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2).”  Torres \nv. City of Raleigh, 288 N.C. App. 617, 620 (2023).  Accordingly, the Court will construe \nthe Motion  to Dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds as an issue of personal \njurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) and apply the appropriate standard of review for \nmotions under that Rule.  \n21. “The standard of review to be applied by a trial court in deciding a motion \nunder Rule 12(b)(2) depends upon the procedural context confronting the court.”  Id. \n(quoting Banc of Am. Sec. LLC v. Evergreen Int’l Aviation, Inc. , 169 N.C. App. 690, \n693 (2005)).  Where, as here,  \nneither party submits evidence  [on personal jurisdiction] , the \nallegations of the complaint must disclose jurisdiction although the \nparticulars of jurisdiction need not be alleged.  The trial judge must \ndecide whether the complaint contains allegations that, if taken as true, \nset forth  a sufficient basis for the court ’s exercise of personal \njurisdiction. \n \nParker v. Town of Erwin , 243 N.C. App. 84, 9 6 (2015) (cleaned up).  “[A] trial court \n[may] consider matters outside the pleadings[ ]” when ruling on a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(2).  Id. at 97. \nB. A nalysis  \n1. Actual and Justiciable Controversy \n22. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act (the “Act”), “[a]ny person interest ed \nunder a . . . written contract . . . , or whose rights, status or other legal relations are \naffected by a . . . contract . . . , may have determined any question of construction or \nvalidity arising under the . . . contract . . . , and obtain a declaration of rights, status, \nor other legal relations thereunder.”  N.C.G.S. § 1- 254.  Because the “Act recognizes \nthe need of society ‘for officially stabilizing legal relations by adjudicating disputes \nbefore they have ripened into . . . destruction of the status quo[,]’ ” Gray Media Grp., \nInc. v. City of Charlotte , 290 N.C. App. 384, 391 (2023) ( quoting Lide v. Mears, 231 \nN.C. 111, 117–18 (1949)), “[a] contract may be construed either before or after there \nhas been a breach thereof[,]” N.C.G.S. § 1-254. \n23. In order for a court to have subject matter jurisdiction to render a \ndeclaratory judgment, “the pleadings and evidence [must] disclose the existence of an \nactual con troversy between the parties having adverse interests in the matter in  \ndispute[ ] . . . at the time the pleading requesting declaratory relief was filed.”  Button \nv. Level Four Orthotics & Prosthetics, Inc. , 380 N.C. 459, 466 (2022) (cleaned up).  \nAlthough “[a]bsolute certainty of litigation is not required,” id., “it is necessary that \nlitigation appear unavoidable,” Sharpe v. Park Newspapers of Lumberton, Inc. , 317 \nN.C. 579, 589 (1986) (quoting Gaston Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Harrison, 311 N.C. 230, \n234 (1984)).  “Mere apprehension or the mere threat of an action or a suit is not \nenough.”  Gaston Bd. of Realtors, Inc., 311 N.C. at 234 (cleaned up).  Instead, it is \n[t]he imminence and practical certainty of the act or event in issue, or \nthe intent, capacity, and power to perform, [that] create[s] justiciability \nas clearly as the completed act or event, and is generally easily \ndistinguishable from remote, contingent, and uncertain events that may \nnever happen and upon which it would be improper to pass as operative \nfacts. \n \nReese v. Brooklyn Vill., LLC, 209 N.C. App. 636, 652 (2011) (quoting Sharpe, 317 N.C. \nat 590 (emphasis omitted)). \n24. The FSU Board argues that, at the time the ACC filed its Complaint, \n“litigation was still speculative and not unavoidable[.]” 47  Because the “FSU Board \nhad not yet met, much less voted to initiate litigation,” the FSU Board contends that \nit “could have voted not to authorize the Florida Action at that time, or not actually \nfiled the Florida Action even if authorized.”48  As a result, the FSU Board asserts that \nno actual and justiciable controversy existed when the ACC filed  its Complaint late \nin the afternoon on 21 December 2023.49 \n \n47 (FSU Bd.’s Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 10 [hereinafter “Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots.”], ECF No. 20; see \nFSU Bd.’s Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 7–8 [hereinafter “Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots.”], ECF No. 41.) \n \n48 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 10; see Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 7–8.) \n \n49 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 10; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 8.) \n25. The Court finds th is argument without merit.  Under the Grant of Rights, \nthe FSU Board agreed that “it will not take any action, or permit any action to be \ntaken by others subject to its control, . . . or fail to take any action, that would affect \nthe validity and enforcement of the Rights granted to the Conference under this \nAgreement.”\n50  As the ACC correctly notes, “[t]o protect its rights [under the Grant of \nRights], the Conference was not required to wait until FSU sued, breac hing that \ncovenant[,]” but “was entitled to enforce that covenant when breach was imminent.”51  \nSee, e.g., Lee Ray Bergman Real Est. Rentals v. N.C. Fair Hous. Ctr., 153 N.C. App. \n176, 179 (2002) (“To satisfy standing requirements, a plaintiff must show . . . injury \nthat is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent[.]”); River Birch Assocs. v. \nCity of Raleigh, 326 N.C. 100, 129 (1990)  (“To have standing the complaining \nassociation or one of its members must suffer some immediate or threatened injury.”).  \nMoreover, under the ESPN Agreements, the ACC was obligated to “ take all \n[Commercially Reasonable Efforts] to protect the rights provided to ESPN[ ]” through \nthe Grant of Rights and Amended Grant of Rights. 52  While the ESPN Agreements \ndid not require the ACC to initiate litigation to protect ESPN’s rights, the ACC had \n \n50 (Grant of Rights ¶ 6.) \n \n51 (Pl.’s Br.

The ACC alleges that, as early as 24 February 2023, the FSU Board “openly \ndiscussed withdrawing from the Conference and the cost of the withdrawal payment \nin order to facilitate a move to another conference in order to receive more money.”54  \nThe ACC further alleges that FSU “began to advocate for more money for the \nuniversity through unequal sharing of revenue[,]” 55 and, on 17 May 2023 , the ACC \n“endorsed the concept of distributing a larger share of post -season revenues to the \nMembers that generated those revenues[ .]”56  Nevertheless, the ACC alleges that \nFSU continued to “advocat[e] for an unequal share of all Conference revenue,”57 once \nagain discussing the possibility of leaving the ACC at the 2 August 2023 meeting of \n \n53 “Commercially Reasonable Efforts” is a defined term in the ESPN Agreements.  The \nportions of the ESPN Agreements initially in the record did not include the definition of this \nterm.  At the  Court’s request, the ACC supplied the Court and the FSU Board with the \nfollowing definition from the ESPN Agreements, which it made part of the public record,  \nprior to the Hearing: \n \n1.24 “ Commercially Reasonable Efforts”:  With respect to a given goal or \nobjective, the efforts that a reasonable commercial person or entity in the \nposition of the party undertaking to pursue such goal or objective would use so \nas to achieve such a goal or objective expeditiously; provided, however, that \nCommercially Reasonable Efforts shall not require any party to incur or \nbecome obligated to incur any expense not otherwise specifically provided for \nin this Agreement, including fees and expenses of counsel and consultants, or \nto incur any liability or waive or concede any right or claim that such party \nmay have. \n \n54 (Compl. ¶ 94; FAC ¶ 117; see also Compl. ¶¶ 95–96; FAC ¶¶ 118–19.) \n \n55 (Compl. ¶ 97; FAC ¶ 120.) \n \n56 (Compl. ¶ 99; FAC ¶ 122.) \n \n57 (Compl. ¶ 101 (emphasis omitted); FAC ¶ 124 (emphasis omitted).) \n \nthe FSU Board.58  The day before this meeting, the Chair of the FSU Board stated in \na public interview that the Grant of Rights “will not be the document that keeps us \nfrom taking action.”59 \n27. On 21 December 2023, the FSU Board notified the public that an emergency \nmeeting would occur the following day.60  Leading up to that meeting, the ACC alleges \nthat “each of the [FSU] Board Members had been privy to ‘individual briefings’ over \nthe course of several months[ ]” and that the Chair “had spoken individually with all \n[FSU] Board Members for the purpose of securing the necessary votes to proceed to \nlitigation.”61  In addition, the ACC alleges that a draft complaint “had been \ntransmitted to all [ FSU Board] Members several days before[  ]” the meeting 62 and \nthat a copy of the original complaint in the Florida Action appeared on FSU’s news \nservice prior to the FSU Board meeting on 22 December 2023. 63  And, of course, the \nFSU Board initiated litigation against the ACC within hours after the FSU Board \nmeeting concluded.64  \n \n58 (See Compl. ¶¶  102–04; FAC ¶¶  125, 129– 32; see generally FAC Ex. 10 , ECF Nos. 11 \n(sealed), 12.10 (public unredacted).) \n \n59 (Compl. ¶  107; FAC ¶  135; see FAC Ex. 11 at 8, ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), 12.11 (public \nunredacted).)

Compl. 1.) \n28. Viewing these allegations as true and in the light most favorable to the ACC \nas it must under Rule 12(b)(1), the Court concludes that, as of the filing of this action, \nthe FSU Board’s initiation of litigation over the Grant of Rights Agreements  was \nunavoidable and a practical certainty .  While it was theoretically possible that the \nFSU Board would decide not to file suit at its 22 December Board meeting, it has not \noffered any evidence to rebut the ACC’s allegations and proof showing that the FSU \nBoard had decided to file suit as of the filing of the ACC’s Complaint and that the \nFSU Board’s approval of that action on 22 December was a mere formality to its  \ninstitution of the Florida Action .  See, e.g., Ferrell v. Dep’t of Transp. , 334 N.C. 650, \n656 (1993) (concluding that where “it is conceivable that litigation [might] not arise[,]” \nsuch “contingencies and possibilities[ ] . . . do not make the case nonjusticiable”); City \nof New Bern v. New Bern -Craven Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 328 N.C. 557,  559 (1991) \n(concluding a justiciable controversy existed when plaintiff challenged a statute that \nremoved “[a] right which previously belonged to the plaintiff”); Bueltel v. Lumber Mut. \nIns. Co., 134 N.C. App. 626, 629 (1999) (determining a justiciable controversy existed \nwhere plaintiff sought a judgment as to whether or not his past and present actions \nviolated a contract) ; Stephenson v. Parsons, 96 N.C. App. 93, 96 (1988) ( concluding \nthat defendant’s subsequent litigation against plaintiff “shows an actual controversy \nbetween [the] parties”).   \n29. Because the  ACC has demonstrated that, as of the filing of the ACC’s  \nComplaint, there existed “a practical certainty that li tigation would arise” with the \nFSU Board, Button, 380 N.C. at 466 (quoting Ferrell, 334 N.C. at 656), there existed \nan “actual controversy between the parties having adverse interests in the matter in \ndispute[ ] . . . at the time the pleading requesting declaratory relief was filed.”  Id. \n30. The Court therefore will deny the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss to the \nextent the FSU Board contends that an actual and justiciable controversy did not \nexist when the ACC filed this litigation.65 \n2. Condition Precedent to Initiating Suit \n31. As the ACC notes in its sur -reply, the FSU Board’s position for dismissal \nbased on the ACC’s failure to comply with a condition precedent “has shifted over \ntime.”66  The first argument advanced by the FSU Board in its supporting brief \nappears to be focused on the sufficiency of the allegations in the pleading and, thus, \nis more properly considered as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n67  Specifically, \nthe FSU Board argues that because the ACC failed to either “plead generally that all \nconditions precedent to filing this action have occurred” or “plead specifically that \n[the] . . . notice, quorum meeting, and member vote” required by the ACC \nConstitution to initiate litigation occurred, dismissal is warranted.\n68 \n \n65 Because the Court concludes that an actual and justiciable controversy existed at the time \nthe ACC filed its Complaint, the Court will also deny the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) on this ground.  See Poole v. Bahamas Sales Assoc., LLC, 209 N.C. App. \n136, 141–42 (2011) (“Although a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is seldom an \nappropriate pleading in actions for declaratory judgments, it is allowed when the record \nclearly shows that there is no basis for  declaratory relief as when the complaint does not \nallege an actual, genuine existing controversy.” (cleaned up)). \n \n66 (Sur-Reply Def.’s Mots. 3.) \n \n67 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 11–12.) \n \n68 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots.  11–12; see ACC Const. §§  1.5.1.5, 1.6.2.)  The Court notes that, \nalthough the FSU Board refers to section 1.5.4.3 of the ACC Constitution in its briefing, (see \nBr. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 11; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 3), this section refers to notice and meeting \n32. The Court disagrees.  Although North Carolina permits notice pleading, see \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 8(a), certain matters have specific pleading requirements, see N.C. R. \nCiv. P. 9.  “In pleading the performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is \nsufficient to aver generally that all conditions precedent have been performed or have \noccurred.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(c) (emphasis added).  And, when the condition precedent \nrelates to a party’s ability to bring suit, Rule 9(a) only requires that “[a]ny party not \na natural person shall make an affirmative averment showing its legal existence and \ncapacity to sue.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(a). \n33. In both its Complaint and FAC, the ACC alleges that it is “an \nunincorporated nonprofit association under North Carolina law.”69  The ACC further \nalleges that “[a]s an unincorporated nonprofit association under North Carolina law, \nthe ACC has the ability to sue in its own name and enter into contracts[,]” and “may, \nacting on its own behalf, enforce its contractual obligations with one or more of its \nMember Institutions.”\n70   \n34. At this stage, the Court  must “construe the pleading liberally and in the \nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, taking as true and admi tted all well- pleaded \nfactual allegations contained within the complaint.”  Donovan  v. Fiumara, 114 N.C. \nApp. 524, 526 (1994) (cleaned up).  Because the ACC was required only to “ make an \n \nrequirements for committees, ( see ACC Const. §  1.5.4.3).  Section 1.5.1.5 of the ACC \nConstitution sets out the notice and meeting requirements for the ACC’s Board of Directors.  \n(See ACC Const. § 1.5.1.5.) \n \n69 (Compl. ¶ 1; FAC ¶ 1.) \n \n70 (Compl. ¶ 2; FAC ¶ 2.) \n \naffirmative averment showing its legal existence and capacity to sue [,]” N.C. R. Civ. \nP. 9(a), the FSU Board’s contention that the ACC failed to plead that it had taken all \nnecessary steps prior to bringing suit, either generally or specifically, is without \nmerit. \n35. Turning to the parties’ remaining arguments, the Court obser ves that the \nparties appear to  “conflate[ ] . . . standing-related arguments with  . . . arguments \nregarding the legally and conceptually distinct issue of whether the [ACC]’s actions \nwere authorized” under the ACC Constitution.  United Daughters of the Confederacy \nv. City of Winston-Salem, 383 N.C. 612, 626 (2022) (emphasis added).  The Court will \ntherefore first determine whether the Conference “has made the necessary showing \nof standing[ ]” prior to addressing the parties’ arguments about whether the ACC was \nauthorized to bring suit.  Id. at 627. \n36. “Standing refers to whether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise \njusticiable controversy such that [the party] may properly seek adjudication of the \nmatter.”  Edwards v. Town of Louisburg, 290 N.C. App. 136, 140 (2023) (citation \nomitted).  “The North Carolina Constitution confers standing to sue in our courts on \nthose who suffer the infringement of a legal right, because ‘every person for an injury \ndone him in his lands, goods, person, or reputation shall have remedy by due course \nof law.’ ”  Comm. to Elect Dan Forest v. Emps. Pol. Action Comm., 376 N.C. 558, 610 \n(2021) (quoting N.C. Const. art. I, §  18, cl. 2).  To establish standing in North \nCarolina, “a plaintiff must demonstrate the following: a legal injury; the traceability \nof the injury to a defendant ’s actions; and the probability that the injury can be \nredressed by a favorable decision.”  Soc’y for the Hist. Pres. of the Twentysixth N.C. \nTroops, Inc. v. City of Asheville, 282 N.C. App. 701, 704 (2022) .  Thus, “ [w]hen a \nperson alleges the infringement  of a legal right directly under a cause of action at \ncommon law, a statute, or the North Carolina Constitution, . . . the legal injury itself \ngives rise to standing.”  Comm. to Elect Dan Forest, 376 N.C. at 608. \n37. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, “an action is maintainable only in so \nfar as it affects the civil rights, status and other relations in the present actual \ncontroversy between the parties.”  Edwards, 290 N.C. App. at 140.  Nevertheless, a \n“plaintiff is still required to demonstrate that it has sustained a legal or factual injury \narising from defendant[’s] actions as a prerequisite for maintaining \n[a] . . . declaratory judgment action[,]” because “[t]he mere filing of a declaratory \njudgment is not sufficient, on its own, to grant a plaintiff stand ing.”  United \nDaughters of the Confederacy, 383 N.C. at 629 (third alteration in original) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). \n38. In Willowmere Community Association v. City of Charlotte, the Supreme \nCourt of North Carolina previously determined that “[n]othing in our jurisprudence \non standing requires a corporate litigant to affirmatively plead or prove its \ncompliance with corporation bylaws and internal rules relating to its decision to bring \nsuit.”  370 N.C. 553, 560– 61 ( 2018) (emphasis added).  Even where, as here, the \ndefendant, who is a member of the plaintiff corporate litigant, raises the plaintiff’s \nfailure to comply with its internal governance procedures as a bar to plaintiff’s suit, \nWillowmere implies that defenda nt’s relief lies in contract, through a motion to \ndismiss, a motion to stay, or the initiation of a separate suit.  See id. at 561.  As long \nas a corporate litigant meets the three- pronged test to establish standing set out \nabove, it “possess[es] a suffici ent stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy to \nconfer jurisdiction on the trial court to adjudicate [a] legal dispute[,]” despite the \ncorporate litigant’s “failure to strictly comply with [its]  . . . bylaws and internal \ngovernance procedures in [its]  decision to initiate  . . . suit[.]”  Id. at 562 (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted) ; see also  Robinson on N.C. Corp. Law § 3.03[1] (“A \nplaintiff corporation’s failure to comply strictly with its bylaws and internal \ngovernance procedures in determining whether to commence litigation does not in \nitself deprive the corporation of standing to bring its claim.”). \n39. Here, and as discussed in connection with the FSU Board’s first argument \nabove, the Court concludes that the ACC has established that it had standi ng when \nit initiated this litigation on 21 December 2023.  Under the Grant of Rights \nAgreements, FSU “irrevocably and exclusively” granted its media rights to the ACC \nfor the term of those agreements.\n71  FSU additionally agreed that “it [would] not take \nany action, or permit any action to be taken by others subject to its control, . . . or fail \nto take any action, that would affect the validity and enforcement of the Rights \ngranted to the Conference under this Agreement.”72  Based on these representations, \n \n71 (See Compl. ¶¶ 52–53, 56–59, 76–80, 117; FAC ¶¶ 61–62, 65–68, 83–86; Grant of Rights \n¶¶ 1, 6; Am. Grant of Rights ¶  3 (“Except as specifically modified by this Amendment, the \nterms of the [Grant of Rights] will remain in full force and effect.”).) \n \n72 (Compl. ¶ 55 (quoting Grant of Rights ¶ 6); FAC ¶ 64 (same).) \n \nthe ACC entered into the ESPN Agreements on behalf of its Members, 73 “which \nsignificantly increased the revenues paid to the Conference and distributed to its \nMember Institutions, including [FSU].”74 \n40. The ACC alleges that the FSU Board has “breached, ignored, or otherwise \nviolated the terms of the Grant of Rights and Amended Grant of Rights[.]” 75  In \nsupport, the Conference alleges that FSU began seeking a greater share of \nConference revenue in early 2023 ;76 openly discussed leaving the Conf erence at \nmeetings of the FSU Board in February and August 2023 ;77 provided “individual \nbriefings” for, and circulated a draft complaint to, each of the FSU Board Members to \n“secur[e] the necessary votes to proceed to litigation[  ]”;78 and held an “emergen cy” \nmeeting of the FSU Board on 22 December 2023 to authorize the filing of “a \npreemptive lawsuit against the ACC in Leon County, Florida[.]”\n79  “By challenging \nthe validity of the Grant of Rights and Amended Grant of Rights through the Florida \nAction,” th e ACC alleges that the FSU Board “seeks to undermine or destroy the \ncontracts and agreements that enable the Conference to create a viable collegiate \n \n73 (See Compl. ¶¶ 69–75; FAC ¶¶ 78–84.) \n \n74 (Compl. ¶ 120; FAC ¶ 177; see FAC ¶¶ 109, 111.) \n \n75 (FAC ¶ 181; see Compl. ¶ 124.) \n \n76 (See Compl. ¶¶ 97–102; FAC ¶¶ 120–25.) \n \n77 (See Compl. ¶¶ 94–96, 103–08; FAC ¶¶ 117–19, 129–32.) \n \n78 (FAC ¶¶ 153–55.) \n \n79 (FAC ¶ 148; see Compl. ¶ 114; FAC ¶¶ 148–57, 168.) \n \nathletic conference that, through its activities, enhances and funds college athletics \nfor its Members.”80 \n41. As such, the ACC has demonstrated that it has “a legally protected interest” \nthat has been “invaded” by the FSU Board’s pursuit of a declaratory judgment with \nrespect to the validity and enforceability of the Grant of Rights Agreements .  Soc’y \nfor the Hist. Pres. of the Twentysixth N.C. Troops, Inc., 282 N.C. App. at 704 (citation \nomitted).  Because the ACC’s “injury can be redressed by a favorable decision[,]” id. ; \nnamely, through a “Declaration that the Grant of Rights and [A]mended Grant of \nRights is [sic] a valid and enforceable contract [sic] between [FSU] and the ACC[,]”\n81 \nthe Court concludes that the ACC had standing to bring suit when it filed its original \nComplaint on 21 December 2023  under the threat of the FSU Board’s imminent \nbreach.  See id. (requiring “a legal injury; the traceability of the injury to a defendant’s \nactions; and the probability that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision” \nfor standing to obtain). \n42. Although argued in the context of “standing,” the parties’ remaining \narguments actually focus on whether the ACC was authorized  to initiate litigation \nagainst FSU.  The FSU Board argues that, because the Conference did not comply \nwith a provision of the AC C Constitution that requires the Conference to obtain the \napproval of an “Absolute Two-Thirds” majority of the ACC Member Institutions prior \n \n80 (FAC ¶ 249.) \n \n81 (FAC Prayer for Relief ¶ 1.) \nto “the initiation of any material litigation involving the Conference[,]”82 dismissal is \nwarranted.83 \n43. The ACC does not dispute that it did not  obtain an “Absolute Two -Thirds” \nmajority approval of its Members prior to filing the Complaint; rather, the Conference \ncontends tha t such approval was unnecessary because the relief requested in the \nComplaint did not amount to “material litigation” and, moreover, had been previously \nauthorized by the Members based on the ACC’s obligation to protect ESPN’s rights \nunder the ESPN Agreements. 84  And, “[w]hile not required because the original \nComplaint was valid,” 85 the ACC further contends that an “Absolute Two -Thirds” \nmajority of the Member Institutions approved the filing of the FAC, which included \nthe original claims as they were asserted in the Complaint, at a duly called meeting  \nof the ACC Board on 12 January 2024, thus retroactively ratifying the filing of the \nComplaint.\n86 \n44. Although the parties direct much of their focus on the ACC’s first two \ncontentions, even if the Court were to assume, as the FSU Board argues, that the \nrelief requested in the Complaint constituted “material litigation” and that the \n \n82 (ACC Const. § 1.6.2.) \n \n83 (See Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 3–6.) \n \n84 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 8–9; Sur-Reply Def.’s Mots. 11.) \n \n85 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 9.) \n \n86 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 9; Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 3–5 [hereinafter “Hostetter \nAff.”], ECF No. 31.2; Sur-Reply Def.’s Mots. 5–8.) \n \ninstitution of litigation was not contemplated in “the already-approved obligation [of \nthe ACC] to take commercially reasonable action[  ]” to protect the Gran t of Rights \nAgreements under the terms of the ESPN Agreements, 87 the Court concludes that \nthe FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss for failure of a condition precedent must be denied \nbecause the ACC’s evidence of ratification is unrebutted and dispositive. \n45. Our Court of Appeals has defined “ratification” as “the affirmance by a \nperson of a prior act which did not bind him but which was done or professedly done \non his account, whereby the act, as to some or all persons, is given effect as if \noriginally authorized by him.”  King Fa, LLC v. Chen, 248 N.C. App. 221, 226 (2016) \n(citation omitted).  “To establish ratification, a plaintiff must show that the principal \nhad full knowledge of all material facts and that the principal intended to ratify the \nact.”  Hilco Transp., Inc. v. Atkins, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 5, at *29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. \n15, 2016). \n46. Far from “turn[ing] the law of internal governance on its head” as the FSU \nBoard contends,88 ratification is a practice frequently employed by corporate entities \nto approve defective actions which the entities failed to originally authorize.  See, e.g., \nN.C.G.S. §§ 55-1-61 to -65 (permitting ratification of defective corporate actions under \nthe N orth Carolina Business Corporation Act); Holland v. Warren , 2020 NCBC \nLEXIS 146, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 15, 2020) (noting that courts have interpreted \nN.C.G.S. §  55A-8-31(a)(1) to permit a nonprofit board to cure an improper act or \n \n87 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 9.) \n \n88 (Reply Supp. Def.’s Br. 6 n.4.) \ntransaction through ratification).  Just like any other corporate action, a failure to \ncomply with procedural prerequisites prior to initiating litigation can be ratified by a \ncorporate entity, such that the prior act “is given effect as if originally authorized by \n[that corporate entity] .”  King Fa, LLC , 248 N.C. App. at 226; see Gao v. Sinova \nSpecialties, Inc., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 70, at *14 –15 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 16, 2018) \n(“[I]t is immaterial whether the board complied with the bylaws prior to asserting its \noriginal and first amended counterclaims” because “the board subsequently complied \nwith its bylaws and ratified Sinova US’s engagement of counsel and the \ncounterclaims” and “filed its second amended counterclaims after the board approved \nfiling the counterclaims[.]”). \n47. T he four cases the FSU Board relies on in opposition do not compel a \ndifferent result.  Two of the cases  are silent as to whether the corporate litigants \nattempted to later authorize the improperly initiated litigation by ratification .  See \nPeninsula Prop. Owners Ass’n v. Crescent Res., LLC , 171 N.C. App. 89, 97 (2005); \nAtkinson v. Lexington Cmty. Ass’n , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 101, at * 9 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nAug. 16, 2023) (dismissing claims without prejudice because the association “could \nobtain member approval in th e future and file a new lawsuit[  ]”).  Moreover, t he \ncourts in the other two cases  expressly emphasized the plaintiff associations’ post -\nsuit actions.  See Willowmere, 370 N.C. at 561 (noting that “[t]here is no evidence in \nthis case suggesting that any member of the [plaintiff associations] opposed plaintiffs’ \nprosecution of this suit[ ]”);89 Homestead at Mills River Prop. Owners Ass’n v. Hyder, \n \n89 Although the issue was not before the Supreme Court, the  Court of Appeals noted in its \ndecision in Willowmere that “plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that the boards took \nNo. COA17 -606, 2018 N.C. App. LEXIS 622, at *9 (N.C. Ct. App. June 19, 2018) \n(unpublished) (noting that, in cont rast to Willowmere , “there was ample evidence \nindicating that a number of Plaintiff’s members opposed this lawsuit[ ]”).90 \n48. Courts in other jurisdictions have also held that a corporate entity may later \nratify the initiation of litigation that was unauthorized at the time of filing.  See, e.g., \nFirst Telebanc Corp. v. First Union Corp., No. 02-80715-CIV-GOLD/TURNOFF, 2007 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 114903, at *26 (S.D. Fla.

Md. \n2016) ( “[W]hen an officer has acted without authority in bringing a suit, the \ncorporation may ratify the action, which is the equivalent of the officer’s having had \noriginal authority to bring the lawsuit.” (citation and quotation marks omitted)); \nCmty. Collaborative of Bridgeport, Inc. v. Ganim, 698 A.2d 245, 254–55 (Conn. 1997) \n(affirming trial court’s finding that board did not ratify officer’s unilateral initiation \nof litigation); City of McCall v. Buxton , 201 P.3d 629, 640 (Idaho 2009) (“ [T]he fact \nthat the city manager did not have the authority to authorize the commencement of \n \naction in accord with their bylaws to ratify the filing of the lawsuit after the issue of standing \nwas raised,” 250 N.C. App. 292, 304 (2016), suggesting that the plaintiff boards of directors \ncould have retroactively ratified their earlier decision to file litigation by subsequent board \naction.  \n \n90 In opposing ratification, the FSU Board also relies on Town of Midland v. Harrell, in which \nthe Supreme Court of North Carolina stated that “[s]ubsequent events cannot confer \nstanding retroactively.”  385 N.C. 365, 371 (2023).  But as the Court has noted above, the \nconcepts of standing and authorization to act are “legally and conceptually distinct issue[s,]” \nUnited Daughters of the Confederacy , 383 N.C. at 626, and ratification implicates issues of \nauthorization, not standing.  Thus, Town of Midland is inapposite. \n \nthis lawsuit does not require dismissal where the city council later ratified that action \nin a meeting that complied with the open meeting laws.”); City of Topeka v. Imming, \n344 P.3d 957, 964 (Kan. Ct. App. 2015) (“[T]he City Council could not ratify the City \nManager’s decision to file this lawsuit without an open, affirmative vote on the matter \nor by taking some action consistent with ratification.”) ; McGuire Performance Sols., \nInc. v.

The FSU Board alleges that this notice was ineffective because FSU \ndid not receive notice of this special meeting.  (See Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 1.)  This argument \nis without merit.  As the Conference notes in its sur-reply, the complaint in the Florida Action \nrequests that FSU “be deemed to have issued its formal notice of withdrawal from the ACC \nunder Section 1.4.5 of the ACC Constitution effective August 14, 2023.”  ( Sur-Reply Def.’s \nMots. 4 n.1 (quoting Fla. Compl. 33).)  Section 1.5.1.3 of the ACC Constitution provides that \n“[t]he CEO of any Member that . . . withdraws from the Conference pursuant to Section 1.4.5 \nshall automatically cease to be a Director  . . . , and shall cease to have the right to vote on \nany matter as of the effective date of the . . . withdrawal.”  In addition,  \n \n[d]uring the period between the delivery of a notice of . . . withdrawal and the \neffective date of the . . . withdrawal, the Board . . . may withhold any \ninformation from, and exclude from any meeting  . . . and/or any vote, the \nDirector . . . of the  . . . withdrawing member, if the Board determines \nthat . . . such attendance, access to information or voting could present a \ndays’ notice,94 Hostetter avers that the required three-fourths of all Directors waived \nthis notice requirement.95  Furthermore, Hostetter avers that a quorum of Directors \nattended the special meeting and “unanimously approved the filing of the [FAC] in \nthis matter, inclusive of the original claims in the Complaint filed on December 21, \n2023.”96  In his affidavit, Hostetter confirms that th e 12 January 2024 vote met the \n“Absolute Two- Thirds” majority vote required by Section 1.6.2 of the ACC \nConstitution to initiate “material litigation involving the Conference[.]”97 \n50. Thus, the record clearly demonstrates that, by approving the filing of the \nFAC, which includes the original declaratory judgment claims as they were asserted \nin the original Complaint, the ACC Board of Directors “ had full knowledge of all \nmaterial facts” and “intended to ratify” the filing of the Complaint on 21 December \n2023.  Hilco Transp., Inc. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 5, at * 29.  In light of this \nuncontroverted evidence, the Court concludes that the ACC was properly authorized \nto bring this litigation. \n \nconflict of interest for the . . . withdrawing member or is otherwise not in the \nbest interests of the Conference, as determined by the Board. \n \n(ACC Const. § 1.5.1.3.)  The Court agrees with the ACC that “[a] meeting to decide whether \naffirmative claims should be made against FSU  . . . presented just such a conflict of \ninterest[,]” (Sur-Reply Def.’s Mots. 4 n.1), such that the ACC was not required to provide the \nFSU Board with notice of the 12 January 2024 special meeting. \n \n94 (ACC Const. § 1.5.1.5.1.) \n \n95 (See Hostetter Aff. ¶ 3 (referencing ACC Const. § 1.5.1.5.2).) \n \n96 (Hostetter Aff. ¶¶ 3, 5.) \n \n97 (See Hostetter Aff. ¶ 5.) \n51. Because the Court concludes both that the ACC had standing to bring this \nlawsuit at the time it filed its original Complaint and that the ACC Board of Directors \nratified the initiation of this litigation three weeks later, the Court will deny the FSU \nBoard’s Motion to Dismiss to the extent the FSU Board contends this action shoul d \nbe dismissed for failure to comply with any conditions precedent. \n3. Sov ereign Immunity  \n52. Prior to 2019, sovereign “immunity [was] available only if the forum State \n‘voluntar[ily]’ decide[d] ‘to respect the dignity of the [defendant State] as a matter of \ncomity.’ ”  Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt  (Hyatt III), 587 U.S. 230, 236 (2019) \n(second and fourth alterations in original) (quoting Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 416 \n(1979)).  But the United States Supreme Court expressly overruled Nevada v. Hall in \nHyatt III, holding that the U nited States Constitution does not “permit[ ] a State to \nbe sued by a private party without its consent in the courts of a different State.”  Id.  \nat 233.  The Supreme Court, however, did not explain what form this “consent” must \ntake in Hyatt III.  Three years later, the  Supreme Court of North Carolina  took up \nthis unanswered question in Farmer v. Troy University , 382 N.C. 366 (2022).   The \nACC contends that Farmer controls and establishes that FSU has expressly \nconsented to suit in the courts of the State of North Carolina.98 \n53. The FSU Board, however,  argues that the ACC’s reliance on Farmer is \ninapposite because “it pertains to a different statutory scheme —the North Carolina \n \n98 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 10–12; Sur-Reply Def.’s Mots. 12–14.) \n \nNonprofit Corporation Act  [the ‘N CNCA’]”99—rather than to the Uniform \nUnincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (the “UUNAA”), N.C.G.S. §§ 59B-1 to -15, \nunder which the ACC is organized.   The FSU Board contends that, unlike the \ndefendant state uni versity in Farmer, it neither  “ registered as a nonprofit \ncorporation[ ]” nor “has it been issued a certificate of authority to operate in this \nstate[.]”100  The FSU Board argues that because “[t]hese requirements simply do not \napply to members of unincorporated associations,” the courts of  North Carolina \ncannot exercise jurisdiction over it under either the UUNAA or Farmer.101 \n54. But the FSU Board’s focus on the N CNCA is misplaced.  As the ACC \ndemonstrates in its opposition brief, 102 Farmer sets out the general framework for \ndetermining what constitutes “consent” to suit in North Carolina post-Hyatt III.  This \nCourt must therefore look to Farmer to determine whether the FSU Board has waived \nits sovereign immunity based on the allegations in the FAC. \n55. In Farmer, Troy University, an Alabama state institution,  registered as a \nnonprofit corporation with the North Carolina Secretary of State, leased an office \nbuilding in North Carolina, and employed Farmer to recruit military personnel in \nNorth Carolina to take its online educational courses.  See Farmer, 382 N.C. at 367.  \nAfter his employment was terminated, Farmer brought suit against Troy University \n \n99 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 14.) \n \n100 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 14; see also Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 8–9.) \n \n101 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 15; see also Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 8–9.) \n \n102 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 9–12.) \nfor various tort claims.  Id.   Shortly after the U nited States Supreme Court decided \nHyatt III, Troy University moved for dismissal based on sovereign immunity.  Id.  at \n369. \n56. The Alabama Constitution provides that “the State of Alabama shall never \nbe made a defendant in any court of law or equity.”  Ala. Const. a rt. I, § 14.  The \nSupreme Court of North Carolina observed in Farmer that this immunity “extend[ed] \nto [the State of Alabama’s] institutions of higher learning.”  Farmer, 382 N.C. at 370 \n(second alteration in original) (quoting Ala. State Univ. v. Danley, 212 So. 3d 112, 122 \n(Ala. 2016)).  Having th en concluded that, “[u]nder Hyatt III and the United States \nConstitution, as a general matter, Troy University is entitled to sovereign immunity \nfrom suit without its consent in the state courts of every state in the country[,]” id. at \n271, our Supreme Court then set about determining whether Troy University had \nconsented to waive its sovereign immunity in North Carolina state court. \n57. The Supreme Court began its analysis in Farmer by reiterating that “any \nwaiver of sovereign immunity must be explicit.”  Id.   As a registered nonprofit \ncorporation, Troy University was subject to the NCNCA, which contains the following \nsue and be sued clause: \n(a) Unless its articles of incorporation or this Chapter provides \notherwise, every corporation  . . . has the same powers as an individual \nto do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its affairs, including \nwithout limitation, power: \n(1) To sue and be sued, complain and defend in its corporate \nname[.] \n \nN.C.G.S. § 55A-3-02(a)(1).  Stressing that it was “crucial” to its “analysis that Hyatt \nIII did not involve a sue and be sued clause[,]” the Farmer Court instead looked to \nThacker v. Tennessee Valley Authority, another recent case in which the United States \nSupreme Court addressed the effect of a sue and be sued clause on sovereign \nimmunity.  Farmer, 382 N.C. at 372. \n58. In Thacker, the United States  Supreme Court explained that “[s]ue-and-be-\nsued clauses . . . should be liberally construed[,]” noting that “[t]hose word s in their \nusual and ordinary sense . . . embrace all civil process incident to the commencement \nor continuance of legal proceedings.”  Thacker, 139 S. Ct. 1435, 1441 (2019) (citations \nand quotation marks omitted).  But, according to our Supreme Court  in Farmer, \nThacker placed a limit on these types of clauses: “[A]lthough a sue and be sued clause \nallows suits to proceed against a public corporation’s commercial  activity, just as \nthese actions would proceed against a private company, suits challenging an entity’s \ngovernmental activity may be limited.”  Farmer, 382 N.C. at 372 (emphasis added) \n(citing Thacker, 139 S.  Ct. at 1443).  Our Supreme Court therefore concluded that , \n“while Hyatt III  . . . requires a State to acknowledge a sister State’s sovereign \nimmunity, Thacker recognizes that a sue and be sued clause can act as a waiver of \nsovereign immunity when a state entity’s nongovernmental  activity is being \nchallenged.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n59. Applying these principles to the facts in Farmer, our Supreme Court \ndetermined that Troy University was engaged in commercial activit y in North \nCarolina, specifically  the marketing and selling of online educational programs , \nrather than governmental activity.  Id. at 373.  Because Troy University knew that it \nwas subject to the NCNCA and its sue and be sued clause when it chose to do business \nin North Carolina, “it explicitly waived its sovereign immunity.”  Id. \n60. Farmer found additional support for Troy University’s waiver of sovereign \nimmunity in article 15 of the NCNCA, which requires a foreign corporation operating \nin North Carolina to obtain a certificate of authority.  Id.  at 374.  “A certificate of \nauthority author izes the foreign corporation  . . . to conduct affairs in this State[,]” \nN.C.G.S. § 55A-15-05(a), and gives the foreign corporation “the same but no greater \nrights and . . . the same but no greater privileges as, and is subject to the same duties, \nrestrictions, penalties, and liabilities  . . . imposed on, a domestic corporation of like \ncharacter[,]” id. § 55A-15-05(b).  Our Supreme Court separately concluded that, “[b]y \nrequesting and receiving a certificate of authority to do business in North Carolina, \nrenting a building here, and hiring local staff, Troy University, as an arm of the State \nof Alabama, consented to be treated like ‘a domestic corporation of like character,’ \nand to be sued in North Carolina.”  Farmer, 382 N.C. at 374– 75 (quoting N.C.G.S. \n§ 55-15-05(b)). \n61. The Court shall now apply the framework created by our Supreme Court in \nFarmer to determine whether, based on the allegations in the FAC and the current \nrecord, the FSU Board has consented to suit in North Carolina and thereby waived \nits sovereign immunity for purposes of this action. \n62. The Court begins with the presumption that the State of Florida may not \n“be sued by a private party without its consent in the courts of [ this] State.”  Hyatt \nIII, 587 U.S. at 233.  Florida has extended its sovereign immunity to include its public \nuniversities because “[u]niversity boards of trustees are a part of the executive branch \nof state government.”  Fla. Stat. Ann. § 1001.71(3).  The Court therefore concludes \nthat, “as a general matte r, [the FSU Board] is entitled to sovereign immunity from \nsuit without its consent in the state courts of every state in the country.”  Farmer, \n382 N.C. at 371.  The Court must now determine whether the FSU Board explicit ly \nwaived its sovereign immunity to suit in North Carolina. \n63. The UUNAA contains the following sue and be sued clause : “A nonprofit \nassociation, in its name, may institute, defend, intervene, or participate in a judicial, \nadministrative, or other governmental proceeding or in an arbitration, mediation, or \nany other form of alternative dispute resolution.”103  N.C.G.S. § 59B-8(1).  In addition, \nthe UUNAA expressly permits  the ACC, as a North Carolina unincorporated \nnonprofit association, and the FSU Board, as a Member of the ACC ,104 to bring suit \nagainst each other: “A member of, or a person referred to as a ‘member’ by, a nonprofit \nassociation may assert a claim against or on behalf of the nonprofit association.  A \nnonprofit association may assert a claim against a member or a person referred to as \na ‘member’ by the nonprofit association.”  N.C.G.S. § 59B-7(e).  Because “a sue and be \nsued clause can act as a waiver of sovereign immunity when a state entity’s \nnongovernmental activity is being challenged[,]” Farmer, 382 N.C. at 372  (citing \nThacker, 139 S. Ct. at 1441), the Court must next analyze the FSU Board’s activities \n \n103 Although the language of the statute itself does not include the phrase “sue and be sued,” \nthe Official Comment affirmatively states that an unincorporated nonprofit association “may \nsue and be sued.”  N.C.G.S. § 59B-8 off. cmt. ¶ 1. \n \n104 (See FAC ¶¶ 1–2.) \n \nin this State and decide if they are of a commercial or governmental nature.  In doing \nso, the Court views the allegations in the FAC as true and, if appropriate, may also \nconsider matters outside the FAC.  See Parker, 243 N.C. App. at 96– 97 (under Rule \n12(b)(2), “[w]hen neither party submits evidence,  . . . [t]he trial judge must decide \nwhether the complaint contains allegations that, if taken as true, set forth a sufficient \nbasis for the court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction” (cleaned up)). \n64. Since it joined the ACC in 1991, FSU  has engaged in “continuous and \nsystematic membership and governance activities” that “arise out of its membership \nin and management of the Conference [.]”\n105  For example, the President of FSU is a \nmember of the ACC’s Board of Directors and “regularly attend[s] ACC meetings held \nin the State of North Carolina .”106  “Three of the four most recent in -person [ACC] \nBoard of Directors meetings were held in North Carolina[,]” and FSU’s President \n“attended each of these meetings either via Zoom or in person.”\n107  In addition, the \nACC alleges that FSU’s President s, Athletic Directors , and Head Coaches have \n“played an active role in the administration of ACC af fairs[ ]” and in “advancing the \nmission of the ACC[,]” and lists in the FAC the numerous Conference leadership and \ncommittee positions held by these individuals over the past decade.108  Moreover, the \n \n105 (FAC ¶ 7; see FAC ¶¶ 8, 36.) \n \n106 (FAC ¶ 8.) \n \n107 (FAC ¶ 10 (stating that the “Conference generally holds two meetings of the Board of \nDirectors per month, with three of these meetings held in person annually, often in North \nCarolina[ ]”).) \n \n108 (FAC ¶ 9; see also FAC ¶¶ 11 (indicating that the ACC Board of Directors, including the \nFSU President, voted to relocate the Conference’s headquarters to Charlotte to secure a $15 \nFSU President has approved the ACC’s execution of several media rights agreements \nentered into on behalf of all of the ACC’s Member Institutions. 109  The FSU Board \nhas not sought to refute any of these allegations.  \n65. As a “collegiate academic and athletic conference[,]”110 the ACC’s purpose is \nto “enrich and balance the athletic and educational experiences of student-athletes at \nits member institutions[,] to enhance athletic and academic integrity among its \nmembers, to provide leadership, and to do this in a spirit of fairn ess to all.”111  More \nspecifically, the ACC seeks to provide “quality competitive opportunities for student-\nathletes in a broad spectrum of amateur sports and championships[,]” and ensure  \n“responsible fiscal management and further financial stability[ ]” by  “[a]ddress[ing] \nthe future needs of athletics” for the “mutual benefit of the Members[.]”112 \n66. Historically, the ACC’s main source of income has consisted of the payments \nit receives in exchange for granting exclusive media rights  to broadcast athletic \n \nmillion financial incentive derived from North Carolina taxpayer dollars),  16 (describing \nFSU’s participation in various ACC championship events held in North Carolina), 57– 67 \n(explaining the benefits of the Grant of Rights and the FSU President’s execution thereof), \n83–104 (discussing the same with respect to the Amended Grant of Rights), 120– 22 \n(discussing how FSU convinced the ACC to distribute “a larger share of post-season revenues \nto the Members that generated those revenues, rather than equally among all Members[ ]”).) \n \n109 (See, e.g., FAC ¶¶ 45 (alleging approval of the 2010 Multi-Media Agreement), 104 (alleging \napproval of the ESPN Agreements).) \n \n110 (FAC ¶ 28.) \n \n111 (FAC ¶ 38 (quoting ACC Const. § 1.2.1).) \n \n112 (ACC Const. §§ 1.2.1(c), (g), (i).) \n \nevents and competitions involving athletes from ACC Member Institutions .113  “By \naggregating the Media Rights from each Member Institution, the Conference was \nable to increase the total value of those rights[.]”114  The Conference then distributes \nthe payments it receives under these media rights agreements, totaling hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, to its Members, including FSU.115   \n67. Based on this record, t he Court first concludes that the ACC’s activities, \nspecifically the sponsorship of athletic ev ents and the marketing of media rights for \nthose events, are commercial in nature.  The Court further concludes that , as a \nMember of the ACC, FSU’s Conference- related activities in this State are also \ncommercial, rather than governmental, in nature.  See T hacker, 139 S. Ct. at 1443 \n(describing “governmental activities” as the “the kinds of functions private parties \ntypically do not perform[ ]”).  Because the FSU Board knew that it was subject to the \nUUNAA and its sue and be sued clause when it chose to be a  member of a North \nCarolina unincorporated nonprofit association , and because FSU engage d in \nextensive commercial activity in North Carolina as described above, Farmer instructs \nthat FSU “explicitly waived its sovereign immunity” to suit in this State.  Farmer, \n382 N.C. at 373. \n \n113 (See FAC ¶¶  12–14, 48–51 ( estimating potential losses of  “$72 Million to over $200 \nMillion[ ]” in media rights payments alone should a Member Institution withdraw  from the \nACC).) \n \n114 (FAC ¶ 60.) \n \n115 (See FAC Summary of Claims, ¶¶ 14, 44, 58, 70–71, 73, 78, 109–11.) \n \n68. In its supporting and reply briefs, the FSU Board argues that the statutory \nwaiver of sovereign immunity found in Fla. Stat. Ann. § 1001.72(1), which states that \n“[e]ach board of trustees shall be a public body corporate  . . . , with all the powers of \na body corporate, including the power to  . . . contract and be contracted with, to sue \nand be sued, [and] to plead and be impleaded in all courts of law or equity,” does not \nextend beyond the State of Florida. 116  The FSU Board contends that , u nless \n“expressly stated in the statute,” “the phrase ‘all courts’ necessarily refers only to all \ncourts in the State of Florida .”117  Although t he Court questions the FSU Board’s  \nnarrow reading of this statute, see Storey Mt., LLC v. George, 357 So. 3d 709, 715 (Fla. \n4th Dist. Ct. App. 2023) (“The use by the Legislature of [a] comprehensive term \nindicates an intent to include everything embraced within the term.” (alteration in \noriginal) (citation omitted)), the Court is not required to engage in statutory \ninterpretation under Farmer, where our Supreme Court held that, despite the fact \nthat “[s]overeign immunity [was] enshrined in Alabama’s Constitution,” Troy \nUniversity had waived its sovereign immunity by engaging in comm ercial, rather \nthan governmental, activities within this State  under a sue and be sued clause , \nFarmer 382 N.C. at 370, 373.\n118 \n \n116 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 13; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 9.) \n \n117 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 13.) \n \n118 The Court notes that the United States Supreme Court denied Troy University’s petition \nfor writ of certiorari.  See Troy Univ. v. Farmer, 143 S. Ct. 2561 (2023), cert denied. \n \n69. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, under Farmer, the FSU Board has \nwaived its sovereign immunity and is subject to this suit in North Carolina.  The \nCourt will therefore deny the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss to the extent it seeks \ndismissal on grounds of sovereign immunity.119 \nIII. \nMOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO RULE 12(b)(7) \nA. Legal Standard \n70. Under Rule 12(b)(7), a necessary party must be joined to an action.  See \nStrickland v. Hughes, 273 N.C. 481, 485 (1968).  A necessary party is any person or \nentity with a material interest in the subject matter of the controversy, and whose \ninterests will be directly affected by an adjudication thereof.  See Equitable Life \nAssurance Soc’y of the U.S. v. Basnight , 234 N.C. 347, 352 (1951).   Dismissal for \nfailure to join a necessary party is proper only if the defect cannot be cured, and any \nsuch dismissal must be without prejudice.  See Lambert v. Town of Sylva, 259 N.C. \nApp. 294, 307 (2018). \n \n119 The ACC also argues that the FSU Board made a general appearance in this matter when \nit opposed the ACC’s 17 January 2024 Amended Motion to Seal and therefore waived its \nsovereign immunity because it did not specifically reserve its right to challenge personal \njurisdiction in its sealing opposition.  (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 14; see generally Def.’s Br. \nOpp’n Pl.’s Am. Mot. Seal, ECF No. 15.)  In the parties’ joint Stipulation of Service, however, \nthe first filing the FSU Board made in this action, the FSU Board represented that “it does \nnot waive and preserves all jurisdictional defenses it may have.”  (Stipulation Service, ECF \nNo. 8.)  Our Court of Appeals has held that “ [w]hen a defendant promptly alleges a \njurisdictional defense as his initial step in an action, he fulfills his obligation to inform the \ncourt and his opponent of possible jurisdictional defects.”  Ryals v. Hall -Lane Moving & \nStorage Co. , 122 N.C. App. 242, 247– 48 (1996) (emphasis added) .  The Court therefore \nconcludes that, under Ryals, the ACC’s argument is without merit. \n \nB. Analysis \n71. The FSU Board argues in conclusory fashion that the ACC’s declaratory \njudgment claims in the FAC should be dismissed because “the ACC did not name the \nactual party to the Grants of Rights—FSU.”120 \n72. This argument is a non-starter.  Although the signature blocks for both the \nGrant of Rights and Amended Grant of Rights list “FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY” \nas the “Member Institution” and bear the signature of the individual  serving as \nPresident of FSU at the time of execution,121 the FSU Board concedes that it, rather \nthan the university, is “the contracting agent of the university[  ]” and has “all the \npowers of a body corporate, including the power to  . . . contract and be contracted \nwith, to sue and be sued, [and] to plead and be impleaded in all courts of law or \nequity[.]”  Fla. Stat. Ann. §§  1001.72(1), (3).\n122  Consequently, Florida courts have \nheld that “it is improper to sue ‘Florida State University’ since the Florida Legislature \nhas designated university boards of trustees as the proper entities with the power to \nsue and be sued.”  Broer v. Fla. State Univ., No. 2021 CA 000859, 2022 WL 2289143, \nat *2 (Fla. Circ. Ct. June 17, 2022) (dismissing defendant “Florida State U niversity” \nwith prejudice); see Doe v. New Coll. of Fla. , No. 8:21-cv-1245-CEH-CPT, 2023 U.S. \n \n120 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16.) \n \n121 (See Grant of Rights 9; Am. Grant of Rights 7.)  Citations to the page numbers in these \nexhibits refer to the electronic PDF page numbers as the signature pages do not contain page \nnumbers. \n \n122 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 15.) \n \nDist. LEXIS 173689, at *21 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 28, 2023)  (dismissing defendant “New \nCollege of Florida” as an improperly named defendant). \n73. Indeed, FSU has acknowledged in litigation that “Florida State University \nis not endowed with an independent corporate existence and so lacks the capacity to \nsue or be sued in its own name[ .]”123  Given that the FSU Board acknowledges that \n“Florida State University” has no independent corporate existence and that the \nFlorida courts have held that the FSU Board is the proper party to answer claims \nagainst “Florida State U niversity,” the Court will deny the FSU Board’s Motion  to \nDismiss the ACC’s first and second claims for failure to join “Florida State University” \nas a necessary party pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7). \nIV. \nMOTION TO DISMISS PURSUANT TO RULE 12(b)(6)  \nA. Legal Standard \n74. When deciding whether to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule \n12(b)(6), the Court considers “whether the allegations of the complaint, if treated as \ntrue, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under some legal \ntheory.”  Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco, PLC , 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoting \nCommScope Credit Union v. Butler & Burke, LLP , 369 N.C. 48, 51 (2016)).   “[T]he \ntrial court is to construe the pleading liberally and in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff, taking as true and admitted all well -pleaded factual allegations contained \n \n123 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. Ex. 4 Pompura v. Fla. State Univ., No. 20 CA 1080, Florida State \nUniversity’s Limited Appearance to Quash Attempted Service and Dismiss ¶ 4 (Fla. Cir. Ct. \nJuly 22, 2020), ECF No. 31.4.) \nwithin the complaint.”  Donovan , 114 N.C. App. at  526 (cleaned up); see also, e.g. , \nSykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, 332 (2019) (recognizing that, under \nRule 12(b)(6), the allegations of the complaint should be “view[ed] as true and in the \nlight most favorable to the non-moving party” (cleaned up)). \n75. When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may \n“also consider any exhibits attached to the complaint because ‘[a] copy of any written \ninstrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.’ ”  \nKrawiec v. Manly, 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 10(c)).  Moreover, \nthe Court “can reject allegations that are contradicted by the documents attached [to], \nspecifically referred to, or incorporated by reference in the complaint.”  Moch v. A.M. \nPappas & Assocs., LLC, 251 N.C. App. 198, 206 (2016) (quoting Laster v. Francis, 199 \nN.C. App. 572, 577 (2009)). \n76. “[D]ismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when ‘(1) the complaint on \nits face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face \nreveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint \ndiscloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.’ ”  Corwin, 371 N.C. \nat 615 (quoting Wood v. Guilford Cnty., 355 N.C. 161, 166 (2002)). \nB. Analysis \n1. Breach of Grant of Rights and Amended Grant of Rights \n77. The ACC alleges that, by initiating the Flor ida Action, the FSU Board has \nbreached its obligation under the Grant of Rights Agreements not to take any actions \nthat affect the validity, enforcement, irrevocability, and/or exclusivity of those \nagreements, as well as the FSU Board’s obligation of good faith and fair dealing that \nis attendant to all contracts.124  In response, the FSU Board does not challenge that \nit breached the a greements (assuming those a greements are valid ) but instead \ncontends that , despite having received hundreds of millions of dol lars under the \nGrant of Rights Agreements, it never entered into those agreements in the first place.  \nThe FSU Board argues that because it is the only entity that has statutory authority \nto enter into contracts on behalf of FSU, the ACC’s failure to allege that “the FSU \nBoard approved either Grant of Rights at any FSU Board meeting, including after \nappropriate notice,” warrants dismissal of the ACC’s contract claim.125 \n78. “The elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) [the] existence of a \nvalid contract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”   Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. \nApp. 19, 26 (2000).   As our Court of Appeals has noted, “[o]ur system of notice \npleading means the bar to plead a valid contract is low.”  Lannan v. Bd. of Governors \nof Univ. of N.C., 285 N.C. App. 574, 596 (2022) (citation omitted).  Consequently, the \nACC need only plead “offer, acceptance, [and] consideration[  ]” to establish the \nexistence of a valid contract.  Id.   \n79. The ACC adequately alleges each element of its breach of contract claim in \nthe FAC.  The ACC alleges that, “in order to secure a long -term media rights \nagreement and thus ensure the payment of predictable sums over time,” the Member \n \n124 (FAC ¶¶ 209–11.) \n \n125 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 15–16.) \n \nInstitutions entered into the Grant of Rights in April 2013.126  As pleaded in the FAC, \n“each Member Institution granted the Conference its Media Rights and, in \nexchange, . . . the Conference negotiated revisions to the 2010 Multi -Media \nAgreement, to increase the [amounts] paid[  ]” and subsequently “distributed the \nfunds to the Member Institutions.”127 \n80. With respect to the Grant of Rights, the ACC alleges that (i) the FSU Board \n“agreed to and executed the Grant of Rights on April 19, 2013[  ]”;128 (ii) FSU’s \nPresident “was authorized to agree to and exec ute the Grant of Rights on April 19, \n2013 on behalf of [the FSU Board]”;129 and (iii) FSU received its pro rata share of the \nfees paid by ESPN to the ACC pursuant to the Second Amendment to the 2010 Multi-\nMedia Agreement and the Grant of Rights. 130  The ACC then alleges that, by filing \nsuit in Florida, the FSU Board breached various obligations under the Grant of \nRights.131 \n \n126 (FAC ¶¶ 56–57, 69.) \n \n127 (FAC ¶ 58.) \n \n128 (FAC ¶  66; see also  Grant of Rights ¶  6 (“ [E]ach Member Institution represents and \nwarrants to the Conference (a) that such Member Institution  . . . has the right, power and \ncapacity to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to discharge the duties set forth \nherein[.]”).) \n \n129 (FAC ¶  67; see also  Grant of Rights ¶  6 (“[E]ach Member Institution represents and \nwarrants to the Conference  . . . (b) that execution, delivery and performance of this \nAgreement and the discharge of all duties contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly \nauthorized by all necessary action on the part of such Member Institution [.]” (emphasis \nadded)); ACC Const. § 1.5.1.1 (“[E]ach Director shall have the right to take any action or any \nvote on behalf of the Member it represents[.]”).) \n \n130 (FAC ¶¶ 68, 71, 73, 111.) \n \n131 (See FAC ¶¶ 205–11.) \n81. With respect to the Amended Grant of Rights, the ACC alleges that the \nMember Institutions agreed to extend the term in the original Grant of Rights in \nexchange for receiving increased fees under the ESPN Agreements. 132  T he ACC \nalleges that (i) the FSU Board “accepted and executed the Amended Grant of \nRights[ ]”;\n133 (ii) FSU’s President “was authorized to enter into and accept the \nAmended Grant of Rights on behalf of [the FSU Board]”; 134 and (iii) FSU received a \nportion of the fees paid by ESPN to the ACC under the ESPN Agreements and the \nAmended Grant of Rights. 135  The ACC then alleges that the FSU Board breached \nvarious obligations under the A mended Grant of Rights by initiating the Florida \nAction.136 \n82. The ACC also contends that it has adequately pleaded waiver and equitable \nestoppel to preclude the FSU Board from denying that it is legally bound by the Grant \nof Rights Agreements.137  The affirmative defenses of waiver and equitable estoppel \n“concern whether a valid and enforceable agreement may be the subject of a legal \naction based on conduct that occurs after the parties enter into a contract[.]”  Window \n \n132 (See FAC ¶¶ 84, 87–90, 109.) \n \n133 (FAC ¶ 99.) \n \n134 (FAC ¶ 100.) \n \n135 (FAC ¶¶ 110–11; see also Amended Grant of Rights ¶  3 (“Except as specifically modified \nby this Amendment, the terms of the [Grant of Rights] will remain in full force and effect.”).) \n \n136 (See FAC ¶¶ 205–11.) \n \n137 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 16.) \n \nWorld of N. Atlanta, Inc. v. Window World, Inc., 2021 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *18 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Sept. 22, 2021). \n83. “The essential elements of waiver are (1) the existence, at the time of the \nalleged waiver, of a right, advantage, or benefit; (2) the knowledge, actual or \nconstructive, of the existence thereof; and (3) an intention to relinquish such right, \nadvantage or benefit.”  Fetner v. Rocky Mount Marble & Granite Works, 251 N.C. 296, \n302 (1959).  The doctrine of equitable estoppel “arises when an individual, by his acts, \nrepresentations, admissions, or by his silence when he has a duty to speak, \nintentionally or through culpable negligence induces another to believe that certain \nfacts exist, and such other person rightfully relies and acts upon that belief to his \ndetriment.”  Thompson v. Soles, 299 N.C. 484, 487 (1980).  Under this doctrine, “ the \nparty whose words or conduct induced another’s detrimental reliance may be \nestopped to deny the truth of his earlier representations in the interests of fairness \nto the other party.”  Whitacre P’ship v. Biosignia, Inc., 358 N.C. 1, 17 (2004). \n84. The ACC alleges in the FAC that the “purpose of the Grant of Rights and \nAmended Grant of Rights was to permit the ACC to negotiate various agreements \nwith ESPN and provide ESPN the Media Rights for its Memb er Institutions, \nincluding [FSU], in exchange for  . . . [f]ees[.]”\n138  The ACC further alleges that the \nFSU Board “knowingly and voluntarily agreed . . . to transfer ownership of its Media \nRights to the ACC through June 30, 2036[  ]”139 “for the purpose of re ceiving the \n \n138 (FAC ¶ 186.) \n \n139 (FAC ¶ 197.) \n \nbenefits generated by these contracts[,]”140 “regardless of whether [FSU] remained a \nMember Institution of the Conference.”141  The allegations in the FAC also state that, \nsince 2013, the FSU Board “substantially and materially benefitted from the Grant \nof Rights and Amended Grant of Rights[  ]”142 by receiving its share of the \n“distributions from [the] revenue generated by the Grant of Rights and Amended \nGrant of Rights[.]” 143  Based on these allegations, the ACC argues that, even if the \nFSU Board “did not vote on these agreements despite accepting their benefits[,]” 144 \nthe FSU Board is “estopped from challenging the validity or enforceability of the \nGrant of Rights or Amended Grant of Rights, or has waived its right to contest [their] \nvalidity or enforceability . . . as a result of its conduct[.]”145 \n85. At this stage, the Court concludes that the ACC has sufficiently pleaded that \nthe FSU Board approved the execution of both the Grant of Rights and Amended \nGrant of Rights.  The Court furt her concludes that the ACC has also sufficiently \npleaded that, regardless of whether the FSU Board approved the Grant of Rights \nAgreements, the FSU Board should be estopped  from challenging or has waived its \nright to challenge these agreements by its conduct in accepting the benefits of these \n \n140 (FAC ¶ 200.) \n \n141 (FAC ¶ 197.) \n \n142 (FAC ¶ 191.) \n \n143 (FAC ¶ 187.) \n \n144 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 16.) \n \n145 (FAC ¶ 203.) \n \nagreements for many years without protest .  Accordingly, the Court will deny the \nFSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss the ACC’s claim for breach of the Grant of Rights and \nAmended Grant of Rights. \n2. Declaratory Judgment Claims \n \n86. The ACC seeks a judicial declaration that (i) the Grant of Rights Agreements \nare valid and enforceable contracts; and (ii) the FSU Board is estopped from making \nor has waived by its conduct any challenge to the Grant of Rights Agreements.\n146  The \nFSU Board seeks dismissal of these claims on the same basis that it seeks dismissal \nof the ACC’s breach of contract claim. 147  Because the Court has concluded that the \nACC’s claim for breach of the Grant of Rights Agreements should survive the FSU \nBoard’s Motion  to Dismiss, the Court will likewise permit the ACC’s declaratory \njudgment claims based on those agreements to proceed. \n3. Breach of Obligation to Protect Confidential Information \n87. The FSU Board next seeks to dismiss the ACC’s claim that the FSU Board \nbreached its obligation to keep confidential the terms of the ESPN Agreements by \ndisclosing some of those terms at its 22 December 2023 meeting and by publicly filing \nthe complaint containing some of those terms in the Florida Action. 148  The FSU \nBoard argues that “neither FSU nor the FSU Board was ever a party to [the ESPN \n \n146 (FAC ¶¶ 173–203.) \n \n147 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 15–16.) \n \n148 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16–18.) \n \nAgreements] or entered into any  confidentiality agreement with the ACC,” 149 and, \nfurthermore, that the FSU Board does not owe “any duties to the ACC beyond those \nreflected in the ACC’s Constitution and [Bylaws].”150 \n88. “[A]n implied-in-fact contract ‘is valid and enforceable as if it were ex press \nor written.’ ”  Lannan , 285 N.C. App. at 596 (quoting Snyder v. Freeman , 300 N.C. \n204, 217 (1980)).  “A valid contract may be implied in light of the conduct of the parties \nand under circumstances that make it reasonable to presume the parties intended to \ncontract with each other.”  Se. Caissons, LLC v. Choate Con str. Co., 247 N.C. App. \n104, 113 (2016) (citation omitted).  Thus, the ACC need only “plead offer, acceptance, \nand consideration[ ]” to plead a valid implied-in-fact contract.  Lannan, 285 N.C. App. \nat 597. \n89. The ACC alleges that, on behalf of its Member Institutions, it entered into \nthe ESPN Agreements with ESPN on 21 July 2016. 151  The ESPN Agreements \ncontain the following terms: \nEach party shall maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and its \nterms, and any other Confidential Information, except when disclosure \nis[ ] . . . to each [Member] Institution, provided that each [Member] \nInstitution shall agree to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, \nsubject to the law applicable to each such [Member] Institution[.]152 \n \n \n149 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16–17.) \n \n150 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 18; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 11.) \n \n151 (See FAC ¶ 78.) \n \n152 (2016 Multi -Media Agreement Confidentiality Provision ¶  21.11; ACC Network \nAgreement Confidentiality Provision  ¶ 18.11; see also FAC ¶¶ 106–08, 214–18 (discussing \nthese terms).) \n \nThe ACC alleges that “[i]n an effort to preserve the confidentiality of the ESPN \nAgreements, the Conference limits access to the [a]greements[  ]”153 by only \n“permit[ting] its Members to inspect and review the ESPN Agreements on request at \nits Headquarters” and “only on agreement that the Member would not copy or \nreproduce the provisions of the ESPN Agreements and would treat the information \nas confidential.”154 \n90. The ACC alleges that counsel for the FSU Board reviewed the ESPN \nAgreements at the ACC’s headquarters on 7 October 2022, 4 January 2023, and 1 and \n2 August 2023.\n155  The ACC further alleges that, on each occasion,  “before being \nprovided access, and as a condition for such access, [the FSU Board] was advised that \nthe information in the ESPN Agreements was confidential.”\n156  The ACC then avers \nthat, after being advised of this confidentiality obligation, FSU’s counsel reviewed the \nESPN Agreements.157  The ACC finally alleges that, despite FSU’s counsel reviewing \nthe ESPN Agreements after receiving these warnings, the FSU Board publicly \ndisclosed confidential information from the ESPN Agreements at its 22 December \n2023 meeting and in the publicly filed complaint in the Florida Action.\n158 \n \n153 (FAC ¶ 220.) \n \n154 (FAC ¶ 221.) \n \n155 (See FAC ¶¶ 138, 222.) \n \n156 (FAC ¶ 139; see also FAC ¶¶ 140, 161, 223; FAC Ex. 12, ECF Nos. 11 (sealed), 12.12 (public \nredacted) (reproducing an e-mail from the ACC’s general counsel informing counsel for the \nFSU Board that the terms of the ESPN Agreements must be kept confidential).) \n \n157 (See FAC ¶¶ 139, 162, 224.) \n \n158 (See FAC ¶¶ 163–72, 225–29.) \n91. Although the FSU Board focuses on the ACC’s failure to allege that FSU \nsigned a written agreement with the ACC or ESPN to maintain the confidentiality of \nthe ESPN Agreements,159 the ACC has alleged that it expressly advised counsel for \nthe FSU Board that counsel could review the ESPN Agreements at the ACC’s \nheadquarters only if FSU maintain ed the confidentiality of those agreements .  As \nsuch, the ACC has alleged that it made a legally binding, conditional offer to the FSU \nBoard, see, e.g., Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond v. Neuse Mfg. Co., 213 N.C. 489, 493 \n(1938) (“In negotiating a contract the parties may impose any condition precedent, a \nperformance of which condition is essential before the parties become bound by the \nagreement.”), which the FSU Board accepted by its c ounsel’s reviewing the \nagreements, Snyder, 300 N.C. at 218 (“Acceptance by conduct is a valid acceptance.”).   \n92. Thus, although the FSU Board was not a party to the ESPN Agreements, \nthe Court concludes that the ACC has sufficiently pleaded at least an implied-in-fact \ncontract between the ACC and the FSU Board to maintain the confidentiality of the \nterms of the ESPN Agreements as well as the FSU Board’s breach.  Id. (“With regard \nto a contract implied in fact, one looks not to some express agreement, but to the \nactions of the parties showing an implied offer and acceptance.”). \n93. The Court therefore will deny the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss the ACC’s \nfourth cause of action for breach of contract concerning confidentiality. \n \n159 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16–17.) \n4. Breach of Fiduciary Duties Owed by the FSU Board to the ACC \n94. The FSU Board next seeks to dismiss the ACC’s claim that FSU has \nbreached, and continues to breach, its fiduciary obligations to the Conference under \nthe ACC’s Constitution and Bylaws as well as under North Carolina law.160  The FSU \nBoard first argues that the ACC is a creature of statute governed by the UUNAA, \nN.C.G.S. §§  59B-1 to -1 5, which imposes no fiduciary duties on members of \nunincorporated nonprofit associations.161  The FSU Board additionally contends that \nneither the ACC ’s Constitution or  Bylaws impose fiduciary duties on the Member \nInstitutions.162 \n95. The ACC argues in opposition that, by joining the Conference as a Member \nInstitution, FSU entered into a “common and joint venture with the other Member \nInstitutions,”163 and thereby has a fiduciary duty to “act in good faith, with due care, \nand in a manner in the best interests of t he Conference” 164 under the ACC ’s \nConstitution and Bylaws “as well as [under] principles of statutory and common law \nin North Carolina[.]” 165  The ACC further contends that, “[b]y seeking retroactive \n \n160 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16–18; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 10–11.) \n \n161 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 17.) \n \n162 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 17; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 10.) \n \n163 (FAC ¶ 240.) \n \n164 (FAC ¶ 241.) \n \n165 (FAC ¶¶ 246–48; see Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 19–20.) \n \nwithdrawal [from the ACC] in the Florida Action, [FSU] has  a clear, direct, and \nmaterial conflict of interest with the management of the Conference.”166 \n96. To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must plead that “(1) \ndefendant[ ] owed the plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) the defendant breached that \nfiduciary duty; and (3) the breach of fiduciary duty was a proximate cause of injury \nto the plaintiff.”  Chisum v. Campagna, 376 N.C. 680, 706 (2021).  “For a breach of \nfiduciary duty to exist, there must first be a fiduciary relationship between the \nparties.”  King v. Bryant, 369 N.C. 451, 464 (2017) (quoting Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. \n647, 651 (2001)).  “[A] fiduciary relationship is generally described as arising when \n‘there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience \nis bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the  one reposing \nconfidence.’ ”  Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A., 367 N.C. 363, 367 (2014) (quoting Green \nv. Freeman , 367 N.C. 136, 141 (2013)).  “North Carolina recognizes two types of \nfiduciary relationships: de jure, or those imposed by operation of law, and de facto, or \nthose arising from the particular facts and circumstances constituting and \nsurrounding the relationship.”  Hager v. Smithfield E. Health Holdings, LLC , 264 \nN.C. App. 350, 355 (2019). \n97. Under North Carolina law, “ [a] joint venture exists when there is: ‘ (1) an \nagreement, express or implied, to carry out a single business venture with  joint \nsharing of profits, and (2) an equal  right of control of the means employed to carry \nout the venture.’ ”  Sykes, 372 N.C. at 340–41 (quoting Rifenburg Constr., Inc. v. Brier \n \n166 (FAC ¶ 263; see Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 20.) \n \nCreek Assocs. Ltd. P’ship, 160 N.C. App. 626, 632 (2003), aff’d per curiam , 358 N.C. \n218 (2004)).  “[E]ach party to the joint venture [has] a right in some measure to direct \nthe conduct of the other ‘ through a necessary fiduciary relationshi p.’ ”  Se. Shelter \nCorp. v. BTU, Inc., 154 N.C. App. 321, 327 (2002) (quoting Cheape v. Town of Chapel \nHill, 320 N.C. 549, 562 (1987)). \n98. Prior to North Carolina’s adoption of the UUNAA in 2006, the legal status \nof unincorporated associations at common law was uncertain.  See, e.g., Venus Lodge \nNo. 62, F. & A. M. v. Acme Benevolent Ass’n , 231 N.C. 522, 526 (1950) (“At common \nlaw . . . an [unincorporated] association is not an entity, and has no existence \nindependent of its members.  This being true, an unincorporated association has no \ncapacity at common law to contract; or to take, hold, or transfer property; or to sue or \nbe sued.” (cleaned up)); Goard v. Branscom, 15 N.C. App. 34, 38 (1972) (“The general \nrule deducible from the cases which have passed on the question is that the members \nof an unincorporated association are engaged in a joint enterprise[.]” (quoting 6 Am. \nJur. 2d, Association s and Clubs, §  31)).  In light of this ambiguity , the legislature \nadopted a modified version of the UUNAA for the “limited purpose of treating a group \nthat acts together in nonprofit matters as a  . . . legal entity” that is “separate and \napart from its mem bers for purposes of owning property and determining and \nenforcing third-party rights, duties and procedures.”  Robinson on N.C. Corp. Law \n§ 35.03[1]; see N.C.G.S. § 59B-2 off. cmt. ¶¶ 1, 3; id. § 59B-5 off. cmt. ¶¶ 1–2.   \n99. Unlike North Carolina’s statutes governing corporations, N.C.G.S. §§ 55-8-\n30, 31, nonprofit corporations, id.  §§ 55A-8-30, 31, limited liability companies, id.  \n§§ 57D-2-21, 30, and partnerships, id.  §§ 59-51, however, the UUNAA does not \ncontain provisions imposing fiduciary duties on memb ers of an unincorporated \nnonprofit association.  Because the General Assembly has repeatedly shown that it \nknows how to impose fiduciary duties on various corporate actors by statute in similar \ncontexts, the legislature should be presumed to have purposely  chosen to exclude \nimposing fiduciary duties on members of an unincorporated nonprofit association \nunder the UUNAA.  See, e.g., N.C. Dep’t of Revenue v. Hudson, 196 N.C. App. 765, \n768 (2009) (“When a legislative body includes particular language in one section of a \nstatute but omits it in another section of the same [statute], it is generally presumed \nthat the legislative body acts intentionally and purposely in  the disparate inclusion \nor exclusion.” (cleaned up)); see also  In re D.L.H., 364 N.C. 214, 221 (2010) \n(recognizing that “the absence of a similar provision in [a related statute] seems to \nindicate a legislative intent not to [reach the same result as unde r the related \nstatute]”); State v. Campbell, 285 N.C. App. 480, 491 (2022) (applying similar \nreasoning when comparing two similar statutes). \n100. Moreover, the Official Comment to the UUNAA explains that, “[b]ecause a \nnonprofit association is made a separate legal entity, its members are not co -\nprincipals.”  N.C.G.S. § 59B-7 off. cmt. ¶ 3 (emphasis added); see also id. § 59B-7 off. \ncmt. ¶ 1 (“At common law a nonprofit association was not a legal entity separate from \nits members.  Borrowing from the law of partnership, the common law viewed a \nnonprofit association as an aggregate of its members.  The members are co-principals.  \nSubsection (a) changes that.” (emphasis added)).  A joint venture, however, “requires \nthat the parties to the agreement stand in the relation of principal, as well as agent, \nas to one another.”  Se. Shelter Corp., 154 N.C. App. at 327.  As the FSU Board notes, \nthe ACC has not alleged that “the FSU Board (or any other individual [M]ember) on \nits own can bind the ACC or other members through its conduct.”\n167  Because “[o]ur \nSupreme Court has . . . held that a joint venture does not exist  where each party to \nan agreement cannot direct the conduct of the other[,]” Rifenburg Constr., Inc. , 160 \nN.C. App. at 632 (citing Pike v. Wachovia Bank & Tr. Co., 274 N.C. 1, 10 (1968)), an \nunincorporated nonprofit association does not qualify as a joint venture and, thus, \nthe ACC cannot establish that a de jure fiduciary relationship existed between itself \nand FSU.168 \n101. In the absence of a de jure fiduciary relationship, the Court must determine \nwhether the allegations in the FAC are sufficient to demonstrate that the relationship \nbetween the parties is one in which “there has been a special confidence reposed in \none who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due \nregard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.”  Dallaire, 367 N.C. at 367 \n(quoting Green, 367 N.C. at 141).  “The standard for finding a de facto  fiduciary \nrelationship is  a demanding one: ‘Only when one party figuratively holds all the \ncards—all the financial power or technical information, for example —have North \n \n167 (Reply Def.’s Mots. 11.) \n \n168 Although not yet adopted in North Carolina and thus not controlling, the Court notes that \nthe revised UUNAA expressly states that “[a] member does not have any fiduciary duty to \nan unincorporated nonpr ofit association or to another member solely by reason of being a \nmember.”  Rev. Unif. Unincorp. Nonprofit Ass’n Act § 17(a) (Nat’l Conf. Comm’rs on Unif. \nState Laws 2011).   \n \nCarolina courts found that the special circumstance of a fiduciary relationship has \narisen.’ ”  Lockerman v. S.  River Elec. Memb ership Corp., 250 N.C. App. 631, 636 \n(2016) (quoting S.N.R. Mgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC, 189 N.C. App. 601, \n613 (2008)).  The ACC has failed to plead such a de facto fiduciary relationship here.  \n102. Under the ACC’s Constitution, “all of the powers of the Conference shall be \nexercised by or under the authority of the Board, and all of the activities and affairs \nof the Conference shall be managed by or under the direction, and subject to the \noversight, of the Board[.]”169  The ACC Constitution further provides that “[t]he Board \nshall be composed of a representative of each Member (each a ‘ Director’)”170 and \n“[e]ach Director shall be entitled to one vote each.” 171  FSU is but one of fifteen ACC \nMember Institutions172 and has the power to cast just one of the votes necessary to \napprove any action taken by the ACC requiring Board approval.  Conversely, the ACC \ncannot take any action requiring Board approval without the approval of its Board of \nDirectors.  As neither party can be said to “hold all the cards,” a de facto  fiduciary \nrelationship between the ACC and the FSU Board does not exist on the pleaded facts. \n103. The FSU Board makes one additional, albeit brief, argument in opposition \nto the ACC’s breach of fiduciary duty claim, contending that “had the ACC [M]embers \n \n169 (ACC Const. § 1.5.1.1; see id. § 1.6 (Board voting requirements); FAC ¶ 243.) \n \n170 (ACC Const. §  1.5.1.2; see FAC ¶ 244 (“As a Member Institution, [FSU] designated its \nPresident as a Member of the [ACC] Board of Directors.”).) \n \n171 (ACC Const. § 1.6.2.) \n \n172 (FAC ¶ 1.) \n \nwished to subject themselves to the fiduciary duties the ACC seeks to impose, they \ncould have  . . . included them in the  . . . ACC Constitution and Bylaws[.]” 173  \nAlthough the UUNAA “contains no rules concerning governance[,]” N.C.G.S. § 59B-3 \noff. cmt. ¶ 2, “the [constitution] and bylaws of an association may constitute a contract \nbetween the organization and its members wherein the members are deemed to have \nconsented to all reasonable regulations and rules of the orga nization,”\n174 Master v. \nCountry Club of Landfall , 263 N.C. App. 181, 187 (2018) (quoting Gaston Bd. of \nRealtors, Inc., 311 N.C. at 237). \n104. The ACC argues that the “provisions of the ACC Constitution that address \nconflicts of interest of withdrawing [M]embers[ ]” support its assertion that Member \nInstitutions owe a fiduciary obligation “to the [Conference] not to defeat or destroy its \ncommon purpose.”175  The Court disagrees.  The provision on which the ACC relies \nallows the ACC Board, in its discretion , to with hold information from or to exclude \nfrom a meeting or vote an expelled or withdrawing Member if the Board determines \nthat a conflict of interest exists. 176  Whether such a conflict of interest exists is \ntherefore discretionary; whether fiduciary duties exist, however, is not.  The ACC \ndoes not point to any provision of the ACC’s Constitution or Bylaws that affirmatively \n \n173 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 17.) \n \n174 The parties do not dispute that the ACC’s Constitution and Bylaws are a contract between \nthe ACC and its Member Institutions.  (FAC ¶¶ 233, 267; see Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16; Br. \nOpp’n Def.’s Mots. 8, 18.) \n \n175 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 20; see FAC ¶¶ 257–64.) \n \n176 (See ACC Const. § 1.5.1.3.) \n \nimposes fiduciary duties on current Members, nor is the Court able to find one.  The \nACC’s breach of fiduciary duty claim therefore fails on this additional basis. \n105. Because the FAC alleges that the ACC is an unincorporated nonprofit \nassociation under the UUNAA,177 the ACC cannot establish the existence of a de jure \nfiduciary relationship with FSU under a joint venture theory.  Nor has the ACC \nalleged sufficient facts to establish either the existence of a de facto  fiduciary \nrelationship or a contractual imposition of fiduciary duties under the AC C’s \nConstitution and Bylaws.  Thus, dismissal of this claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is \nproper both because “the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the \nplaintiff’s claim [ ]” and “ the complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts \nsufficient to make a good claim[.]”  Corwin, 371 N.C. at 615 (citation omitted). \n106. The Court will therefore grant the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss the ACC’s \nfifth claim for relief for breach of fiduciary duty and dismiss this claim with prejudice. \n5. Breach of Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Under the ACC’s \nConstitution and Bylaws \n \n107. Finally, the FSU Board seeks to dismiss the ACC’s claim for breach of the \nimplied duty of good faith and fair dealing under the ACC’s Constitution and \nBylaws.\n178  The FSU Board argues in conclusory fashion that “there is no basis in \nNorth Carolina law for the ACC’s allegation that the FSU Board (or any other ACC \n \n177 (FAC ¶¶ 1–2, 6, 9, 17, 22–23, 233, 236.) \n \n178 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16–18; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 10–11.) \n \n[M]ember) owes any duties to the ACC beyond those reflected in the ACC’s \nConstitution and [Bylaws].”179  The Court disagrees. \n108. North Carolina law has long recognized that a covenant of good faith and \nfair dealing is implied in every contract and requires the contracting parties not to \n“do anything which injures the rights of the other to receive the benefits of the \nagreement.”  Bicycle  Transit Auth. v. Bell, 314 N.C. 219, 228 (1985) (citation \nomitted).180   \n109. As discussed above, to sustain a claim for breach of contract, the ACC need \nonly plead “(1) [the] existence of a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms of that \ncontract[,]” Poor, 138 N.C. App. at 26, to satisfy its burden under Rule 12(b)(6).  The \nACC alleges, and the FSU Board concedes, that the “ACC Constitution and Bylaws \n[are] . . . valid and enforceable contract[s] between the Conference and its \nMembers[,]” including FSU.181  The Conference further alleges that the FSU Board’s \n“actions as detailed in this Amended Complaint violate its duty to act in good faith \nand fairly deal with the Conference.” 182  Under our notice pleading standard, these \n \n179 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 18; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 11.) \n \n180 The revised UUNAA expressly adopts this concept, providing that “[a] member shall \ndischarge the duties to the unincorporated nonprofit association and the other members and \nexercise any rights under this [act] consistent with the governing principles and contractual \nobligation of good faith and fair dealing.”  Rev. Unif. Unincorp. Nonprofit Ass’n Act § 17(b) \n(second alteration in original). \n \n181 (FAC ¶ 267; see FAC ¶ 233; Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 16; Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 8, 18.) \n \n182 (FAC ¶ 271.)   \n \nallegations are sufficient to state a claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair \ndealing under the ACC’s Constitution and Bylaws. \n110. The Court will therefore deny the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss the ACC’s \nclaim against FSU for breach o f its obligation of good faith and fair dealing under \nthese governing documents. \nV. \nMOTION TO STAY \n111. The FSU Board moves in the alternative to stay this first-filed action under \nN.C.G.S. §  1-75.12 in favor of its second -filed Florida Action .183  The FSU Board \nargues that the Florida Action should take priority because it is “broader in scope,”184 \n“more comprehensive,”185 and in “the true proper forum for this case ,”186 and also \nbecause the ACC deserves no first-filing deference as a result of its improper forum \nshopping.187   \n112. The ACC argues in opposition that a North Carolina court, not a Florida \ncourt, should determine the claims of a North Carolina organization concerning the \nvalidity and breach of contracts governed by North Carolina law and further that the \n \n183 (See Def.’s Mots. ¶ 3.) \n \n184 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 26.) \n \n185 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 1.) \n \n186 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 18.) \n \n187 (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 21–25; Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 11–13.) \n \nFSU Board has failed to offer any evidence that FSU would suffer “substantial \ninjustice” should this litigation proceed in North Carolina.188 \n113. Section 1-75.12 provides, in relevant part, as follows:  \n(a) When Stay May Be Granted. – If, in any action pending in any \ncourt of this State, the judge shall find that it would work substantial \ninjustice for the action to be tried in a court of this State, the judge on \nmotion of any party may enter an order to stay f urther proceedings in \nthe action in this State.  A moving party under this subsection must \nstipulate his consent to suit in another jurisdiction found by the judge \nto provide a convenient, reasonable and fair place of trial. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 1-75.12(a).  “The essential question for the trial court is whether allowing \nthe matter to continue in North Carolina would work a ‘ substantial injustice’ on the \nmoving party.”  Muter v. Muter, 203 N.C. App. 129, 131–32 (2010). \n114. Our appellate courts have held that  \n[i]n determining whether to grant a stay under [N.C.]G.S. § 1-75.12, the \ntrial court may consider the following factors: (1) the nature of the case, \n(2) the convenience of the witnesses, (3) the availability of compulsory \nprocess to produce witnesses, (4) the relative ease of access to sources of \nproof, (5) the applicable law, (6) the burden of litigating matters not of \nlocal concern, (7) the desirability of litigating matters of local concern in \nlocal courts, (8) convenience  and access to another forum, (9) choice of \nforum by plaintiff, and (10) all other practical considerations. \n \nLaws. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. of N.C. v. Nexsen Pruet Jacobs & Pollard, 112 N.C. App. \n353, 356 (1993).   \n115. “[I]t is not necessary that the trial court find that all  factors positively \nsupport a stay, as long as it is able to conclude that (1) a substantial injustice would \nresult if the trial court denied the stay, (2) the stay is warranted by those factors \npresent, and (3) the alternative forum is convenient, reasonable, and fair.”  Id. at 357.  \n \n188 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 21–27.) \nAnd while “t he trial court need not consider every factor,” Muter, 203 N.C. App. at \n132, the court will abuse its discretion when it “abandons any consideration of these \nfactors[,]” Laws. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., 112 N.C. App. at 357.   \n116. After careful consideration and review, the Court concludes, in the exercise \nof its discretion and based on an evaluation of each of the factors set forth in Lawyers \nMutual, that “allowing th[is] matter to continue in North Carolina would [not] work \na ‘substantial injustice’ on [ the FSU Board],” Muter, 203 N.C. App. at  131–32, and \ntherefore that the FSU Board’s Motion to Stay should be denied. \n117. Much of the parties’ focus in their briefing and at the Hearing is on Lawyers \nMutual’s ninth factor—whether the ACC’s choice of its North Carolina home forum \nis entitled to deference.  North Carolina “[c]ourts generally give great deference to a \nplaintiff’s choice of forum, and a defendant must satisfy a heavy burden to alter that \nchoice by . . . staying the case.”  Wachovia Bank v. Deutsche Bank Tr. Co. Ams., 2006 \nNCBC LEXIS 10, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 2, 2006).  This is particularly true \nwhen the plaintiff chooses to file suit in its home forum.  See, e.g., La Mack v. Obeid, \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *16–17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 5, 2015) (“[A] plaintiffs’ choice \nof forum ordinarily is given great  deference, especially when plaintiffs select their \nhome forum to bring suit.”).   \n118. This Court  has recognized , however,  that “[t]he amount of deference \ndue . . . varies with the circumstances,” Cardiorentis AG v. IQVIA Ltd., 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 243, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 31, 2018), aff’d, 373 N.C. 309, 314 (2020), and \nthat “when plaintiffs file a complaint merely as a strategic maneuver to choose a \nfavorable forum, ‘first -filed’ priority may be denied.”  La Mack, 2015 NCBC LEXIS \n24, at *17.  As our Court of Appeals has explained: \n[I]n situations in which two suits involving overlapping issues are \npending in separate jurisdictions, priority should not necessarily be \ngiven to a declaratory suit simply because it was filed earlier.  Rather, \nif the plaintiff in the declaratory suit was on notice at the time of filing \nthat the defendant was planning to file suit, a court should look beyond \nthe filing dates to determine whether the declaratory suit is merely a \nstrategic maneuver to achieve a preferable forum. \n  \nCoca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol. v. Durham Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 141 N.C. App. 569, \n579 (2000).  \n119. The FSU Board argues that the ACC’s choice of forum is not entitled to \ndeference because the ACC engaged in improper “procedural fencing” 189 by pre-\nemptively filing this action against the FSU Board, the “true” or “natural” plaintiff, \nwithout required ACC Board approval, “to attain what it presumes to be a more \nfavorable forum[ ]” after learning that the FSU Board had scheduled an emergency \nboard meeting for the following day.190  The FSU Board cites to numerous cases that \nhave denied first -filer advantage when a natural defendant files a declaratory \njudgment action in what it perceives to be a more favorable forum when it is aware \nthat the natural plaintiff’s lawsuit is imminent.191   \n \n189 See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 141 N.C. App. at 579 (“[A] declaratory suit should not \nbe used as a device for ‘procedural fencing.’ ”). \n \n190 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 23–24; see Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 12.) \n \n191 See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 141 N.C. App. at  579 (“ A defendant in a pending \nlawsuit should not be permitted to bring a declaratory suit involving overlapping issues in a \ndifferent jurisdiction as a strategic means of obtaining a more preferable forum.  Otherwise, \nthe natural plaintiff in the underlying controversy would be deprived of its right to choose \nthe forum and time of suit.”); see also Poole, 209 N.C. App. at 143; Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Narron, 155 N.C. App. 362 (2002); Harris Teeter Supermarkets, Inc. v. Ace Am. Ins. Co. , \n120. The ACC contends in opposition that the FSU Board started any “race to the \ncourthouse” and that its “grievance is . . . that it lost.”192  The ACC argues that “since \nbefore August 2023 FSU intended to breach the Grant of Rights through litigation[ ]” \nand that “when the [FSU] Board convened a meeting on the last business day before \nthe Christmas Holiday for an ‘emergency’ matter, it did so to try to be the first to file \na lawsuit, a lawsuit which it had already publicly released, and which its counsel was \npoised to file immediately.”193  As such, the ACC argues that “once it became apparent \nthat FSU intended to breach its obligations by filing a lawsuit, the ACC had the right \nto sue to settle the validity of the Grant of Rights, and to do so in the state whose law \napplied and where the ACC is headquartered, North Carolina.”194 \n121. After careful review, t he Court concludes on the allegations and fact s of \nrecord here that the ACC’s choice of forum is entitled to deference as the party first \nto file.  To begin, it is clear , as the FSU Board argues and the ACC acknowledges,  \nthat the ACC filed its action on 21 December 2023 because it correctly anticipate d \nthat the FSU Board intended to file the Florida Action the following day soon after \n \n2023 NCBC LEXIS 125, at *52 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 10, 2023); La Mack, 2015 NCBC LEXIS \n24, at *18–20; Wachovia Bank, Nat’l Ass’n v. Harbinger Cap. Partners Master Fund I, Ltd. , \n2008 NCBC LEXIS 6 , at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Ma r. 13, 2008), aff’d  201 N.C. 507 (2009); N. \nAm. Roofing Servs., Inc. v. BPP Retail Props., LLC, No. 1:13-cv-000119-MR-DLH, 2014 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 35193, at *9–10 (W.D.N.C. 2014) ; Klingspor Abrasives, Inc. v. Woolsey , No. \n5:08CV-152, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66747, at *11 (W.D.N.C. July 31, 2009);  Nutrition & \nFitness, Inc. v. Blue Stuff, Inc., 264 F. Supp. 2d 357, 361 (W.D.N.C. 2003). \n \n192 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 21–22.) \n \n193 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 21–22.) \n \n194 (Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 24.) \n \nthe FSU Board was scheduled to vote to approve the filing of the Florida Action.  The \nFSU Board argues that the ACC’s litigation conduct is paradigmatic “procedural \nfencing” that should cause the Court to reject any first-filer advantage for the ACC.195  \nSee, e.g., Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 141 N.C. App. at 579 (finding “procedural \nfencing” when a “potential defendant [which] anticipates litigation by the natural \nplaintiff in a controversy” is the first to file); Poole, 209 N.C. App. at 141–42 (applying \nCoca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol.  to dismiss claim where “natural defendant” denied \n“natural plaintiff” its forum of choice). \n122. But the FSU Board’s argument hing es on its erroneous view that it is  the \nonly “natural” plaintiff in this dispute.  The “natural” or “real” plaintiff in a civil suit \nis the party that has allegedly suffered damages at the hands of its opponent.  Coca-\nCola Bottling Co. Consol., 141 N.C. Ap p. at 579–80.  Here, that is the ACC, which \nalleges that the FSU Board intended to breach the covenants not to sue in the Grant \nof Rights Agreements.196  The parties did not simply race to the courthouse to resolve \ntheir dispute over the agreements’ terms; to the contrary, the ACC sued because the \nFSU Board’s alleged breach of those a greements was a practical certainty that \nthreatened the ACC with imminent and unavoidable injury  as a result.  See, e.g., \nRiver Birch Assocs., 326 N.C. at 129 (finding standing where an association member \nsuffers “immediate or threatened injury”).  In other words, it is the ACC, as the non-\nbreaching party, rather than the FSU Board, as the alleged breaching party, that is \n \n195 (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. 24.) \n \n196 (See FAC ¶¶ 134, 136, 142, 149, 181, 206, 209–11.) \nthe injured party in this dispute, see Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 141 N.C. App. \nat 579, and “the one who wishes to present a grievance for resolution by a court,” \nCree, Inc. v. Watchfire Signs, LLC, No. 1:20CV198, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 223801, at \n*15 (M.D.N.C. Dec. 1, 2020) (quoting Piedmont Hawthorne Aviation, Inc. v. TriTech \nEnv’t Health and Safety, Inc., 402 F. Supp. 2d 609, 616 (2005)).   \n123. As such, the Court concludes that the ACC is a  “natural” plaintiff in its \ndispute with the FSU Board.  Thus, even assuming the FSU Board is a “natural” \nplaintiff because it is the one challenging the enforceability of the Grant of Rights \nAgreements as the FSU Board contends , the fact that the ACC is also a “natural” \nplaintiff is sufficient for the ACC to ma intain its first -filer advantage.  See, e.g. , \nWachovia Bank, 2006 NCBC LEXIS 10, at *18 (recognizing the “heavy burden” a \ndefendant must satisfy “to alter [a plaintiff’s choice of forum]  by . . . staying the \ncase”).   \n124. The Court’s rejection of the FSU Board’s attack on the ACC’s choice of forum \nfinds further support from numerous courts within and without North Carolina that \nhave refused to stay a first-filed declaratory judgment action where, as here, both the \nfirst- and second-filed actions involve the same agreements and seek the same relief.  \nSee, e.g., IQVIA, Inc. v. Cir. Clinical Sols., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 105, *4–5 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Sept. 14, 2022) (staying second-filed action where both the first- and second-filed \nactions involved the same declaratory and injunctive relief); Baldelli v. Baldelli, 249 \nN.C. App. 603, 608 (2016) (remanding with instructions to hold second-filed action in \nabeyance and noting that when there is a “clear interrelationship of the issues,” \nallowing “both actions to proceed concurrently would be to invite conflict between the \nresolution of interrelated issues in the two actions[ ]”); see also, e.g., Sorena v. Gerald \nJ. Tobin, P.A., 47 So. 3d 875, 878– 89 (Fla. 3d Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (staying second-\nfiled action involving “substantially similar” parties and claims “stem[ming] from the \nsame set of facts”); Caspian Inv., Ltd. v. Vicom Holdings, Ltd., 770 F. Supp. 880, 884 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1991)  (staying second -filed action where “both actions involve[d] \ninterpretation of the same loan agreements” and “[sought] the same relief”); Fuller v. \nAbercrombie & Fitch Stores, Inc., 370 F. Supp. 2d 686, 690 (E.D. Tenn. 2005) (staying \nsecond-filed action, even though the second -filed case brought an additional claim, \nbecause both actions contested the same issue).  \n125. Based on the above, the Court cannot conclude, as the FSU Board contends, \nthat the ACC’s filing was “nothing more than an attempt to deny the FSU Board (i.e., \nthe true plaintiff) from prosecuting its claims in its chosen venue .”197  Rather than \nseek to avoid unfavorable law, see, e.g., Harris Teeter Supermarkets, Inc., 2023 NCBC \nLEXIS 125, at *51 n.16, or deny a party who has suffered actual damages its choice \nof forum, see, e.g. , Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol. , 141 N.C. App. at 578 —\ncircumstances typically found to constitute improper forum shopping—the ACC chose \nto put its interpretation of its North Carolina contracts and their covenants not to sue \nbefore a North Carolina court once the FSU Board’s breach of those contracts was \nimminent.  See, e.g. , Pilot Title Ins. Co. v. Nw. Bank, 11 N.C. App. 444,  449 (1971) \n(“[J]urisdiction lies where the court is convinced that litigation, sooner or later, \n \n197 (Reply Supp. Def.’s Mots. 12.) \nappears to be unavoidable[.]”).  As such, the ACC did not engage in improper conduct \nor “procedural fencing” in filing this action in North Carolina.  Accordin gly, \nconsidering all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the filing of this action \nand the Florida Action, the Court concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that the \nACC’s choice of forum is entitled to deference on this record.   \n126. The Court further concludes that the nature of the case and the applicable \nlaw strongly favor allowing this matter to proceed in North Carolina.  The key \ncontracts in this case—the Grant of Rights and the Amended Grant of Rights—were \nmade in North Carolina and are governed by North Carolina law.  See, e.g., Tom Togs, \nInc. v. Ben Elias Indus. Corp., 318 N.C. 361, 365 (1986) (“Under North Carolina law, \na contract is made in the place where the last act necessary to make it binding \noccurred.”).  The ACC’s Constitution and Bylaws are also at issue , and as the ACC’s \ngoverning documents, they too are governed by North Carolina law.  See, e.g., Futures \nGrp., Inc. v. Brosnan , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 19, 2023) \n(“North Carolina courts apply the subs tantive law of the incorporating state when \ndeciding matters of internal governance.”).  In addition, the FSU Board’s claims in \nthe Florida Action and its anticipated defenses and compulsory counterclaims in this \naction are based on the ACC’s decisions and conduct in North Carolina.  And while \nthe Court recognizes that certain of the FSU Board’s anticipated defenses and \nanticipated counterclaims may be governed by Florida law , and that the ACC’s \ndamages claims challenge, at least in part, the FSU Board’s conduct in Florida, the \ncore issue presented in the two actions —i.e., the enforceability of the two Grant of \nRights Agreements—favors resolution before a North Carolina court.198 \n127. The Court also finds that the burden of litigating matters not of local concern \nand the desirability of litigating matters of local concern in local courts strongly favor \nthe litigation of this matter in North Carolina.  T he ACC has been based in North \nCarolina for over seventy years and recently received a tax incentive from the State \nof North Carolina to locate its headquarters in Charlotte. 199  Four of its Member \nInstitutions are located in North Carolina —more M embers than from any other \nState—and only two Members of the ACC’s fifteen current Members are in Florida.200  \nFSU ha s attended numerous meetings, served in Conference leadership positions,  \nand participated in hundreds of athletic contests in North Carolina since it joined the \nACC in 1991 ,201 and, as noted, m any of the decisions about which the FSU Board \n \n198 While the FSU Board has raised certain defenses that likely implicate Florida law, the \nFSU Board’s contention that “this case involves important jurisdictional issues of sovereign \nimmunity waiver under Fla. Stat. §§  1001.72 and 768.28 that should be interp reted and \ndecided by a Florida court more familiar with the intent and application of these statutes[,]” \n(Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots.  25), is without merit.  The FSU Board initiated the Florida Action \nand thereby consented to suit in Florida; thus, there are no issues of sovereignty immunity \nwaiver to be determined in Florida.  Sovereign immunity waiver is only at issue in this \nlitigation and therefore is only before this Court for determination. \n \n199 (See FAC ¶¶ 1, 11, 32.) \n \n200 (See FAC ¶¶ 1, 16.) \n \n201 (See FAC ¶¶ 8–10, 16, 94–97, 112.) \n \ncomplains occurred at the ACC’s headquarters in North Carolina.202  The FSU Board \nhas also previously participated in litigation in North Carolina without complaint.203   \n128. Moreover, while FSU is the only ACC Member Institution involved in this \nlawsuit, the determination of whether the ACC’s Grant of Rights Agreements are \nlegally enforceable is critically important to all M embers of the Conference, and the \nresolution of that issue is of tremendous consequence to the North Carolina-based \nACC since it may d irectly bear on the Conference’s ability to meet its contractual \ncommitments to ESPN as well the Conference’s future revenues, stability, and long -\nterm viability.  For these reasons, the Court concludes that a North Carolina court \nhas “a local interest in resolving the controversy” that exceeds the local interest of \nthe Florida courts.  See Cardiorentis AG , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 243, at *23 (observing \nthat North Carolina courts generally have an interest in providing a forum to hear \ndisputes involving injuries related to citizens of the state). \n129. The Court also concludes that the convenience of witnesses and the ease of \naccess to proof favor proceeding in North Carolina.  While the FSU Board did not \nspecifically address these factors in its briefing or at the Hearin g, the ACC has \nidentified by name several material witnesses who reside in North Carolina and other \n \n202 (See FAC ¶¶ 11–15, 52–53, 69, 105.) \n \n203 Indeed, the FSU Board voted to approve the ACC’s initiation of litigation in North Carolina \nagainst the University of Maryland in 2012, (see Br. Supp. Def.’s Mots. Ex. 2 ¶ 39, ECF No. \n19.2), and FSU’s General Counsel submitted an affidavit in that litigation seeking the \ndisqualification of the University of Maryland’s counsel for a conflict of interest , ( see Br. \nOpp’n Def.’s Mots. Ex. 5, ECF No. 31.5.) \n \nmaterial witnesses who do not reside in Florida. 204  The ACC has also represented \nthat its servers, records, Board minutes, and agreements with ESPN are loca ted in \nNorth Carolina.205  Without opposing argument or evidence from the FSU Board, the \nCourt concludes these factors weigh against the FSU Board’s requested stay. \n130. In addition to its arguments on the ACC’s choice of forum, the FSU Board \nargues that this Court should defer to the Florida Action because it is broader in scope \nthan this action.  See, e.g. , Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol. , 141 N.C. App. at 578 \n(recognizing that “the interests of judicial economy and efficiency weigh in favor of \nsuits that will settle all of the issues in the underlying controversy”).   While the \nFlorida Action may be broader in scope at this pre-answer stage of the litigation, the \nFSU Board ignores that its  defenses and compulsory counterclaims will likely \nbroaden the scope of this action to the same extent as the Florida Action once they \nare asserted.  As a result, the Court does not give substantial weight to this factor in \nits analysis. \n131. Considering the  Lawyers Mutual  factors as discussed above , both \nindependently and in combination, and balancing the equities present in these \ncircumstances, the Court concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that the stay that \nthe FSU Board requests is not warranted under Lawyers Mutual and that proceeding \nwith this action in North Carolina would not work a “substantial injustice” on the \nFSU Board.  The Court concludes, as discussed above, that (1) the nature of the case, \n \n204 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 26 n.16, 17.) \n \n205 (See Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mots. 27.) \n(2) the convenience of the witnesses, (4) the relative ease of access to sources of proof, \n(5) the applicable law, (6) the burden of litigating matters not of local concern, (7) the \ndesirability of litigating matters of local concern in local courts, and (9) the ACC’s \nchoice of the North Carolina forum, when considered in combination, decisively \noutweigh the FSU Board’s choice of the Florida forum for the determination of the \nenforceability of the Grant of Rights Agreements and the resolution of the ACC’s \ndamages claims against the FSU Board for breach of those agreements.  Accordingly, \nthe Court, in the exercise of its discretion, will deny the FSU Board’s alternative \nMotion to Stay under section 1-75.12(a). \nVI. \nCONCLUSION \n132. WHEREFORE, the Court GRANTS in part  and DENIES in part  the \nMotions and hereby ORDERS as follows: \na. The Court GRANTS the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss as to the ACC’s \nfifth claim for relief for breach of fiduciary duty, and that claim is hereby \nDISMISSED with prejudice; \nb. The Court otherwise DENIES the FSU Board’s Motion to Dismiss; and \nc. The Court, in the exercise of its discretion,  DENIES the FSU Board’s \nalternative Motion to Stay.   \n    SO ORDERED, this the 4th day of April, 2024. \n \n \n      /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe   \n      Louis A. Bledsoe, III    \n      Chief Business Court Judge "
