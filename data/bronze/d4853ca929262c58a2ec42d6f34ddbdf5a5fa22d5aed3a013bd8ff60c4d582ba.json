Martin Hunter, Receiver for K&E Real Estate Investments, LLC \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \n{1} THIS MATTER  is before the Court upon  G. Martin Hunter’s (the \n“Receiver”) Final Report of Receiver an d Motion for Approval of Receiver’s \nCommission (the “Motion”) as the court-appointed Receiver for Defendant K&E Real \nEstate Investments, LLC (“K&E,” the “Receivership,” or the “Receivership Estate”).  \nThe Motion seeks Court approval of the Receiver’s Final Report, the Receiver’s \nrejection of the claims of North Carolina’s Realty, Inc. (“NC Realty”) and Defendant \nPaul A. Konrady (“Konrady”), the Receiv er’s proposal for payment of K&E’s 2015 \ntaxes, the Receiver’s request for commissio n, and the Receiver’s request to make \nfinal distributions of K&E’s assets to Plaintiff Lavonne R. Ekren (“Ekren” or \n“Plaintiff”) and Konrady.   \n{2} The Receiver filed the Motion on July 30, 2015, together with a brief in \nsupport of the Motion.  Plaintiff filed a response consenting to the Receiver’s \nMotion, and Defendant Konrady filed two re sponses and an affidavit objecting to \nthe Receiver’s Motion, in part.  The Court held a hearing on the Motion on \nNovember 12, 2015.  The Receiver, counsel for Plaintiff and Konrady, and Konrady \nwere in attendance at the hearing. \nThe Receiver’s Request for Commission \n{3} The Receiver seeks Court approval for payment to the Receiver of a \ncommission of five percent of the receipts received by the Receivership Estate \nbetween September 1, 2014 and July 30, 2015,  the payment to be made from the \ncash assets of the Receivership Estate.  Pursuant to N.C. Gen.  Stat. § 1-507.9, “the \ncourt shall allow a reasonable compensation to  the receiver for his services, not to \nexceed five percent upon receipts and disbursements, and the costs and expenses of \nadministration . . . .”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-507.9 (2013).\n1  It is undisputed that the \ngross receipts of the Receivership Esta te between September 1, 2014 and July 30, \n2015 were $238,867.97.  The Receiver seeks five percent of this amount, which \nequals $11,943.40.   \n{4} Defendant Konrady contends that the Receiver’s request is excessive, both \nbecause the Receiver has miscalculated his commission by double-counting certain \nreceipts, and because the Receiver has no t done sufficient work to justify the \ncompensation requested in the circumstances here.  The Court finds Konrady’s \narguments without merit.   \n{5} First, as to the Receiver’s commission calculation, Konrady contends that \nthe Receiver erred by calculating his commission based on gross receipts during the \napplicable period rather than, as he had in his two prior commission requests, based \non net receipts (i.e. receipts after deducting for mortgages, real estate commissions \nand closing costs).  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-507.9, however, does not require that \ncommission be paid on net receipts, and the Court does not find that the Receiver’s \ndecision to seek commission based on net receipts in his first two applications \n                                                 \n1 The Court notes that N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-5 07.9 governs the compensation for receivers of \ncorporations, and that K&E is a limited liability company.  However, in the Order appointing the \nReceiver, this Court (Murphy J.) specifically ordered that the Receiver would be paid pursuant to \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-507.9.  Ekren v. K&E Real Estate Inv., LLC , No. 12 CVS 508 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nAug. 8, 2012) (order appointing receiver).  The Receiver was thereafter paid pursuant to N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 1-507.9 in connection with his two prior applications for commission.  The Court, therefore, \nelects, in its discretion, to apply N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-507.9 in considering the Receiver’s Motion. \nprecludes his request to be paid on gross receipts in the current Motion.  \nCompensation awarded under N.C. Gen. St at. § 1-507.9 must be reasonable, and \nthe Receiver is certainly permitted to contend that reasonable compensation under \nthe circumstances existing during a part icular period should be based on net \nreceipts while reasonable compensation under the circumstances existing in a \ndifferent period should be based on gr oss receipts.  Konrady’s “miscalculation” \nargument therefore fails. \n{6} Next, as to Konrady’s contention that the Receiver’s request is excessive, \nKonrady argues that the Receiver has already been paid over $60,000 in receiver’s \nfees, attorneys’ fees, and costs and contends that the Receiver did not perform \nsufficient work in the applicable period to  warrant additional compensation.  The \nCourt disagrees.  \n{7} The Receiver attached his computerized time records to the Motion \nshowing that he has spent 36.5 hours over the past year exercising his duties as \nReceiver.  The Receiver’s time records set forth in great detail the numerous and \nvaried actions the Receiver took to manage  the Receivership Estate and to sell the \nReceivership Estate’s last two real estate parcels after September 1, 2014.  Based on \nthe evidence of record, the Court finds that the actions the Receiver took, and the \ntime the Receiver spent in furtherance of his duties under his appointment, were \nreasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.   \n{8} Konrady also appears to suggest that the Receiver’s commission should be \nreduced because, in Konrady’s view, this action was “motivated strictly by \n[Plaintiff’s] spite” and because the Receiver’s fees were unnecessary in light of \nKonrady’s safekeeping of K&E’s assets.  Neither contention is persuasive.  First, \nhaving accepted court appointment, the Rece iver is entitled to receive reasonable \ncompensation for his services under N.C. Ge n. Stat. § 1-507.9 re gardless of who or \nwhat caused the conditions necessitati ng the Receivership.  The Receiver’s \ncompensation should not be dependent upon the wisdom of his appointment.  In \naddition, Konrady’s complaint that the Re ceivership was unnecessary carries no \nweight.  Konrady continues to ignore that , regardless of the conduct that caused \nhim to conclude that he needed to transfer K&E’s assets to himself, it was that \ntransfer – made without any support under North Carolina law – and his decision \nto forego his available legal remedies in a court of law in favor of extra-legal self-\nhelp, that precipitated Plaintiff’s action and required the appointment of the \nReceiver. \n{9} In sum, the Court concludes, based upon a consideration of the entire \nrecord before the Court, that the Rece iver’s requested commission is fair and \nreasonable compensation for his services between September 1, 2014 and July 30, \n2015, and should be approved.  Accordingly, pursuant to N.C. Ge n. Stat. § 1-507.9, \nthe Court, in the exercise of its discretion, hereby GRANTS the Receiver’s Motion \nand APPROVES a commission payment in the amo unt of $11,943.40 to be paid to \nthe Receiver out the assets of the Receivership Estate.\n2 \nClaims against the Receivership Estate \n{10} The Receiver also seeks Court approval of his rejection of two claims \nagainst the Receivership Estate.   \n{11} The first claim was asserted by NC Realty concerning an outstanding \ninvoice to K&E allegedly due since June 10, 2011 for $6,000.00 for marketing and \nprep time in connection with the sale of one of K&E’s properties.  Although NC \nRealty raised this claim to the Receiv er on June 13, 2013, NC Realty has not \nbrought an action against K&E for non-payment at any time.\n3  The Receiver \ncontends that any claim NC Realty can bring to collect on this alleged debt is now \nbarred by the three-year statute of limitati ons under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52(1).  The \nCourt agrees and concludes that the Receiver properly rejected NC Realty’s claim \nagainst the Receivership Estate. \n                                                 \n2  The Receiver did not seek recovery of attorneys’ fees in the Motion and advised at the hearing that \nthe Motion sets forth his final application for compensation for his services as either Receiver or as \ncounsel for the Receiver in this matter. \n \n3  The Receiver advised at the hearing that he had notified NC Realty through its owner, Rick \nChristenberry, of the Receiver’s objection to the claim but did not receive any response from Mr. \nChristenberry.  NC Realty has not filed an objection to the Receiver’s rejection of NC Realty’s claim \nwith the Court. \n{12} The second claim was asserted by De fendant Konrady through an invoice \nsent by “Paul Konrady Consulting” to the Receiver dated February 4, 2015 in the \namount of $24,000.00 for alleged “financial record keeping of on-going operations, \npreparation of year-end financial information for tax reporting purposes, and \nfinancial reporting service as needed fo r ongoing operations of [K&E]” from 2011 \nthrough 2014.  The evidence of record is undisputed that neither K&E nor the \nReceiver ever entered into a contract with Konrady or Paul Konrady Consulting for \nsuch services or requested that Konrady perform such services.  Konrady contends \nthat a contract or request was not needed , however, under the express terms of the \nOperating Agreement.  Specifically, Ko nrady argues that Section 5.5 of the \nOperating Agreement, which states that a member may charge his “regular fees for \nany activity associated with the management of the corporation so long as the \nactivity is of the type that the member us ually provides to its clients,” requires the \nReceiver to recognize his claim because the fees he seeks are for “activity of the type \nthat he usually provides to [his] clients.”\n4  The Court disagrees. \n{13} First, by Konrady’s own admission, he  provided the alleged services to \nK&E without charge “for many years” and avers that he “began charging the \nCompany for [his] services” only after Plaintiff began engaging in conduct he viewed \nas detrimental to K&E.  Konrady has provided no evidence, however, that (i) he \never told Plaintiff that he had begun to charge K&E for his services at any time, (ii) \nhe ever submitted an invoice to K&E for his services prior to the institution of the \nReceivership, (iii) K&E ever paid him for his services at any time, or (iv) Plaintiff or \nany other person was aware that he was charging K&E for his services.  \nAccordingly, Konrady’s claim – supported solely by his September 1, 2015 affidavit \n– appears to reflect nothing more than a lo ng-after-the-fact decision to charge for \n                                                 \n4  Konrady asserts in his brief, and stated again at the hearing, that his claim is based solely on the \nOperating Agreement as “a specific written agreem ent which allows Mr. Konrady to charge for his \nservices in this case” and “is not [a claim] in quantum meruit.”  As such, the Receiver’s contention \nthat Konrady’s claim should be rejected based on the equitable doctrine of unclean hands is \nmisplaced.  See , e.g., Guessford v. Pa. Nat' l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. , 918 F. Supp. 2d 453, 469 (M.D.N.C. \n2013) (“Under North Carolina law, the defense of unclean hands is only applicable when the plaintiff \nseeks an equitable remedy.”) (citations and quotations omitted).  \nhis alleged services in an effort to obtain a greater share of the final distribution of \nthe Receivership Estate’s remaining assets.  Even if the Court were to assume that \nSection 5.5 of the Operating Agreement pe rmitted Konrady to receive payment for \nbookkeeping services, the Agreement d oes not permit Konrady to decide, \nunilaterally, months and years after the serv ices were provided, to charge K&E for \nservices that were rendered free of charge at the time they were offered and \nprovided.  \n{14} In addition, the Order appointing the Receiver in August 2012 broadly \nauthorized the Receiver to “take charge of  the day-to-day administration of [K&E]” \nand did not subject the Receiver’s authority to any purported right of Konrady to \nprovide bookkeeping services under the Op erating Agreement.  It is undisputed \nbased on the evidence of re cord before the Court that (i) the Receiver did not \ncontract with Konrady to provide services , (ii) the Receiver did not authorize or \nrequest Konrady to provide any services, (iii) the Receiver did not agree to pay \nKonrady for any services, (iv) Konrady did no t advise the Receiver that he intended \nto charge for his alleged services, and (v) Konrady did not tender an invoice for his \nalleged services until February 2015, almost 2½ years after the Receiver was \nappointed.   \n{15} Under these circumstances, the Court concludes, based on its \nconsideration of the entire record before  the Court, that the Receiver properly \nrejected Konrady’s claim against the Receivership Estate.5 \nK&E’s 2015 Taxes \n{16} The Receiver has proposed that $7, 000.00 of the Receivership Estate’s \nassets be deposited into the IOLTA trust account of G. Martin Hunter Attorney at \nLaw to be held for payment of final taxe s due from the Receivership Estate.  The \nReceiver further proposes that he be authorized to sign K&E’s final 2015 tax \nreturns.  The Receiver also proposes that , in the event K&E’s final tax liability is \n                                                 \n5  In light of the Court’s approval of the Receiver’s rejection of Konrady’s claim, the Court declines to \nconsider Plaintiff’s additional contention that Sect ion 5.5’s exclusion of fees for activities that are \nconsidered “managing the Company” also bars Konrady’s claim.   \n \nless than $7,000.00, the Receiver shall pa y the amount less than $7,000.00 to \nKonrady, and in the event K&E’s final tax liability is greater than $7,000.00, \nPlaintiff and Konrady shall pay the amount in excess of $7,000.00 to the Receiver in \nequal shares.  Neither Plaintiff nor Ko nrady advanced any objection to the \nReceiver’s proposal in their briefs on the Receiver’s Motion, and counsel for each \nindicated their consent to the Receiver’s proposal at the hearing.  The Court finds \nthe Receiver’s proposal fair and reason able under the circumstances and approves \nthe proposal as set forth in this Order. \nFinal Distributions \n{17} The parties indicated at the hearing that, subject to their disagreement \nconcerning the Receiver’s rejection of Konrady’s claim, they agree that the final \ndistribution of the Receivership Estate’s assets should be made as follows:  \nBeginning Balance      $276,724.42 \n Tax holdback             ($7,000) \n Receiver’s Commission                      ($11,943.40) \nAmount to be distributed     $257,781.02 \n1. To Konrady6     ($60,000.00) \n2. To Plaintiff7     ($95,000.00) \nTo Konrady     ($95,000.00) \n3. To Konrady8     ($7,781.02) \n{18} The Court finds that the Receiver’s pr oposed distribution is consistent \nwith the terms of the Second Amendment and, in light of the Court’s approval of the \n                                                 \n6 The parties and the Receiver agree that Konrady is to receive the first $60,000 of any distribution \npursuant to paragraph 1(a) of the Second Amen dment to Operating Agreement dated October 20, \n2007 between Plaintiff and Konrady (the “Second Amendment”).  \n \n7 The parties and the Receiver agree that after payment of the first $60,000 under paragraph 1(a) of \nthe Second Amendment, the next $190,000 of any distri bution is to be paid equally between Plaintiff \nand Konrady in accordance with  their respective membership interests in K&E pursuant to \nparagraph 1(b) of the Second Amendment. \n \n8 The parties and the Receiver agree that the next $45,000 in assets “shall be first distributed to \nKonrady or his successors as a preferred distributi on” pursuant to paragraph 1(c) of the Second \nAmendment. \nReceiver’s rejection of Konrady’s clai m, approves the Receiver’s proposed \ndistribution of final proceeds as follows: \nBeginning Balance      $276,724.42 \nT a x  h o l d b a c k                        ($7,000.00) \n Receiver’s commission          ($11,943.40) \n To Konrady            ($162,781.02) \n To Plaintiff            ($95,000.00) \n Total Payments           ($276,724.42) \nConclusion \n{19} IT IS, THEREFORE, ORD ERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED  as \nfollows: \na) The Receiver’s Final Report is APPROVED. \nb) The Receiver’s rejection of the claims of NC Realty and Konrady is \nAPPROVED. \nc) The Receiver’s proposal regarding the 2015 tax returns is \nAPPROVED and (i) the Receiver shall be permitted to place \n$7,000.00 into the IOLTA genera l trust account of G.
