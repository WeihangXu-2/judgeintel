Ruley, for \nDefendant Tammy Whitworth. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3. The pertinent procedural and factual background of these matters is set out \nmore fully in Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc., 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 60, at *4 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 12, 2017), Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC \nv. Window World, Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 25, 2016), \nand Window World of St. Louis, Inc. v. Window World, Inc. , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 79, \nat *2 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2015). The Court recites only those facts necessary for \nthe determination of the Motions. \n4. Defendant Window World, Inc. (“Window World”) is in the business of \nselling and installing windows, doors, and siding.  It operates several store locations \nand also franchises its business around the country.   Plaintiffs in these actions are \nvarious Window World franchisees.   According to Plaintiffs, Defendant Window \nWorld International, Inc. is an entity Defendant Tammy Whitworth created to receive \nWindow World’s intellectual property in a scheme to enrich herself and defraud \nWindow World’s creditors. \n5. The Window World Defendants assert that MetricWise, a customer \nrelationship management  software-as-a-service provider that furnishes sales and \nlead information for use by certain Plaintiffs, has information concerning Plaintiffs’ \nbusinesses that is relevant to Plaintiffs’ alleged damages. \n6. Through both the Damages Motion to Compel and the MetricWise Motion to \nCompel, the Window World Defendants seek information regarding Plaintiffs’ alleged \ndamages.  Specifically at issue are Plaintiffs’ alleged money damages arising from the \nfollowing causes of action: (i) breach of contract, (ii) breach of the covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing, (iii) fr aud, (iv) negligent misrepresentation, (v) unfair and \ndeceptive trade practices under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1, and (vi) unjust enrichment.  \n(Pls.’ Third Am. Compl., ¶¶ 245 –85, ECF No. 252 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 275 (15 CVS \n2).) \n7. Plaintiffs seek damages under three theories.  First, through the ir claims \nfor breach of contract, breach of the covenant of goo d faith and fair dealing, and (in \nthe alternative) unjust enrichment,  Plaintiffs seek the amounts they allege they \noverpaid for windows, products, and services from vendors designated by the Window \nWorld Defendants (the “Overpayment Damages”).  Second, through the ir claims for \nfraud, negligent misrepresentation, unfair trade practices , and unjust enrichment , \nPlaintiffs seek damages  from the Window World Defendants corresponding to the \namount of outstanding debt owed to the Window World Defendants and assumed by \ncertain Plaintiffs  when those Plaintiffs acquired various failing Window World \nfranchises (the “Debt Damages”).  Third, through their claims for fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and unjust enrichment , Plaintiffs seek damages based on their \nadvertising expenditures, which Plaintiffs argue built value in the Window World \ntrademarks and brand without benefit to Plaintiffs (the “Advertising Damages”).  \nNotably, Plaintiffs assert that they are not seeking damages based on lost profits, \ndecreased sales, or diminution in the value of their businesses.  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Defs.’ \nMot. Compel Pls. Produc. Financial, Sales, and Customer D ata 3, ECF No. 457 (15 \nCVS 1), ECF No. 497 (15 CVS 2).) \n8. In February 2018, the Window World Defendants served MetricWise with a \ndeposition subpoena under Rule 30(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil \nProcedure and a subpoena duces tecum under Rule 45 (collectively, the “Subpoenas”).  \nMetricWise objected to the Subpoenas on several grounds, including that producing \nthe requested documents would impose an undue burden and that it is obligated by \ncontract to protect Plaintiffs’ confidential data  of the sort sought .  Plaintiffs also \ntimely objected to the Subpoenas, arguing, in part, that the Subpoenas sought \nconfidential and irrelevant business information and imposed an undue burden.  \n9. The Window World Defendants subsequently filed the Motion to Strike, \narguing that Plaintiffs’ objections should be struck because (i) Plaintiffs did not have \nstanding to assert the objections and (ii) Plaintiffs’ objections based on the \nconfidentiality of the subpoenaed information could readily be protected through the \nJuly 31, 2015 Protective Order previously entered in this case.  By order dated June \n19, 2018, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs had standing to challenge the \nMetricWise Subpoenas but deferred consideration of the Motion to Strike until \nconsideration of the parties’ additional briefing and arguments on various related \nmotions to be heard at the August 22 Hearing.   \n10. Through the Damages Motion to Compel, which was filed on May 4, 2018, \nthe Window World Defendants seek responses to ninety -five separate requests for \nproduction of documents related to Plaintiffs’ alleged damages. \n11. Through the subsequent MetricWise Motion to Compel, the Window World \nDefendants seek an order compelling Plaintiffs or (in the alternative) MetricWise “to \nrespond to requests for information (via written discovery and/or a document and \ndeposition subpoena) seeking documents supporting [Plaintiffs’] claimed damages[.]” \n(Window World Defs.’ Mot. Compel Pls. and/or MetricWise Produc. Docs. or Provide \nTest. 2, ECF No. 538 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 576 (15 CVS 2).) \n12. The Motions have been fully briefed and heard and are ripe for \ndetermination. \nII. \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \n13. Rule 26 of the North Carolina Rule s of Civil Procedure provides that \n“[p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is \nrelevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action[.]”   N.C. R. Civ. P. \n26(b)(1).  Under Rule 34, a “party may serve on any other party a request  . . . to \ninspect and copy, test, or sample any . . . tangible things which constitute or contain \nmatters within the scope of Rule 26(b) and which are in the possession , custody or \ncontrol of the party upon whom the request is served[.]”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 34(a).  \n14. “A fundamental requirement of Rule 26, and the focus of the Court’s analysis \nhere, is that the information sought to be discovered must be ‘relevant’ to the pending \naction.”  Wachovia Capital Partners, LLC v. Frank Harvey Inv. Family L.P. , 2007 \nNCBC LEXIS 7, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 5, 2007); see Adams v. Lovette, 105 N.C. \nApp. 23, 29, 411 S.E.2d 620, 624, aff’d, 332 N.C. 659, 422 S.E.2d 575 (1992).  “To be \nrelevant for discovery purposes, the information sought need only be ‘reasonably \ncalculated’ to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence admissible at trial.”  Wachovia \nCapital Partners, LLC, 2007 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *32 (citing N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1)).   \n“[A] determination that information is relevant for discovery purposes does not \nnecessarily mean that the information is admissible at trial.   The latter \ndetermination is made according to Rule 401 of the Rules of Evidence.”  Id. at *31–\n32; see also Shellhorn v. Brad Ragan, Inc., 38 N.C. App. 310, 314, 248 S.E.2d 103, 106 \n(1978).  \nA. Damages Motion to Compel \n15. The Window World Defendants, through the Damages Motion to Compel , \nseek the following documents from Plaintiffs : (i) the corporate Plaintiffs’ profit and \nloss statements (the “P&L Statements”); (ii) the corporate Plaintiffs’ balance sheets \n(the “Balance Sheets”);  (iii) the corporate Plaintiffs’ tax returns  (the “Corporate  \nReturns”); and (iv) the individual Plaintiffs’ tax returns (the “Individual Returns”)  \n(collectively, the “ Accounting Records”).  The Window World Defendants also seek \nproduction of certain advertising records and metrics (the “Advertising Records”) as \nwell as documents relat ing to the financial impact of the alleged overpricing  on \nPlaintiffs’ businesses, including information related to Plaintiffs’  pricing, individual \nsales, cost of goods sold, and profitability (the “Lost Profit Records”).   Finally, the \nWindow World Defendants seek Plaintiffs’ transaction -by-transaction customer \nrecords, which they contend will enable them to show that favorable “C” Pricing was \navailable to Plaintiffs on specific transactions (the “‘C’ Pricing Records”).2  According \nto the Window World Defendants, the documents sought through the Damages \nMotion to Compel  are necessary for their damages expert, Catharine M. Lawto n \n(“Lawton”), to analyze causation and damages  in connection with Plaintiffs’ claims \nfor monetary relief.   \n16. Plaintiffs argue in response that none of the documents the Window World \nDefendants seek are relevant to Plaintiffs’  claims and, in particular, to Plaintiffs’ \ntheory of damages.  Plaintiffs contend that the documents at issue relate to Plaintiffs’ \nbusiness methods and financial success, which are only relevant to a lost profits \ntheory, which Plaintiffs have not pleaded and expressly disavow. \n17. As a general matter, a party cannot withhold requested information “on \ngrounds that it does not agree with [the requesting party’s] theory of the case.”  Ati \nIndus. Automation, Inc. v. Applied Robotics, Inc. , No. 1:09CV471, 2014 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 101413, at *12 (M.D.N.C. July 25, 2014).  However, to determine whether \nrequested information is reasonably calculate d to lead to the discovery of evidence \nadmissible at trial, a court may look to the nature of the underlying claims or \ndefenses.  See Shellhorn, 38 N.C. App. at 315, 248 S.E.2d at 107 (“[D]iscovery as to \n                                                 \n2 The Court recognizes that there may be overlap between the Accounting Records, \nAdvertising Records, Lost Profit Records, and “C” Pricing Records.  For purposes of this Order \nand Opinion, Lost Profit Records shall include only documents related to Plaintiffs’ pricing, \nproduct profitability, and, together with “C” Pricing Records, Plaintiffs’ individual \ntransactions with Plaintiffs’ customers. \nmatters occurring outside the period of limitations or at some other time not relevant \nto the case may be denied[.]”);  Brown v. Secor , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *29 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. July 28, 2017) (denying motion to compel defendants’ tax returns that \npredated events giving rise to the claim); Lawrence v. UMLIC-Five Corp., 2007 NCBC \nLEXIS 30, at *32 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 14, 2007) (denying motion to compel after \nanalyzing viability of legal theories and noting requested information was “not \nrelevant to the claims or defenses here, nor is it likely to lead to t he discovery of \nadmissible evidence”); see also Wagoner v. Elkin City Sch. Bd. of Educ., 113 N.C. App. \n579, 585, 440 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1994) (affirming denial of motion to compel and noting \nthe plaintiff “failed to meet her burden of proving that her reques ts relate to \ninformation both relevant and necessary to her claims”); Dworsky v. Travelers Ins. \nCo., 49 N.C. App. 446, 448, 271 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1980) (noting that a party seeking \ndiscovery is “not entitled to a fishing expedition to locate it”).   Thus, a court \nnecessarily may consider a party’s proffered legal theories in determining the \nrelevance of requested information under Rule 26. \n18. Here, the Window World Defendants claim the information they seek is \nrelevant to their purported defense to Plaintiffs’ damages.  With one limited \nexception,3 the Window World Defendants do not claim these documents are relevant \nto any of their affirmative claims or defenses.   Therefore, the Court must determine \nwhether the requested information is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery \n                                                 \n3 As discussed below, the Window World Defendants contend that that the Individual Returns \nare relevant to whether the “Large Franchisee Exemption” under federal franchise law \nexcused the disclosure requirements upon which Plaintiffs rest their Section 75-1.1 claim. \nof admissible evidence concerning Plaintiffs’ damages.  To that end, the Court \nnecessarily must consider the theories of damages Plain tiffs advance and the \ndefenses to those damages forecasted by the Window World Defendants .  See, e.g., \nLawrence, 2007 NCBC LEXIS 30, at *32 (denying motion to compel after analyzing \nlegal theories). \n1. Lost Profit Records \n19. Notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiffs are not seeking lost profit damages, \nthe Window World Defendants ’ expert, Lawton, avers that the Lost Profit Records  \nare relevant to the Window World Defendants’ defense because they are necessary to \ndetermine “the extent to which , if at all, Plaintiffs’ sales and/or profits decreased as \na result of the alleged overpayment.”   (Lawton Aff. ¶ 13, ECF No. 414.9 (15 CVS 1), \nECF No. 454.9 (15 CVS 2).)   The Window World Defendants’ argument hinges on \ntheir contention that if the overcharge amounts paid by Plaintiffs were passed on to \nPlaintiffs’ customers, Plaintiffs would not have suffered harm and their claims must \ntherefore fail.  More than that, the Window World Defendants contend that the Lost \nProfit Records are “likely to show that Plaintiffs’ profits increased as a result of the \nalleged ‘overcharging,’” as Plaintiffs may have disproportionately increased prices to \ncustomers when their own costs increased.  (Window World Defs.’ First Br. Supp. \nMot. Compel Damages Docs. 8, ECF No. 495 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 534 (15 CVS 2).) \n20. The Window World Defendants rely on People’s Center, Inc. v. Anderson, 32 \nN.C. App. 746, 233 S.E.2d 694 (1977) , to argue that the Lost Profit Records are \nrelevant to their purported defense to Plaintiffs’  damages claim.  The Court of \nAppeals observed in People’s Center  that “a plaintiff cannot recover damages by \nproving only that the defendant has unlawfully violated some duty owing to the \nplaintiff, leaving the trier of fact t o speculate as to the damages. ”  Id. at 748, 233 \nS.E.2d at 696.  Rather, a plaintiff “must go further and prove the nature and extent \nof the damage suffered by the plaintiff and that the breach of duty was the legal cause \nof that damage.”  Id. \n21. Here, the Window World Defendants argue that “[t]here is harm in the form \nof lost ‘value’ or ‘benefit of the bargain,’ if any, only when Plaintiffs resell the goods \nin the ordinary course of their businesses.”  (Window World Defs.’ Second Br. Supp. \nMot. Compel Damages Docs. 5, ECF No. 522 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 5 61 (15 CVS 2).)   \nThe Window World Defendants’ assertion, however, and the underlying implication \nthat Plaintiffs must show economic harm in subsequent and unrelated transactions \nwith their customers, is incompatible with the Court of Appeals’ caution in People’s \nCenter against allowing the recovery of damages based on mere speculation.  See \nPeople’s Ctr., Inc., 32 N.C. App. at 748–49, 233 S.E.2d at 696 (“[N]o recovery is allowed \nwhen resort to speculation or conjecture is necessary to determine whether the \ndamage resulted from the unlawful act of which complaint is made or from some other \nsource.”). \n22. The United States Supreme Court has rejected the Window World \nDefendants’ theory of defense—termed a “passing-on” defense—on similar facts in \nthe context of anti trust claims.  See Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Mach. Corp. , 392 \nU.S. 481, 493 (1968).  In holding that an intermediate buyer’s damages are not \ndependent on downstream transactions, the Supreme Court reasoned as follows: \nEven if it could be shown that the b uyer raised his price in response to, and \nin the amount of, the overcharge and that his margin of profit and total sales \nhad not thereafter declined, there would remain the nearly insuperable \ndifficulty of demonstrating that the particular plaintiff could not or would not \nhave raised his prices absent the overcharge or maintained the higher price \nhad the overcharge been discontinued.  Since establishing the applicability of \nthe passing-on defense would require a convincing showing of each of these \nvirtually unascertainable figures, the task would normally prove \ninsurmountable. \n \nId.; see also Adams v. Mills, 286 U.S. 397, 407  (1932) (“In contemplation of law the \nclaim for damages arose at the time the extra charge was paid.”) ; S. Pac. Co. v. \nDarnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531, 533 –34 (1918) (“The plaintiffs suffered \nlosses to the amount of the verdict when they paid.”) .  Although Plaintiffs’ action no \nlonger contains antitrust claims,4 the Supreme Court’s rationale applies with equal \nforce in the context presented here, and well-established North Carolina law supports \nthe Court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs should not be required to produce the Lost \nProfits Records. \n23. Turning first to Plaintiffs’ contract -based claims, the Court concludes that \nwhether Plaintiffs passed the alleged overcharged amounts to their customers is not \nrelevant to Plaintiffs’ damages for breach of contract or breach of the duty of good \nfaith and fair dealing.  In an action for breach of contract, “the injured party is entitled \nas compensation therefor to be placed, insofar as this can be done by money, in the \nsame position he would have occupied if the contract had been performed.”  First \n                                                 \n4  The Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claim under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1 by order dated October \n26, 2016. \nUnion Nat’ l Bank v. Naylor , 102 N.C. App. 719, 725, 404 S.E.2d 161, 164 (1991) \n(emphasis added) (quoting Perfecting Serv. Co. v. Product Dev. & Sales Co., 259 N.C. \n400, 415, 131 S.E.2d 9, 21 (1963)) .  Similarly, “[t]o state a claim for breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, a plaintiff must plead that the party \ncharged has taken action which injured the right of the plaintiff to receive the benefits \nof the agreement  and deprived the plaintiff of the fruits of his bargain.”   Koch \nMeasurement Devices, Inc. v. Armke , 2013 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 14, 2013) (emphasis added). \n24. The non-breaching party under either theory is entitled to damages based \non his expectation interest, which is “measured by . . . the loss in the value to him of \nthe other party’s performance caused by [that party’s] failure or deficiency[.]”  First \nUnion Nat ’l Bank , 102 N.C. App. at 725, 404 S.E.2d at 164 (citation omitted) .  \n“Damages for a breach of contract are determined as of the time of the occurrence of \nthe breach  . . . .  Under this rule, later events . . . do not affect the measur e of \ndamages.” 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages § 95. \n25. In the agreements at issue here, the Window World Defendants allegedly \npromised, among other things, to secure for Plaintiffs superior wholesale pricing for \nthe products Plaintiffs purchased, sold, and installed.   The relevant time for \ndetermining the position Plaintiffs “would have occupied” absent the alleged breach \nis the time of the Window World Defendants ’ alleged breach. 5  Subsequent \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiffs specifically contend that the agreements were breached when the Window World \nDefendants “fail[ed] to secure superior wholesale pricing from suppliers, require[ed] \nPlaintiffs [to] purchase products and supplies a t inflated prices from suppliers selected by \nWW, receiv[ed] undisclosed kickbacks or rebates on products and supplies purchased by \ntransactions between Plaintiffs and their customers are therefore irrelevant to the \ncalculation of Overpayment Damages, regardless of Plaintiffs’ profitability.  See S. \nPac. Co., 245 U.S. at 533 (“The general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at \nleast, is not to go beyond the first step.”); see also N. Ariz. Gas Serv., Inc. v. Petrolane \nTransp., Inc., 702 P.2d 696, 705 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1984) (“If [defendant] were permitted \nto assert this defense  . . .  it would be able to retain its overcharges with impunity.   \nSince [plaintiff’s] customers, the parties who ultimately absor bed at least some part \nof the damage, were not in privity with [defendant], they cannot sue on the contract. \n. . . [Plaintiff] is the only party that can recover the overcharge from [defendant], and \nit will be permitted to do so.”) .  Thus, whether Plaintif fs passed the alleged \novercharged amounts to their customers has no bearing on whether Plaintiffs were \nharmed by the Window World Defendants’ conduct or the recoverable damages for \nsuch harm on either of these contract-based claims. \n26. Although only argued through passing reference in briefing and at the \nAugust 22 Hearing, the Window World Defendants also suggest that the Lost Profit \nRecords are relevant to Plaintiffs’ duty to mitigate .  The Court disagrees.  “The \ngeneral rule is that where there has been a breach of contract, the injured party must \ndo what fair and reasonable prudence requires to save himself and reduce the \ndamage[.]”  Turner Halsey Co. v. Lawrence Knitting Mills, Inc., 38 N.C. App. 569, 572, \n248 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1978) (internal quotation ma rks omitted).  However, \n                                                 \nfranchisees from designated suppliers, [and] provid[ed] undisclosed ‘C’ pricing to certain \nfranchisees with lower levels of s ales[.]”  (Pls.’ Third Am. Compl., ¶ 249, ECF No. 252 (15 \nCVS 1), ECF No. 275 (15 CVS 2).) \n“[k]nowledge by the party complaining of a breach of a contract that he could by \nreasonable diligence have prevented or lessened the damage caused by another’s \nwrongful act is essential.”  Wilson v. Scarboro , 171 N.C. 606, 608, 88 S .E. 872, 873 \n(1916).  Here, the alleged breach, by its very nature, occurred without Plaintiffs’ \nknowledge and thus without an opportunity for Plaintiffs to mitigate the purported \nbreach’s alleged effects.  (See Pls.’ Third Am. Compl., ¶ 249, ECF No. 252 (15 CVS 1), \nECF No. 275 (15 CVS 2).)  As such, Plaintiffs did not have a duty to mitigate , and \nthus discovery of Plaintiffs’ efforts to mitigate is inapt on the record here.  See, e.g, \nClayworth v. Pfizer, Inc., 233 P.3d 1066, 1085 (Cal. 2010) (excluding pass-on evidence \nas irrelevant to mitigation).  \n27. Turning next to Plaintiffs’ fraud claim , t he Window World Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiffs will have failed to satisfy the proximate cause requirement for \nfraud if Plaintiffs “avoided adverse economic consequences from alleged fraudulent \novercharges . . . by raising prices to their customers[.]”   (Window World Defs.’ First \nBr. Supp. Mot. Compel Damages Docs. 9.) \n28. As with contract damages, fraud damages are intended to put a plaintiff in \nthe “same position” he would have occupied had no fraud occurred.  Godfrey v. Res-\nCare, Inc., 165 N.C. App. 68, 79, 598 S.E.2d 396, 404 (2004) (citation omitted).   “The \nmeasure of damages for fraud in the inducement of a contract is the difference \nbetween the value of what was received and the value of what was promised, and is \npotentially trebled by N.C.G.S. § 75 -16.”  Id. (quoting River Birch Assocs. v. City of \nRaleigh, 326 N.C. 100, 130, 388 S.E.2d 538, 556 (1990)) .6  In cases involving fraud, \n“courts are astute to give plaintiff a complete remedy and are careful to avoid \nsituations in which the defendant may benefit from his fraud.”  Tradewinds Airlines, \nInc. v. C -S Aviation Servs. , 222 N.C. App. 834, 841, 733 S.E.2d 162, 169 (2012) \n(quoting Charles E. Daye & Mark W. Morris, North Carolina Law of Torts § 27.36 (2d \ned. 1999)). \n29. Plaintiffs’ fraud claim is premised on the Window World Defendants’ alleged \npromise to provide superior wholesale pricing to Plaintiffs while misrepresenting or \nconcealing the superior pricing they offered to other franchisees.   The difference \nbetween what was promised to Plaintiffs—superior wholesale pricing—and what was \nreceived—the pricing Plaintiffs actually received and paid—is the relevant inquiry \nas to alleged Overpayment Damages.  As with contract damages, whether Plaintiffs \npassed the alleged overcharged amounts on to their customers is not relevant to \nPlaintiffs’ damages for alleged fraud here.  See Adams, 286 U.S. at 407 (“Neither the \nfact of subsequent reimbursement by the plaintiffs from funds of the shippers, nor \nthe disposition which may hereafter be made of the damages recovered, is of any \nconcern to the wrongdoers.”). \n30. Examination of Plaintiffs’ unfair and deceptive trade practices claim does \nnot produce a different result.   The conduct supporting that claim is nearly identical \n                                                 \n6 This standard is also applicable to negligent misrepresentation damages.  See Middleton v. \nRussell Grp. , 126 N.C. App. 1, 29, 483 S.E.2d 727, 743 (1997) (noting th at the standard \nmeasure of negligent misrepresentation damages is “the difference between the value for \nwhat he has received in the transaction and its purchase price” (quoting Restatement \n(Second) of Torts § 552B (Am. Law Inst. 1977)).  \nto the conduct alleged in support of Plaintiffs’ contract and fraud claims .  The \ndamages analysis necessarily follows the same reasoning applied to those claims.  The \ngeneral principle that damages should “restore the victim to his original condition, to \ngive back to him  that which was lost as far as it may be done by compensation in \nmoney” also governs recovery under Section 75-1.1.  Bernard v. Cent. Carolina Truck \nSales, Inc., 68 N.C. App. 228, 233, 314 S.E.2d 582, 585 (1984)  (quoting Phillips v. \nChesson, 231 N.C. 566, 571, 58 S.E.2d 343, 347 (1950)) .7  Therefore, the Lost Profit \nRecords have no bearing on Plaintiffs’ unfair and deceptive trade practices damages.  \n31. The Lost Profit Records  also have no connection to Plaintiffs’ alleged \ndamages on their alternative claim for unjust enrichment .  That claim seeks \nrestitution for the wrongfully-collected and undisclosed kickbacks the Window World \nDefendants allegedly received.  A claim for restitution “is not aimed at compensating \nthe plaintiff, but at forcing the defendant to disgorge benefits that it would be unjust \nfor him to keep.”  Booher v. Frue, 86 N.C. App. 390, 393, 358 S.E.2d 127, 129 (1987)  \n(quoting D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 4.1, at 224 (1973)) .  Thus, whether Plaintiffs \nwere able to avoid harm by passing alleged overcharged amounts on to their \ncustomers has no bearing on Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment damages. \n32. Separate from the Court’s conclusion regarding lack of relevance, the Court \nalso concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that producing the Lost Profit Records \nwould impose an  undue b urden on Plaintiffs.  According to Plaintiffs’ counsel, \n                                                 \n7  Indeed, the Nor th Carolina Pattern Jury Instructions on unfair and deceptive trade \npractices provide that where a business is suing in its capacity as a consumer, appropriate \ninstructions as to damages include “the amount of price discrimination paid by the plaintiff” \nor “the excess price paid by the plaintiff.”  N.C.P.I. 813.80 – Civil at 2.  \nPlaintiffs, collectively, have sold over three million windows.  A mong other broad \nrequests, the Window World Defendants seek “[a]ll documents and other information \nrelated to each Plaintiff licensee’ s sales order history for each product, including \nassociated accessories, supplies, and service, including any documents or information \ncontaining estimated costs, gross margin analysis, and/or expense analysis for the \nperiod of time each Plaintiff has been in the Window World system.”  (Window World \nDefs.’ Mot. Compel Pls. Produc. Docs. Supp. Alleged Damages Ex. D , at 26, ECF No. \n414.4 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 454.4 (15 CVS 2).)   The Court concludes that producing \npurchase orders, invoices, sales contracts, and other documents on a transaction -by-\ntransaction basis for millions of transactions would impose an undue burden  on \nPlaintiffs, particularly in light of this information’s lack of relevance to the c laims \nand defenses asserted in this action.  \n33. Accordingly, f or the reasons set forth above,  the Court concludes , in the \nexercise of its discretion, that the Damages Motion to Compel should be denied as to \nthe Lost Profits Records.  \n2. “C” Pricing Records \n34. The Window World Defendants seek Plaintiffs’ “C” Pricing Records ( i.e., \nPlaintiffs’ transaction-by-transaction customer records ), which they contend will \nenable them to determine when “C” pricing was available to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs  \nallege that the Window World Defendants misrepresented pricing information \nconcerning windows purchases from suppliers, including Associated Materials, Inc. \n(“AMI”), which served as Window World’s exclusive supplier of windows after 2007.  \n(Pls.’ Third Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25, 72, ECF No. 252 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 275 (15 CVS 2).)  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, the Window World Defendants represented that Plaintiffs \nwould receive “best pricing” from AMI and that there were only two tiers of dealer \npricing—“A” pricing and “B” pricing, with “B” pricing the more favorable.  (Pls.’ Third \nAm. Compl., ¶ 117.)  Plaintiffs further allege that the Window World Defendants hid \nfrom them the existence of even more favorable “C” pricing, which was only offered \nto certain Window World franchisees and did not include Plaintiffs.  (Pls.’ Third Am. \nCompl., ¶ 130.)  Plaintiffs assert that the Window World Defendants received “per -\nunit rebates,” or kickbacks,  “provided by the designated supplier ,” including AMI, \n“with respect to windows . . . and other products, as well as certain options to windows \n. . . including ‘LowE’ screens, interior laminates, grids, and colors.”  (Pls.’ Third Am. \nCompl. ¶ 69.) \n35. At the August 22 Hearing, the Window World Defendants contended that \nthe more favorable “C”  pricing was only available for windows sold with LowE and \ngrids, each of which were available to Plaintiffs’ customers.  According to the Window \nWorld Defendants, Plaintiffs’ “C” Pricing Records should be produced to permit the \nWindow World Defendants to determine the specific transactions in which those \noptions were sold and thus were eligible for “C” pricing.   \n36. As an initial matter, based on the parties’ representations at the August 22 \nHearing, it appears that AMI has produced records , reflected in a sp readsheet that \nhas also been produced (the “AMI Spreadsheet”), that show the number of windows \nand options that each Plaintiff purchased in each order placed with AMI, including \nwhether Plaintiffs ordered the LowE and grid options.  Accordingly, it appears to the \nCourt that AMI has already produced the information that the Window World \nDefendants seek in the “C” Pricing Records. \n37. In addition, based on the claims and defenses in this action, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs’ window sales with the LowE and grid options are irrelevant.  \nRather, the Court concludes that the relevant inquiry is whether Plaintiffs purchased \nwindows from AMI with the LowE and grid options, and, if so, on what occasions and \nin what quantities .  In short, t he relevant transact ions here are those between \nPlaintiffs and dealers, such as AMI, and those between Plaintiffs and the Window \nWorld Defendants, not those between Plaintiffs and their customers. \n38. Accordingly, based on the above, the Court concludes that the Window \nWorld Defendants’ request for the “C” Pricing Records should be denied. \n3. Accounting Records \n39. The Window World Defendants contend that the Accounting Records are \nrelevant to Plaintiffs’ alleged Overpayment Damages, Debt Damages, and \nAdvertising Damages.  Plaintiffs appear to agree but have produced the Accounting \nRecords with redactions.  The Window World Defendants seek to have th e records \nproduced without redactions.  Although the parties have not  disclosed the specific \nredactions at issue, Plaintiffs’ c ounsel advised at the August 22 Hearing  that they \nwere limited to a line item on the P&L Statements reflecting the attorneys’ fees paid \nin this litigation.  The Window World Defendants did not dispute this assertion.  The \nCourt concludes that the Window Wo rld Defendants have not developed a record \nsufficient to compel Plaintiffs to disclose this information.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that Plaintiffs should produce the \nAccounting Records but be permitted to redact the P&L Statements to conceal the \namount of attorneys’ fees paid in connection with this litigation.  \n4. Individual Returns  \n40. Plaintiffs’ Section 75-1.1 claim rests, in part, on Plaintiffs’ contention that \nthe Window World Defendants engaged in unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent conduct \nby intentionally choosing not to provide Franchise Disclosure Documents to Plaintiffs \ndespite a legal obligation to do so.  (Window World Defs.’ First Br. Supp. Mot. Compel \nDamages Docs. 3 n.1.)   The Window World Defendants  contend that the Individual \nReturns will show the individual Plaintiffs’ net worth, and thus whether the “Large \nFranchisee Exemption” under federal franchise law excused the disclosure \nrequirements on which the individual Plaintiffs rest their claim .  See 16 C.F.R. \n§ 436.8(a)(5)(ii) (creating exemption where “[t]he franchisee (or its parent or any \naffiliates) is an entity that has been in business for at least five years an d has a net \nworth of at least $ 5,715,500.”).  The Window World Defendants , relying on Lawton, \nalso argue that the Individual Returns will assist their expert in calculating \nOverpayment Damages.  The Court disagrees with both arguments. \n41. First, an individual’s “net worth” is not  readily determined from  most \nindividual tax returns, and the Window World Defendants have not offered evidence \nsuggesting that the individual Plaintiffs’ tax returns contain this information  here.  \nIn re Garth , 214 S.W.3d 190, 193 (Tex. App. 2007) (holding trial court exceeded its \nauthority by ordering the productio n of income tax returns and noting “tax returns \ndo not necessarily show an individual ’s net worth”).  Further, the Window World \nDefendants have not demonstrated that the information they seek cannot be obtained \nby less burdensome and invasive means.  See N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1a) (allowing court \nto limit discovery where information sought can be obtained “from some other source \nthat is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive”).  Indeed, at the August \n22 Hearing, counsel indicated that the Wind ow World Defendants recently served \ninterrogatories seeking information related to Plaintiffs’ net worth.  Finally, Lawton’s \ncontention, without explanation , that the Individual Returns  would assist her \nanalysis of Overpayment Damages and “the extent to which, if at all, that the alleged \noverpayments resulted in lower sales and/or profits,” (Lawton Aff. ¶¶ 26, 27), is stated \nin conclusory terms and in furtherance of a defense theory the Court has found \ninapposite.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Damages Motion to Compel \nshould be denied as to the Individual Returns. \n5. Advertising Records \n42. As noted above, Plaintiffs seek Advertising Damages in connection with \ntheir various claims.  At the August 22 Hearing, counsel for the Window World \nDefendants narrowed the Advertising Records sought to information that evidences \nthe value or benefit Plaintiffs received as a result of their  advertising expenditures.  \nCounsel further represented tha t the Advertising Records that the Window World \nDefendants seek through the Damages Motion to Compel are substantially the same \ndocuments that are sought through the MetricWise Motion to Compel , and that the \nMetricWise Motion to Compel was an “alternative method” of obtaining the same \ndocuments.  The parties further represented that during meet and confer negotiations \nleading to the Damages Motion to Compel, the Window World Defendants abandoned \ntheir demand for the Advertising Records, suggesting that their need for such Records \nis not substantial.  \n43. The Court concludes, based on the current record and for the reasons set \nforth below in the Court’s analysis of the MetricWise Motion to Compel, that \ngenerating and producing the Advertising Records, other than the MetricWise reports \ndescribed below, will impose an undue burden on Plaintiffs under the circumstances \nof this case.  The Court therefore concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that the \nDamages Motion to Compel should be denied to the extent it s eeks Advertising \nRecords other than the MetricWise data that are the subject of the MetricWise Motion \nto Compel, which is considered below. \nB. MetricWise Motion to Compel \n44. The Window World Defendants, through the MetricWise Motion to Compel, \nask the Court to compel Plaintiffs or MetricWise to produce sales and lead data used \nby and compiled for certain Plaintiffs.  The Window World Defendants specifically \nseek eleven reports, each of which can be generated through the MetricWise software \nused by Plaintiffs: (i) Sales Summary by Turn -in Date Reports; (ii) Sales Summary \nby Contract Data  Reports; (iii) Sales per Lead Issue  Reports; (iv) Leads Detail by \nSource Reports; (v) Leads Resulted Summary by Source  Reports; (vi) Leads Set \nSummary by Source Reports; (vii) Ad Campaign Detail by Lead Source Reports; (viii) \nCost of Goods Sold Reports; (ix) Quote Summary by Turn-In Date Reports; (x) Quote \nSummary by Contract Date Reports; and (xi) Lead Conversions Reports (collectively, \nthe “MetricWise Reports”).  (Window World Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Compel Pls. and/or \nMetricWise Produc. Docs. or Provide Test.  5 n.2, ECF No. 540 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. \n578 (15 CVS 2) .)  At the August 22 Hearing, counsel for the Window World \nDefendants clarified that they seek MetricWise Reports only for a small number of \naccounts over an eight-year period and narrowed the request to include only quarterly \nor annual Reports.   Specifically, the Window World Defendants seek MetricWise \nReports from January 2010 to the present (the “Eight -Year Period”) for \napproximately eight accounts associated with stores owned by Plaintiffs James T. \nLomax III, Jonathan Gillette, Michael Edwards, and Kenneth R. Ford, Jr. (the “Eight \nAccounts”).8 \n45. The Window World Defendants assert that the MetricWise Reports are \nrelevant in two respects: (i) as to whether Plaintiffs suffered economic harm as a \nresult of alleged overcharges, and (ii) as to Plaintiffs’ alleged Advertising Damages, \ncontending that “[t]he MetricWise data is the primary source for determining the \nsuccess of Plaintiffs’ advertising campaigns.”9  (Window World Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nCompel Pls. and/or MetricWise Produc. Docs. or Provide Test. 3.)  The Window World \n                                                 \n8 On the current record, i t is not clear wh ich stores utilize the MetricWise software and \nwhether each store owned by Plaintiffs James T. Lomax III, Jonathan Gillette, Michael \nEdwards, and Kenneth R. Ford, Jr. maintains a separate MetricWise account.  To the extent \nthat there are more than eight accounts, the Court may revisit its ruling for good cause \nshown.  \n \n9 The Window World Defendants base their request for the Advertising Records in the \nDamages Motion to Compel on the same theories of relevance. \nDefendants, however,  do not delineate which MetricWise Reports correspond to \nwhich relevance theory. \n46. In opposition to the MetricWise Motion to Compel, Plaintiffs and MetricWise \nargue that the MetricWise Reports are irrelevant  and that generating the Reports \nwould be unduly burdensome.  In particular, Plaintiffs argue that they would never \nhave made any ad vertising expenditures had they known of the Window World \nDefendants’ alleged misrepresentations and omissions and thus should be entitled to \nrecover all of the funds so expended.  As to burden, Plaintiffs and MetricWise contend \nthat because each MetricWise Report must be generated manually, the production \nburden is excessive, particularly as to the Ad Campaign Detail Report and the Sales \nPer Lead Issue Report, and especially in light of the needs of this case.   \n47. To begin, the Court has previously rejected the Window World Defendants’ \ncontention that they should be able to dis cover pricing, product profitability, and \ncustomer transaction information from Plaintiffs.  Thus, to the extent the Window \nWorld Defendants seek MetricWise Reports or other Advertising Records related to \nPlaintiffs’ pricing, profits, and margins on individual transactions with customers , \nthe MetricWise Motion to Compel will be denied. \n48. As to the MetricWise Reports relating to the success of Plaintiffs’ \nadvertising, Plaintiffs’ Advertising Damages theory presumes both that the Window \nWorld Defendants did not provide any advertising benefit to Plaintiffs and that \nPlaintiffs’ advertising expenditures benefited only the Window World Defendants.  \nUnlike Plaintiffs’ alleged Overpayment Damages, which do not require or permit an \nassessment of lost profits  and thus render the Lost Profits Records irrelevant , \nPlaintiff’s Advertising Damages rest on factual presumptions that may or may not be \ntrue.  The Court therefore concludes that the Window World Defendants should be \nafforded an opportunity to discover information relevant to Plaintiffs’ factual \npresumptions underlying their claim for these damages .  See Friday Invs., LLC v. \nBally Total Fitness of the Mid -Atl., Inc. , 805 S.E.2d 664, 667 (N.C. 2017) (“The \nprimary purpose of the discovery rules is to facilitate the disclosure prior to trial of \nany unprivileged information that is relevant and material to the lawsuit so as to \npermit the narrowing and sharpening of the ba sic issues and facts that will require \ntrial.” (quoting Bumgarner v. Reneau , 332 N.C. 624, 628, 422 S.E.2d 686, 688 –89 \n(1992))). \n49. Based on the parties’ representations at the August 22 Hearing, it appears \nthat Plaintiffs have produced advertising general le dgers, exemplars of \nadvertisements, and correspondences with advertisers.  These records show, among \nother things, the advertising expenses that Plaintiffs incurred.  The documents do \nnot, however,  necessarily account for the value or benefit Plaintiffs re ceived in \nexchange for their advertising expenditures.   \n50. Based on the record before the Court, it appears that certain MetricWise \nReports relating to advertising likely provide evidence of the value or benefit many \nof the Plaintiffs received from their  advertising expenditures. 10  The MetricWise \n                                                 \n10  As an example, Plaintiff Michael Edwards (“Edwards”), who owns Plaintiff Window World \nof Huntsville, Pl aintiff Window World of North Atlanta, and Plaintiff Window World of \nCentral Alabama, noted in his deposition that certain MetricWise Reports can be used to \ntrack the source of leads, which include television, newspaper, and internet advertisements.  \nReports contain information, including leads and revenue information , which is \npotentially relevant to the value and effectiveness of Plaintiffs’ advertising \nexpenditures.  The Court thus concludes, in the exerci se of its discretion, that \nPlaintiffs should be required to produce a limited number of a nnual MetricWise \nReports for the Eight-Year Period that relate to the effectiveness and value of \nPlaintiffs’ advertising expenditures for the Eight Accounts the Window  World \nDefendants have identified.  Because the parties’ briefs and arguments have not put \nthe Court in a position to identify the specific MetricWise Reports that most directly \nrelate to advertising effectiveness and value, the Court orders the Window World \nDefendants and Plaintiffs to meet and confer concerning a limited number of specific \nReports that shall be produced, taking into account the burden the manual \ngeneration of such Reports shall have upon Plaintiffs, including , in particular, the \nburden the manual generation of the Ad Campaign Detail Report and the Sales Per \nLead Issue Report may impose.   \n51. Because the MetricWise Reports the Window World Defendants seek from \nPlaintiffs are also sought from MetricWise, the Court concludes that MetricWise shall \nnot be required to produce any Reports at this time.  See Arris Grp., Inc. v. Cyberpower \nSys. (USA), Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 58, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 11, 2017) (“[T]he \nfact of nonparty status may be considered by the court in weighing  the burdens \nimposed in the circumstances.”  (quoting Katz v. Batavia Marine & Sporting Supplies, \n                                                 \n(Edwards Dep. 226, ECF No. 538.14 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 576.14 (15 CVS 2).)  Edwards also \nacknowledged that certain MetricWise Reports can track the revenue generated by specific \nleads, and in making decisions as to advertising expenditures, one consideration is the cost-\nper-lead.  (Edwards Dep. 524–25.) \nInc., 984 F.2d 422, 424 (Fed. Cir. 1993)).  The Court  may revisit its ruling as to \nMetricWise for good cause shown, including in the event Plaintiffs are unable to \nproduce the Reports that are the subject of this Order. \nC. Motion to Strike \n \n52. The Motion to Strike seeks to strike Plaintiffs’ objections to the MetricWise \nSubpoenas on confidentiality grounds.  Because the Court has denied the MetricWise \nMotion to Compel to the extent it seeks production from MetricWise , the Court \nconcludes that the Motion to Strike is now moot.  See, e.g., In re Hamilton, 220 N.C. \nApp. 350, 353, 725 S.E.2d 393, 396 (2012) (noting that an issue is moot whenever “the \nrelief sought has been granted or that the questions originally in controversy between \nthe parties are no longer at issue”).  Should the Court later revisit and grant the \nMetricWise Motion to Compel as to MetricWise upon a showing of good cause, the \nMotion to Strike will no longer be moot and thus again be before the Court for \ndecision.  In such an event, the Court anticipates granting the Motion to Strike, in \nthe exercise of its discretion, because Plaintiffs’ confidential information can readily \nbe protected through the Protective Order entered in this case on July 31, 2015.   \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n53. WHEREFORE, the Court, for the reasons stated herein and in the exercise \nof its discretion, hereby ORDERS as follows: \na. The Window World Defendants’ Damages Motion to Compel  is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows: \ni.
