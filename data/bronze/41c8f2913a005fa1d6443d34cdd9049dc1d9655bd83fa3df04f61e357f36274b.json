Spainhour for Defendant \nAmerican Express Co. \n \nDiaz, Judge. \n \n{1} This matter is before the Court on the cross-motions of pro se Plaintiff \nCharles Burgess (“Burgess”) and Defendant American Express Co. (“AMEX”) for \nsanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule \n11”).  For the reasons stated below, the Court DENIES Burgess’s Motion for \nSanctions and GRANTS AMEX’s Motion for Sanctions. \nI. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n{2} Burgess filed his Complaint on 13 February 2007. \n{3} On 1 March 2007, Burgess amended his Complaint, and on 5 March 2007, \nBurgess purported to amend his Complaint a second time.1 \n{4} In his Amended Complaint, Burgess alleges that Defendants AIS Network, \nInc. and Clickspring, LLC illegally placed programs on his computer that facilitated \nthe receipt of unwanted “pop-up” advertisements.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 26–28, 46.)  He \nfurther alleges that AMEX and various other Defendants used these programs to \nillegally place unwanted “pop-up” advertisements on his computer (Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n29–30, 32–33, 38–40, 49–50, 52, 55–56), and that these “pop-up” advertisements, \nand the programs that facilitated them, have invaded and damaged his computer \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 27, 34–36, 40, 49, 51). \n{5} On 21 March 2007, AMEX filed a Notice of Designation of Action as \nMandatory Complex Business Case (the “Notice of Designation”) under section 7A–\n45.4 of the North Carolina General Statutes. \n{6} That same day, AMEX filed an offer of judgment pursuant to Rule 68(a) of \nthe North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure allowing judgment to be had against it \nfor $1.00 “for all damages, attorneys’ fees taxable as costs, and the remaining costs \naccrued at the time the Offer is filed.”  (Offer of J. 2.) \n{7} On 22 March 2007, the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court \ndesignated this matter a mandatory complex business case, and on 26 March 2007, \nJudge Ben Tennille, the Chief Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business \nCases, assigned this case to me. \n{8} On 26 March 2007, Burgess filed an Opposition to Notice of Designation \npursuant to Business Court Rule 3.3. \n                                                 \n1 On 14 May 2007, the Court entered an Order striking Burgess’s Second Amended Complaint for \nfailure to comply with Rule 15 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  (Order, May 14, \n2007.) \n \n{9} On the same day that he filed his objection to litigating in the Business \nCourt, Burgess filed a Motion for Sanctions under Rule 11 alleging that AMEX filed \nits offer of judgment and Notice of Designation frivolously and in bad faith.  (See \nPl.’s Mot. Sanctions.) \n{10} As to his Rule 11 Motion, Burgess alleges, among other things, that: \n(1) AMEX and its counsel filed the $1.00 offer of judgment \n“solely for purposes of extorting the Plaintiff into a ridiculous \nsettlement” (Pl.’s Mot. Sanctions 1); \n \n(2) AMEX’s decision to remove the case to the North Carolina \nBusiness Court was “totally unsupported by facts and not \nsupported by the frivolous pleading of counsel for [AMEX]” \nand “[t]hat the motivation behind the Removal to Business \nCourt is to get the case in a Court in Charlotte where counsel \nfor [AMEX] resides and thereby prejudice the Plaintiff who \nwill then have to travel to a location outside his home” (Pl.’s \nMot. Sanctions 2); and \n \n(3) “counsel for [AMEX] is trying to extort a settlement from the \nPlaintiff in a perverted effort to impress his wealthy client \nand fatten his own pocket by using devious and illegal \nmeans” (Pl.’s Mot. Sanctions 2). \n \n{11} On 4 April 2007, and again the next day, counsel for AMEX requested that \nBurgess withdraw his Rule 11 Motion, but Burgess refused.  (Pl.’s Reply Mot. \nSanctions Ex. C, D.) \n{12} On 13 April 2007, AMEX filed a response to Burgess’s Motion for \nSanctions. \n{13} That same day, AMEX filed a Motion for Sanctions against Burgess, \nalleging that Burgess’s Motion for Sanctions violated Rule 11.  (See Def.’s Mot. Rule \n11 Sanctions.) \n{14} On 17 April 2007, Judge Tennille entered an order overruling Burgess’s \nobjection to the Notice of Designation.  (See Order, Apr. 17 2007.) \n{15} On 19 April 2007, Burgess filed a response to AMEX’s Motion for \nSanctions. \n \n{16} On 12 June 2007, the Court heard oral arguments on the cross-motions for \nsanctions. \n \nII. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. \nRULE 11 STANDARD \n{17} Rule 11 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure states: \nEvery pleading, motion, and other paper of a party represented by \nan attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his \nindividual name, whose address shall be stated.  A party who is not \nrepresented by an attorney shall si gn his pleading, motion, or other \npaper and state his address. . . .  The signature of an attorney or \nparty constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, \nmotion, or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge, \ninformation, and belief formed af ter reasonable inquiry it is well \ngrounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith \nargument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing \nlaw, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as \nto harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the \ncost of litigation. . . .  If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed \nin violation of this rule, the cour t, upon motion or upon its own \ninitiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a \nrepresented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may \ninclude an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of \nthe reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the \npleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's \nfee. \n \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 11. \n{18} In analyzing whether a pleading, motion, or other paper meets the first \ncertification requirement under Rule 11, the Court “must determine:  ‘(1) whether \nthe [party] undertook a reasonable inquiry into the facts and (2) whether the \n[party], after reviewing the results of his inquiry, reasonably believed that his \nposition was well grounded in fact.’”  Kohler Co. v. McIvor, 177 N.C. App. 396, 402, \n628 S.E.2d 817, 822 (2006) (quoting McClerin v. R-M Indus., Inc., 118 N.C. App. \n640, 644, 456 S.E.2d 352, 355 (1995)). \n \n{19} “In determining whether sanctions are warranted under the legal \nsufficiency prong of the rule, the Court must first determine the facial plausibility of \nthe paper.”  Mack v. Moore, 107 N.C. App. 87, 91, 418 S.E.2d 685, 688 (1992) (citing \nBryson v. Sullivan, 330 N.C. 644, 661, 412 S.E.2d 327, 336 (1992)).   \n{20} If the pleading, motion, or other paper is not facially plausible, “then the \nsecond issue is (1) whether the alleged offender undertook a reasonable inquiry into \nthe law, and (2) whether, based upon the results of the inquiry, [the alleged \noffender] formed a reasonable belief that the paper was warranted by existing law, \njudged as of the time the paper was signed.”  Id.  “If the court answers either prong \nof this second issue negatively, then Rule 11 sanctions are appropriate.”  Id. (citing \nBryson, 330 N.C. at 661–62, 412 S.E.2d at 336). \n{21} Even if a pleading, motion, or other paper is well grounded in fact or law, \nhowever, “it may still violate Rule 11 if it is served or filed for an improper purpose.”  \nMcIvor, 177 N.C. App. at 404, 628 S.E.2d at 823–24 (quoting Brooks v. Giesey, 334 \nN.C. 303, 315, 432 S.E.2d 339, 345–46 (1993)). \n{22} Under Rule 11: \n \nan objective standard is used to determine whether a paper has been \ninterposed for an improper purpose, with the burden on the movant to \nprove such improper purpose. . . .  In this regard, the relevant inquiry \nis whether the existence of an improper purpose may be inferred from \nthe alleged offender’s objective behavior. . . .  An improper purpose is \nany purpose other than one to vindicate rights . . . or to put claims of \nright to a proper test. \n \nMack, 107 N.C. App. at 93, 418 S.E.2d at 689 (internal quotations and citations \nomitted). \n{23} “[T]he Rule 11 movant’s subjective belief that a paper has been filed for an \nimproper purpose is immaterial in determining whether an alleged offender’s \nconduct is sanctionable.”  Id. (citing Taylor v. Taylor Prods., Inc., 105 N.C. App. 620, \n632, 414 S.E.2d 568, 576–77 (1992)). \n{24} Finally, the burden is on the movant to show an improper purpose, id., and \n“[t]here must be a strong inference of improper purpose to support imposition of \n \nsanctions.”  Bass v. Sides, 120 N.C. App. 485, 488, 462 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1995) (citing \nMack, 107 N.C. App. at 93–94, 418 S.E.2d at 689). \nB. \nBURGESS’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS \n{25} Under Business Court Rule 15.2, “[a]ll motions, unless made orally during \na hearing or a trial, shall be in paper writing or electronic form and shall be \naccompanied by a brief . . . .”  BCR 15.2 (2006). \n{26} Under Business Court Rule 15.11, a “motion unaccompanied by a brief \nmay, in the discretion of the Court, be summarily denied.”  BCR 15.11 (2006). \n{27} Because Burgess’s Motion for Sanctions was unaccompanied by a separate \nbrief, that is sufficient grounds to DENY it. \n{28} Even considering the merits, Burgess’s Motion for Sanctions still fails. \n{29} Burgess’s Motion attacks two papers filed by AMEX:  (1) the $1.00 offer of \njudgment filed pursuant to Rule 68 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, \nand (2) the Notice of Designation of this matter as a complex business case.  The \nCourt discusses each of these in turn. \n1. \nAMEX’S OFFER OF JUDGMENT \n{30} Rule 68 provides in relevant part: \nAt any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party \ndefending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an \noffer to allow judgment to be taken against him for the money or \nproperty or to the effect specifie d in his offer, with costs then \naccrued. \n \nIf within 10 days after the servic e of the offer the adverse party \nserves written notice that the o ffer is accepted, either party may \nthen file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of \nservice thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment. \n \nAn offer not accepted within 10 days after its service shall be \ndeemed withdrawn and evidence of  the offer is not admissible \nexcept in a proceeding to determine costs. \n \n \nIf the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable \nthan the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the \nmaking of the offer. \n \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 68(a). \n{31} Rule 68 makes no attempt to define the contours of a valid offer of \njudgment, other than to say that it must be for money, property, or in the case of \ninjunctive or other relief, “to the effect specified in [the] offer.”  Id. \n{32}  Our Court of Appeals has made clear, however, that “[t]he purpose of Rule \n68 is to encourage settlements and avoid protracted litigation.”  Scallon v. Hooper, \n58 N.C. App. 551, 554, 293 S.E.2d 843, 844 (1982); accord Aikens v. Ludlum, 113 \nN.C. App. 823, 824, 440 S.E.2d 319, 320 (1994). \n{33} Viewed in that context, it is difficult to see how a $1.00 offer of judgment \ntendered at the very inception of the litigation promotes the Rule’s purpose, given \nthat it has “little if any chance of seriously opening negotiations or of settling a \ncase.”  Century 21 Today, Inc. v. Tarrant, No. 240696, 2003 Mich. App. LEXIS 2762, \nat *2 (Mich. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2003). \n{34} Thus, I find that AMEX’s $1.00 offer of judgment was not intended to \npromote a settlement but instead was a tactical maneuver intended to trigger the \ncost-shifting mandate of Rule 68 in the event of a defense verdict. \n{35} The question raised by Burgess’s Motion is whether this tactic is subject to \nsanctions under North Carolina law.  I conclude that it is not. \n{36} The North Carolina cases shed no light on what constitutes a proper offer \nof judgment for purposes of Rule 68, and I have found few cases from other \njurisdictions that address the issue.  Perhaps this is because, while it may be simple \nto determine the bona fides of an offer of judgment at the margins, it becomes a \nsubjective exercise when the offer lies somewhere within the extremes.  See Warr v. \nWilliamson, 195 S.W.3d 903, 908 (Ark. 2004) (Imber, J., concurring) (asking \nrhetorically whether a $200,000 offer of judgment would be a bona fide offer in a \ncase “where millions of dollars are at stake”). \n \n{37} Moreover, that an offer of judgment may not be bona fide—in the sense \nthat it does not promote the purpose of Rule 68—does not mean that the offeror \nshould be subject to Rule 11 sanctions.  After all, AMEX’s offer of judgment does \nsatisfy the literal requirement of Rule 68(a), even if the amount offered is only \n$1.00. \n{38} Further, a defendant who is convinced that a case lacks merit should not \nbe required to offer a substantial sum to obtain the benefit of the statute.  See \nO’Neil v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 602 So. 2d 1342, 1344 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992) \n(reversing award of attorneys fees to a defendant and remanding to trial court for \ndetermination of whether $1.00 offer of settlement was “unreasonably rejected” \nunder Florida Rules of Civil Procedure). \n{39} Whether AMEX would be entitled to recover its costs in this case pursuant \nto Rule 68 remains an open question.  See Warr, 195 S.W.3d at 907 (declining to \nmake such an award in the face of a $1.00 offer of judgment); Tarrant, 2003 Mich. \nApp. LEXIS 2762, at *2 (reaching the same result “in the interests of justice”); see \nalso Delta Airlines, Inc. v. August, 450 U.S. 346, 354 (1981) (holding that the plain \nlanguage of the federal version of Rule 68 exempts cases from its cost-shifting \nmandate where a judgment is entered in favor of the defendant). \n{40} What is clear is that the law in North Carolina regarding Rule 68 offers of \njudgment is far from settled.  As a result, I “cannot say that [AMEX’s offer of \njudgment] was made for an improper purpose or that a reasonable inquiry into the \nissue of what offer is required to trigger an award of costs under Rule 68 at the time \nthe offer was made would have shown that it was implausible.”  \nWarr, 195 S.W.3d \nat 908 (affirming trial court’s decision not to impose Rule 11 sanctions based on \ndefendant’s $1.00 offer of judgment). \n{41} Accordingly, the Court DENIES Burgess’s Motion for Sanctions as to \nAMEX’s offer of judgment. \n \n \n \n \n2. \nAMEX’S NOTICE OF DESIGNATION \n{42} As to Burgess’s claim that AMEX’s Notice of Designation violates Rule 11, \nmy colleague Judge Ben Tennille overruled Burgess’s objection to removal of this \ncase to the North Carolina Business Court on 17 April 2007.  In his order, Judge \nTennille stated: \nThe Complaint on its face raises issu es involving Internet advertising.  \nThat issue falls squarely within the definition of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-\n45.4(a)(6) which covers material issues related to the Internet and \nelectronic commerce.  It also in volves issues that would have \nimplications for use of the Intern et by others, both consumers and \nadvertisers, who are not parties to this lawsuit. \n \n(Order, Apr. 17, 2007.) \n{43} I agree, and also note that this case is particularly suited to management \nby a single judge given that Burgess originally sued twenty defendants. \n{44} Accordingly, I find absolutely no merit in Burgess’s request for Rule 11 \nsanctions based on AMEX’s Notice of Designation. \nC. \nAMEX’S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS \n{45} The Court reaches a different conclusion as to AMEX’s Motion for Rule 11 \nSanctions. \n{46} As noted earlier, Rule 11 imposes on an attorney or party a duty of \nreasonable inquiry, both as to the facts and the law set out in the paper, and a \nseparate obligation not to file papers for an improper purpose.  A breach of the \ncertification as to any one of these three prongs is a violation of the Rule.  Bryson v. \nSullivan, 330 N.C. 644, 655, 412 S.E.2d 327, 332 (1992). \n{47} As to that portion of Burgess’s Rule 11 Motion attacking AMEX’s offer of \njudgment, I decline to enter sanctions. \n{48} Burgess’s filings in this case are prone to hyperbole, and this particular \npaper is no exception.  For example, Burgess complains in his Motion that AMEX \nand his counsel filed the $1.00 offer of judgment “solely for purposes of extorting the \n \nPlaintiff into a ridiculous settlement” (Pl.’s Mot. Sanctions 1), and that counsel for \nAMEX made the offer “in a perverted effort to impress his wealthy client and fatten \nhis own pocket by using devious and illegal means” (Pl.’s Mot. Sanctions 2). \n{49} While a $1.00 offer of judgment does little to promote the purpose of Rule \n68, the Court is hard-pressed to find anything perverse, devious, or illegal about it.  \nMoreover, it is difficult to fathom how AMEX’s offer of judgment could extort a \nsettlement, given that, by the plain terms of Rule 68, Burgess was free to ignore it \nand prosecute his claim. \n{50} Nevertheless, because I do not believe that a $1.00 offer of judgment \npromotes the purpose of Rule 68, I do not fault Burgess for seeking sanctions on \nthat basis. \n{51} I will, however, sanction Burgess for that portion of his Rule 11 Motion \ntargeted at AMEX’s Notice of Designation. \n{52} I find that Burgess undertook no reasonable inquiry as to the relevant \nfacts on this issue.  In his Motion, Burgess argues that AMEX’s “motivation behind \nthe Removal to Business Court is to get the case in a Court in Charlotte where \ncounsel for American Express resides and thereby prejudice the Plaintiff who will \nthen have to travel to a location outside his home.”  (Pl.’s Mot. Sanctions 2.) \n{53} But, had Burgess made any reasonable inquiry into the matter before \nfiling his Motion, he would have discovered that the Court’s policy is to hear all \npretrial and trial proceedings in a mandatory complex business case in the county \nwhere the case originates unless the parties agree otherwise.2  See The NC \nBusiness Court Frequently Asked Questions, http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/FAQ/ \nbusiness_court_frequently_asked_.htm (last visited June 19, 2007) (“It has \nconsistently been the policy of the [North Carolina Business] Court to try each case \n                                                 \n2 Because the Polk County courthouse is closed for renovations, the Court heard these matters in \nHenderson County pursuant to Rule 7(b)(4) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, which \nprovides that “[a] motion in a civil action filed with the superior court clerk of a county that is in a \nsuperior court district consisting of more than one county . . . may be heard in any county in that \nsuperior court district.”   \n \nin the county in which it is filed unless there are other standard reasons for a \nchange of venue.”) \n{54} I also conclude that Burgess filed his Rule 11 Motion as to the Notice of \nDesignation for an improper purpose.  As I have already discussed, on its face, the \nNotice of Designation satisfies the requirements of section 7A–45.4 of the North \nCarolina General Statutes for mandatory designation of complex business cases.  \nThat same statute provides a remedy for a party who objects to designation of a case \nas mandatory complex business.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A–45.4(e) (2005). \n{55} Here, Burgess pursued his remedy, but instead of waiting for a decision on \nhis objection to the Notice of Designation, he filed a separate Rule 11 Motion on the \nsame day. \n{56} I also note that AMEX’s counsel twice asked Burgess to withdraw his Rule \n11 motion, but Burgess refused to do so.  (Pl.’s Reply Mot. Sanctions Ex. C, D.) \n{57} Chief Judge Tennille overruled Burgess’s objection to the Notice of \nDesignation on 17 April 2007.  (See Order, Apr. 17, 2007.)  Burgess did not appeal \nthat ruling to the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, as was his \nright.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A–45.4(e).  Yet, his Rule 11 Motion remains pending \nbefore this Court.  Cf. McIvor, 177 N.C. App. at 405, 628 S.E.2d at 824 (holding that \nemployee did not show that an action commenced to enforce a non-compete \nagreement was filed for an improper purpose because the employer dismissed its \nclaims within a reasonable time after the employee left his job with the competitor). \n{58} “An improper purpose [under Rule 11] is ‘any purpose other than one to \nvindicate rights . . . or to put claims of right to a proper test.’”  Brown v. Hurley, 124 \nN.C. App. 377, 382, 477 S.E.2d 234, 238 (1996) (quoting Mack, 107 N.C. App. at 93, \n418 S.E.2d at 689). \n{59} In this case, Burgess put AMEX’s Notice of Designation to the proper test \nthrough the procedure set out in section 7A–45.4(e) of the North Carolina General \nStatutes.  Viewed objectively, however, I can conceive of no proper purpose to be \nserved by Burgess’s filing of a separate Rule 11 Motion on the same issue.  I find \n \ninstead that Burgess’s purpose was to harass AMEX, unnecessarily delay these \nproceedings, and needlessly increase the cost of litigation. \n{60} Accordingly, the Court will award AMEX sanctions.  I direct AMEX to file \nan affidavit of its reasonable fees and expenses incurred in responding to that part \nof Burgess’s Motion related to the Notice of Designation.  AMEX shall file its \naffidavit within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order.  Burgess shall have ten (10) \ndays from the date of service to file a response.  Any reply by AMEX shall be filed \nwithin five (5) days of the service of Burgess’s response. \n{61} Finally, I recognize that Burgess appears in this case pro se.  Rule 11, \nhowever, “does not exempt pro se litigants from its operation; a pro se litigant has \nthe same duties under [the Rule] as an attorney.”  In re Weiss, 111 F.3d 1159, 1171 \n(4th Cir. 1997) (applying federal bankruptcy version of Rule 11). \n{62} The Court will, however, consider Burgess’s pro se status in fashioning an \nappropriate sanction in this case.  See Blue v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 914 F.2d 525, 546 \n(4th Cir. 1990) (stating that trial court may “reflect upon equitable considerations in \ndetermining the amount of the sanction”). \n \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n{63} For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES Burgess’s Motion for \nSanctions and GRANTS AMEX’s Motion for Sanctions. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 29th day of June, 2007. \n \n      \n "
