The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motions. \n3. On March 13, 2018, Plaintiff initiated this action by filing its Verified \nComplaint.  (ECF No. 3.)  \n4. This action was designated as a mandatory complex business case by order \nof Chief Justice Mark Martin of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated April 26, \n2018, (ECF No. 6), and was assigned to the undersigned by order of then -Chief \nBusiness Court Judge James L. Gale dated April 30, 2018, (ECF No. 2). \n5. The Verified Complaint named Wayne Bach (“Bach”) as a Defendant in his \ncapacity as administrator of the estate of Clyde L. Lail (“Clyde’s Estate”).  (Compl. 1, \nECF No. 3.)  However, on March 27, 2018, Defendant Noble was appointed \nadministrator of Clyde’s Estate in lieu of Bach.  (Verified Am. Compl. ¶ 4, ECF No. 8 \n[“Am. Compl.”].)  Accordingly, on May 2, 2018, Plaintiff filed its Amended Verified \nComplaint substituting Noble for Bach as a defendant.  (Compare Compl. 1, with Am. \nCompl. 1.)  The Amended Complaint asserts c laims against the Lail Defendants for \nviolation of the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (“fraudulent transfer claim”) and \nasserts claims against all Defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, \nand unfair and deceptive trade practices (“UDTP”).  (Am. Compl. 4–13.) \n6. The Lail Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was filed on May 25, 2018 pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(1) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”).  (ECF No. \n15.)   \n7. On May 31, 2018, Noble filed her motion to dismiss, joining the arguments \nraised by the Lail Defendants pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and asserting additional \narguments for dismissal of the claims against Clyde’s Estate pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6).  (ECF No. 22.)  Because Noble is being sued in her capacity as administrator \nof Clyde’s Estate and joins the Lail Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, references to the \nLail Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss shall include Noble.  \n8. Briefing on the Motions is complete and the Court held a hearing on the \nMotions on August 2, 2018 at which all parties were represented by counsel. \n9. The Motions are ripe for resolution. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n10. The Court does not make findings of fact on the Motions, but recites only \nthose facts that are relevant and necessary to the Court’s determination of the \nMotions. \n11. Plaintiff Associated Hardwoods, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) is a North Carolina \ncorporation with its principal office in Granite Falls.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 1.) \n12. Gary, Susan, David, Cathleen, 1 and Clyde (who passed away before the \ncommencement of this litigation) (collect ively, the “Lail Defendants”) were directors \nof Quaker Furniture, Inc. d/b/a Studio Q Furniture (“Quaker”), a North Carolina \ncorporation that manufactured furniture.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 10.)  Gary, David, and Clyde \n(during his life) were also shareholders and officers of Quaker at certain times.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 10.) \n13. For years prior to 2016, Plaintiff supplied Quaker with dry kiln hardwood \nlumber to be used by Quaker in its furniture business.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff \nwould fill Quaker’s orders and later subm it invoices to Quaker requesting payment \nfor the lumber previously delivered.  (Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. 2 to Ex. A, ECF No. \n15.1.)  Plaintiff did not secure the debt owed to it by Quaker.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 9.) \n14. By May 31, 2016, Quaker was insolvent on a b alance sheet and cash flow \nbasis and could not pay its bills as they became due in the regular course of business.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 14.)  Notwithstanding Quaker’s financial condition, the Lail \nDefendants, on behalf of Quaker, continued to order lumber from P laintiff.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 15.a.) \n15. Around August 22, 2016, Gary, David, and Clyde sold their shares in \nQuaker and the assets of Quaker for inadequate consideration to Defendant McNeil \n& Partners, LP (“McNeil & Partners”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.c.)  Defendant Edwa rd \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff’s original and amended complaints misname Cathleen as “Catherine C. \nLail.”  (Compl. 1; Am. Compl. 1.)  Because Cathleen has not challenged that she was \nproperly served with process or the Court’s jurisdiction over her, the Court sees no \nneed to require the Amended Complaint to be further amended at this time. \nJoseph McNeil, Jr. (“McNeil,” together with McNeil & Partners, the “McNeil \nDefendants”) is the general partner of McNeil & Partners and became an officer and \nthe sole director of Quaker following the stock transfer.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6, 11.)  \nThereafter, none of the Lail Defendants were involved with Quaker, except for Gary, \nwho remained an officer of Quaker.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10–11.) \n16. Plaintiff alleges that the Lail Defendants’ sale of their Quaker shares and \nQuaker’s assets was a leveraged buyout for which no consideration passed to the Lail \nDefendants or Quaker for the benefit of Quaker’s creditors.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.c, g –\nh.)  In addition, Plaintiff alleges that the Lail and McNeil Defendants engaged in \nunwritten side agreements whereby McNeil would refinance Quaker’s equipment and \nmachinery to pay Quaker’s existing secured obligations guaranteed by the Lail \nDefendants.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.f.)  Plaintiff further alleges that the McNeil \nDefendants, who had no experience in the furniture industry, stripped Quake r of its \nworking capital and equity by paying themselves and McNeil’s other businesses \nexorbitant fees, salaries, and cash withdrawals.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.d–e.) \n17. At the time of the sale, Quaker had assets in excess of its secured liabilities \nthat exceeded $1  million, which could have been distributed to unsecured creditors \nhad the Lail Defendants wound up Quaker’s affairs instead of selling their shares.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 15.b.)  Plaintiff alleges that the Lail Defendants’ conduct preferred \ntheir interest over the rights of Quaker’s unsecured creditors, including Plaintiff, and \nwas intended to prevent such creditors from recovering any of Quaker’s assets.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 15.f–h, 18–20.) \n18. After McNeil & Partners purchased the Lail Defendants’ shares of stock in \nQuaker, and McNeil became the sole director, Quaker continued to purchase lumber \nfrom Plaintiff without informing Plaintiff of Quaker’s financial condition.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 30.a.) \n19. For purposes of the Lail  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(1), the Court takes judicial notice of several proceedings involving Plaintiff and \nQuaker.  First, the Court takes judicial notice that on March 13, 2017, Plaintiff filed \na complaint in the General Cour t of Justice, Superior Court Division, Caldwell \nCounty, asserting claims against Quaker for failing to pay for lumber that Quaker \nhad ordered and accepted from Plaintiff.  (Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. A.)  Plaintiff’s \ncomplaint in that action reveals that Plaintiff claimed that Quaker had failed to pay \nfor lumber purchased from approximately November 23, 2016 to February 28, 2017.  \n(Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. A, ¶ 9.)  Attached to that complaint was a report listing \nQuaker’s unpaid invoices, bills of lad ing, and invoices from the alleged three -month \ntime period and showing that Quaker then owed Plaintiff $117,915.62.  (Lail Defs.’ \nMot. Dismiss Exs. 1–3 to Ex. A.)   \n20. Next, the Court takes judicial notice that on August 28, 2017, Quaker filed \na Chapter 11 vo luntary petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western \nDistrict of North Carolina (the “Bankruptcy Action”).  (Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. \nC, ECF No. 15.3.)  Along with twenty-nine other creditors of Quaker, Plaintiff filed a \nproof of claim form in  the Bankruptcy Action on September 5, 2017 asserting that \nQuaker owed Plaintiff $129,742.06 for unpaid invoices from November 23, 2016 \nthrough February 28, 2017.  (Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. B, ECF No. 15.2.)  Finally, \nthe Court takes judicial notice th at on October 13, 2017, Quaker voluntarily \nconverted the Bankruptcy Action to a Chapter 7 proceeding that is still pending \nbefore the bankruptcy court.  (Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. D, ECF No. 15.4.)  \nIII. LAIL DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. Rule 12(b)(1) \n21. “Rule 12(b)(1) permits a party to contest, by motion, the jurisdiction of the \ntrial court over the subject matter in controversy.”  Swan Beach Corolla, LLC v. Cty. \nof Currituck, 234 N.C. App. 617, 621, 760 S.E.2d 302, 307 (2014).  When it appears \nthat subject matter jurisdiction is lacking, a court shall dismiss the action.  N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(h)(3). \n22. “In order for a court to have subject matter jurisdiction to hear a claim, the \nparty bringing the claim must have standing.”  Newton v. Barth, 788 S.E.2d 653, 659 \n(N.C. Ct. App. 2016); see also Smith v. Forsyth Cty. Bd. of Adjust., 186 N.C. App. 651, \n653, 652 S.E.2d 355, 357 (2007) (“Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court’s \nproper exercise of subject matter jurisdiction, and is a question of law  . . . .” (citation \nomitted)).  “[T]he party seeking to bring [its] claim before the court must include \nallegations which demonstrate why [it] has standing in the particular case  . . . .”  \nCherry v. Wiesner, 245 N.C. App. 339, 346, 781 S.E.2d 871, 877 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016).   \nSince [the elements of standing] are not mere pleading requirements but \nrather an indispensable part of the plaintiff’s case, each element must \nbe supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff \nbears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence \nrequired at the successive stages of the litigation. \nNeuse River Found. Inc. v. Smithfield Foods, Inc., 155 N.C. App. 110, 113, 574 S.E.2d \n48, 51 (2002) (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. \n555, 561 (1992)). \n23. “Unlike a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, consideration of matters outside the \npleadings does not convert the Rule 12(b)(1) motion to one for summary \njudgment . . . .”  Cunningham v. Selman, 201 N.C. App. 270, 280, 689 S.E.2d 517, 524 \n(2009).  Accordingly, a court may consider matters outside the pleadings in \ndetermining whether subject matter jurisdiction exists.  Keith v. Wallerich, 201 N.C. \nApp. 550, 554, 687 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2009); Tart v. Walker, 38 N.C. App. 500, 502, 248 \nS.E.2d 736, 737 (1978).  “However, if the trial court confines its evaluation to the \npleadings, the court must accept as true the plaintiff’s allegations and construe them \nin the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”  Munger v. State, 202 N.C. App. 404, 410, \n689 S.E.2d 230, 235 (2010). \nB. Standing to Assert Claims Against Directors of a Bankrupt \nCorporation \n \n24. The Lail Defendants move for dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(1) arguing that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert claims against  them as \nQuaker’s former officers and directors because such claims belong to Quaker’s \nbankruptcy estate.  (Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss ¶ 9, ECF No. 15.) \n25. “When a corporation enters bankruptcy, any legal claims that could be \nmaintained by the corporation against other parties become part of the bankruptcy \nestate, and claims that are part of the bankruptcy estate may only be brought by the \ntrustee in the bankruptcy proceeding.”  Newton, 788 S.E.2d at 659.  The filing of a \nbankruptcy petition gives the trustee of  the bankruptcy estate full authority over \nclaims belonging to the bankruptcy estate such that “a creditor may not pursue such \na claim unless there is a judicial determination that the trustee in bankruptcy has \nabandoned the claim.”  Keener Lumber Co. v. Perry, 149 N.C. App. 19, 25, 560 S.E.2d \n817, 822 (2002); see also In re Bostic Constr., Inc. , 435 B.R. 46, 60 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. \nJune 25, 2012) (“When a corporation files bankruptcy, the bankruptcy estate succeeds \nto the corporation’s rights against its directors.”).  A North Carolina state trial court \ngenerally lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear claims belonging to a bankruptcy \nestate.  Keener Lumber Co., 149 N.C. App. at 26, 560 S.E.2d at 822.  However, where \na claim is personal to the creditor, such claim is not property of the bankruptcy estate.  \nNewton, 788 S.E.2d at 659.  Whether a claim is personal to a creditor depends on \nstate law.  Id. \n1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud \n26. The Amended Complaint alleges that the Lail  Defendants breached their \nfiduciary duties to Plaintiff by continuing to purchase lumber from Plaintiff without \ndisclosing Quaker’s poor financial condition and then selling their shares of Quaker \nand Quaker’s assets pursuant to agreements with the McNeil  Defendants that \npreferred the Lail Defendants’ interests over the interest of Quaker’s creditors in \nreceiving a pro rata distribution of Quaker’s assets.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff \nalleges that such breaches amounted to constructive fraud.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 16.) \n27. “Under North Carolina law, directors of a corporation generally owe a \nfiduciary duty to the corporation, and where it is alleged that directors have breached \nthis duty, the action is properly maintained by the corporation  rather than any \nindividual creditor . . . .”  Spoor v. Barth, 244 N.C. App. 670, 682, 781 S.E.2d 627, 635 \n(2016) (emphasis omitted).  Accordingly, “creditors . . . of corporations generally may \nnot bring individual actions to recover what they consider their share of the damages \nsuffered by the corporation[.]”  Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 660, \n488 S.E.2d 215, 220 –21 (1997).  “However, where a cause of action is founded on \ninjuries peculiar or personal to [an individual creditor], so that any recovery would \nnot pa ss to the corporation and indirectly to other creditors, the cause of action \nbelongs to, and is properly maintained by, that particular creditor . . . .”  Keener \nLumber Co., 149 N.C. App. at 26, 560 S.E.2d at 822 (quotation marks omitted); see \nalso Newton, 788 S.E.2d at 659–60 (“[C]reditors of a bankruptcy estate may prosecute \nindividual actions against a third party if they can show either (1) that the wrongdoer \nowed [them] a special duty, or (2) that the injury suffered by the [creditors] is personal \nto [them] and distinct from the injury sustained by the corporation itself.” (quotation \nmarks omitted)). \n28. Notwithstanding the general rule that directors owe fiduciary duties \ndirectly to the corporation, a director’s fiduciary duty to creditors arises “where there \nexist circumstances amounting to a ‘winding -up’ or dissolution of the corporation.”  \nKeener Lumber Co., 149 N.C. App. at 31, 560 S.E.2d at 825 (quotation marks omitted); \nsee also Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin , 147 N.C. App. 52, 61, 554 S.E.2d 840, 84 7 \n(2001) (“[A] corporate director can breach a fiduciary duty to a creditor if ‘the \ntransaction at issue [] occurs under circumstances amounting to a “winding -up” or \ndissolution of the corporation.’” (second alteration in original) (quotation marks \nomitted)).  In determining whether circumstances amount to a “winding up” or \ndissolution, our courts consider various factors, which include:  \n(1) whether the corporation was insolvent, or nearly insolvent, on a \nbalance sheet basis; (2) whether the corporation was cash flow insolvent; \n(3) whether the corporation was making plans to cease doing business; \n(4) whether the corporation was liquidating its assets with a view of \ngoing out of business; and (5) whether the corporation was still \nprosecuting its business in good faith, with a reasonable prospect and \nexpectation of continuing to do so. \n \nKeener Lumber Co., 149 N.C. App. at 31, 560 S.E.2d at 825 (citing Whitley v. Carolina \nClinic, Inc., 118 N.C. App. 523, 528, 458 S.E.2d 896 (1995)). \n29. When such circumstances are present, the director “is generally prohibited \nfrom taking advantage of his intimate knowledge of the corporate affairs and his \nposition of trust for his own benefit and to the detriment of the creditors to whom he \nowes the duty” and “must treat all creditors of the same class equally by making any \npayments to such creditors on a pro rata basis.”  Id. at 33, 560 S.E.2d at 826 –27.  \nAccordingly, our Court of Appeals has held that  \na claim brought by a creditor against a director of a corporation, alleging \nthat the director has committed constructive fraud by breaching his \nfiduciary duty owed directly to the creditor, is a claim founded on \ninjuries peculiar or personal to the individual creditor, and, therefore, is \na claim that belongs to the creditor and not the corporation. \n \nId. at 26–27, 560 S.E.2d at 823. \n30. The Lail Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue its claims \nagainst them as directors of Quaker because such claims are property of Quaker’s \nbankruptcy estate and, therefore, must be brough t by the bankruptcy trustee.  (Lail \nDefs.’ Mot. Dismiss ¶ 9.)  The Lail Defendants argue that dismissal is proper because \nPlaintiff has failed to allege facts indicating that the Lail Defendants owed a special \nduty directly to Plaintiff or that Plaintiff s uffered a peculiar or personal injury \ndistinct from the injury suffered by all other creditors of Quaker.  (Lail Defs.’ Br. \nSupp. Mot. Dismiss 3–4, ECF No. 16.) \n31. Plaintiff argues that it has standing to assert claims against the Lail \nDefendants because the Amended Complaint adequately alleges that circumstances \nexisted where Quaker was “winding up” or in dissolution such that the Lail \nDefendants, as directors of Quaker, owed fiduciary duties to Plaintiff, as a creditor of \nQuaker, thereby establishing a special duty owed directly to Plaintiff.  (Pl.’s Resp. Br. \nOpp’n Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 10, ECF No. 28 [“Pl.’s Br. Opp’n”].)  Plaintiff argues, \nrelying on the Court of Appeals’ decision in Keener, that its breach of fiduciary duty \nand constructive fraud claim s, therefore, survive.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n 10.)  Plaintiff \nfurther argues that it has standing because “Plaintiff’s injuries require different \ncompensatory relief than that of any other creditor, and such injuries were caused by \nthe Defendants’ acts of contracting with Plaintiff—no other creditor was involved in \nany lumber transaction between Plaintiff and Quaker[.]”  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Lail Defs.’ \nMot. Dismiss 12–13.)  Although not entirely clear, the Court understands Plaintiff’s \nargument to be that its injur ies are unique because it was the only creditor that \nsupplied lumber to Quaker.  Public filings in the Bankruptcy Action reveal that there \nare numerous unsecured creditors of Quaker who supplied various goods and services \nto the bankrupt company.  Notice to Creditors Holding 20 Largest Unsecured Claims \nat 3, In re Quaker Furniture, Inc. , No. 17 -50583 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Aug. 30, 2017), \nECF No. 6.  \n32. Plaintiff’s standing argument ignores that the Amended Complaint neither \nalleges (1) that Plaintiff was directly o wed a duty separate from the duty the Lail \nDefendants owed to Quaker’s creditors to treat all creditors of the same class equally, \nnor (2) that Plaintiff suffered a unique injury that was not shared by all of Quaker’s \nunsecured creditors. \n33. Instead, Plaintiff’s counsel argued at the hearing that the Lail Defendants, \nas directors of Quaker, had an obligation once the company became insolvent to have \na plan in place to protect creditors’ right to a pro rata distribution of company assets.  \nThe Court is unaware of any obligation on shareholders, officers, or directors who \nseek to exit a corporation to have a “plan in place” to protect a creditor’s right to a pro \nrata distribution. \n34. Rather, as noted above, the fiduciary duty that directors of an insolvent \ncorporation owe to creditors is a duty to “treat all creditors of the same class equally \nby making any payments to such creditors on a pro rata basis” and not to “tak[e] \nadvantage of [the director’s] intimate knowledge of the corporate affairs and his \nposition of trust for his own benefit and to the detriment of the creditors to whom he \nowes the duty[.]”  Keener Lumber Co., 149 N.C. App. at 33, 560 S.E.2d at 826–27. \n35. “[W]hen all creditors of an insolvent or bankrupt corporation share an \ninjury based on a common act, only a receiver or trustee has standing to assert the \ncreditors’ collective claim against directors on behalf of the corporation.”  Angell v. \nKelly, 336 F. Supp. 2d 540, 544 –45 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (citing Underwood v. Stafford , \n270 N.C. 700, 703, 155 S.E.2d 21 1, 213 (1967)).  Indeed, a review of North Carolina \ncases and federal cases applying North Carolina law reveals that an individual \ncreditor typically only has standing to sue directors of a debtor corporation where \nsome misconduct was directed specifically at plaintiff or the directors were alleged to \nhave misappropriated funds that were earmarked for plaintiff.  See, e.g., Angell, 336 \nF. Supp. 2d at 547 (alleged misrepresentations that were made only to plaintiffs and \nwhich induced plaintiffs to take detri mental action were “factually unique to \n[p]laintiffs as among [debtor]’s other creditors” thus conferring standing on \nplaintiffs); In re Midstate Mills, Inc., No. 13-50033, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 3105, at *23–\n24 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Sept. 15, 2015) (unpublished) (standing existed where plaintiffs \nalleged that directors and officers falsely represented to plaintiffs that goods shipped \nwould be paid for and that plaintiffs would be substantially paid when the debtor \ncorporation was sold); Newton, 788 S.E.2d at 661 (customers, vendors, and suppliers \nhad standing to sue debtor corporation’s officer who falsified financial reports and \ndirected corporate staff to fraudulently misrepresent to creditors that the corporation \nwould receive additional funds); Phillips & Jordan, Inc. v. Bostic, 2012 NCBC LEXIS \n36, at *5, *17–19 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 1, 2012) (plaintiff subcontractor had standing \nto assert claims against directors based on allegations that defendants made \npreferential payments for their personal benefit out of construction loan proceeds that \nplaintiff believed would be used to pay its construction costs); see also Snyder v. \nFreeman, 300 N.C. 204, 217, 266 S.E.2d 593, 601 –02 (1980) (plaintiff had individual \nstanding to sue corporate insiders based on allegations that corporate directors failed \nto earmark funds that were to be held specifically for plaintiff apart from corporate \nassets); Lillian Knitting Mills Co. v. Earle, 233 N.C. 74, 75, 62 S.E.2d 492, 493 (1950) \n(individual creditor could maintain claim alleging t hat officers and directors made \nfraudulent misrepresentations directly to that creditor). \n36. Conversely, where a plaintiff -creditor seeks to advance claims that “could \nalso have been pursued by any of [the debtor corporation]’s creditors, the [creditor] \n“lack[s] standing because the claims are property of the bankruptcy estate.”  Angell, \n336 F. Supp. 2d at 545; see also, e.g., M-Tek Kiosk, Inc. v. Clayton , No. 1:15CV886, \n2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67036, at *27 (M.D.N.C. May 23, 2016) (unpublished) \n(allegations of fraudulent transfers that could have been alleged by any of the debtor \ncorporation’s creditors were insufficient to confer standing); Alvarez v. Ward , No. \n1:11cv03, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4557, at *14 –16 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Jan. 13, 2012) \n(unpublished) (plaintiffs lacked standing where the injuries alleged were identical to \nother creditors’ injuries and were caused by the common acts of defendants in \nfraudulently transferring the assets of the company); Underwood, 270 N.C. at 703, \n155 S.E.2d at 213 (allegations  that officers and directors misappropriated corporate \nassets to themselves were wrongs committed against the insolvent corporation). \n37. Plaintiff’s allegations demonstrate that none of the Lail Defendants’ alleged \nconduct was directed specifically toward Pla intiff or treated Plaintiff in a manner \ndifferent from Quaker’s other unsecured creditors.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 15, 33.)  Further, \nPlaintiff’s reliance on Keener is misplaced.  In Keener, defendant-director decided to \nliquidate a struggling corporation’s assets  in order to use the money to pay the \ncorporation’s outstanding debts.  Keener Lumber Co., 149 N.C. App. at 23, 560 S.E.2d \nat 820.  The director used the funds from the liquidated assets to then fully pay, or \nalmost fully pay, existing secured debts and an  unsecured debt to a company for \nwhich defendant was the chief operating officer, president, director, and majority \nshareholder.  Id. at 22–23, 560 S.E.2d at 820–21.  However, no payment was made to \nplaintiff-unsecured creditor.  Id. at 23, 560 S.E.2d at 820 –21.  Thus, the Keener \nplaintiff’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty was premised on allegations that \ndefendant (1) directed the company to continue purchasing goods from plaintiff \nwithout informing plaintiff of the company’s fina ncial status and (2) made \npreferential payments to another unsecured creditor where a duty existed to treat all \ncreditors of the same class equally.  Id. at 32, 560 S.E.2d at 826.  Plaintiff makes no \nallegation that it was treated any differently than othe r unsecured creditors of \nQuaker.  Rather, Plaintiff alleges that the Lail Defendants preferentially paid off \n“existing secured obligations of Quaker guaranteed by the Lail Defendants[.]”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 15.f.) \n38. The Court further finds unavailing Plaintiff’s argument that it has suffered \na unique injury because it was the only creditor who entered into lumber transactions \nwith Quaker.  Plaintiff’s injury is no different than any other unsatisfied creditor of \nQuaker in that Plaintiff seeks to be paid for the go ods it rendered to Quaker just as \nother unsecured creditors seek to be paid for the goods or services they provided to \nQuaker.  Plaintiff does not seek to recover the lumber sold on credit, but the money \nowed to Plaintiff by Quaker for the value of the lumber.  (Am. Compl. 15.)  In fact, the \nAmended Complaint repeatedly refers to unsecured creditors of Quaker as an injured \ngroup of which Plaintiff was a part.  ( See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 15.)  Such allegations \nbelie Plaintiff’s argument that it suffered a uniq ue injury different from that \nexperienced by Quaker’s other unsecured creditors. \n39. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty \nand constructive fraud claims are property of the bankruptcy estate and Plaintiff, \ntherefore, lacks standing. \n40. Even assuming arguendo that Plaintiff’s claims do not belong to the \nbankruptcy estate, Plaintiff lacks standing for another reason —because it cannot \ndemonstrate a concrete injury caused by the Lail Defendants. \n41. Apart from the standing inquiry as i t relates to creditors of a bankrupt \ncorporation, standing more generally “refers to whether a party has a sufficient stake \nin an otherwise justiciable controversy so as to properly seek adjudication of the \nmatter.”  Neuse River Found. Inc. , 155 N.C. App. at 114, 574 S.E.2d at 51.  To \nestablish this more general standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate three elements: \n(1) an injury in fact, i.e., “an invasion of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete \nand particularized and (b) actual or imminent, n ot conjectural or hypothetical;” (2) \nthat the injury is fairly traceable to defendants’ actions; and (3) that the injury will \nlikely be redressed by a decision in plaintiff’s favor.  Strates Shows, Inc. v. \nAmusements of Am., Inc., 184 N.C. App. 455, 460, 646 S.E.2d 418, 423 (2007). \n42. Plaintiff alleges that it was harmed by the Lail  Defendants’ alleged \nbreaches of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud because Plaintiff did not receive its \npro rata distribution of Quaker’s assets as payment for lumber that Plaintiff delivered \nto Quaker.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 15 –16; see also Pl.’s Br. Opp’n 12–13 (arguing that \nPlaintiff’s injuries are unique because each one of Plaintiff’s sales of lumber is \nunique).)  However, the record before the Court demonstrates that Plaintiff has been \npaid for all shipments of lumber that occurred prior to November 23,  2016 as \nevidenced by Plaintiff’s earlier civil suit against Quaker and Plaintiff’s proof of claim \nfiled in the Bankruptcy Action.  (Lail Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. A ¶ 9, Ex. 1 to Ex. A, \nEx. B.)  The Lail Defendants sold their Quaker shares and otherwise cea sed their \ninvolvement with Quaker, except for Gary remaining as an officer, around the time \nof the stock sale on August 22, 2016—nearly three months before the date of the first \ninvoice for which Plaintiff claims entitlement to payment.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10 –11, \n15.) \n43. Therefore, even assuming the Lail Defendants owed and breached a \nfiduciary duty by continuing to purchase lumber from Plaintiff without disclosing \nQuaker’s financial status, the allegations of the Complaint do not establish that \nPlaintiff, as a result, suffered a particular, concrete injury. \n44. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Plaintiff lacks standing to \nassert its claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud against the Lail \nDefendants. \n2. Fraudulent Transfer Claim \n45. Plaintiff alleges as a part of its breach of fiduciary duty claim that the Lail \nDefendants violated the North Carolina Uniform Voidable Transactions Act by \nfraudulently transferring Quaker’s assets to the McNeil Defendants without \nreceiving reasonably equivalent v alue in an attempt to hinder, delay, or defraud \nQuaker’s creditors.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 18–22.) \n46. “[A]ny transfer that fraudulently or unlawfully deprives all creditors of \ntheir right to an insolvent corporation’s assets necessarily gives rise to a cause of \naction shared by those creditors and not unique to any one of them.”  Angell, 336 F. \nSupp. 2d at 546.  Upon reviewing the allegations of the Amended Complaint, the Lail \nDefendants’ alleged misconduct in stripping Quaker of its assets is identical as to all \nof Quaker’s unpaid creditors who experienced the same harm—not receiving payment \nfor goods or services rendered.  Because all of Quaker’s creditors share an injury \nbased on the Lail Defendants’ alleged fraudulent transfers, only Quaker’s bankruptcy \ntrustee ha s standing to assert the creditors’ collective claim against the Lail \nDefendants on behalf of Quaker.  Id. \n47. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert its \nfraudulent transfer claim against the Lail Defendants. \n3. UDTP Claim \n48. Plaintiff alleges that the Lail Defendants engaged in unfair and deceptive \nconduct based on the same factual allegations that Plaintiff alleged in support of its \nbreach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 33.)  As the \nCourt has concluded that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert its breach of fiduciary duty \nand constructive fraud claims because such claims are property of the bankruptcy \nestate, the Court similarly concludes that Plaintiff lacks a basis for standing as to its \nUDTP claim. \n49. Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiff’s UDTP claim should be \ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  \nIV. NOBLE’S MOTION TO DISMISS \n50. In her motion to dismiss, Noble not only joins the Lail Defendants’ Motion \nto Dismiss, but also asserts as a separate basis for her motion that Plaintiff’s claims \nagainst Noble, as Administrator of Clyde’s Estate, should be dismissed pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.  (Noble’s Mot. \nDismiss 1, ECF No. 22.) \n51. Because the Court concluded that the Lail Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nshould be granted, the Court further concludes that Noble’s Motion to Dismiss should \nbe granted to the extent it joins the Lail Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  Having \nconcluded that the Cou rt lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims \nagainst the Lail Defendants, including the claims against Clyde’s Estate, the Court \nneed not, and does not, reach the merits of the additional arguments raised pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(6) in Noble’s Motion to Dismiss.  \n52. As a result, the Court grants Noble’s Motion to Dismiss to the extent it is \npremised on Rule 12(b)(1) and, to the extent it is premised on Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \ndenies the motion as moot.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n53. THEREFORE, based on the foregoing, the Court hereby GRANTS the \nLail Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for lack of standing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).  \nThe Court further GRANTS in part Noble’s Motion to Dismiss, to the extent it joins \nthe Lail Defendants’ Motion to Dism iss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), and DENIES as \nmoot Noble’s Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s \nclaims against the Lail Defendants and against Defendant Noble, in her capacity as \nAdministrator of the Estate of Clyde L. Lail, are dismissed without prejudice.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 6th day of August, 2018. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L.
