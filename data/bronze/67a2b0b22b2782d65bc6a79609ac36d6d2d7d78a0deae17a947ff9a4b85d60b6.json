Confluent Health, LLC, 2018 NCBC 126. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nCOUNTY OF WAKE \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 9321 \n \nDUNN HOLDINGS I, INC. \n(previously DUNN PHYSICAL \nTHERAPY, INC.), a North Carolina \ncorporation, Individually and \nDerivatively on behalf of \nBREAKTHROUGH CARY PT, LLC; \nCHRISTOPHER F. DUNN; and \nTHERESA M. DUNN, \n  \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nCONFLUENT HEALTH LLC, a \nDelaware limited liability company; \nLAURENCE N. BENZ, Manager of \nBreakthrough Cary PT, LLC; \nBREAKTHROUGH CARY PT, LLC, \na North Carolina limited liability \ncompany; MARK F. WHEELER; \nJEFFREY HATHAWAY; and \nBREAKTHROUGH PHYSICAL \nTHERAPY, INC., \n \nDefendants. \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \nCOUNTERCLAIMS \n \nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on Plaintiffs Dunn Holdings I, Inc., \nindividually and derivatively on behalf of Breakthrough Cary, PT, LLC, Christopher \nF. Dunn , and Theresa M. Dunn ’s (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) Motion to Dismiss \nCounterclaims.  (“Motion”; ECF No. 60.)   \nTHE COURT, having considered the Motion, the briefs i n support of and in \nopposition to the Motion, the arguments of counsel at the hearing, and other \nappropriate matters of record, concludes that the Motion should be GRANTED, in \npart, and DENIED, in part, for the reasons set forth below. \nSmith, Anderson, Blo unt, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jernigan, LLP, by J. \nMitchell Armbruster for Plaintiffs Dunn Holdings I, Inc.; Christopher \nDunn; and Theresa Dunn. \n \nStites & Harbison PLLC, by Chadwick A. McTighe (pro hac vice) and \nTimothy D. Thompson (pro hac vice), and Robinson,  Bradshaw & \nHinson, P.A., by Edward F. Hennessey, IV for Defendants Confluent \nHealth LLC; Laurence N. Benz; Breakthrough Cary PT, LLC; Mark F. \nWheeler; Jeffrey Hathaway; and Breakthrough Physical Therapy, Inc. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(6) of the North Caro lina Rules of Civil Procedure (hereinafter, the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure will be referred to as “Rule(s)”).  In this case, the \nCourt only recites those facts included in the counterclaims that are relevant to the \nCourt’s determination of the Motion.  All facts herein are drawn from the allegations \nin Defendants’ counterclaims.  (Answ. and Countercl., ECF No. 59 at CC, pp. 27–38.) \nA. Parties Relevant to the Counterclaims \n2. Defendants Breakthrough Cary, LLC (“Breakthrough Cary”) and \nBreakthrough Physical Therapy, Inc. (“Breakthr ough PT”) are affiliated entities \norganized u nder the laws of North Carolina,  which engage in the business of \nproviding physical therapy treatment to patients at multiple locations acro ss North \nCarolina.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 1–2.)  Breakthrough Cary is a  part of the overall \nBreakthrough PT practice.  (Id.)1 \n                                                 \n1 The allegations in the counterclaims do not contain any further explanation of the corporate \nor other relationship between Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT, and neither party \nhas attempted to explain the exact nature of the relationship in their briefing.  For purposes \nof deciding the Motion, the Court treats Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT as the \nsame entity.  \n3. Defendant Confluent Health, LLC (“Confluent”) is a Delaware limited \nliability company based in Kentucky that acts as a holding company for numerous \nphysical therapy practices, including Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT.  (Id. \nat ¶ 3.) \n4. Defendant Dr. Laurence Benz (“Benz”) is the manager of Breakthrough \nCary and Confluent.  (Id. at ¶ 4.) \n5. Plaintiff Dunn Holdings I, Inc. (“Dunn Holdings”) is a North Carolina \ncorporation owned by Plaintiffs Dr. Christopher F. Dunn (“Christopher”) and his wife, \nTheresa M. Dunn (“Theresa”, collectively “the Dunns”).  (Id. at ¶ 6 .)  In 2014, the \nDunns sold substantially all of the assets of Dun n Holdings to Breakthrough Cary \n(“the Transaction”).  (Id. at ¶ 11.)   The Transaction was accomplished through the \nparties’ execution of an Asset Purchase Agreement.  (“APA”, ECF No. 50.2.)   As a \nresult of the Transaction, Dunn Holdings is a member of, and owns a 20% interest in, \nBreakthrough Cary.  The remaining 80% interest in Breakthrough Cary is currently \nheld by Confluent.2  (Breakthrough Cary Op. Ag., ECF No. 50.1, at p. 30 (hereinafter \n“Operating Agreement”) .)  Dunn Holdings is a p arty to Breakthrough Cary’s \nOperating Agreement.  (Id. at p. 1.) \n6. The APA contains the following provision regarding confidentiality: \n                                                 \n2 The 80% interest was originally held by  PT Development Cary, LLC (“PT Development”).  \nIt is undisputed that PT Development’s interest was later transferred to Confluent. \nFrom and after the Closing, [Dunn Holdings] and [the \nDunns] shall, . . . use its commercially reasonable efforts to \ncause it s or their respective representatives to hold, in \nconfidence any and all information, whether written or \noral, concerning the … Transaction Documents or the \n[Transaction]. \n \n(ECF No. 50.2, at p. 36.) \n \n7. In conjunction with the Transaction, Christopher was emp loyed by  \nBreakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT  under a written Employment Agreement  \nexecuted between Christopher and Breakthrough PT .  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶ 5 ; \nEmployment Agreement, ECF No. 61 at Ex. A.)  The Employment Agreement \nprovided in relevant part as follows: \n[Christopher] shall devote his full business time and effort \nto [Breakthrough PT].  [Christopher] agrees to perform his \nduties hereunder to the best of his ability and at a level of \ncompetency consistent with the position occupied, to act on \nall matters in a manner that is in the best interest of \n[Breakthrough PT], and to use his best efforts, skill and \nability to promote the profitable growth of [Breakthrough \nPT].  The duties and responsibilities of [Christopher] under \nthis Agreement shall incl ude providing physical therapy \nservices to the patients of [Breakthrough PT] , and \nperforming such other duties as may be assigned to \n[Christopher] by [ ] Benz … \n \n(ECF No. 61 at Ex. A, p. 4.) \n \n8. Benz assigned certain responsibilities to Christopher that otherwise \nwould have been performed by Benz as the manager of Breakthrough Cary.  (Id. at \n¶ 8.)  Defendants allege that, by acting on behalf of Breakthrough Cary in a \nmanagerial capacity, Christopher occupied a  position of trust and confidence with , \nand owed fiduciary duties to, Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT.  (Id. at ¶¶ 7–\n8.) \nB. Christopher’s and Dunn Holdings’ alleged wrongdoing \n9. Defendants allege that  Christopher and Dunn Holdings engaged in \nrepeated acts of misconduct during and after Christopher’s time as an employee for \nBreakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 10 –21.)  The alleged \nwrongdoing includes: (1) diversions of Breakthrough Cary’s funds , (2) misuse of \nBreakthrough Cary’s resources, (3) engaging in unauthorized actions; (4) disclosures \nof confidential information; (5) defaming Breakthrough Cary, Confluent, and Benz ; \nand (6) failing to comply with the terms of the Operating Agreement.  (Id.) \ni. Diversions of Funds \n10. Following the Transaction, Dunn Holdings’ accounts receivable became \nthe property of Breakthrough Cary.  (Id. at ¶ 11.)  On June 2, 2014, Dunn Holdings \nentered into an “Interim Billing Agreement” with Breakthrough Cary.  (Id. at ¶ 12; \nInterim Bill. Agr., ECF No. 63.1  (hereinafter “Billing Agreement”) .)  The Billing \nAgreement required Dunn Holdings to collect the accounts receivable and deposit \nthem to an account designated by Breakthrough Cary .  ( ECF No. 59, at ¶ 12 .)  \nHowever, instead of depositing payments received to the Breakthrough Cary \naccount, Christopher diverted them to accounts under his control.  (Id. at ¶ 11.)  The \nBilling Agreement expired on December 31, 2014.  (Id.)  \nii. Misuse of Company Resources \n11. Christopher negotiated a deal between Breakthrough PT and the school \nthat his children attend to provide services to the school at below market rates in an \neffort to obtain personal benefits from the school.  (Id. at ¶ 14.)  Breakthrough PT did \nnot authorize or approve of the arrangement, which inured to its detrim ent and to \nChristopher’s benefit.  (Id.) \niii. Unauthorized Actions \n12. Christopher, unilaterally and without authority, removed a covenant \nnot to compete from the employee contract of at least one of Breakthrough Cary and \nBreakthrough PT’s employees.  ( Id. at ¶ 16.)  The employee has now resigned and \nmade clear her intention to compete with the Breakthrough companies.   \n13. Christopher also, unilaterally and without authority, increased the \ncompensation of certain employees with “full knowledge that [Benz] would not \napprove of the [ ] increases.”  (Id. at ¶ 17.) \niv. Disclosures of Confidential Information \n14. In his pleadings filed in this lawsuit, Christopher disclosed confidential \nfinancial information about Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT, and the terms \nof the Transaction.  Defendants allege the disclosures were made in violation of the \nconfidentiality provisions of the APA.  (Id. at ¶ 19.) \nv. Defamatory Statements \n15. In November of 2017, Christopher intentionally or recklessly made \nrepresentations to various employees “about alleged embezzlement” by Breakthrough \nCary, Confluent, and Benz.  ( Id. at ¶ 20.)   Defendants allege the statements were \ndefamatory.  (Id. at ¶ 45.) \nvi. Failure to comply with the Breakthrough Cary Operating Agreement \n16. In December of 2017, Christopher resigned as an employee of \nBreakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT.  (Id. at ¶ ¶ 5, 56. )  Section 16.8 of the \nBreakthrough Cary Operating Agreement states that “[i]n the event Christopher’s \nemployment with Breakthrough [PT] is terminated for any reason whatsoever, then \nsuch termination of employment shall be deemed as an offer by Dunn [Holdings] to \nsell all of its Membership Interests to [Breakthrough Cary], and [Breakthrough Cary] \nshall purchase such Membership interests.”  (ECF No. 50.1, at pp. 22 –23; ECF No. \n59 at CC, at ¶ 51.)  The Operating Agreement provides that the purchase price shall \nbe “the fair market value” of the transferring member’s in terest as determined by \nagreement among the members within 30 business days of the triggering event.  (ECF \nNo. 50.1, at pp. 21–22.)  If the parties cannot reach agreement, the fair market value \nis determined through a detailed appraisal process.  (Id.) \n17. Following Christopher’s resignation, Breakthrough Cary notified Dunn \nHoldings that it was invoking the provisions of section 16.8, but Dunn Holdings has \nrefused to engage in the process for determining the fair market value of Dunn \nHolding’s interests.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 56–62.)  Breakthrough Cary alleges that \nDunn Holdings has breached the Operating Agreement by refusing to participate in \nthe mandatory appraisal and buyout process.  (Id. at ¶¶ 21, 64 .)  Alternatively, \nBreakthrough Cary asks the Court to declare the rights of the parties under the OA \nand to determine how the appraisal process should occur.  (Id. at ¶ 65.) \nC. Procedural History \n18. Plaintiffs filed their first Complaint in this matter on July 28, 2017.  \n(ECF No. 3.)  Plaintiffs subsequently filed an Amended Complaint on November 6, \n2017.  (ECF No. 7.)  On December 22, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Amend \nComplaint.  (ECF No. 36.)  The Court granted the Motion to Amend Complaint on \nJanuary 30, 2018 and deemed the Second Amended Complaint to have been filed and \nserved upon Defendants on January 30, 2018.  (ECF No. 47.)   \n19. On May 8, 2018, Defendants filed their Answer and  Counterclaims.  \n(ECF No. 59.)  Defendants bring the following counterclaims: (1) breach of co ntract \n(asserted by Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT against Christopher and \nDunn Holdings); (2) breach of fiduciary duty and conversion (asserted by \nBreakthrough Cary against Christopher); (3) defamation and slander per se (asserted \nby Breakthrough Cary, Confluence, and Benz against Christopher); and (4) breach of \ncontract or declaration of rights (asserted by Breakthrough Cary against Dunn \nHoldings). \n20. On June 11, 2018, Plaintiff s filed a Reply to Counterclaim .  (ECF No. \n61.) \n21. On June 11, 2018, Plaintif fs also filed the Motion , along with a \nsupporting brief.  (Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Countercl., ECF No. 62.)  Defendants filed \na response brief in opposition to the Motion on July 6, 2018, (Mem. Opp. Mot. Dismiss \nCountercl., ECF No. 68), and Plaintiffs filed their reply brief on July 19, 2018 (Reply \nSupp. Mot. Dismiss Countercl., ECF No. 70).  The Court held a hearing on the Motion \nat which counsel made oral arguments ,3  and the Motion  is now ripe for \ndetermination.   \nII. ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review  \n22.  In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \ntrue, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some \nlegal theory, whether properly labeled or not.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 N.C. \nApp. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).  North Carolina is a notice pleading state.  \nSee, e.g., Feltman v. City of Wilson, 238 N.C. App. 246, 252, 767 S.E.2d 615, 620 (2014) \n(quoting Wake Cty. v. Hotels.com, L.P. , 235 N.C. App. 633, 646,  762 S.E.2d 477, 486 \n(2014)).  Under the notice pleading standard,  \n[a] complaint sufficiently states a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted when it gives sufficient notice of the events \nor transactions which produced the claim to enable the \nadverse party to understand the nature of it and the basis \nfor it, to file a responsive pleading, and by using the rules \nprovided for obtaining pretrial discovery to get any \nadditional information he may need to prepare for trial. \n \nSpoor v. Barth, 811 S.E.2d 609, 612, 2018 N.C. App. LEXIS 93, at *6 (N.C. Ct. App. \n2018) (quoting Wray v. City of Greensboro, 370 N.C. 41, 45, 802 S.E.2d 894, 898 \n                                                 \n3 At the hearing on the Motion, Defendants abandoned their claim against Christopher for \nconversion.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ conversion claim should \nbe GRANTED. \n(2017)).  In applying this standard, “mere vagueness or lack of detail” is generally not \ngrounds for dismissal.  Krawiec v. Manly , 370 N.C. 602, 619, 811 S.E.2d 542, 554 \n(2018).  Additionally, complaints are to be construed liberally, such that few  fail to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss.  Wray, 370 N.C. at 46, 802 S.E.2d at 898.   \n23.  Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when the \ncomplaint reveals on its face the absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; [or] \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985).  In deciding \na motion to dismiss, the Court should construe the complaint liberally and accept all \nwell-pleaded allegations as true.  Fussell v. N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 364 N.C. \n222, 225, 695 S.E.2d 437, 440 (2010).  The Court, however, is not required “to accept \nas true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S .E.2d 873, 880 (2005) ( citation and quotations \nomitted).  In addition, the Court may consider documents that are the subject of \nDefendant’s Counterclai ms and to which the Counterclaims specifically refer.  \nOberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60, 554 S.E.2d 840, 847 (2001). \n24. Plaintiffs have moved to dismiss the remaining c ounterclaims for  \nbreach of contract (Count I), breach of fiduciary du ty (Count II), defamation and \nslander per se (Count III), and breach of contract/declaratory judgment (Count IV). \nThe Court will consider each claim in turn. \nB. Breach of Contract (Counts I and IV) \n25. Defendants allege the following breaches of contract : (i) breach of \nChristopher’s Employment Agreement  by Christopher ; ( ii) breach of the \nconfidentiality provision of the APA by Christopher and Dunn Holdings ; (iii) breach \nof the Interim Billing Agreement by Dunn Holdings; and (iv) breach of the Operating \nAgreement/declaratory judgment by Dunn Holdings. \n26. Plaintiffs move to dismiss Defendants’ breach of contract claims on the \ngrounds including, inter alia, that the breach of contract claims are not pled with the \nrequisite specificity to state a claim  under the notice pleading standard.  (ECF No. \n62, at pp. 5–10, 15–17.)  Defendants contend that their pleadings satisfy the low bar \nfor alleging breach of contract claims under North Carolina’s notice pleading \nstandard.  (ECF No. 68, at pp. 1–5, 8–10.) \n27. “The elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) existence of a valid \ncontract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, \n26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000).  “[W]here the complaint alleges each of these \nelements, it is erro r to dismiss a breach of contract claim under Rule 12(b)(6).”  \nWoolard v. Davenport, 166 N.C. App. 129, 134, 601 S.E.2d 319, 322  (2004);  see also \nSchlieper v. Johnson 195 N.C. App. 257, 265 –66, 672 S.E.2d 548, 553 –54 (2009) \n(holding that plaintiff’s breach of contract claim survived a 12(b)(6) motion based on \nplaintiff’s allegations that defendant breached the terms of plaintiff’s employment by \nfailing to pay a performance bonus, despite the fact that plaintiff had yet to present \nevidence of a specific agreement under which he was entitled to a bonus);  Barbarino \nv. Cappuccine, Inc., 219 N.C. App. 400, 722 S.E.2d 211, 2012 N.C. App. LEXIS 305, \nat *5 –9 (N.C. Ct. App. 2012) (unpublished) ( holding that the trial court erred in \ndismissing defendant’s breach of contract counterclaim as “conclusory” because \nplaintiff’s complaint, even if vague and lacking detail, had alleged a valid contract \nand a breach of that contract).      \ni. Breach of the Employment Agreement \n28. Defendants allege Christopher breached the Employment Agreement by \nfailing to “perform his duties competently and to act in the best interests of \nBreakthrough [PT] ,” in violation of the “best efforts” provision of Christopher’s \nEmployment Agreement.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 9, 23–24.)  Defendants allege that \nChristopher violated “contractual duties to Breakthrough [PT]” by “altering employee \nagreements without authorization to do so in a manner detrimental to Breakthrough \nPhysical Therapy, [ ] authorizing compensation increases without authority to do so, \nand [ ]  negotiating improper and unauthorized agreements  . . . that benefited \n[Christopher] and his family to the detriment of Breakthrough [PT].”  (Id. at ¶ 24.) \n29. Defendants contend that the claim for breach of Employment \nAgreement should be dismissed because it is lacking in detail and “ does not \nspecifically allege how or whether Dr. Dunn breached [the ‘best efforts’] provision.”  \n(ECF No. 62, at p. 6.)  The Court disagrees.  While the allegations are bare-boned, the \nCourt concludes, for the purposes of this Motion, that Defendants ’ allegations meet \nthe low bar  for breach of contract claims  set by North Carolina’s notice pleading \nstandard.  Defendants have alleged the existence of a contract between Christopher \nand Breakthrough PT—the Employment Agreement—and also pointed to several \nspecific actions—diverting funds, amending employee agreements, negotiating \nagreements that harmed Breakthrough PT—that Defendants contend breached the \n“best efforts” provision of the agreement.  Defendants’ allegations are detailed enough \nto enable Plaintiffs to answer and prepare for trial, which is all North Carolina’s \nnotice pleading standard requires.   \n30. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaim for \nbreach of the employment contract for failure to state a claim should be DENIED.  \nii. Breach of the Confidentiality Agreement \n31. Defendants allege that Christopher and Dunn Holdings violated \ncontractual duties of confidentiality that they owed to Breakthrough Cary and \nBreakthrough PT pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, \n¶¶ 19, 25 –26.)  Plaintiff argues that the counterclaim fails because Defendants did \nnot “identify what confidential information was divulged” or allege how the sharing \nof confidential information constituted a breach of any confidentiality provision.  \n(ECF No. 62, at p. 7.)  \n32. In relevant part, Defendants allege that Christopher and Dunn \nHoldings breached the  confidentiality provision of the  APA by sharing  “detailed \nfinancial information about Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough  [PT]” and other \ninformation about the Transaction, in the public record in this action without making \nefforts to preserve the confidentiality of the information .  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 19, \n27–38.)  Thus, the Defendants have alleged the existence of a valid contract between \nChristopher, Dunn Holdings,  and Breakthrough Cary —the Asset Purchase \nAgreement—and specific conduct which  allegedly breached the  confidentiality \nprovision in the  contract—the sharing of detailed financial information  from the \nAgreement in the public record  without making an effort t o keep it confidential .  \nAgain, while Defendants’ allegations are minimal, they are sufficient to state a claim \nfor breach of contract under North Carolina’s notice pleading standard.  The \nallegations give Plaintiffs “ sufficient notice of the events or transactions which \nproduced the claim [and]  enable [Plaintiffs] to understand the nature of it and the \nbasis for it, [and] to file a responsive pleading . . . .”  Spoor, 811 S.E.2d at 612 (citation \nand quotations omitted).  Specifically, Plaintiffs can review the Asset Purchase \nAgreement and their Complaint to determine what information, if any, from the APA \nthey disclosed in the Complaint. \n33. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaim for \nbreach of the confidentiality provision in the APA should be DENIED. \niii. Breach of the Interim Billing Agreement \n34. Defendants allege that Dunn Holdings breached the Billing Agreement \nbetween by failing to bill, collect, and deposit funds from the business in specified \nbank accounts on behalf of Breakthrough Cary. (ECF No. 59 at CC, at ¶¶ 13, 27–29.)  \nPlaintiffs assert that Defendants’ breach of contract claim should be dismissed \nbecause it was brought outside of the three year statute of limitations applied to \nbreach of contract claims pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52.  (ECF No. 62, at pp. 9–\n10.) \n35. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52(1) requires that claims for breach of contract be \nfiled within three years.  The statute of limitations begins to run upon the breach of \nthe contract.  Abram v. Charter Medical Corp.. Of Raleigh, 100 N.C. App. 718, 721, \n398 S.E.2d 331, 333 (1990).  \n36. The Billing Agreement, pursuant to its own terms, terminated on \nDecember 31, 2014.  (ECF No. 63.1, at p. 1.)  Defendants’ Counterclaim was filed with \nthis Court on June 11, 2018. (ECF No. 59 at CC.)  Accordingly, even assuming \narguendo that there was in fact a breach of the Billing Agreement by Dunn Holdings \nand assuming further that said breach occurred on December 31, 2014, the very last \nday the Billing Agreement was in effect, Defendants’ Counterclaim was still filed well \noutside of the 3 year statute of limitations applicable to Defendants’ claim under N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 1-52.  \n37. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaim for \nbreach of the Billing Agreement should be GRANTED. \niv. Breach of the Operating Agreement \n38. Defendants allege that Dunn Holdings has violated its Operating \nAgreement by refusing to proceed with the appraisal and sale of its membership \ninterest in Breakthrough Cary.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶ 51.)  Article 16.8 of the \nOperating Agreement provides that if Christopher’s employment with Breakthrough \nCary is “terminated for any reason whatsoever,” then Dunn Holdings will be \nconsidered to have offered to sell all of its membership interest in Breakthrough Cary, \nand Breakthrough Cary will purchase that interest at a price determined pursuant \nto Article 16.3 of the Operating Agreement.  (ECF No. 50.1, at pp. 22–23.)  \n39. Defendants allege and Plaintiffs admit that Christopher terminated his \nemployment with Breakthrough Cary in December of 2017, triggering Dunn \nHoldings’ obligation to sell its membership interest in Breakthrough Cary.  (ECF No. \n59 at CC, ¶¶ 56–57; ECF No. 62, at p. 15.)  Under Article 16.3, Dunn Holdings had \n30 days to agree to a purchase price for its interest with Breakthrough Cary or begin \nan appraisal process to determine the price of that interest.  (ECF No. 18, at p. 21.)  \nDefendants allege that Dunn Holdings has not agreed to a purchase price under \nArticle 16(a), or, in the alternative, selected an appraiser as required under Article \n16.3(b), placing Dunn Holdings in violation of the Operating Agreement.  (ECF No. \n59 at CC, ¶¶ 56–60.)  Defendants allege Dunn Holdings’ refusal to participate in the \nprocess for determining the purchase price is a breach of the Operating Agreement.  \n(Id. at ¶ 64.)  In the alternative, Defendants allege if the Court “were to conclude that \na breach has not yet occurred, it is apparent that there is a dispute between \nBreakthrough Cary and Dunn Holdings as to the proper interpretation of the \noperating agreement and how the appraisal process is to proceed. Accordingly, \npursuant to N.C. Gen Stat. §§ 1-253 et seq., a declaration of rights is appropriate to \ndetermine how the appraisal process is to occur under the operating agreement.”  (Id. \nat ¶ 65.) \n40. In response, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants have failed to allege a \nspecific breach of the Operating Agreement and that Defendants have gone too far in \nrequesting that the Court order Plaintiffs to comply with the appraisal process or \nissue a declaration of the respective parties’ rights under the Operating Agreement.  \n(ECF No. 62, at pp. 15–17.) \n41. As an initial matter, at the motion to dismiss stage the Court will not \nconsider whether a breach of the Operating Agreement has, in fact, already occurred, \nbut determines only whether or not the underlying cause of action should survive \ndismissal.  \n42. Defendants’ allegations that Dunn Holdings breached the Operating \nAgreement are sufficient both to provide notice to the Plaintiffs to enable them to \nanswer and prepare for trial and also to state a claim for breach of contract. \nDefendants, by pointing to the Operating Agreement, have properly alleged the \nexistence of a contract between Plaintiffs and Defendants.  Defendants explain, step \nby step, how they believe Christopher triggered Article 16 of the Operating \nAgreement by resigning from Breakthrough Cary, what requirements they believe \nthat resignation imposed on Dunn Holdings pursuant to the Operating Agreement, \nand how Dunn Holdings’ subsequent behavior allegedly breached that Operating \nAgreement.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 56–64.)  Accordingly, the Court concludes that \nDefendants have provided Plaintiffs with sufficient notice to satisfy the notice \npleading standard and adequately pled their breach of contract claim as required to \nsurvive dismissal at this stage of the case. \n43. Therefore, the Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaims \nfor breach of the Operating Agreement and for declaratory judgment should be \nDENIED. \nC. Breach of Fiduciary Duties  \n44. Breakthrough Cary claims Christopher owed, and breached, fiduciary \nduties to Breakthrough Cary.  (Id. at ¶¶ 33–41.)  Defendants claim that Christopher \nowed fiduciary duties as a result of the nature of Christopher’s position with \nBreakthrough Cary and the managerial responsibilities assigned to Christopher by \nBenz.  (Id. at ¶ 34.).  Christopher argues in response that he was not an employee of \nBreakthrough Cary, but rather of Breakthrough PT, and that the duties he performed \non behalf of the company did not create a fiduciary duty as a matter of North Carolina \nlaw.  (ECF No. 62, at p. 10.) \n45. To establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must show: \n“(1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship; (2) a breach of that duty; and (3) the \nbreach proximately caused plaintiff’s injury.”  Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 749 \nS.E.2d 262, 268 (2013).  A fiduciary relationship arises when “there has been a special \nconfidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good \nfaith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence[.]”  Dalton \nv. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651–52, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001) (quoting Abbitt v. Gregory, \n201 N.C. 577, 598, 160 S.E. 896, 906 (1931)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Such \na relationship “extends to any possible case in which a fiduciary relationship exists \nin fact, and in which there is confidence reposed in one side, and resulting domination \nand influence on the other .”  Id. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at 707 –08 (quoting Abbitt, 201 \nN.C. at 598, 160 S.E. at 906 (emphasis in original)). \n46. In the employment context, the mere existence of an employer-employee \nrelationship is insufficient to give rise to a fiduciary duty.  Id. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at \n708 (quoting King v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. C o., 157 N.C. 44, 62 –63, 72 S.E. 801, 808 \n(1911)) (“Under the general rule, ‘the relation of employer and employee is not one of \nthose regarded as confidential.’”) ; Austin Maint. & Constr., Inc. v. Crowder Constr. \nCo., 224 N.C. App. 401, 410, 742 S.E.2d 535, 542 (2012) (finding no breach of fiduciary \nduty because “any confidence that Plaintiff reposed in [employee] consisted of nothing \nmore than relying on him to competentl y perform his assigned duties”).   Rather, \n“where an employee is neither an officer nor a director, extraordinary circumstances \nare necessary to impose a fiduciary duty arising out of the employment relationship.”  \nSoutheast Air Charter, Inc. v. Stroud, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nAug. 17, 2015) (citing Dalton, 353 N.C. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at 708 ).  These \n“extraordinary circumstances” are present when an employer is “subjugated to the \nimproper influences or domination of his employee.”  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 652, 548 \nS.E.2d at 708; see also DSM Dyneema, LLC v. Thagard , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 50, at \n*21–22 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 12, 2015) (holding that the plaintiff failed to allege “the \nextraordinary or special type of employer -employee relationship that gives rise to a \nfiduciary duty” because the facts pleaded did not “allege that Thagard enjoyed the \nsort of domination or influence over DSM that our courts have found necessary to \ncreate a fiduciary duty”).  For example , the special circumstance of a fiduciary \nrelationship can arise  “‘when [the employee] figuratively holds all the cards —all \nthe financial power or technical information .’”  Crumley & Assocs., P.C. v. Charles \nPeed & Assocs., P.A. , 219 N.C. App. 615, 621, 730 S.E.2d 763, 767 (2012) (quoting  \nBroussard v. Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, 155 F.3d 331, 348 (4th Cir. 1998)). \n47. Preliminarily, for the reasons note d earlier in this Order and Opinion, \nthe Court will not consider Defendants’ argument that Christopher could not have \nowed fiduciary duties to Breakthrough Cary because his employment wa s with \nBreakthrough PT and not Breakthrough Cary.  Defendants allege that Breakthrough \nPT is “affiliated with Breakthrough Cary” and “is a part of the overall Breakthrough \n[PT] practice.”  (ECF No. 59 at CC,  ¶ 2.)  The issue of whether Breakthrough Cary \nand Breakthrough PT should be treated as one and the same should be determined \nafter further development of the facts in this matter. \n48. Defendants do not allege that Christopher was a manager , officer, or \ndirector of Breakthrough Cary.  Rather, Defendants allege only that Christopher was \nan employee of Breakthrough Cary with management responsibilities including some \n“that otherwise would be performed by the manager of [Breakthrough Cary].”  (Id. at \n¶¶ 8, 34 .)  However, the allegations come nowhere close to the level necessary to \ndescribe the type of managerial authority that would place Christopher in a position \nof domination and influence over Breakthrough Cary.  While Defendants allege that \nChristopher “held a position of trust and confidence with Breakthro ugh Cary giving \nrise to fiduciary duties to the company,” they do not allege any facts showing that he \ndominated or  influenced the company, or otherwise held “ all the cards —all \nthe financial power or technical information.”  Crumley & Assocs., P.C., 219 N.C. App. \nat 621, 730 S.E.2d at 767 (quotation omitted); see also Abbitt, 201 N.C. at 598, 160 \nS.E. at 906 (finding that a fiduciary relationship only exists where it is shown that \none party was in a position of dominance and influence over the other ).  To the \ncontrary, Defendants allege that Benz was the manager of Breakthrough Cary, and \ndo not allege that Benz lacked access to financial and other information necessary to \noversee the company’s business. \n49. The facts alleged in Defendants’ Counterclaim do not support \nDefendants’ allegation that Christopher owed fiduciary duties to Breakthrough Cary.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Breakthrough Cary’s counterclaim for \nbreach of fiduciary duty should be GRANTED. \nD. Defamation and Slander Per Se \n50. Breakthrough Cary, Confluent, and Benz assert a claim for defamation \nand slander per se against Christopher.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 42–48.)  In support \nof the claim they allege “[u]pon information and belief . . . in November 2017, Dr. \nDunn made representations to various employees about alleged embezzlement by \nthese parties.”  (Id. at ¶ 20.)  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ allegation amounts to \nno more than a legal conclusion, is too vague to satisfy the pleading standard for \ndefamation, fails to identify the specific statement made by Christopher needed to \nserve as the basis for their slander per se claim, and, finally, that to the extent \nDefendants’ claim is based on statements about Defendants’ overcharging of \nPlaintiffs for expenses, the statements would be true and therefore not defamatory \nor slanderous.  (ECF No. 62, at pp. 12–13.) \n51. To state a claim for defamation, a plaintiff must allege that the \ndefendant made false, defamatory statements concerning the plaintiff, which were \npublished to a third person, thereby causing injury to the plaintiff’s reputation.  Boyce \n& Isley, PLLC v. Cooper , 153 N.C. App. 25, 29, 568 S.E.2d 893, 897 (2002).   \n“[P]ublications or statements which are susceptible of but one meaning, when \nconsidered alone without innuendo, colloquium, or explanatory circumstances, and \nthat tend to ‘disgrace and degrade the party or hold him up to public hatred, \ncontempt, or ridicule, or cause him to be shunned and avoided’ are defamatory per \nse.”  Andrews v. Elliot, 109 N.C. App. 271, 274, 426 S.E.2d 430, 432 (1993) \n(quoting Flake v. Greensboro News Co., 212 N.C. 780, 786, 195 S.E. 55, 60 (1938)).  \nStatements constituting slander per se include oral statements to a third party which \namount to (1) an accusation that the plaintiff committed a crime involving moral \nturpitude; (2) an allegation that impeaches the plaintiff in his trade, business, or \nprofession; or (3) an imputation that the plaintiff has a loathsome disease.  Boyce & \nIsley, PLLC, 153 N.C. App. at 29–30, 568 S.E.2d at 898 (quotations omitted). \n52. When pleading a claim for defamation, the alleged defamatory \nstatements made by the defendant must be identified “with sufficient particularity to \nenable the court to determine whether the statement was defamatory.”  Stutts v. Duke \nPower Co., 47 N.C. App. 76, 84, 266 S.E.2d 861, 866 (1980); see also Addison Whitney, \nLLC v. Cashion, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 111, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 1, 2017) (stating \nthat claims for defamation are subject to heightened pleading requirements and must \nbe recited in the complaint “verbatim or with sufficient particularity to enable the \ncourt to determine whether the statement was defamato ry” (citation and quotations \nomitted)).  This court has interpreted th e heightened pleading standard  to require \nthe claimant to allege “‘who said what to whom, as well as when and where the \ndefamatory statements were made.”’  Addison Whitney, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 111, \nat *15 (quoting Gosnell v. Reid, No. 5:14CV179-RLV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96878, \nat *21 (W.D.N.C. July 24, 2015),  aff'd by Gosnell v. Catawba Cty. , 646 F. App’x 318 \n(4th Cir. 2016)).  Where such particularity is lacking, courts will dismiss claims for \ndefamation for failure to state a claim.  See id. at *15–17 (dismissing defendants’ \ncounterclaim for defamation because they failed to identify who made the allegedly \ndefamatory statements, who the statements were made to, or when or where the \nstatements were made);   Izydore v. Alade , 242 N.C. App. 434, 446, 775 S.E.2d 341, \n350 (2015) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff’s defamation claims because plaintiff \nfailed “to identify with any degree of specificity the allegedly defamatory remarks \nmade by [defendants], either specifically or in substance”). \n53. The Court concludes that Defendants have sufficiently alleged a claim \nfor defamation and slander per se to survive the motion to dismiss.  Again, while the \nallegations underlying this claim are not a model of particularity, Defendants allege \nthat Christopher made the alleged defamatory statements in November 2017 to other \nemployees of Breakthrough Cary.  In addition, Defendants allege that Christopher \nmade statements “accus[ing]” Breakthrough Cary, Confluent, and Benz “of \nembezzlement.”  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶ 43.)  This satisfied the requirement that the \ndefamatory statement be made with “sufficient particularity to enable the court to \ndetermine whether the statement was defamatory.”   Stutts, 47 N.C. App. at 84, 266 \nS.E.2d at 866.  Furthermore, a false statement that a party has embezzled can be \ninterpreted as “an accusation that the plaintiff committed a crime involving moral \nturpitude” or “an allegation that impeaches the plaintiff in his trade, business, or \nprofession.”  Boyce & Isley, PLLC, 153 N.C. App. at 29–30, 568 S.E.2d at 898. \n54. Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants’ defamation claim fails because \nthe alleged statements by Christopher were true bears little consideration.  \nDefendants have alleged that the statements were false.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 20, \n43.)  In support of their argument Plaintiffs claim that “[e]veryone admits that \nBreakthrough Cary was overcharged expenses to some extent; the amount of those \novercharges is what is in dispute.”  (ECF No. 62, at p. 13.)  However, there is no \nallegation in the counterclaims that the statements were true, or any facts pleaded \nfrom which the Court could conclude that they were true, and Plaintiff does not direct \nthe Court to any such allegations.  Plaintiffs’ argument must fail. \n55. Accordingly, since Defendants have pleaded their counterclaim for \ndefamation and slander per se with sufficient particularity, Plaintiffs’ motion to \ndismiss Defendants’ claim for defamation and slander per se should be DENIED. \nIII. CONCLUSION \n56. THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED, in part, \nand DENIED, in part, as follows: \n1. Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaim for conversion is \nGRANTED. \n2. Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaim for breach of the \nemployment contract (Count I) for failure to state a claim is DENIED. \n3. Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaim for breach of the \nconfidentiality provision in the APA (Count I) is DENIED. \n4. Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss Defendants’ counterclaim for breach of the \nBilling Agreement (Count I) is GRANTED. \n5.
