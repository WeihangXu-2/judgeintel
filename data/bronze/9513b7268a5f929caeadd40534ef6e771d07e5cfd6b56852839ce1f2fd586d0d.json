INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION    \n    \n {2} The Motion raises the central issue of whether Plaintiffs Dr. Robert G. \nDeyton (“Dr. Deyton”) and his wife Yvonne Deyton (“Mrs. Deyton”) (collectively, “the \nDeytons”) may by their action filed on June 1, 2010 recover from Defendant Multi-\nFinancial Securities Corporation (“MFSC”) because of the theft of several hundreds \nof thousands of dollars by their son-in-law, Kenneth C. Waters (“Waters”), between \n1996 and 2000 while he was a registered representative of MFSC or its merger \npredecessor, IFG Network Securities, Inc. (“IFG”).  MFSC’s primary argument is \nthat the Deytons’ claims are barred by the statute of limitations because they either \nknew or should have known, as early as September 1996 and no later than 1997, \nfacts adequate to put them on inquiry notice and to trigger the running of the \nstatute of limitations.  The Deytons in turn claim they are entitled to the discovery \nrule which tolls the running of the limitations period and that there are questions of \nfact whether they did not know and should not reasonably be expected to have \nknown of the theft until after Waters committed suicide less than three years before \nthe suit was filed.  MFSC contends that the Deytons are not entitled to the \ndiscovery rule as to claims against MFSC even if they would be entitled to the rule \nas to claims against Waters.  The Deytons contend they have raised facts issues: (1) \nas to whether MFSC independently owed the Deytons fiduciary duties thereby \naffording the Deytons the benefit of the discovery rule; and (2) whether Waters was \nan MFSC employee or agent acting within the scope of his authority so that his \nliability is imputed to MFSC.  The court concludes Plaintiffs have failed to develop \nevidence adequate to impose an independent fiduciary duty on MFSC, or even \nassuming such a duty to demonstrate that it was misused for personal benefit \nadequate to support a claim for constructive fraud as against MFSC, but otherwise, \nthe Parties’ respective positions depend upon contested issues of material fact.     \n \n \nII. II. II. II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY    \n    \n {3} Plaintiffs filed their Verified Complaint (“Complaint”) in New Hanover \nCounty Superior Court on June 1, 2010.  This matter was designated as a \nmandatory complex business case by Order of Chief Justice Sarah Parker dated \nJuly 2, 2010, first assigned to the Honorable John R. Jolly, Jr., and later reassigned \nto the undersigned.   \n {4} Plaintiffs’ Complaint asserted claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary \nduty, and constructive fraud against the Estate of Kenneth C. Waters (“Estate”), \nand also against MFSC.  On August 12, 2010, MFSC filed its Answer to Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint and asserted cross-claims against the Estate.    \n {5} An Entry of Default was entered against the Estate on Plaintiffs’ \nclaims on October 14, 2010 and on MFSC’s cross-claims on July 5, 2011.  There \nwere various third-party claims which have been voluntarily dismissed.     \n {6} On September 14, 2012, MFSC filed the present Motion seeking to \ndismiss all claims asserted against it.  The Motion has been fully briefed, the court \nheard oral argument, and the Motion is ripe for adjudication. \n \nIII. III. III. III. \n STATEMENT OF FACTS STATEMENT OF FACTS STATEMENT OF FACTS STATEMENT OF FACTS    \n    \n {7} The court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion for \nsummary judgment, but examines whether the record establishes uncontested facts \nor an absence of necessary facts adequate to demonstrate that the claims should be \nresolved as a matter of law without the necessity of trial proceedings.  See Hyde Ins. \nAgency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp. , 26 N.C. App. 138, 215 S.E.2d 162 (1975).  The \nfollowing recitation of facts or contentions is not to find facts but to provide context \nfor the court’s ruling.  \n \n \n \nA.  The Parties  \n \n {8} The Deytons are citizens and residents of Pitt County, North Carolina \n(Compl. ¶¶ 1, 2), who maintained investment accounts with Waters while he was a \nregistered representative with MFSC or its predecessor, IFG.  (Compl. ¶¶ 5, 7.) \n {9} Defendant MFSC is a Colorado corporation doing business in North \nCarolina.  (Compl. ¶ 4.)  In January 2004, MFSC acquired and merged with IFG in \na transaction leaving MFSC as the surviving corporation assuming all the assets \nand liabilities of IFG.  (Compl. ¶ 7.) \n \nB. \n The Relationship Between the Deytons and Waters  \n \n   {10} The Deytons have known Waters since his youth, as Waters’ mother \nwas Dr. Deyton’s patient.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 31:9–22.)  The Deytons’ daughter, Kara, \nattended high school with Waters before they were later married in 1991.  (Dr. \nDeyton Dep. 28:16–24, 33:5–23.)  After the marriage, the Deytons enjoyed a close \npersonal relationship with Waters, and Dr. Deyton participated in many activities \nwith Waters, including golfing, hunting, and fishing.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 96:17–\n97:14.)    \n{11} Waters and his wife lived near the Deytons’ home in Greenville, North \nCarolina for several years before relocating to Wilmington in 2000, during which \ntime Dr. Deyton saw Waters several times a week.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 93:21–94:13, \n178:19–25.)  In 1995, as Dr. Deyton was approaching retirement, he established \nseveral investment accounts with Waters who was then a registered representative \nwith IFG.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 35:22–37:1.)  Dr. Deyton claims that he relied on IFG’s \nreputation as well as on his relationship with Waters when deciding to invest with \nIFG.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 36:21–37:24.)  Dr. Deyton spoke with Waters on the phone \non a regular basis and met with him often to discuss his investment accounts.  (Dr. \nDeyton Dep. 166:8–167:3.)  The record shows little or no interaction between the \nDeytons and any other IFG or MFSC representative. \n {12} MFSC acknowledges the obvious family relationship between the \nDeytons and Waters, but contends that there are facts indicating that the Deytons \ndid not depend upon IFG or MFSC with regard to investing.  Rather, they contend \nthat that Dr. Deyton had significant personal financial sophistication that belies \nany assertion that he separately placed the trust and confidence in IFG or MFSC \nnecessary to create a separate fiduciary duty owed by MFSC.  MFSC alleges its \ncontention is further amplified by evidence that Dr. Deyton often asked for \nassurances from Waters when having questions about his accounts but made no \nfurther inquiry of IFG or MFSC.  MFSC points to evidence of Dr. Deyton’s \nbackground including his undergraduate and medical degrees from Duke University \n(Dr. Deyton Dep. 11:7–11); his responsibility for monitoring the retirement fund at \nhis medical practice (Dr. Deyton Dep. 16:6–18:7); his buying and selling individual \nstocks without the use of a brokerage firm (Dr. Deyton Dep. 15:17–16:5); his \npurchase and sale of real estate on several occasions (Dr. Deyton 18:8–19:22); his \noperation of a Christmas tree business (Dr. Deyton 23:9–24:1); and his membership \nin one or more investment clubs that invested in stocks, bonds and other securities, \nand real estate.  (Dr. Deyton 38:15–54:12.)   \n \nC. \n Reports Which MFSC Contends Provided Notice to the Deytons of Waters’  \nMalfeasance  \n    \n {13} Waters handled several accounts for the Deytons in the period from \n1996 to 2009, including Dr. Deyton’s personal account, Mrs. Deyton’s personal \naccount, and the Deytons’ joint account (collectively referred to as “Personal \nAccounts”).  Waters also handled trust accounts and Dr. Deyton’s IRA retirement \naccount.  All losses at issue were from the Personal Accounts.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. \n109:4–13.)  Plaintiffs allege that starting in August of 1996 and continuing through \nNovember 2000, Waters made several unauthorized wire transfers from the \nPersonal Accounts to an account registered to Waters at First Union National Bank.  \n(Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n to Def. MFSC’s Mot. for Summ. J. (hereinafter “Pls.’ Br. in \nOpp’n”) Ex. J; Breton Dep. 268:1–273:14.)  Alleged losses include: (1) $371,500.00 \nfrom Mrs. Deyton’s personal account (3ND-075443); (2) $206,000.00 from Dr. \nDeyton’s personal account (3ND075609); and (3) $128,000.00 from the Deytons’ joint \naccount (3ND075609).  (Breton Dep. 271:13–273:14.)  Waters accomplished these \ntransfers through fraudulent Letters of Authorization (“LOA”) made by cutting and \npasting Plaintiffs’ signatures.  (Breton Dep. 286:18–24, 271:13–272:2, 273:5–14, \n342:11–360:11; Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n Exs. I, J, K; Pinto Dep. 158:2–159:9.)  \n{14} Pershing, LLC (“Pershing”) served as the clearing agency for the \naccounts and provided monthly account statements (“Pershing Monthly \nStatements”).  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Def. Multi-Financial Securities Corp.’s Mot. \nfor Summ. J. (hereinafter “Def.’s Mem. in Supp.”) 6.)  At some point, the Deytons no \nlonger received Pershing statements on the Personal Accounts but continued \nreceiving them on other accounts.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 167:7–168:1, 322:20–323:6.)  \nUnknown to the Deytons, in August 1997, Waters changed the mailing address for \nthe Personal Accounts to a post office box which Waters controlled.  (Breton Dep. \n303:18–23.)  The Parties have divergent views on whether the Deytons received and \nreviewed statements on the Personal Accounts between August 1996 and August \n1997, it being apparently undisputed that they received and reviewed such \nstatements from April 1996 until August 1996. (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. Ex 7; Dr. \nDeyton Dep. 163:15–22.)  It is also clear that the Deytons continued to receive \nmonthly account statements and other documentation from Pershing relating to \ntheir IRA and trust accounts after August 1996.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 167:7–168:1, \n322:20–323:6.)   \n{15} The Pershing documents related to the Personal Accounts include clear \nindications that monies were transferred to a First Union account and that interest \nhad been charged because of borrowing on margin.  The important question is then \nwhether the Deytons received those reports.  Dr. Deyton acknowledges that he did \nnot have an account at First Union and that he would have known that a transfer to \nthis account was improper had he been advised of any such transfer.  (Dr. Deyton \nDep. 161:14–24.)   \n{16} MFSC contends that the record is adequate to determine as a matter of \nlaw that the Deytons are charged with knowledge of the improper transfers no later \nthan September 1997.  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. Exs. 14–16, 18–21.)  Dr. Deyton \nacknowledges that at some point he noticed discrepancies between Pershing reports \nand the separate reports that Waters prepared, but he steadfastly denies ever \nhaving seen any evidence of a transfer from the Personal Accounts to the First \nUnion account Waters controlled.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 157:9–158:7, 185:8–18.)   \n{17} Starting sometime in 1996, Waters prepared and provided the Deytons \nfraudulent portfolio statements on the Personal Accounts in lieu of the Pershing \nMonthly Statements.  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. Exs. C, W.)  The Deytons argue it is \nsignificant that he did so using Centerpiece Software which MFSC knew had been \nused for fraudulent purposes for other customers.  Waters misrepresented the \nDeytons’ account holdings on their statements by not disclosing margin balances \nand overvaluing actual account valuations in amounts in excess of $800,000.  (Def.’s \nMem. in Supp. Ex. W; Breton Dep. 430:22–434:22, 435:7–441:2.)  Dr. Deyton noted \ndiscrepancies between the Pershing reports and those provided by Waters, admits \nhe made inquiry of Waters and accepted his explanations.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 157:9–\n158:7, 185:8–18.)  Apparently, Dr. Deyton never made any further inquiry of IFG or \nMFSC.    \n{18} In addition to denying ever having read any Pershing statement \nindicating an improper transfer, the Deytons forecast evidence they contend is \nadequate to persuade a jury that Waters prevented their having ever seen such \nstatements.  The record discloses that both opened and unopened documents \naddressed to the Deytons’ home address were found in Waters’ possession after his \nsuicide, including Pershing monthly statements on the Personal Accounts that \ndocumented the wire transfers.  (Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n Exs. P, Q, S, T, U; Pinto Dep. \n103:8–122:10, 122:16–128:16, 131:13–140:15.)  MFSC contends but the Deytons \ndeny that some of the pertinent Pershing Monthly Statements had not been taken \nby Waters and were found in the Deytons’ possession.  \n{19} Dr. Deyton points to evidence which he contends supports a \ndetermination that Waters intercepted the statements from the Deytons’ residence \nduring the time when the Pershing statements would have been addressed to the \nDeytons’ personal residence.  Dr. Deyton testified that when Waters lived in \nGreenville from around 1995 to 2000, his office was only 1.5 miles from the Deytons’ \nhome.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 178:16–179:10.)  Julia Wooten (“Wooten”), the Deytons’ \nhousekeeper from 1994 to 2012, testified that while working at the house she \nremembered Waters coming to the house while the Deytons were away on vacation \nand bringing in the Deytons’ mail from the mailbox (Wooten Dep. 15:22–18:17), but \nshe did not mention it to the Deytons when they returned.  (Wooten Dep. 18:18–\n20:6.)  She testified that on another occasion when the Deytons were out of town, as  \nshe arrived for work at the Deytons’ home, Waters came downstairs and told her he \nhad spent the night.  (Wooten Dep. 20:11–22:19.)   \n{20} As further evidence that they should not have been expected to have \ndiscovered Waters’ fraud, the Deytons indicate that their CPA accepted Waters’ \nhandwritten tax information related to their accounts without separately \ndemanding written 1099 forms.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 220:2–221:19, 224:5–18; Farley \nDep. 47:18–58:20.)     \n \nD.  The Deytons Learn of Waters’ Theft From Other Family Members  \n \n{21} In or around April 2009, Waters admitted to stealing money from \nanother Deyton daughter and her husband, Dr. and Mrs. Greg and Nancy Nelson \n(the “Nelsons”).  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 249:9–12, 250:13–21, 246:19–23; 288:14–23; Mrs. \nDeyton Dep. 53:17–58:13; Nelson Dep. 59:15–60:21, 61:22–64:16, 78:2–80:19.)  \nWaters then admitted to creating fraudulent records regarding the Nelsons’ \nholdings and began repayment.  (Nelson Dep. 73:23–74:18; Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n Ex. \nNN.)  Following this disclosure, Dr. Deyton made inquiry of Waters about the \nDeytons’ accounts but again accepted Waters’ assurance that the Deytons’ money \nwas safe without seeking further assurances from MFSC.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 250:13–\n252:16; Mrs. Deyton Dep. 57:20–59:14.)  \n{22} Waters committed suicide in July 2009.  His suicide notes and other \ndocuments state that he had embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the \nDeytons’ Personal Accounts.  (Kara Waters Dep. 51:11–25, 67:1–12; Pls.’ Br. in \nOpp’n Exs. H, QQ, RR, SS, TT, VV, WW.)  The Deytons contend they never saw the \nsuicide notes until after the lawsuit was filed, never discussed their contents with \nKara Waters (Dr. Deyton Dep. 256:8–259:2), and first learned of Waters’ actions \nrelating to their Personal Accounts after Waters’ death.  (Dr. Deyton Dep. 250:22–\n251:5, 128:16–23.)  \n  \nE. \n Waters as a Registered Representative of IFG and MFSC  \n    \n    {23} Waters was terminated as a registered representative for Merrill \nLynch in 1993 for improperly exercising discretion in a client account on three \nseparate occasions.  (Breton Dep. 80:10–81:14.)  Waters then became a registered \nrepresentative for IFG in 1994 and remained until 2004, during which time IFG \nmerged into MFSC.  Waters returned to MFSC in 2006.  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. 3, \nEx. 1.)  Waters and IFG executed a Registered Representative Agreement (“RRA”) \non May 6, 1994 which, among other provisions, recites that Waters was an \nindependent contractor.  The RRA further contains provisions with which Waters \nwas expected to comply.  (Def. Mem. in Supp. Ex. 34.) \n{24} Plaintiffs complain that MFSC or IFG failed to supervise Waters \nadequately and improperly withheld information about Waters’ improper conduct.  \nIn part, they contend MFSC failed to respond when learning that Waters was or \nmight be preparing fraudulent statements using the software program known as \nCenterpiece, which is the same software Waters used in creating the false \nstatements he provided the Deytons.  (Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n 12, 13–15; Breton Dep. \n204:14–208:5; Goselin Dep. 29:18–25.)  Plaintiffs contend that John Goselin, \nappearing as MFSC’s Rule 30(b)(6) designee, admitted that IFG in 2003 had \nknowledge of Waters’ involvement in a fraudulent real estate scam.  (Pls.’ Br. in \nOpp’n 14.)  Plaintiffs allege that IFG knew Waters, or persons for whom he had \nsupervisory authority, used the Centerpiece Software to create fraudulent portfolio \nstatements to obtain mortgage lending from mortgage companies that resulted in \nlitigation.  (Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n 14.)   \n  {25} Waters had his own company, Heritage Investment Advisors, LLC, at \nthe same time he was a registered representative for IFG or MFSC.  This company \nwas registered in North Carolina in 1996, but its registration lapsed in 1998.  (Pls.’ \nBr. in Opp’n Ex. FF.)  In 2001, the North Carolina Secretary of State Securities \nDivision began an investigation into Waters’ possible criminal violation of North \nCarolina Securities Laws by improperly providing investment advice without being \nproperly registered.  (Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n Ex. II.)  The Deytons assert that IFG was \naware of this investigation.  (Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n Ex. II.)     \n \nIV. IV. IV. IV. \n ANALYSIS ANALYSIS ANALYSIS ANALYSIS \n    \nA.  Standard of Review  \n \n{26} Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to the interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits show that no genuine \nissue as to any material fact exists and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2009); \nSpaulding v. Honeywell \nInt’l, Inc. , 184 N.C. App. 317, 320, 646 S.E.2d 645, 648 (2007).  The party seeking \nsummary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a \ngenuine issue of material fact, which may be met by showing that the opposing \nparty cannot prove an essential element of its claim.  DeWitt v. Eveready Battery \nCo. , 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002).  If the moving party meets this \ninitial burden, the opposing party must then present specific facts establishing the \npresence of a genuine factual dispute for trial.  Lowe v. Bradford , 305 N.C. 366, \n369–70, 289 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1982).  In ruling on a summary judgment motion, the \nevidence is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Brown \nv. City of Winston-Salem , 171 N.C. App. 266, 270, 614 S.E.2d 599, 602 (2005).  \n        \nB.  Plaintiffs Have Raised a Sufficient Dispute of Material Fact Adequate to  \nAvoid Summary Judgment That Their Claims Are Time Barred  \n \n1.  There Is an Issue of Fact Whether Plaintiffs Knew or Should Have Known \nof Waters’ Malfeasance Outside the Limitations Period \n \n{27} Different periods of limitation apply to different claims, and the \naccrual of claims, such as fraud or constructive fraud, may be measured from the \ndate that the plaintiff knew or should have known of facts adequate to constitute \nnotice of his claim.  Irrespective of this discovery rule, the Deytons would be time \nbarred as to all claims if they were on notice of their claims earlier than June 1, \n2007 for any claims governed by a three-year statute of limitations or before June 1, \n2000 for claims governed by a ten-year statute of limitations.   \n{28}  “When the statute [of limitations] is pled as an affirmative defense, the \nburden rests on the party asserting a cause of action to remove the bar.”  State \nFarm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Darsie , 161 N.C. App. 542, 547, 589 S.E.2d 391, 398 (2003).  \nThe statutes of limitations for claims of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty are three \nyears, but the beginning of that three-year period may depend on when the \naggrieved party knew of the facts upon which the cause of action is grounded.  N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 1–52(1), (9) (2013).  Discovery adequate to trigger the running of the \nlimitations period means either actual discovery or when the facts should have been \ndiscovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence under the circumstances.  Forbis \nv. Neal , 361 N.C. 519, 524, 649 S.E.2d 382, 386 (2007).  Generally, the question of \nwhen fraud, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should be discovered is a \nquestion of fact for the jury. White v. Consol. Planning, Inc. , 166 N.C. App. 283, 307, \n603 S.E.2d 147, 163 (2004).  However, when the evidence is clear and shows without \nconflict that the claimant had the capacity and opportunity to discover the fraud but \nfailed to do so, the absence of reasonable diligence is established as a matter of law.  \nId.   In some instances, a lack of reasonable diligence may be excused because of a \nrelationship of trust and confidence, but “the principle of leniency does not apply \nwhen an event occurs to ‘excite [ ] suspicion or put [the aggrieved party] on such \ninquiry as should have led, in the exercise of due diligence, to a discovery of the \nfraud.’”  Forbis , 361 N.C. at 386, 649 S.E.2d at 526; see also Piedmont Inst. of Pain \nMgmt. v. Staton Found., 157 N.C. App. 577, 584–85, 581 S.E.3d 68, 73–74 (2003) \n(affirming Judge Tennille’s grant of summary judgment of fraud claim on the basis \nof the statute of limitations).   \n{29} MFSC contends that the Deytons were clearly on notice of facts \nadequate to trigger a duty of due diligence, and they cannot escape being time \nbarred by claiming they reasonably relied on assurances from Waters, particularly \nwhen the evidence is undisputed that Dr. Deyton noticed discrepancies in different \nreports regarding his Personal Accounts.  MFSC then contends that, as a matter of \nlaw, had Plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence they would have discovered the \nbasis of their claims as early as September 1996, and no later than the end of 1997.  \n(Def.’s Mem. in Supp. 12.)   \n{30} The court has grappled with the record in this case.  It has actually \nwritten both this present Order and another draft order granting summary \njudgment against all claims on the basis of the statute of limitations.  Ultimately, \nthe court concludes that the Deytons have forecast evidence adequate to avoid \nsummary judgment on some claims because the court cannot conclude that the \nrecord is sufficiently clear and unequivocal that the Deytons received the Pershing \nMonthly Statements or other documents that disclose the improper transfers which \nbegan in August 1996.  There is certainly evidence upon which a jury could conclude \nsuch receipt, but the Deytons forecast evidence which support a contrary inference \nadequate to present to the jury.  The court agrees with MFSC that had they \nreceived those reports the Deytons would not be excused from further inquiry \nsimply because they trusted Waters and accepted his explanations.     \n{31} The court struggled with Dr. Deyton’s admission that he noticed “quite \nof bit” of discrepancy between the Pershing Monthly Statements and the portfolio \nstatements prepared by Waters.  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. 15; Dr. Deyton Dep. 185:8–\n25.)  However, after reviewing Dr. Deyton’s deposition testimony carefully, the court \nwas unable to discern the exact discrepancies he noticed or to determine clearly that \nthey related to the improper transfers.  The testimony simply is not that precise.  \n(Dr. Deyton Dep. 184:16–185:7, 185:19–25.)  When asked specifically, Dr. Deyton \ndenied ever knowing of a wire transfer from the Personal Accounts.  (Dr. Deyton \nDep. 128:9–23, 161:4–24, 183:20–184:7.) \n{32} The court has also carefully examined MFSC’s argument that certain \nof the Pershing statements between September 1996 and August 1997 must be \npresumed to have been received by the Deytons because they were produced from \nthe Deytons’ own files.  MFSC argues that before year end 1996, prior to the \nPershing statements being redirected to the mail box Waters controlled, Plaintiffs \nwere sent at least 18 documents from Pershing showing unauthorized wire \ntransfers, and that the document production distinguished between those \ndocuments that were found at the Deytons’ home and those documents later found \nat Waters’ home and produced by his widow.  These 18 documents are critical in \nthat they disclose the documents showing the improper transfers were among those \nproduced from the Deytons’ home which includes: (1) seven documents showing \nunauthorized sales of securities in 1997; (2) tax statements revealing margin \ninterest payments in 1996; and (3) account statements showing unauthorized \ntransfers through July 1997.  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. 12–15.)  The Deytons’ counsel at \nargument countered that MFSC incorrectly contends that the record supports a \nfinding that these 18 documents had always been in the Deytons’ possession before \nWaters’ death simply because they were not among the productions by Waters’ \nwidow.  ( See Dr. Deyton Dep. 170:18–172:16, 175:6–17.) \n{33} In sum, the court finds that there is a dispute as to the material issue \nof whether the Deytons received documents adequate to put them on notice of their \nloss prior to June 1, 2007.   \n \n2.  Plaintiffs Have Raised Fact Issues Whether Defendant’s Knowledge \nJustifies an Estoppel Against Use of a Statute of Limitations Defense \n \n{34} Plaintiffs contend that they should not be time barred even if there \nwere facts adequate to trigger their inquiry, because there are also facts that should \nestop MFSC from relying on a statute of limitations defense.  The essential \nelements of equitable estoppel are: \n(1) conduct on the part of the party sought to be estopped which \namounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts; (2) \nthe intention that such conduct will be acted on by the other party; and \n(3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts. The party \nasserting the defense must have (1) a lack of knowledge and the means \nof knowledge as to the real facts in question; and (2) relied upon the \nconduct of the party sought to be estopped to his prejudice. \n \nWhite , 166 N.C. App. at 305, 603 S.E.2d at 162.  Ultimately, application of estoppel \nraises issues of law within the court’s province, but resolving facts necessary to \ndetermine whether the elements of the claim are met fall within the jury’s province.  \nId.        \n{35} Plaintiffs contend that MFSC should be estopped from relying on the \nstatute of limitations because MFSC was aware but did not inform Plaintiffs that: \n(1) prior to hiring Waters, Waters was terminated in 1993 from Merrill Lynch for \nexercising discretion in an account; (2) Waters was acting as an investment advisor \nwhile not properly registered; and (3) MFSC knew that Waters used Centerpiece \nSoftware to create fraudulent statements in an earlier real estate scam.  (Pls.’ Br. in \nOpp’n 48–49.)  MFSC contends that the Deytons cannot properly invoke any \nequitable estoppel defense to being time barred when they clearly admit they were \non notice of discrepancies in statements Waters provided but nonetheless accepted \nhis assurances.  (Reply Br. in Supp. of Def. Multi-Financial Securities Corporation’s \nMot. for Summ. J. (hereinafter “Reply Br.”) 6.)   \n {36} The Court of Appeals has previously allowed the doctrine of equitable \nestoppel to be asserted against an employer where the employee/agent intentionally \nthwarted plaintiffs from discovering his malfeasance, holding that the defense \nultimately depended upon a jury’s determination that the employee was acting \nwithin the scope of his employment.  White , 166 N.C. App. 306–07, 603 S.E.2d at \n162–63.  Here, as discussed below, there are questions whether Waters was acting \nas an agent within the scope of his authority when he provided account statements \nto the Deytons.  On balance, the court concludes that the final resolution of the \nlimitations issue, including whether the Deytons have an adequate basis to assert \nestoppel, should await trial. \n \n3. \n Laches \n \n{37} Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs’ claims should be barred by the \ndoctrine of laches even if they are not otherwise barred by the statute of limitations.  \nFor the equitable doctrine of laches to apply, North Carolina courts have held: \n1) the doctrine applies where a delay of time has resulted in some \nchange in the condition of the property or in the relations of the \nparties; 2) the delay necessary to constitute laches depends upon the \nfacts and circumstances of each case; however, the mere passage of \ntime is insufficient to support a finding of laches; 3) the delay must be \nshown to be unreasonable and must have worked to the disadvantage, \ninjury or prejudice of the person seeking to invoke the doctrine of \nlaches; and 4) the defense of laches will only work as a bar when the \nclaimant knew of the existence of the grounds for the claim. \n \nFarley v. Holler , 185 N.C. App. 130, 132–33, 647 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2007) (citation \nomitted).      \n{38} MFSC asserts that had Plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence, \nWaters’ actions would have been uncovered prior to its merger with IFG and it \nwould not be a party to the lawsuit, and further that documents were destroyed, \nlost, and misplaced over the past 14 years, memories of the relevant witnesses have \nfaded, and some witnesses have died, including Robert Oviatt, the former IFG \nbranch office examiner who conducted IFG’s annual compliance reviews of Waters’ \nbranch office.  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. 17.)  MFSC contends further that even if the \nDeytons did not have knowledge in 1997, they unfairly delayed in taking action \nafter learning that Waters had in April 2009 embezzled money from their daughter, \nNancy Nelson.  (Def.’s Mem. in Supp. 16.)  \n{39} The court believes that the laches issue revolves around the same facts \nimplicated by the statute of limitations issues, and therefore should also be deferred \nto trial.  The court does not believe a laches defenses can be sustained if the \nDeytons first learned of the theft in April 2009.   \n \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Claims of Direct Liability of MFSC Are Not Governed by the  \nDiscovery Rule  \n \n{40} As noted, if the jury finds that the Deytons were reasonably on notice \nof their claims prior to June 1, 2000, then the discovery rule which might toll the \nrunning of the limitations period until such knowledge is irrelevant.  However, if \nthe jury concludes that they did not have such knowledge until later, then the \nDeytons’ right to recover would depend upon their entitlement to the discovery rule.  \nAs against Waters, their fraud claims receive the benefit of the discovery rule.  See \nN.C.G.S. § 1–52(9).  The court here addresses whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim \nof breach of fiduciary duties owed directly by MFSC adequate to invoke the \ndiscovery rule for such a claim.  The court concludes that they have not, and to the \nissue of whether MFSC is liable for its own breach of fiduciary duty to the Deytons, \nMFSC’s motion for summary judgment should be GRANTED.      \n{41} The statute of limitations for claims of fraud and a breach of fiduciary \nduty based on contract is three years.  N.C.G.S. § 1–52(1), (9).  While the cause of \naction based on fraud is not deemed to have accrued until discovery by the \naggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake, when a breach of \nfiduciary duty claim is based on a contract, the claim accrues when the cause of \naction arose.  Id. ; Scarvey v. First Fed. S&L Ass’n of Charlotte , 2000 NCBC LEXIS \n2, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 23, 2000); Marzec v. Nye , 203 N.C. App. 88, 94, 690 \nS.E.2d 537, 542 (2010).  On the other hand, where the fiduciary duty arises from a \nspecial relationship of trust or confidence, the discovery rule may apply so that the \ncause of action does not accrue until the claimant knew or should have known of the \nunderlying facts upon which liability is based.  See, e.g. , Pittman v. Barker , 117 \nN.C. App. 580, 591, 452 S.E.2d 326, 332 (1995);  Dawn v. Dawn , 122 N.C. App. 493, \n495, 470 S.E.2d 341, 343 (1996); Toomer v. Branch Banking & Trust Co. , 171 N.C. \nApp. 58, 68–69, 614 S.E.2d 328, 336 (2005); Tyson v. N.C. Nat’l Bank , 305 N.C. 136, \n142, 286 S.E.2d 561, 565 (1982).    \n{42} The court need not determine whether MFSC owed some fiduciary \nduty arising as a matter of contract because any such claim in now time barred.  To \navoid the statute of limitations, the Deytons must adequately allege a fiduciary \nduty based on a special relationship of trust and confidence.  Such a relationship \narises “wherever confidence on one side results in superiority and influence on the \nother side; where a special confidence is reposed in one who in equity and good \nconscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the \none reposing the confidence.”  White , 166 N.C. App. at 294, 603 S.E.2d at 156 (citing \nVail v. Vail , 233 N.C. 109, 114, 63 S.E.2d 202, 206 (1951)).  Assuming there is an \nadequate factual basis from which to determine such a relationship, the issue is \ngenerally one for the jury; however, summary judgment may be appropriate where \nsuch adequate evidence has not been forecasted.  Carcano v. JBSS, LLC , 200 N.C. \nApp. 162, 178, 684 S.E.2d 41, 53 (2009).    \n{43} In their arguments on whether such a relationship existed, the Parties \ndirected significant attention to whether the accounts were discretionary or \nincluded a “wrap fee,” which Plaintiffs contend would then establish a fiduciary \nduty.  See Geman v. SEC , 334 F.3d 1183, 1189 (10th Cir. 2003) (holding that the \nfirm was held to the standard of a fiduciary with respect to customers charged a \nwrap fee, which is an industry term for an all-inclusive fee to provide brokerage, \nadvisory, and custodial services); see also Fin. Planning Ass’n v. SEC , 482 F.3d 481, \n375 U.S. App. D.C. 389 (D.C. Cir. 2007); 17 C.F.R. 275.202(a)(11)-1 (2005).  Even \nthough there might be some evidence from which other accounts may have included \nsuch a fee, there has been no forecast of evidence adequate to classify the Personal \nAccounts as discretionary or to indicate that a fee was paid for investment advice \nregarding those accounts.  As to the Personal Accounts, the only charges were \ncommissions.  (Def’.’s Additional Br. 1.; Reply Br. 8; Dr. Deyton Dep. Exs. 19–20.)  \nDr. Deyton’s bare assertion that he trusted Waters’ advice is not adequate to \ncharacterize the Personal Accounts as discretionary.  \n{44} Federal courts have recognized a fiduciary relationship when a broker-\ndealer has de facto control of the account.  See, e.g, Leib v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, \nFenner & Smith, Inc. , 461 F. Supp. 951 (1978).  There is no similar North Carolina \ncase.  Here, the evidence may be strong to create a relationship of trust and \nconfidence as between the Deytons and Waters, but the court does not believe the \nevidence is adequate to conclude separately that the Deytons placed special trust or \nconfidence in IFG or MFSC.  In fact, the Deytons’ actions indicate otherwise.  \n{45} Even assuming a relationship of trust and confidence, the court has \nseparately considered whether the Deytons have presented evidence that MFSC \nreceived a personal benefit adequate to invoke a claim of constructive fraud.  To \nstate a claim for constructive fraud, a plaintiff must show that the defendant took \nadvantage of the fiduciary relationship to benefit him.  Sterner v. Penn. , 159 N.C. \nApp. 626, 631, 583 S.E.2d 670, 674 (2003).  “The primary difference between \npleading a claim for constructive fraud and one for breach of fiduciary duty is the \nconstructive fraud requirement that the defendant benefit himself.” White , 166 N.C. \nApp. at 294, 603 S.E.2d at 156.  “A plaintiff must allege that the benefit sought was \nmore than a continued relationship with the plaintiff or payment of a fee to a \ndefendant for work it actually performed.”  Id.  at 295; 603 S.E.2d at 156 (citation \nomitted).     \n{46} The Deytons seek to prove MFSC’s personal benefit in several ways.  \nFirst, they contend that they facilitated a prompt completion of wire transfers to \nprotect their own reputation, which would be adversely impacted by any delay in \nfacilitating the transactions.  (Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n 45.)  Secondly, they contend they \nreceived commissions or interest charges, to which MFSC correctly counters that \nunder North Carolina law, payment for work actually performed and cannot \nconstitute a sufficient benefit to state a claim for constructive fraud.  (Def.’s Mem. in \nSupp. 19); see Sterner , 159 N.C. App. 626, 632, 583 S.E.2d 670, 674 (2003); see also \nNationsbank of N.C. v. Parker , 140 N.C. App. 106, 108, 535 S.E.2d 597, 598 (2000).  \nIt also does not appear that MFSC itself received interest payments, but instead \nsuch charges were for the benefit of the clearing house Pershing. \n{47} In sum, the court does not find adequate evidence to support a special \nrelationship of trust and confidence as between the Deytons and IFG or MFSC, and \neven if such a relationship did exist, IFG or MFSC misused the relationship for \ntheir own personal benefit.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not entitled to proceed \nagainst MFSC directly on a claim for breach of fiduciary duty or constructive fraud, \nand these claims should be DISMISSED.   \n \nD. \n Issues of MFSC’s Vicarious Liability Must Await Trial   \n \n{48} MFSC contends that the court should determine as a matter of law \nthat Waters was an independent contractor, and even if not he was acting outside \nthe scope of any authority granted to him by MFSC or IFG. The Deytons contend \nthat they have forecasted adequate evidence upon which a jury could determine \nthat Waters was either an employee or agent acting within the scope of his \nauthority.  The court finds that there are material issues of fact that must await \ndetermination at trial.   \n{49} North Carolina law distinguishes between an independent contractor \nand a servant, employee, or agent.  Hayes v. Bd. of Trs. of Elon College , 224 N.C. 11, \n29 S.E.2d 137 (1944); Pressley v. Turner , 249 N.C. 102, 105 S.E.2d 289 (1958).  \nServants, agents, and employees are subject to the control of the party for whom the \nwork is being done, and due to this control, the doctrine of respondeat superior  \napplies.  Pressly , 249 N.C. at 105, 105 S.E.2d at 292.  The principal-agency \nrelationship rests on two essential elements: “(1) authority, either express or \nimplied, of the agent to act for the principal, and (2) the principal’s control over the \nagent.”  Holcomb v. Colonial Assocs., LLC , 358 N.C. 501, 509, 597 S.E.2d 710, 716 \n(2004) (citing  24 Strong’s North Carolina Index 4th Principal and Agent  § 1 (1993)).  \nThe North Carolina Supreme Court expresses the test for measuring that \nrelationship as requiring an examination if:  \nThe person employed (a) is engaged in an independent business, \ncalling or occupation; (b) is to have the independent use of his special \nskill, knowledge, or training in the execution of the work; (c) is doing a \nspecified piece of work at a fixed price, or for a lump sum or upon a \nquantitative basis; (d) is not subject to discharge because he adopts one \nmethod of doing the work rather than another; (e) is not in the regular \nemploy of the other contracting party; (f) is free to use such assistants \nas he thinks proper; (g) has full control over such assistants; and (h) \nselects his own time. \n \nHayes , 224 N.C. at 16, 29 S.E.2d at 140.  No particular factor is controlling, nor is \nthe presence of all required.  Id.  On the other hand, “an independent contractor is \n‘one who exercises an independent employment and contracts to do certain work \naccording to his own judgment and method, without being subject to his employer \nexcept as to the result of his work.’”  Rhoney v. Fele , 134 N.C. App. 614, 616, 518 \nS.E.2d 536, 539 (1999) (citation omitted).     \n{50} Defendant correctly notes the RRA entered between Waters and IFG in \n1994 recites that Waters was an independent contractor; however, this designation \nis not by itself controlling any more than any reference to Waters as a covered \n“employee” in insurance policies would control.  See Estate of Redding , 170 N.C. \nApp. at 330, 612 S.E.2d at 669 (holding that although a contract designates an \nemployer-independent contractor, rather than an employer-employee, the terms of \nthe contract are not controlling).  Generally, whether one is an independent \ncontractor or an agent or employee is a mixed question of law and fact Rhoney , 134 \nN.C. App. at 616, 518 S.E.2d at 538, but may in appropriate instances reduce to a \nquestion of law when the facts could support only one finding:   \n[W]here the facts are undisputed or the evidence is susceptible of only \na single inference and a single conclusion, it is a question of law for the \ncourt whether one is an employee or an independent contractor, but it \nis only where a single inference can reasonably be drawn from the \nevidence that the question of whether one is an employee or an \nindependent contractor becomes one of law for the court. \n \nYelverton v. Lamm , 94 N.C. App. 536, 538–39, 380 S.E.2d 621, 623 (1989) \n(citation omitted).     \n{51} The Deytons have forecast evidence which cuts against MFSC’s \ncontractual argument.  The Deytons forecast evidence from which they contend that \na jury could conclude that IFG or MFSC had reason to know of and then condoned \nor acquiesced in Waters’ improper conduct.  This forecast is adequate to resist entry \nof summary judgment.  Without further facts, embezzlement might be concluded to \nbe outside an employee’s or agent’s authority.  See Johnson v. Schultz, 364 N.C. 90, \n94, 691 S.E.2d 701, 704 (2010).  However, a mere finding that an employee or agent \nstole monies is not by itself adequate to compel a finding that she acted outside the \nscope of her authority.  White , 166 N.C. App. at 297–98, 603 S.E.2d at 158–59. \n{52} In White , the Court cited favorably to Restatement (Second) of Agency \n§ 261 (1958) which provides: “A principal who puts a servant or other agent in a \nposition which enables the agent, while apparently acting within his authority, to \ncommit a fraud upon third persons is subject to liability to such third persons for \nthe fraud.”  Id.  at 298, 603 S.E.2d at 158.  The Court also cited Parsons v. Bailey \nstating that “[i]t makes no difference that the agent was acting in his own behalf \nand not in the interests of the principal when the fraudulent act was perpetrated \nunless the third parties had notice of that fact.”  30 N.C. App. 497, 501–02, 227 \nS.E.2d 166, 168 (1976).  The court then further distinguished two lines of cases \nfollowing either B. B. Walker Co. v. Burns Int’l Sec. Servs., Inc. , 108 N.C. App. 562, \n424 S.E.2d 172 (1993), or Thrower v. Coble Dairy Prods. Coop., Inc. , 249 N.C. 109, \n105 S.E.2d 428 (1958), noting:  \nthe difference between cases in which an employee is able to commit a \ntort solely by virtue of his employment and presence on the employer’s \npremises, and those in which an employee is able to commit a tort by \nperforming the precise tasks that he was hired to do and was held out \nto the public as authorized to perform.  \n \nWhite , 166 N.C. App. at 299, 603 S.E.2d at 159.  The dividing line for finding \nwhether an agent can be said to be within or outside his authority is not clear, and \nthe cases seemingly allow for a factual inquiry into whether the principal knew of \nsome improper conduct by its agent then left the agent in a place from which the \nwrong could continue.  Here, drawing that line requires a trial determination.                         \n{53} In sum, the court concludes that the determinations of whether Waters \nwas an IFG or MFSC agent or employee and if so, whether he acted outside the \nscope of his authority, must await trial.   \n \nV. V. V. V. \n CC CCONCLUSION ONCLUSION ONCLUSION ONCLUSION    \n    \n{54} For the reasons expressed above, MFSC is entitled to summary \njudgment that the direct claims of breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud \nagainst it should be dismissed.  The Motion should not be otherwise allowed.  \nAccordingly, the Motion is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 25th day of April, 2013. "
