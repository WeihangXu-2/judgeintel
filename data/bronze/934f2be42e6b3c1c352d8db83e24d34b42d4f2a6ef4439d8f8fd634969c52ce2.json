Brookside is a nursing care \nfacility located in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  The Contract was signed on May \n6, 1999, on behalf of Plaintiff as seller by David H. Wagner (“Wagner”),1 owner and \nPresident of Plaintiff.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. \nSumm. J. 2.)  Defendant Nina Gibson (“N. Gibson”) and Defendant Timothy Smith \n(“Smith”) signed individually as purchasers.2  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2; \nPl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 2.)  On July 20, 1999, N. Gibson and Smith executed \na modification of the Contract (the “Modification”) adjusting the price and payment \nterms and extending the closing date until September 9, 1999.  (Compl. ¶ 11; Def.’s \nBr. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 2.)  Ultimately, the \ntransaction fell through, and the closing of the Brookside purchase never occurred.  \n(Compl. ¶ 14; Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 3.)  \nAs a result of the failed closing, Plaintiff has filed suit alleging breach of contract \nand seeking monetary damages.  (Compl. ¶¶ 16−18.) \n{3} It is alleged that Allen was a member of a joint venture with N. Gibson \nand Smith, among others, to purchase Brookside pursuant to the Contract.  (Compl. \n¶ 8.)   Allen, however, was not listed on and did not sign the Contract or the \nModification.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 5.)  \nPlaintiff’s claim against Allen is based exclusively “on the allegation that N. Gibson \nand Smith executed the Contract on behalf of an existing joint venture in which \n                                                 \n1 Mr. Wagner has a law degree but is not engaged in the private practice of law. \n \n2 Defendant Smith has settled the claims against him.  The Court previously granted summary judgment in favor of \nMeredith Dodson Vanhoy, Personal Representative of the Estate of Ricky Dodson, deceased.  That ruling is on \nappeal.  Defendant Tuttle’s Motion for Summary Judgment is treated separately.   \n  \nAllen was a member.” (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. \nSumm. J. 5−9.)  Allen asserts that there are no issues of material fact and he is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law because (1) Plaintiff’s claim is barred by \nthe Statute of Frauds since he is not a member of the alleged joint venture, and (2) \nPlaintiff committed its own material breach of the Contract.3  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. \n1; Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 16−20.) \n{4} A first action was filed against Defendants in Davidson County in 2002 \nshortly before expiration of the three (3) year statute of limitation for breach of \ncontract.  At trial, during Plaintiff’s evidence, Plaintiff took a voluntary dismissal \nwithout prejudice as to all claims.  One (1) day before the one (1)-year period to re-\nfile expired, Plaintiff filed this new suit.4   \nB. \nEVIDENCE OF THE ALLEGED JOINT VENTURE \n1. \n ALLEN’S FAILED 1998 ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE BROOKSIDE \n{5} Allen is a medical doctor with experience directing and managing nursing \ncare facilities.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3.)  In 1998, prior to the Contract at \nissue in this litigation, Allen, N. Gibson and Defendant Larry Gibson (“L. Gibson”) \n(collectively “the Gibsons”) attempted, unsuccessfully, to purchase Brookside.  \n(Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 1.)  The Gibsons, \nwho have experience in managing nursing care facilities, engaged Allen to provide \nmedical care to the residents of Brookside pending purchase of the property.  (\nSee \nDef.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3.)  The Gibsons sought Allen’s services because he \nhad previously worked at a nursing care facility operated by the Gibsons.  (Def.’s Br. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J. 3.)   \n{6} In December 1998, Allen and the Gibsons toured the Brookside facility \ntogether and purchased a house adjacent to Brookside where the supervisor-in-\n                                                 \n3 The Court need not address the issue of Plaintiff’s material breach of the Contract as a result of the \nCourt’s ruling on Allen’s first basis for summary judgment.  \n \n4 This being a new lawsuit, the Court is not bound by decisions in the previous case. \n  \ncharge of the facility was to reside.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 1.)   Plaintiff \ncites the purchase of the house adjacent to Brookside as evidence that Allen was a \nmember of a later-formed and different joint venture to purchase Brookside.  (Pl.’s \nBr. Opp’n. Mot. Summ. J. 1.)  Allen’s wife was also a purchaser of the house; she, \nhowever, is not alleged to be a member of the joint venture and is not a defendant in \nthis lawsuit.  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 5.)  Ultimately, Allen and the \nGibsons failed to execute a contract to purchase Brookside.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nSumm. J. 3.)  Wagner testified at his deposition that the failed 1998 attempt at \npurchasing Brookside was due to a lack of funding.   (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. \nJ. 3.)  Wagner further testified that the purchase of the house related to the failed \n1998 attempt to purchase Brookside and is “separate and distinct” from the \nContract at issue in this litigation.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3; Def.’s Reply \nBr. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 5−6.)  \n2.   \nTHE BUYER’S GROUP \n{7} Plaintiff’s main contention is that Allen was a member of a joint venture \nformed to purchase Brookside and is therefore liable for the alleged breach of the \nContract.  (Compl. ¶¶ 8, 12.)  However, there is no evidence to support that \ncontention.  Allen denies under oath that he was a member of any group formed in \n1999 to purchase Brookside.  The other members of the alleged joint venture \nexpressly deny that Allen was a member of the buyer’s group.  Specifically, Smith \nand N. Gibson, the only signatories to the Contract and Modification, testified in \ntheir respective depositions “that they did not execute the Contract on behalf of Dr. \nAllen because he was not apart of the buyer[’s] group.”  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nSumm. J. 2.)  Moreover, N. Gibson testified that, from her perspective, “Smith, \n \n \n \n  \nDanny Tuttle5 (“Tuttle”), Ricky Dodson6 (“Dodson”) or a corporation to be formed by \nthem was purchasing [Brookside].”  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  Similarly, \nSmith testified that he “did not execute the Contract on behalf of Dr. Allen, but \nrather on behalf of a yet-to-be formed corporation that would be owned by himself, \nTuttle, and Dodson.”  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  In fact, both Smith and \nTuttle testified that as of May 6, 1999, the day the Contract was signed, they had \nnever even met Allen.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 4.) \n{8} Based on the record before the Court, it is clear that Wagner is the only \nperson to specifically include Allen in the buyer’s group.  (See Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nSumm J. 5−7.)  At his deposition, Wagner testified that the only evidence of the \njoint venture was the presence of the buyer’s group in his office at the execution of \nthe Contract on May 6, 1999.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ J. 5−7.)7  Allen, \nhowever, was not present at the execution of the Contract on May 6, 1999.  (Def’s \nBr. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 7.)  The only Defendants present at execution were Smith, \nTuttle, Dodson, and the Gibsons.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 7.)  Furthermore, \nWagner testified that Smith, Tuttle, Dodson, and the Gibsons each affirmatively \nindicated they were a part of the buyer’s group.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. \n                                                 \n5 Danny Tuttle, a defendant in this litigation, is an alleged member of the buyer’s group. \n \n6 Ricky Dodson was a broker with The Interstate Companies of America, Inc.  He was retained as Plaintiff’s agent \nfor the sale of the Brookside property.  Plaintiff alleged that Mr. Dodson subsequently withdrew from his broker \nstatus and became a partner in a joint venture to buy Brookside pursuant to the Contract.  (Compl. ¶ 10.)  Mr. \nDodson passed away in October of 2000.  The Personal Representative of Mr. Dodson’s estate moved for summary \njudgment on the basis that Plaintiff failed to file a timely claim within the claim notice period.  This \nCourt, by Order dated February 28, 2008, granted summary judgment as to Mr. Dodson’s estate. \n \n7 Q:  Is there any other particular evidence that you have that will – that supports your allegation \nthat these folks were signing this document as well on behalf of the group? \nA:  Well, as I say, it was signed at a time that they were all gathered around my desk, and they were \nall representing themselves as the buyer group, and they chose persons to sign on their behalf, and \nthose are the persons who signed.  I mean, that was the complete indication.  (Wagner Dep. I 50−51.) \n \nQ: Okay.  And how did he [Smith] indicate to you that he was signing on behalf of this group? \nA: Well, the entire group was there discussing the purchase, and he signed the document, and I saw \nhim sign the document.  (Wagner Dep. I 36−37.) \n  \n 7−8.)8  Noticeably absent from Wagner’s testimony was any mention of Allen \naffirmatively indicating membership in the buyer’s group.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nSumm. J. 8.)  Indeed, Wagner’s own testimony makes clear that Allen’s involvement \nin the alleged joint venture was pure speculation on Wagner’s part.  (See Def.’s Br. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J. 15.)9\n3.   \nTHE BANK DOCUMENTS \n{9} Financing was required by the parties to purchase Brookside.  James Keen \n(“Keen”) of Branch Banking & Trust (“BB&T”) was the banker in charge of \noriginating the loan.  In support of the alleged joint venture, Plaintiff asserts that \nAllen is linked to the bank documents originated for the purchase of Brookside.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiff notes that Dodson gave Allen’s name to Keen, and Keen had \npossession of Allen’s personal financial information along with the personal \nfinancial information of Smith, Dodson, and the Gibsons.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. \nSumm. J. 2; Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 5, 7.)  As a result of this \ninformation, two commitment letters from Keen and BB&T listed Allen as one of \nthe co-makers of the loan along with the rest of the alleged buyer’s group.  (Pl.’s Br. \nOpp’n Mot. Summ. J. 2; Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 5, 7.)  However, Keen \nknew of Allen only through Dodson and included Allen’s name on the loan \ncommitment letter at Dodson’s request.  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 7−8.)  \nAdditionally, Allen’s personal financial information was from “December 1998, \nconsistent with Dr. Allen’s failed attempt to purchase Brookside.” (Def.’s Reply Br. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J. 8.)  Keen specifically testified at his deposition that he had \n                                                 \n8 Q: Okay.  Who told you they were acting as purchasers? \nA:  Well, I know that Mr. – Smith did, and the Gibsons did, and Danny Tuttle did, and at one time \nRicky Dodson did.  (Wagner Dep. I 34.)  \n \n9 Q: Well, you knew that Dr. Harvey Allen did not sign the contract right? \nA: Yeah, I knew he did not sign the contact. \n \nQ: Okay. You just happened to have his address? \nA: No, I happened to have his involvement, based on my knowledge of the – of his involvement with \nthe Gibsons and what he had anticipated or indicated to me he was planning on doing, and I realized \nthat – I knew that he was a part of the buyer’s group.  (Wagner Dep. I 201−02.)  \n  \nnever met Allen and was working at the instruction of Dodson.  (Def.’s Reply Br. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J. 8.)  \n{10} Based on the record, it is clear that Keen got Allen’s name by the \nunauthorized acts of Dodson.  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 7.)  Plaintiff \nhas produced no evidence that Allen instructed Keen to include him in the loan \ndocumentation.  Likewise, Plaintiff has produced no evidence that Allen consented \nto Dodson distributing his name to Keen.  In fact, Allen testified at his deposition \nthat he had never talked with Dodson.  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 8.)  \nThere is no evidence to the contrary.   \n4. \nTHE LETTER FROM HERNDON TO WAGNER \n{11} The closing of the Brookside purchase was to be conducted by attorney \nBrian Herndon (“Herndon”) of the firm Blanco Tackabery & Matamoros, P.A.  (Pl.’s \nBr. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 3.)  Ultimately, however, the buyers refused to close on the \npurchase.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 3; Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. \n8.)  In light of their refusal, the buyers instructed Herndon to write a letter to \nWagner advising him that they did not intend to perform under the Contract.  (Pl.’s \nBr. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 3; Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 8.)  The letter to \nWagner was carbon copied to Allen.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 3).  Plaintiff \nsuggests that Allen’s name on this letter is further evidence of Allen’s alleged \nmembership in the joint venture formed to purchase Brookside.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n \nMot. Summ. J. 3.)  Put another way, Plaintiff suggests that Allen’s name on the \nletter raises an inference that Allen was a member of the buyer’s group.  (Pl.’s Br. \nOpp’n Mot. Summ. J. 3.)  At his deposition, however, Herndon testified that he \ncopied the letter to Allen because Dodson instructed him to do so, “and in fact [he] \nwas writing that letter on behalf of ‘primarily Ricky Dodson[] [and] also – the entity \nthat was to be the new buyer.’”  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 8.)  Herndon \nmade clear at his deposition that he “understood the potential buyer of Brookside to \nbe an entity to be formed under the direction of Dodson.”  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. \n  \nMot. Summ. J. 8−9.)  Similarly to Keen, Herndon testified that he had never met \nAllen.  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 9.)   \n{12} Based on the record before the Court, Herndon got Allen’s name from \nDodson’s unauthorized act.  (See Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 9.)  Plaintiff \nhas produced no evidence that Allen instructed Herndon to include his name in the \nletter to Wagner.  Similarly, Plaintiff has produced no evidence that Allen \nconsented to Dodson’s act.  Indeed, Allen testified that he had never talked with \nDodson or consented to Dodson taking actions on his behalf.  (Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. \nMot. Summ. J. 8−9.) \n \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{13} Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.R. Civ. P. 56(c).  “It is not the purpose of the \nrule to resolve disputed material issues of fact but rather to determine if such issues \nexist.”  Id. at 56 cmt.  The burden of showing a lack of triable issues of fact falls \nupon the moving party.  See, e.g., Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co., 313 \nN.C. 488, 491, 329 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1985).  Once this burden has been met, the \nnonmoving party must “produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that [it] will \nbe able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.”  Collingwood v. Gen. Elec. \nReal Estate Equities, Inc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989).  The Court \nmust exercise caution in granting a motion for summary judgment.  N.C. Nat’l Bank \nv. Gillespie, 291 N.C. 303, 310, 230 S.E.2d 375, 379 (1976).  \n \nIII.  \nANALYSIS  \n{14} The Statute of Frauds requires that a contract to buy or sell real property \nbe in writing.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 22-2.  Specifically, “[a]ll contracts to sell or \n  \nconvey any lands . . . shall be void unless said contract, or some memorandum or \nnote thereof, be put in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or \nby some other person by him thereto lawfully authorized.”  Id.  The facts in this \nlitigation are clear—Allen did not sign the Contract executed on May 6, 1999 or the \nModification executed on July 20, 1999.  Consequently, the Statute of Frauds will \nbar Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim against Allen unless Plaintiff can establish \nthat someone “lawfully authorized” signed the Contract on Allen’s behalf.   \n{15} Plaintiff contends that the Statute of Frauds does not bar Plaintiff from \nrecovering from Allen because Allen was a member of a joint venture formed to \npurchase Brookside.  (Compl. ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff further asserts that Smith and N. \nGibson signed the Contract on behalf of the joint venture thereby making all co-\nadventurers liable for the alleged breach of contract.  (Compl. ¶ 12.)  In North \nCarolina, a writing not signed by the party to be charged\n10 does not run afoul of the \nStatute of Frauds when the writing is signed by an authorized agent.  See Lewis v. \nAllred, 249 N.C. 486, 489, 106 S.E.2d 689, 692 (1959).  “Each member of a joint \nventure is both an agent for his coadventurer and a principal for himself.”  Pike v. \nWachovia Bank & Trust Co., 274 N.C. 1, 8, 161 S.E.2d 453, 460 (1968) (citing \nSummers v. Hoffman, 341 Mich. 686, 696, 69 N.W. 2d 198, 203 (1955)).  The Statue \nof Frauds is satisfied “if the agent signs in his own name instead of that of his \nprincipal . . . .”  Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co., 282 N.C. 643, 670, 194 S.E.2d 521, \n539 (1973).  Thus, the fact that N. Gibson and Smith signed the Contract in their \nown individual names does not absolve Allen, or the alleged joint venture, from \nliability.  Given the foregoing, the viability of Plaintiff’s claim against Allen hinges \non the existence of a joint venture in which Allen was a participant.    \n{16} A joint venture is “an association of persons with intent, by way of \ncontract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single business adventure \nfor joint profit, for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill, \nand knowledge, but without creating a partnership in the legal or technical sense of \n                                                 \n10 The “party to be charged” is “the one against whom relief is sought . . . .’”  Lewis v. Murray, 177 \nN.C. 17, 19, 97 S.E. 750, 751 (1919). \n  \nthe term.”  Pike, 274 N.C. at 8, 161 S.E.2d at 460 (1968) (citing In re Simpson, 222 \nF. Supp. 904, 909 (M.D.N.C. 1963)).  An express agreement is not required to prove \nthe existence of a joint venture.  See Rhue v. Rhue ___ N.C. App. ___, ___, 658 \nS.E.2d 52, 59 (2008); see also Wike v. Wike, 115 N.C. App. 139, 141, 445 S.E.2d 406, \n407 (1994).  Rather, intent to create a joint venture can be inferred by the conduct of \nthe parties and the surrounding circumstances.  See Rhue, ___ N.C. App. at ___, 658 \nS.E.2d at 59; see also Wike, 115 N.C. App. at 141, 445 S.E.2d at 407.  The existence \nof a joint venture “may be based upon a rational consideration of the acts and \ndeclarations of the parties, warranting the inference that the parties understood \nthat they were [co-adventurers] and acted as such.”  Davis v. Davis, 58 N.C. App. \n25, 30, 293 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1982) (citing Eggleston v. Eggleston, 228 N.C. 668, 674, \n47 S.E. 2d 243, 247 (1948)).  “Facts showing the joining of funds, property, or labor, \nin a common purpose . . . in which each has a right . . . to direct the conduct of the \nother[s] through a necessary fiduciary relation[ship]” is sufficient for finding the \nexistence of a joint venture.  Pike, 274 N.C. at 8, 161 S.E.2d at 460; Cheape v. \nChapel Hill, 320 N.C. 549, 561, 359 S.E.2d 792, 799 (1987). \n{17} In North Carolina, joint ventures are similar to partnerships, and they are \n“governed by substantially the same rules.”  Jones v. Shoji, 336 N.C. 581, 585, 444 \nS.E.2d 203, 205 (1994).  A hallmark of a partnership is the sharing of “any profits, \nincome, expenses, joint business property or hav[ing] authority of any kind over \neach other.”  Wilder v. Hobson, 101 N.C. App. 199, 203, 398 S.E.2d 625, 628 (1990).  \n{18} Moreover, using North Carolina partnership law as a guide, where one co-\nadventurer executes an instrument in his individual name, the party attempting to \nhold the joint venture liable has the burden of proving that the other co-adventurers \neither authorized or ratified the execution of the instrument.  See In the Matter of \nOxford Plastics v. Goodson, 74 N.C. App. 256, 262, 328 S.E.2d 7, 11 (1985).  Stated \notherwise, when a document is not signed in the joint venture’s name, “a plaintiff \nmust show that the defendant was acting on behalf of the [joint venture] or that the \n[joint venture] ratified the individual’s act.”  See Messer v. Laurel Hill Assoc., 93 \nN.C. App. 439, 445, 378 S.E.2d 220, 224 (1989). \n  \n{19} In this case there is no express written agreement creating a joint venture \nbetween the Defendants.  Thus, for Allen to be liable, a joint venture must be \ninferred from the conduct of the parties and the surrounding circumstances.  See \nRhue, ___ N.C. App. at ___, 658 S.E.2d at 59.  Based on the record before the Court, \nhowever, there is no evidence from which to draw such an inference.  Plaintiff has \nfailed to produce any evidence consistent with the existence of a joint venture in \nwhich Allen was a participant. \n{20} Allen and the Gibsons did tour the Brookside facility in 1998 and \npurchased an adjoining piece of property.  These actions were taken in anticipation \nof purchasing Brookside in 1998 and are not related to this litigation.  Wagner, the \nowner and President of Plaintiff and a signatory to the Contract, admitted at his \ndeposition that the actions taken in 1998 were “separate and distinct” from the \nContract at issue in this litigation.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3; Def.’s Reply \nBr. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 5−6.)  Based on the record before the Court, Allen’s \nparticipation in a joint venture to purchase Brookside in 1999 cannot be inferred \nfrom Allen and the Gibsons’ failed attempt to purchase Brookside in 1998.  \nWagner’s own deposition testimony concedes that Allen’s actions in 1998 were not \nconsistent with membership in the alleged joint venture to purchase Brookside in \n1999. \n{21} The record before the Court also shows that the signatories to the Contract \nexplicitly deny signing the contract on behalf of Allen.  Plaintiff has failed to cite a \ncase in which all the members of an alleged joint venture denied the joint venture’s \nexistence and yet the court nonetheless found that a joint venture existed.  Both N. \nGibson and Smith testified that a yet-to-be formed corporation owned by Smith, \nTuttle, and Dodson was to be the owner of Brookside.  Moreover, when pressed at \nhis deposition for evidence of a joint venture, Wagner could only produce the \npresence of Smith, Tuttle, Dodson, and the Gibsons around his desk the day the \nContract was signed—May 6, 1999.  By a ll accounts, Allen was not present for the \nexecution of the Contract.   Indeed, Smith and Tuttle both testified that they had \nnever met Allen prior to the signing of the Contract.  Moreover, Allen testified he \n  \nhad never spoken with Dodson.  The Pike court defined a joint venture as “an \nassociation of persons with intent . . . express or implied, to engage in and carry out \na single business adventure for joint profit . . . .”  Pike, 242 N.C. at 8, 161 S.E.2d at \n460 (emphasis added).  Based on N. Gibson and Smith’s understanding of the \nsituation, they undoubtedly lacked intent “to engage in and carry out a single \nbusiness adventure for profit” with Allen.  Quite the opposite, N. Gibson and Smith \nexpressly stated they were not members of a joint venture with Allen.  \nFurthermore, it is unclear how Smith and Tuttle intended to be co-adventurers with \nAllen given the fact that they had not met Allen prior to May 6, 1999.  N. Gibson’s \nand Smith’s testimony, coupled with evidence that Smith and Tuttle had not met \nAllen prior to May, 6 1999, certainly does not “warrant[] the inference that the \nparties understood that they were [co-adventurers]” together.  \nDavis, 58 N.C.App. \nat 30, 293 S.E.3d at 271.  Instead, the evidence before the Court warrants the \ninference that the parties did not intend to be members of a joint venture with \nAllen. \n{22} Consistent with Goodson and Messer, Allen may be liable for breach of the \nContract if he authorized, or subsequently ratified, N. Gibson or Smith signing the \nContract on his behalf.  Goodson, 74 N.C. App. at 262, 328 S.E.2d at 11; see also \nMesser, 93 N.C. App. at 445, 378 S.E.2d at 224.  However, Plaintiff has produced no \nevidence that Allen authorized N. Gibson or Smith to sign the Contract on his \nbehalf.  Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that Allen subsequently ratified \nN. Gibson and Smith’s execution of the Contract. \n{23} At first glance, Allen being listed on two loan commitment letters as a co-\nmaker of the loan to purchase Brookside appears to be some evidence that he was a \nmember of a joint venture to purchase Brookside.  Upon further review, however, it \nis clear that Allen’s name was given to Keen by Dodson’s unauthorized act.  In fact, \nKeen testified that he had never met Allen and that he was instructed by Dodson to \nput Allen’s name on the loan commitment letters.  Plaintiff has failed to produce \nany evidence that Allen instructed Keen to include his name on the loan \n  \ndocumentation.  Additionally, Plaintiff can point to no evidence that Allen \nconsented to, or ratified, Dodson’s distributing his name to Keen. \n{24} Plaintiff has pointed to a letter written by Herndon to Wagner which was \ncarbon copied to Allen as evidence that Allen was a member of the alleged joint \nventure.  Similar to the loan commitment letters, however, Herndon copied the \nletter to Allen at Dodson’s request.  At the time the letter was sent to Wagner, \nHerndon had never met Allen.  In fact, Herndon testified that “he understood the \npotential buyer of Brookside to be an entity formed under the direction of Dodson.” \n(Def.’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 8−9.)  Herndon’s own testimony suggests that \nhe did not view Allen as a member of the buyer’s group.  Plaintiff has offered no \nevidence that Allen instructed Herndon to carbon copy him on the letter.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiff can point to no evidence that Allen consented to, or ratified, \nDodson’s distributing his name to Herndon. \n{25} Taken as a whole, Plaintiff has relied exclusively on the actions of others—\nspecifically Dodson, Keen, and Herndon— to prove Allen’s membership in the \nalleged joint venture.  Plaintiff has produced no evidence that Allen “joined funds, \nproperty, or labor in a common purpose.” Pike, 274 N.C. at 8, 161 S.E.2d at 460; see \nalso Wilder 101 N.C. App. at 203, 398 S.E.2d at 628.  Furthermore, Allen’s \nmembership in the joint venture cannot be inferred from the circumstances given \nthat many of the alleged members of the joint venture had never met prior to May \n6, 1999.  Most damaging to Plaintiff’s claim is the undisputed fact that all the \nalleged members of the joint venture deny his participation.  Plaintiff has relied \nentirely on circumstantial evidence to prove the existence of a joint venture, and, as \na matter of law, that is not sufficient.  In the absence of a joint venture or Allen’s \nsubsequent ratification of N. Gibson and Smith’s act, Plaintiff’s claim is barred by \nthe Statute of Frauds.   \n{26} For the reasons stated above, there are no genuine issues of material fact \nand Allen is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The Court hereby GRANTS \nAllen’s Motion for Summary Judgment. \n  \n{27} Based on the Court’s ruling that the Statute of Fraud bars Plaintiff’s claim \nagainst Allen, the Court need not address Allen’s claim that Plaintiff materially \nbreached the Contract.   \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED: \n1. Defendant Allen’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED; \nand \n2. Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with prejudice. \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED this 17th day of March, 2009. \n \n  "
