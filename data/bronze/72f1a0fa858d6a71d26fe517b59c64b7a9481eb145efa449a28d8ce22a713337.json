Sturrus, 2017 NCBC 75. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nCOUNTY OF WAKE \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n16 CVS 10068 \n \nSAW PLASTIC, LLC and STEVE A. \nWORDSWORTH, \n  \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nANTHONY STURRUS, GALLATIN \nEQUITY PARTNERS, LP, \nGALLATIN EQUITY PARTNERS, \nGP, LLC, JULIAN ALEXANDER, \nand AIMET TECHNOLOGIES, LLC \nf/k/a AIMET ACQUISITION, LLC, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \nOPINION AND ORDER  \nON DEFENDANTS’ MOTION  \nTO DISMISS  \n \nTHIS MATTE R comes before the Court on Defendants Anthony Sturrus, \nGallatin Equity Partners, LP, Gallatin Equity Partners GP, LLC, Julian Alexander, \nand Aimet Technologies, LLC’s Motion to Dismiss (“Motion to Dismiss”).1  \n THE COURT, having considered the Motion to Dismiss, the briefs in support \nof and in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, the arguments of counsel at the hearing, \nand other appropriate matters of record, concludes that the Motion to Dismiss should \nbe DENIED for the reasons set forth below. \nWard and Smith, P.A. by Michael J. Parrish, Esq., Gary J. Rickner, Esq., \nfor Plaintiffs Saw Plastic, LLC and Steve A. Wordsworth. \n \nStark Law Group, PLLC  by Thomas H. Stark, Esq., Seth A. Neyhart, \nEsq., Brycen Williams, Esq . for Defendants Gallatin Equity Partners, \nL.P., Gallatin Equity Partners, GP, LLC, Julian Alexander, and Aimet \nTechnologies, LLC. \n                                                 \n1 On August 3, 2017, the Court issued an Order on Motion for Sanctions in which it struck \nthe Motion to Dismiss to the extent it was made on behalf of Defendant Anthony Sturrus \n(“Sturrus”) and entered default against Sturrus. Accordingly, Gallatin Equity Partners, LP, \nGallatin Equity Partners GP, LLC, Julian Alexander, and Aimet Technologies, LLC are \nreferred to hereinafter as “Defendants.” \n \n \n \nAnthony Sturrus, pro se. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(6), but only recites those facts included in the complaint that are relevant \nto the Court’s determination of the Motion. See e.g., Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs \nGrp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).  \n2. Saw Plastic, LLC (“SAW”) is a North Carolina limited liability company. \nSteve A. Wordsworth (“Wordsworth”) is a member and manager of SAW (collectively, \nSAW and Wordsworth are referred to as “Plaintiffs”). \n3. Gallatin Equity Partners, LP  (“Gallatin LP”)  is a Delaware limited \npartnership. Gallatin Equity Partners GP, LLC (“Gallatin GP”) is a Delaware limited \nliability company (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 5–6.) (collectively, Gallatin LP and Gallatin GP are \nreferred to as “Gallatin.”)2 Gallatin GP, Sturrus, and Julian Alexander (“Alexander”) \nare partners in Gallatin LP and members and managers of Gallatin GP (Ver. Compl. \n¶¶ 15–18.) \n4. Aimet Technologies, LLC (“Aimet”), a Delaware limited liability \ncompany with its principal place of business in Wake County, North Carolina , was \nformed in 2014 and is formally known as Aimet Acquisition, LLC (Ver. Comp l. ¶ \n8―12.). Aimet is in the business of custom injection molding for plastic products and \n                                                 \n2 There is some dispute as to which Gallatin entity is the appropriate Defendant in this \naction. Howe ver, this issue is not currently before the Court in its determination of the \nMotion to Dismiss.  \n \n \nrelated services. At all relevant times, Defendant Sturrus was an officer, director, \npresident, member, Chair of the Board of Managers , and Chief Executive Officer of \nAimet. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 13–16.) \n5. In October 2014 Sturrus began to solicit Wordsworth and SAW  to \npurchase debt securities in Aimet by touting “Aimet’s business prospects  and his \noptimistic vision for Aimet.”  (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 28 –30.) At all times when soliciting \nWordsworth and SAW, Sturrus “was acting as both an officer and direct or of Aimet \nand also a partner, manager, and owner of Gallatin.” (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 37–38.) \n6. Sturrus purchased debt securities from Aimet i n December 2014, a nd \nFebruary, March, and April, 2015 . SAW later converted part of the debt securities \ninto equity securitie s in Aimet. (Ver. Compl. ¶ 34.) On February 13, 2015, \nWordsworth and Aimet executed a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note, in the \noriginal principal am ount of $1,000,000.00. (Ver. Compl . ¶ 35; Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, \nExs. A, D, her einafter “February 2015 Note.”) Aimet also executed a Security \nAgreement giving Wordsworth a security interest in certain of Aimet ’s assets. (Ver. \nCompl. ¶ 36; Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, Ex. E.)  \n7. During late 2014 and early 2015, Sturrus also proposed that SAW and \nGallatin make equal equity investments  in Aimet in exchange for equal ownership \nand rights in Aimet.  (Ver. Compl. ¶ ¶ 40–43.) Sturrus provided SAW with proposed \ncapital tables that showed that Gallatin and  SAW would make equal  cash \ncontributions to Aimet . (Ver. Compl. ¶ ¶ 43–44.) Sturrus indicated that  it was \nGallatin’s intent to invest in Aimet before , or contemporaneously with, its receipt of \n \n \nits ownership interest and voting rights in Aimet and on equal terms with SAW’s \ninvestment. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 45―48.) Sturrus told Wordsworth and SAW that \nGallatin’s contribution would be funded one -half by Sturrus and one -half by \nAlexander. (Ver. Compl. ¶ 41.)  \n8. On or about April 1, 2015, the initial members of Aimet executed the \nOperating Agreement of Aimet Acquisition, LLC . (Ver. Compl. Ex. A , hereinafter, \n“Operating Agreement.”) Schedule A to the Operating Agreement  contains a table \ntitled “Members, Initia l Capital and Membership Interests” (“Capital Table”). The \nCapital Table provided that  SAW and Gallatin would each provide a capital \ncontribution of $375,000.00 in exchange for 375,000 Class A Units, a 37.152% voting \ninterest in Aimet, and a 35.294% member ship interest in Aimet . ( Operating \nAgreement, Schedule A.) The Capital Table indicated that SAW and Gallatin were to \nmake a “cash contribution.” The Capital Table also provided that the other members \nof Aimet would make their respective capital contributions through a combination of \ncash and a promissory note, or through non-cash contributions made to Aimet. (Ver. \nCompl. ¶ 58; Operating Agreement, Schedule A.)  \n9. SAW made its full $375,000.00 contribution to Aimet. (Ver. Compl. ¶ \n66.) \n10. Gallatin did not make its full cash contribution, and “paid substantially \nless than $375,000.00” because “while Alexander funded certain amounts of the \npurchase price for Gallatin’s equity securities in Aimet, Sturrus did not fund or did \nnot fully fund his share of the purchase  price.” (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 59 –60.) Despite not \n \n \nmaking its full contribution , Gallatin received its 37.152% voting interest and \n35.294% membership interest in Aimet. (Ver. Compl. ¶ 59.) \n11. Plaintiffs allege that Sturrus’s representations that Gallatin would \nmake a capital contribution to Aimet of $375,000 were false and misleading and were \nmade to induce SAW to purchase its membership interest in  Aimet. (Ver. Compl. ¶ \n67.) Plaintiffs further allege: \nHad SAW known that its investment in Aimet would not \nbe on equal  terms with Gallatin; that Gallatin would not \nimmediately pay for its equity securities; or that Aimet or \nSturrus would convey to Gallatin its equity securities \nwithout receiving Gallatin’s full payment, SAW would not \nhave purchased equity securities from Aimet or would have \nrequired different pricing, terms, or conditions for an y \npurchase of equity securities . . . . \n \n(Ver. Compl. ¶ 73.) \n12. On or about September 29, 2 015, while soliciting Wordsworth for \nadditional capital for Aimet,  Sturrus disclosed that Gal latin had not  fully paid its \ncapital contribution. Nevertheless, Sturrus also “expressly represented” that Gallatin \nwould make its full capital contribution in Aimet on or before October 31, 2015. (Ver. \nCompl. ¶¶ 79, 81.) In reliance on this representation, Wordsworth agreed to enter \ninto an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, Promissory Note, and Security \nAgreement with Aimet for  the maximum principal amount of $1,550,000.00 . (Ver. \nCompl. ¶ 82; Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, Exs. B, F, G, collectively the “Amended Note”). The \nAmended Note replaced the February 2015 Note. The Amended Note had a maturity \ndate of December 31, 2017, and provided for Aimet to pay monthly interest on \nborrowed amounts equal to the prime rate established by Providence Bank plus 5%, \n \n \nbut not to exceed 9.5%. (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss , Ex . F .) The Amended Note gave \nWordsworth a security interest in, inter alia, Aimet’s accounts receivable, inventory, \nand fixtures and equipment. (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, Ex. F.) \n13. Wordsworth would not have executed the Amended Note “but for the \nassurances and representations by Sturrus that Gallatin would pay its obligations to \nAimet by October 31, 2015.” (Ver. Compl. ¶ 84.) \n14. In January 2016, Aimet defaulted on the Amended Note. (Ver. Compl. ¶ \n85.) \n15. Sturrus continued to solicit Wordsworth for additional capital  in early \n2016. On February 19, 2016, Sturrus asked Wordsworth to make a personal loan to  \nSturrus so that he could provide Aimet with “much needed cash.” (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ \n87―88.) Later that same day, Wordsworth was informed that Aimet’s bank account \nwould be overdrawn unless substantial funds were received immediately. (Ver. \nCompl. ¶ 90.) In addition, on February 19, 2016, Sturrus and Aimet revealed to \nWordsworth that Gallatin still had not paid the full $375,000.00 capital contribution \nto Aimet . (Ver. Compl. ¶ 91.) Wordsworth declined to make the personal loan to \nSturrus, and instead executed a Due on Demand Promissory Note  to Aimet, dated \nFebruary 19, 2016 in the amount of $7 5,000.00. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 92―94; Defs.’ Mot. \nDismiss, Ex. C, the “Demand Note”; collectively the Amended Note and Demand Note \nare referred to hereinafter as “the Notes”) . The Demand Note provided for Aimet to \npay simple interest of 8% on the borrowed amount, but 15% interest upon a default. \n \n \n16. Wordsworth made demand for payment of the Demand Note, but Aimet \nfailed to pay the note. (Ver. Compl. ¶ 96.) \n17. On August 10, 2016 , Plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit by filing the \nVerified Complaint. On September 15, 2016, this case was designated a mandatory \ncomplex business case by Order of the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme \nCourt, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4(b) (hereinafter, references to the North \nCarolina General Statutes will be to “G.S.”), and assigned to the undersigned Special \nSuperior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases by Order of Chief Judge James L. \nGale on September 16, 2016. \n18. The Verified Complaint as serts claims  against Sturrus, Aimet, and \nGallatin for violations of the North Carolina Securities Act, G.S. § 78A-56(a) and (c) \n(“NCSA”), common law fraud, and unlawful solicitation of unregistered securities  \nunder G.S. § 78A-24.3 The Verified Complaint also asserts claims for  vicarious \nliability against Gallatin and Aimet  and partnership liability against Sturrus, \nAlexander, and Gallatin GP.4 \n                                                 \n3 The NCSA applies “to persons who sell or offer to sell [securities] when (i) an offer to sell is \nmade in this State, or (ii) an offer to buy is made or accepted in this State.” G.S § 78A-63(a). \nAlthough Plaintiffs have not alleged that the offers or acceptances of the transactions at issue \noccurred in North Carolina, Defendants do not contest the NCSA would apply if the \ntransactions involve securities. \n  \n4The Verified Complaint contains two separate claims  labeled “Third Claim for Relief” (¶¶ \n133–34, titled “Fraud ―Sturrus, Gallatin, Aimet, ” and ¶ ¶ 135–42, titled “Unlawful Sale of \nSolicitation of Unregistered Securities”), and two separate claims labeled “Fourth Claim for \nRelief” (¶¶ 143 –51, titled “Vicarious Liability―Gallatin, Aimet ,” and ¶ ¶ 152–54, titled \n“Partnership Liability―Sturrus, Alexander, Gall atin Equity Partners GP, LLC” ). \nAccordingly, where appropriate, the Court will refer to the claims by referen ce to the \nparagraph numbers in the Verified Complaint alleging the claim. \n \n \n19. On October 11, 2016, Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss, and on \nOctober 31, 2016, Plaintiffs responded in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. \n20. The Court subsequently stayed this case  until February 7, 2017. \nFollowing the stay, ne w counsel appeared on behalf of Defendants, except Sturrus. \nSturrus opted to proceed pro se in this matter. \n21. On May 8, 2017, Defendants’ new counsel filed a reply in support of the \nMotion to Dismiss.  Sturrus did not file a reply brief. \n22. The Motion to Dismiss is fully briefed, the Court held a hearing on the \nMotion to Dismiss, and it is now ripe for disposition. \nANALYSIS \nI. 12(b)(6) Standard \n23. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \ntrue are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal \ntheory, whether properly labeled or not .” Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. \n669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987). Our appellate courts frequently reaffirm that \nNorth Carolina is a notice pleading state. See, e.g., Feltman v. City of W ilson, 238 \nN.C. App. 246, 252, 767 S.E.2d 615, 620 (2014) (quoting Wake Cty. v. Hotels.com, L.P., \n762 S.E.2d 477, 486 (2014)). “Under notice pleading, a statement of claim is adequate \nif it gives sufficient notice of the claim asserted to enable the adverse party to answer \nand prepare for trial, to allow for the application of the res judicata, and to show the \ntype of case brought.” Id.  \n \n \n24. Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports  plaintiff’s claim; (2) when the \ncomplaint reveals on its face that absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; [or] \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.” Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985). Otherwise, \n“a complaint should not be dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty \nthat plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in \nsupport of the claim.” Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) \n(emphasis omitted). The Court construes the complaint liberally and accepts all \nallegations as true. Laster v. Francis , 199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 \n(2009). However, the Court is not required “to accep t as true allegations that are \nmerely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.” \nGood Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs. , 174 N.C. App. 266, \n274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005). \n25. The Court may consider document s which are the subject of plaintiff’s \ncomplaint and to which the complaint specifically refers, including the contract that \nforms the subject matter of the action. Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. \n52, 60, 554 S.E.2d 840, 847 (2001). \n26. Plaintiffs allege that Sturrus, acting as an agent of Gallatin and Aimet, \ninduced Plaintiffs to invest in Aimet through SAW’s capital contribution to Aimet and \nthe Notes. Plaintiffs contend Sturrus induced the investments by falsely representing \nthat Gallatin intended to make the same $375,000.00 cash contribution to Aimet that \n \n \nSAW made, and by failing to tell Plaintiffs that Gallatin had not made the full \ncontribution but had received the benefits of ownership in Aimet. Plaintiffs allege \nthat SAW’s capital contribution and the Notes are “securities” under the NCSA, and \nthat Sturrus’s misrepresentations and omissions constitute securities fraud under \nG.S. § 78A-56, and common law fraud. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 102–134.) Plaintiffs also allege \nthat Sturrus, Gallatin, and Aimet unlawfully failed to register the investments they \nwere seeking in Aimet as a security under the NCSA.  (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 135–142.) \nFinally, Plaintiffs allege that Gallatin and Aimet are vicariously liable for Sturrus’s \nconduct and that Alexander and Gallatin GP are liable as partners for Sturrus’ s \nconduct. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 143–154.) \n27. Defendants first move to dismiss the claims under G.S. § 78A-56 and for \nfailure to register securities on the grounds that SAW’s capital contribution to Aimet \nand the Notes are not securities under the NCSA.   \nA. Saw Plastic’s Capital Contribution and Membership Interest in Aimet  \n28. The NCSA is a state -law scheme which is complementary to federal \nsecurities law schemes. Piazza v. Kirkbride , 785 S.E.2d 695, 707, 2016 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 371, *34 (Apr. 5, 2016), cert. granted, 794 S.E.2d 316, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 664 \n(Aug. 18, 2016) . “ [T]he NCSA parallels federal antifraud acts,” such that North \nCarolina Courts “use federal courts’  interpretation of analogous federal actions as \npersuasive authority.” Id. at 708, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 371 at *35. (citing State v. \nDavidson, 131 N.C. App. 276, 282 –83, 506 S.E.2d 743, 748 (1998)).  “[T]his Court \npreviously has found gu idance in interpr eting the NCSA’s definition of ‘ security’ in \n \n \ndecisions interpreting the strikingly  similar federal definition of “security”  found in \nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ” Vestlyn BMP, LLC v. Balsam Mt. Gr p., LLC, \n2016 NCBC LEXIS  48, *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 22, 2016).  In making this \ndetermination, courts “are not bound by legal formalisms, but instead take account \nof the economics of the transaction under investigation.” Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 \nU.S. 56, 61 (1990). \n29. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ capital contribution to, and resulting \nmembership interest in , Aimet is not a security . The NCSA defines a “security ,” in \nrelevant part, as \nany note; stock; treasury stock; bond; debenture; evidence \nof indebtedness; certif icate of interest or participation in \nany profit sharing agreement  . . . investment contract . . .  \nor, in general any interest or instrument commonly known \nas a “security,” or any certificate of interest or participation \nin, temporary or interim certificat e for, receipt for \nguarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or \npurchase, any of the foregoing. \n \nG.S. § 78A-2(11). \n \n30. Defendants contend that the membership interest in Aimet must be \nanalyzed as an “investment contract” after applying the test developed in SEC v. W.J. \nHowey, 328 U.S. 293, 298 –99 (1946) . (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 13 –15.) In \nHowey, the United States Supreme Court held that “an investment contract for \npurposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or sc heme whereby a \nperson invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely \nfrom the efforts of the promoter or a third party . . . .” Id. at 298–99. This Court has \nheld “[t]he Howey definition encompasses four elements: “(1) an investment of money, \n \n \n(2) in a common enterprise, (3) an expectation of profits, and (4) the expectation that \nprofits will arise solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party .” NNN \nDurham Office Portfolio 1, LLC v. Highwoods Realty Ltd. P’ship., 2013 NCBC LEXIS \n11, *25 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 19, 2013).  \n31. Defendants concede that “[w]ith respect to SAW’s Membership and \nCapital Contribution in Aimet, Plaintiffs have alleged the first three factors of the \nHowey test.” (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 13.) Defendants, however, contend that \nPlaintiffs have failed to allege facts showing an expectation that profits in Aimet will \narise “solely” from the efforts  of Sturrus and Gallatin . Because SAW is one of the \nlargest owners of Aimet, controls two of the six seats on Aimet’s Board of Managers, \nand manages Aimet through its representative s on Aimet’s Board of Managers,  \nDefendants contend SAW exercises meaningful control over Aimet’s business, and \ntherefore cannot allege that it expected profits to arise solely from the efforts of \nSturrus and Gallatin. (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 14  (citing Operating \nAgreement §4.2).) \n32. Plaintiffs argue that the Howey test is not applicable here because North \nCarolina law controls, and regulations adopted under the NCSA provide both a \nbroader definition of “investment contract” than Howey and a rebuttable presumption \nthat a membership interest in a limited liability company is a security under the \nNCSA.  (Pls.’ Mem. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 9―11 (citing 18 NCAC 06A.1104(8), 18 \nNCAC 06A.1510) .) Under 18 NCAC 06A.1104(8)  the definition of  an investment \ncontract includes the following: \n \n \n(a) Any investment in a common enterprise with the \nexpectation of profit to be derived through the essential \nmanagerial efforts of someone other than the in vestor. In \nthis Subparagraph a “common enterprise”  means an \nenterprise in which the fortunes of the investor are \ninterwoven with and dependent upon the efforts and \nsuccess of thos e seeking the  investment or of a third \nparty[.] \n  \n33. Section 6A.1510 provides in relevant part as follows: \n(a) Membership interest . . . in a limited liability company \nshall be presumed to be securities within the meaning of \nG.S. 78A-2(11) in either of the following circumstances: (1) \nwhere the articles of organization of the limited liability \ncompany provide that all members of the limited liability \ncompany are not necessarily managers by virtue of their \nstatus as members; or (2) where all members by virtue o f \ntheir status as members are managers of the limited \nliability company and the number of m embers is greater \nthan 15.  \n(b) Among the factors that will be considered . . . as \nevidence offered to rebut or support the presumption in \nParagraph (a) of this Rule are: (1) whether investors retain, \nunder the limited liability company’s operating agreement, \nthe right to exercise practical and actual control over the \nmanagerial decisions of the enterprise . . . . \n \n34. Plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to the pres umption created by \nthis rule because SAW is a member, but not a manager , of Aimet. Plaintiffs argue \nthat Defendants must show that SAW had “practical and actual control” over Aimet \nin order to rebut the presumption that the membership interest is a securit y. (Pls.’ \nMem. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 10.) The Operating Agreement provides that a Board \nof Managers  consisting of six (6) members  “shall direct, manage, and control the \nbusiness of the Company to the best of its ability and shall have full and complete \nauthority, power, and discretion” subject to certain Member rights, “to make any and \n \n \nall decisions, and to do any and all things whi ch the Board of Managers deems \nnecessary or desirable for that purpose.” (Operating Agreement § 4.1(a).)  The Board \nof Managers makes decisions by majority vote. ( Operating Agreement § 4.1(b).) Saw \nPlastic elected two members to the Board of Managers , inclu ding Wordsworth. \nPlaintiffs contend that even if SAW controls two members of the Board of Managers, \nit has  only a minority voting interest  and is not able to control Aimet’s business \ndecisions. (Pls.’ Mem. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 14.)  Finally, Plaintiffs  expressly \nallege that “neither SAW nor Wordsworth is actively engaged, on a regular basis, in \nthe management of Aimet’s business.” (Ver. Compl. ¶ 138.) \n35. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have alleged facts that would \nsupport a claim that SAW’s capital co ntribution to Aimet  was an “investment \ncontract” within the meaning of the NCSA , and that the membership interest in \nAimet was a security. Aimet was a “common enterprise” between SAW, Gallatin, and \nthe other members . SAW’s fortunes in Aimet were interwoven  with the efforts of \nSturrus on behalf of Aimet since Sturrus was Aimet’s CEO and President. It also is \nclear from the allegations that Sturrus was the primary principal behind Aimet’s \noperations. Plaintiffs allege that SAW invested in Aimet , based at least in part, on \nSturrus’s optimistic  business projections for Aimet ’s future profitability. The \nOperating Agreement anticipated a distribution of profits from Aimet’s operations. \n(Operating Agreement §§ 10.1–10.9.)  \n36. In addition, n either the allegations in the Verified Complaint nor the \nterms of the Operating Agreement establish that SAW or its representatives had \n \n \nactual control  over the managerial decisions of  Aimet. “[C]ontrol must be actual \nrather than theoretical, and must take economic realities into consideration.” NNN \nDurham Office Portfolio  1 LLC , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 95 at *50. Restricting its \nconsideration to the pleadings and the documents properly considered , the Court \ncannot say at this stage of the litigation that SAW’s membership interest in Aimet is \nnot a security subject to the NCSA. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ claims under G.S. §78A-56 and Plaintiffs’ claim for unlawful solicitation of \nunregistered securities in violation of the NCSA on the grounds that the membership \ninterest in Aimet is not a security should be DENIED.5 \nB. The Amended Note and Demand Note \n37. Defendants next argue the Notes are not securities  under the NCSA . \nBoth parties agree that determination of whether the Notes are securities requires \napplication of the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Reves v. Ernst & Young, \n494 U.S. 56, 63 (1990). In Reves, the Supreme Court rejected application of the Howey \ntest to the determination of whether a note is a security  under the Securities \nExchange Act. 494 U.S. 56 at 64. Instead, the Court adopted the “family resemblance” \ntest used by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Id. at 64–65 (citing  Exchange Nat. \nBank of Chicago v. Touche Ross & Co., 544 F.2d 1126, 1137–38 (2nd Cir. 1976)). \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiffs also argue that the membership interest in Aimet is a security under the NCSA \nbecause Aimet is a “Direct Participation Program”  under the definition in 18 NCAC \n06A.1104(3), and that the membership interest meets the standard for a security under the \nHowey test. (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 11, 13–14.) Since the Court concludes that \nPlaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the membership interest in Aimet is a security for other \nreasons, it need not address these arguments. \n \n \n38. Since the statutory definition of security under the Security Exchange \nAct includes “any note,” the family resemblance test starts “with a presumption that \nevery note is a security.” Id. at 65.   That presumption, however, is rebuttable. If the \nnote bears a resemblance to certain types of financial instruments that are recognized \nnot to be securities, then the note is not a security.  Id.  Included among notes that \nare not securities are “the note delivered in consumer financing, the no te secured by \na mortgage on a home, the short -term note secured by a lien on a small business or \nsome of its assets, the note evidencing a ‘character’ loan to a bank customer, short -\nterm notes secured by an assignment of accounts receivable, or a note which simply \nformalizes an open -account debt incurred in the ordinary course of business [.]” Id. \n(quoting Exchange Nat. Bank of Chicago, 544 F.2d at 1138.) \n39. In Reves, the Court held that in order to determine whether a particular \nnote bears a family resemblance to those notes that are not securities, courts should \nengage in a four factor analysis of: (1) the motivations that would prompt a reasonable \nseller and buyer to enter into the note; (2) the “plan of distribution” of the note, to \ndetermine whether it is an instrument in which there is ‘common trading for \nspeculation or investment’”; (3) “the reasonable expectations of the investing public”; \nand (4) “whether some factor such as the existence of another regulatory scheme  \nsignificantly reduces the risk of the instrument, thereby rendering application of the \nSecurities Acts unnecessary.” 494 U.S. at 66–67 (citations omitted). Here, Defendants \nand Plaintiffs both argue that application of these four factors supports their \nrespective positions. \n \n \n40. Defendants do not squarely frame their argument with regard to each \nof the four Reves factors, but instead argue that the Notes strongly resemble notes \nthat are recognized as not being securities, such as short-term notes secured by a lien \non a small business or its assets or accounts receivable . (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss 1 5–17.) Defendants contend that the  Notes are “short term,” 6 and the \nAmended Note is secured by Aimet’s assets, inc luding its accounts receivable.  The \nNotes were  extended to assist Aimet with is business expenses and cash flow \nproblems. (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 16.); Reves, 494 U.S. 56 at 66. (“If the note \nis exchanged to . . . correct for the seller’s cash -flow difficulties, or to advance some \nother commercial or consumer purpose . . . the note is less sensibly described as a \n‘security.’”). Defendants also argue that the Notes are not like an investment in a \nsecurity because “Wordsworth’s entitlement to interest [on the Notes] is an economic \nexpectation that is independent from Aimet’s profits, or lack thereof.”  (Defs.’ Mem. \nSupp. Mot. Dismiss 16.) Finally, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not alleged \nthat Sturrus had a “plan of distribution” for the Notes because Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat the Notes were offered to the public and were traded.  (Defs.’ Reply 7–8.) Rather, \nPlaintiffs allege only that “Sturrus made targeted solicitations for Wordsworth or \nSAW to purchase debt securities and equity securities from Aimet.” (Ver. Compl. ¶ \n30.) \n41. Plaintiffs expressly address the Reves factors. Plaintiffs argue that the \nfirst factor, the motivations of the buyer and seller, favors the position that the Notes \n                                                 \n6 Defendants’ argument that since the demand note is for a term of less than nine months it \ncannot be a security was expressly rejected by the Court in Reves. 494 U.S. at 70–73. \n \n \nare securities because Wordsworth executed the Notes “in response to Sturrus’ \nrequests to raise additional capital for Aimet.” (Pls.’ Mem. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss \n18 (citing Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 75, 77, 86–88, 93).) “If the seller’s purpose is to raise money \nfor the general use of a business enterprise or to finance substantial investments and \nthe buyer is interested primarily in the profit the note is expected to generate, th e \ninstrument is likely to be a ‘ security.’” Reves, 494 U.S. at 66. Plaintiffs also contend \nthat the advantageous interest rates on the Notes demonstrate Wordsworth’s profit \nmotive in extending the loans to Aimet. SEC v. Thompson, 732 F.3d 1151, 1162 (10th \nCir. 2013) (“attractive interest rate  . . . provides strong evidence that holders were \ninterested primarily in . . . profit”); Stoiber v. SEC, 161 F.3d 745, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(“a favorable interest rate indicates that profit was the primary goal of the lender.”) \n42. With respect to the second factor, Plaintiffs do not contend that they \nhave alleged that Sturrus had a plan of distribution for the Notes beyond soliciting \nWordsworth. \n43. Plaintiffs contend that the Notes satisfy the third Reves factor because \n“[t]he investing public would view substantial infusions of money by an individual \n(Wordsworth) to an entity in its infancy to assist with working capital at a premium \nrate of interes t as an investment, rather than as a typical commercial loan \ntransaction.” (Pls.’ Mem. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 19.) \n44. Plaintiffs argue that the fourth factor supports the conclusion that the \nNotes are securities because no specific statutory scheme exists that reduces the risk \nassociated with the Notes, but do not address  the fact that the Amended Note is \n \n \nprotected by a security lien on Aimet’s assets. (Pls.’ Mem. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss \n19.)  \n45. Given the broad protective purposes of the NCSA, and mindful tha t \nPlaintiffs are required only to provide “notice of th e transactions or occurrences . . . \nintended to be proved,” the Court concludes that the allegations in the Verified \nComplaint are minimally  sufficient to support the claim that the Notes are securities \nfor purposes of surviving Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  G.S. §1A -1, Rule  8(a)(1); \nSutton v. Duke , 176 S.E.2d 161, 165, 277 N.C. 94, 102 (1970) (“Under the ‘notice \ntheory of pleading’ a statement of claim is adequate if it gives sufficient notice of the \nclaim asserted ‘to enable the adverse party to answer and prepare for trial, to allow \nfor the application of the doctrine of res judicata, and to show the type of case brought. \n. . .’”). The Verified Complaint alleges that Aimet was seeking “investments,” and that \nSturrus solicited the investments by providing Wordsworth with optimistic business \nforecasts for Aimet, and “encouraged Wordsworth or SAW to convert any debt \nsecurities . . . into equity securities at a future date.” (Ver. Comp l. ¶¶ 29―33.) \nPlaintiffs also allege that Wordsworth “only purchased the Debt Securities to protect \nSAW’s equity interest in Aimet.” (Ver. Comp l. ¶ 111.) Accordingly, Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss  Plaintiffs’ claims under G.S. §78A -56 and Plaintiffs’ claim for \nunlawful soli citation of unregistered securities  in violation of the NCSA on the \ngrounds that the Notes are not securities should be DENIED. \n46. Defendants also argue that Wordsworth must elect his remedy and \ncannot seek damages under the NCSA in this lawsuit because he obtained a judgment \n \n \non the promissory notes in a separate action. The Court believes this argument is \nuntimely. Election of remedies is an affirmative defense which must be plead ed by \ndefendants who bear the burden of proof. Accordingly, this doctrine is “not an \nappropriate basis for dismissal upon a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, since defendants have \nnot yet filed an answer and asserted any defenses.” Tucker v. Fayetteville State Univ., \nNo. COA10-726, 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS 613, *4–5 (Apr. 5, 2011). \nC. Unlawful Sale or Solicitation of Unregistered Securities \n47. As a separate cause of action, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated \nG.S. § 78A-24, which provides that “[i]t is unlawful for any person to offer or sell any \nsecurity . . . unless (i) it is registered under this Chapter, (ii) the security or \ntransaction is exempted [under this Chapter], or (iii) it is a security covered under \nfederal law. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 135–42.) Plaintiff alleges that SAW’s capital contribution \nand membership in Aimet and the  Notes “were required to have been registered by \nChapter 78A (Section 78A-24) of the North Carolina General Statutes and by Federal \nlaw, but were not registered [or exempted].” (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 136–37.) \n48. Since the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that \nthe capital contribution to Aimet and the Notes are s ecurities under the NCSA, \nPlaintiffs’ claim that Sturrus, Gallatin, and Aimet violated the NCSA through the \nunlawful solicitation and sale of unregistered securitie s also must survive.  \nAccordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ fourth claim for relief (Ver. \nCompl. ¶¶ 135―42) should be DENIED. \nD. Fraud \n \n \n49. Defendants seek dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims for fraud in violation of \nG.S. § 78A-56(1),7 and common law fraud. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 120–32, 133–34.) Plaintiffs \nallege that Sturrus fraudulently represented that Gallatin would make its full \n$375,000 capital c ontribution to Aimet , at the same time SAW made its capital \ncontribution.  Plaintiffs allege that Sturrus represented that Gallatin would make \nthe full contribution by October 31, 2015,  to induce Wordsworth’s execution of the \nAmended Note. Defendants contend th at Plaintiffs have not alleged  fraud with the \nparticularity as required by Rule 9(b), that Sturrus’s representations were \nstatements of future intent and cannot be the basis of a fraud claim , and that \nPlaintiffs could not reasonably have relied on Sturrus’ statements in executing the \nNotes because Plaintiffs were members of Aimet and had access to Aimet’s books and \nrecords. (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 17―21.) \n50. An action under G.S. § 78A-56(1) “sounds in fraud, comparable to \ncommon law fraud” and “must include allegations and proof typical of common law \nfraud claims.”  Highwoods Realty Ltd. , 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11 at **29, 30. The \nelements of a claim under G.S. § 56(a)(1) “closely parallel [] the Rule 10b-5 antifraud \n                                                 \n7 Although Plaintiffs titled this claim “Violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 78A-56(2),”they appear \nto have intended to invoke G.S. § 78A-56(1), alleging that “Sturrus, Aimet, and Gallatin . . .  \nemployed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud SAW and Wordsworth and induced them to \npurchase equity securities and the Debt Securities, respectively”; that Sturrus’s statements \nwere known to be false and intended to deceive Plaintiffs; and  the statements were “relied \nupon” by Wordsworth (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 121, 122, 127); Stanback v. Stanback, 297 N.C. 181, \n202, 254 S.E.2d 611, 625 (1979) (“when the allegations in the complaint give sufficient notice \nof the wrong complained of an incorrect choice of legal  theory should not result in dismissal \nof the claim if the allegations are sufficient to state a claim under some legal theory ”); N.C. \nState Ports Auth. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 32 N.C. App. 400, 407–08, 232 S.E.2d 846, 852 \n(1977), aff’d, 294 N.C. 73, 240 S.E.2d 345 (1978) (holding that a court may grant any relief to \nwhich a party is entitled, regardless of whether it has been demanded in the pleadings, for \n“it is not a crucial error to demand the wrong relief”).  \n \n \nprovision of the Securities Exchange Act.” Id. at *33. “[T]he elements of a cause of \naction under Rule 10b-5 include: (1) the making of a false statement or omission of \nmaterial fact or the use of a fraudulent device in connection with the purchase or sale \nof any security; (2) made with scienter; (3) upon which the purchaser justifiably relies; \nand (4) proximate causation.” Id.; see also Piazza v. Kirkbride, 785 S.E.2d at 709, 2016 \nN.C. App. LEXIS 371, at *38–39. \n51. Under North Carolina common law , “[t]o state a claim for fraud, the \ncomplainant must allege with particularity: (1) that defendant made a false \nrepresentation or concealment of a material fact; (2) that the representation or \nconcealment was reasonably calculated to de ceive plaintiff; (3) that defendant \nintended to deceive plaintiff; (4) that plaintiff was deceived; and (5) that plaintiff \nsuffered damage resulting from defendant’s misrepresentation or concealment.” \nClaggett v. Wake Forest Univ., 126 N.C. App. 602, 610, 486 S.E.2d 443, 447 (1997). \n52. A claim under G.S. § 78A-56(1), like common law fraud, must be alleged \nwith particularity as required by Rule 9(b) . Highwoods Realty Ltd. , 2013 NCBC \nLEXIS 11 at *35 . The particularity requirement is “met  by alleging time, place and \ncontent of the fraudulent representation, identity of the person making the \nrepresentation and what was obtained as a result of the fraudulent acts or \nrepresentations.” Terry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 85, 273 S.E.2d 674, 678 (1981). “Malice, \nintent, knowledge, and other condition of mind . . . may be averred generally.” G.S. § \n1A-1, Rule 9(b). \n \n \n53. As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs do not allege or argue that Sturrus \nor anyone else made false representations or omissions in inducing W ordsworth to \nprovide the Demand Note. To the contrary, Wordsworth provided the Demand Note \ndespite being informed that Gallatin still had not made its full capital contribution \nto Aimet. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 88–94.) Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs claim that the \nDemand Note was induced by fraud, that claim should be dismissed. \n54. With regard to Plaintiffs’ claims for fraud in inducing SAW’s capital \ncontribution in Aimet and Wordsworth’s execution of the Amended Note, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have alleged their claims for fraud with the required \nparticularity to survive dismissal. Plaintiffs allege d that Sturrus made the false \nmisrepresentations, the dates or approximate dates on which the misrepresentations \nwere made, and the content of those misrepresentations. While Plaintiff did not allege \nthe specific locations at which the misrepresentations were made, it can be implied \nthat they were made in and around Eastern North Carolina. Finally, Plaintiffs allege \nthat the misrepresentations induced SAW to  make the equity investment in Aimet \nand induced Wordsworth to execute the Amended Note for Aimet’s benefit.  \n55. Defendants also argue that Sturrus never represented that Gallatin had \nmade its full capital contribution but only that it would make the contribution, and, \naccordingly, “the ‘false’ statement related to Gallatin’s future performance, not a then \nexisting fact.” (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 19.)  In connection with  soliciting \nSAW’s capital contribution to Aimet, however, Plaintiffs allege that Sturrus \nrepresented that Gallatin would make an “equal investment in Aimet on equal terms” \n \n \nwith SAW. (Ver. Compl. ¶ 40.)  Plaintiffs further provide that Sturrus did not disclose \n“that Gallatin’s purchase . . . would be delayed, would not be on a cash basis, or that \nGallatin would receive its ownership interest or voting rights in Aimet without first \npaying the amount shown on the capital tables  . . . [i]nstead all of Sturrus’ \ncommunications and all documentation . . . reflected Gallatin’s intent and obligation \nto purchase its equity securities from Aimet  before or contemporaneously with its \nreceipt of its ownership interest or voting interest in Aimet.” (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 46–47.) \nIn addition, Plaintiffs allege t he capital tables  presented by Sturrus to Plaintiffs , \nincluding the final table in the Operating Agreement , indicated that Gallatin was \nmaking a cash contribution. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 44, 56–57.) These allegations sufficiently \nallege statements of existing fact, and not future intent, to survive dismissal at this \nstage of the litigation. \n56. Even if Sturrus’s representations  were characterized as statements \nregarding future events , Plaintiffs have alleged that Sturrus made the statements \nknowing that they were false and with no intention that Gallatin would make its full \ncapital contribution.  (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 122, 126―27.)  “As a general rule, a mere \npromissory representation will not support an action for fraud. However, a \npromissory misrepresentation may constitute actual fraud if the misrep resentation \nis made with intent to deceive and with no intent to comply with the stated promise \nor representation.” Braun v. Glade Valley Sch., Inc., 77 N.C. App. 83, 87, 334 S.E.2d \n404, 407 (1985) (citations omitted); McKee v. James, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 33, *26 (N.C. \n \n \nSuper. Ct. July 24, 2013).  Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the misrepresentations \nwould support a claim for fraud. \n57. Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs could not reasonably have relied \non representations that Sturrus made after SAW became a me mber of Aimet and \nWordsworth became a member of Aimet’s Board of Managers  because Plaintiffs had \naccess to Aimet’s books and records and could have discovered that Gallatin had n ot \nmade its full contribution. (Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 20 –21.) This argument \nwould only apply to Plaintiffs’ fraud claim based on Wordsworth’s execution of the \nAmended Note on October 30, 2015, and not the capital contribution to Aimet. \nAlthough Defendants make scant argument in support of this contention and cite to \nno auth ority, they apparently  are relying on  the principal that “when the party \nrelying on the false or misleading representation could have discovered the truth \nupon inquiry, the complaint must allege that he was denied the opportunity to \ninvestigate or that he could not have learned the true facts by exercise of reasonable \ndiligence.” Hudson-Cole Dev. Corp. v. Beemer , 132 N.C. App. 341, 346, 511 S.E.2d \n309, 313 (1999). Plaintiffs’ allege Wordsworth executed the Amended Note on October \n30, 2015, based on Sturrus’s statement that Gallatin would make its full contribution \nby October 31, 2015. Wordsworth could not have discovered that Sturrus’s \nrepresentation was false by reviewing Aimet’s books on or before October 30, 2015. \nDefendants’ argument based on Plaintiffs’  alleged lack of reasonable diligence must \nfail at this stage of the case. \n \n \n58. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss Plaintiff’s claims for fraud in violation of the NCSA (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 120–32) \nand common law fraud (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 133–34) should be DENIED. \nD. Vicarious Liability \n59.  Plaintiffs allege as a separate “claim” th at Gallatin and Aimet should \nbe vicariously liable for Sturrus’s conduct. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 143–51.)8  Under common \nlaw, “a principal will be liable for its agent’s wrongful acts under the doctrine of \nrespondeat superior when the agent’s act (1) is expressly authorized by the principal; \n(2) is committed within the scope of the agent’s employment and in the furtherance \nof the pr incipal’s business; or (3 ) is ratified by the principal.” White v. Consol. \nPlanning, Inc., 166 N.C. App. 283, 296, 603 S.E.2d 147, 157 (2004).  Plaintiffs allege \nrepeatedly that at all times Sturrus was acting as a partner and agent of Gallatin, \nand as an officer, employee, and agent of Aimet. (See, e.g., Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 144–46.) \n60. Plaintiffs also allege that Gallatin is liable under G.S. § 78A-56(c), which \nimposes secondary liability on, inter alia, (1) persons who “control” a person found \nliable under G.S. §§  78A-56(a) or (b), including “every partner, offi cer, or director of \nthe person,” and (2) those who “materially aid[] in the transaction giving rise to the \nliability.” (Ver. Compl. ¶ 117.) Plaintiffs do not expressly allege that Gallatin or Aimet \nhad “cont rol” over, or provided any material aid, to Sturrus in soliciting the \n                                                 \n8 To the extent Plaintiffs allege common law vicarious liability against Gallatin and Aimet, \nsuch liability apples only to Plaintiffs’ claim for common law fraud.  As discussed infra, the \nclaims under the NCSA are controlled by the statutory requirements for imposing secondary \nliability. See G.S. § 78A-56(c). Plaintiffs do not argue that Gallatin and Aimet can be liable \nfor violations of the NCSA under common law vicarious liability. \n \n \ntransactions with Plaintiffs. Plain tiffs, however, do allege that Sturrus was  a \nprincipal in both Gallatin and Aimet;  that both entities “knew of the false and/or \nmisleading nature of Sturrus’s actions, inactions, conduct, and representations”; and, \nboth entities benefitted from and ratified Sturrus’s actions. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 148, 150.) \nThe Court, under a liberal construction, finds that the Verified Complaint “broadly \nbut adequately alle ges” that Gallatin and Aimet controlled Sturrus and “put \nDefendants on notice of Plaintiffs’ claim for secondary liability” against them under \n§ 78A-56(c). Atkinson v. Lackey, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 21, **27–28 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. \n27, 2015).  \n61. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged grounds for \nimposing common law vicarious liability on Gallatin and Aimet on the claim for \ncommon law fraud, and for secondary liability against Gallatin and Aimet under G.S. \n§ 78A-56(c). Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for vicarious liability \nagainst Gallatin and Aimet should be DENIED.   \nE. Partnership Liability \n62. Plaintiffs also allege a claim for “partnership liability” against \nAlexander and Gallatin GP based on Sturrus’s conduct. (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 152–54.) “It \nis fundamental that ‘[e]very partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of \nits business,’ and that a partnership is generally bound by acts of a partner done to \nfurther the business of the partnership.” Hedgecock Builders Supply Co. v. White, 92 \nN.C. App. 535, 543, 375 S.E.2d 164, 170 (1989) (quoting G.S. §59-39(a)). Partnership \nliability may lie when (1) the partner was acting on behalf of the partnership and was \n \n \nauthorized to so act; or (2) the partners, with knowledge of the transaction, thereafter \nratified the acts of their partner. Id. at 543–44, 375 S.E.2d 164, 170. \n63. Plaintiffs allege that “Sturrus, Alexander, and [Gallatin GP] , as \npartners of [Gallatin LP], are liable to SAW and to Wordsworth to the same extent as \n[Gallatin LP].” (Ver. Compl. ¶ 153.) Defendant s make no substantial argument in \nsupport of dismissal of the allegations of partnership liability. \n64. The Court finds it premature to determine whether  Alexander and \nGallatin GP are liable to the same extent as Sturrus un der a theory of partnership \nliability. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ claim  for partnership liability \nagainst Alexander and Gallatin GP should be DENIED. \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that:  \n65. To the extent Plaintiffs allege claims for fraud in violation of the NCSA \n(Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 120 –32) and common law fraud (Ver. Compl. ¶¶ 133 –34) based on \nWordsworth’s execution of the Demand Note, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \nGRANTED. \n66. Except to the extent granted herein, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Verified Complaint is DENIED. \nThis the 25th day of August, 2017.  \n \n     /s/ Gregory P.
