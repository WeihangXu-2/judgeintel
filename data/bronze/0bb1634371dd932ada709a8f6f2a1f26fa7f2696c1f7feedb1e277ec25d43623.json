Gen. Stat. § 7A-\n45.4, and assigned to the undersigned Special Superior Court Judge for Complex \nBusiness Cases by Order of the Chief Special Superior Court Judge for Complex \nBusiness Cases, is before the court for determination of the Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss (“Motion”) all but the First Cause of Action alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint, \npursuant to the provisions of Rule 12(b)(6), North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure \n(“Rule(s)”); and \n THE COURT, having considered the Defendants’ Motion, the arguments and \nbriefs in support of and in opposition to the Motion, and appropriate matters of record, \nCONCLUDES that the Motion should be DENIED, for the reasons stated herein. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \n[1] This civil action was filed by Plaintiff on July 3, 2008.  As it currently is \npostured, the Complaint alleges five Causes of Action (“Claim(s)”): First Claim – Breach \nof Contract; Second Claim – Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair \nDealing; Third Claim – Breach of Fiduciary Duty; Fourth Claim – Civil Conspiracy; and \nFifth Claim – Punitive Damages.1 \n[2] Defendants seek dismissal of Claims Two through Five as a matter of law. \nII. \n \nFACTS \n \nAmong other things, the Complaint alleges that: \n[3] Plaintiff Mark W. Oakeson (“Oakeson ”) is a citizen and resident of Durham \nCounty, North Carolina.  At times material, he was an officer, shareholder and member \nof the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Defendant TBM Consulting Group, Inc. (“TBM”). \n[4] Defendant TBM is a Delaware corpor ation, with its principal place of \nbusiness in Durham County, North Carolina. \n[5] Defendant Anand Sharma (“Sharma”) is and at all times relevant to this \naction was the President, majority shareholder and a Board member of TBM, and was \nacting as an agent of and with full authority of TBM. \n[6] Defendant Gary Hourselt (“Hourselt”) is  and at all times relevant to this \naction was an officer, shareholder and Board member of TBM, and was acting as an \nagent of and with the full authority of TBM. \n[7] Defendant William Schwartz (“Schwart z”) is and at all times relevant to \nthis action was an officer, shareholder and Board member of TBM, and was acting as \nan agent of and with the full authority of TBM.  \n                                                 \n1 The Complaint initially contained a Sixth Claim – Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices.  However, by \nnotice dated September 24, 2008, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his Sixth Claim pursuant to Rule 41(a). \n[8] Defendant Dan Sullivan (“Sullivan”) is and at all times relevant to this \naction was an officer, shareholder and Board member of TBM, and was acting as an \nagent of and with the full authority of TBM. \n[9] In or about December 1992, Plai ntiff and TBM entered into a written \nshareholder agreement (“Shareholder Agreement”).2  Under the terms of the \nShareholder Agreement, and in consideration therefore, Plaintiff became a twenty-two \npercent (22%) shareholder in TBM; and was employed and compensated as Vice-\nPresident and an employee of TBM. \n[10] Plaintiff operated under the Shareholder Agreement until January 14, \n2004, when the shareholders of TBM entered into a Waiver and Modification of \nShareholders Agreement (“Modified Shareholder Agreement”)3 (the Shareholder \nAgreement and the Modified Shareholder Agreement collectively are the “Shareholder \nAgreements”), in order to allow certain shares of TBM to be transferred to a TBM \nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).  Thereafter, while Plaintiff was still a \nshareholder of TBM under the terms of the Modified Shareholder Agreement, the \nPlaintiff and TBM entered into an Employment Agreement (“Employment Agreement”).\n4 \n[11] As part of the consideration for the Employment Agreement, the Plaintiff \nand TBM mutually agreed in writing as follows: \n(a) Plaintiff’s term of employment was to be for a period of five (5) \nyears beginning on January 1, 2004, and ending on January 1, 2009. \n(b) Plaintiff was to continue his role  as the Vice-President of TBM. \n                                                 \n2 Compl., Ex. A. \n3 Id., Ex. B. \n4 Id., Ex. C. \n(c) Plaintiff was to receive a guaranteed base salary of $330,000 per \nyear through January 1, 2009, plus bonus compensation as enumerated more \nspecifically in the Employment Agreement. \n(d) Plaintiff was to receive medica l benefits through January 1, 2009, \nplus annual paid vacation, country club membership and 401K matching \ncontributions. \n(e) The Employment Agreement coul d be terminated only by TBM “for \ncause.”  Specifically, paragraph 12 provides: \n12. Termination by Company .  Other than as described in \nparagraph 5 or paragraph 11 her eof, this Agreement may be \nterminated by the company only for cause at any time by giving \nthirty days written notice of term ination to the Employee. “Cause” \nfor termination of the employee by the company shall be limited to: \n \na. refusal to carry out the legitimate, proper and \nmaterial duties assigned to him by the board of \ndirectors of the Company, which refusal shall \nhave continued for a period of at least thirty \n(30) days, or breach of any one or more of the \nmaterial provisions of this Agreement, which \nfailure, refusal or breach shall have continued \nfor a period of at least thirty (30) days after \nsuch notice from the Company describing such \nfailure, refusal or breach in reasonable detail; \nb. conviction of, or pleading guilty or nolo \ncontendere to any felony; \nc. final judgment by any court of competent \njurisdiction that the Employee has committed \nan act or omission of willful malfeasance or any \nact of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation \nof funds, breach of fiduciary duty or other act of \ndishonesty against the Company or any \naffiliate, any customer or supplier of the \nCompany or any affiliate, or any shareholder or \nemployee of the Company or any affiliate. \n \n[12] Thereafter, Plaintiff continued as a thirteen and one-half percent (13.5%) \nshareholder of TBM, a Board member of TBM and as Vice-President of Global \nConsulting for TBM. \n[13] Throughout 2004, Sharma consistently  requested that Plaintiff restructure \nthe Shareholder Agreements with TBM, which Plaintiff refused to do. \n[14] The domestic consulting work by TB M was split into two teams, US East \nand US West.  Plaintiff was placed in charge of the US East team with five consulting \nteams directly under his management and supervision, and Sullivan was placed in \ncharge of the US West team.  Plaintiff alleges that his global consulting obligations, field \ncontact and opportunities were drastically reduced as a result of this assignment. \n[15] In mid-2004, Sharma shifted two US East consulting teams under Plaintiff \nto the US West team. \n[16] Shortly thereafter, Sh arma indicated that the Plaintiff would no longer be \nresponsible for managing any consulting teams and that Plaintiff’s title was being \nchanged to “Vice-President of Client Development,” a new position that had not \npreviously existed. \n[17] Throughout the remainder of 2004 and 2005, Sharma continued to \nrequest that the Plaintiff restructure his Employment Agreement and Shareholder \nAgreements with TBM, which Plaintiff continued to refuse to do. \n[18] In June 2005, Sharma requested that  Plaintiff meet with him on July 5, \n2005, in Durham, North Carolina.  At the July 5, 2005 meeting, Sharma, for reasons \nunknown to the Plaintiff and without justification, told Plaintiff to resign as a member of \nthe TBM Board and as an officer and employee of TBM by July 31, 2005. \n[19] At the July 5, 2005 m eeting, Sharma alleged that the Plaintiff’s production \nhad fallen and indicated that Sharma, Hourselt, Schwartz, and Sullivan (the “Defendant \nShareholders”) had agreed that they did not want Plaintiff to be there any longer and \nwanted him to resign by the end of July.  During the same meeting, Sharma indicated \nthat he had the support of the Defendant Shareholders to remove Plaintiff as a \nshareholder under the terms of the Shareholder Agreements, and stated that Plaintiff \nshould not resist this effort, and “if you do we will deal with this situation strongly as we \nare resolute in our decision to remove you.”5  In response, Plaintiff stated that he did not \nwish to leave TBM and that he intended to remain with TBM until he retired. \n[20] Faced with Sharma’s demand, and as an alternative to being forced to \nresign, Plaintiff inquired about the possibility of a different employment arrangement that \nwould allow him to remain with TBM.  Plaintiff’s inquiry was rebuffed by Sharma. \n[21] Plaintiff refused to resign fr om TBM and demanded a meeting of all \nShareholders to discuss the demand for his resignation and to demonstrate his \nproductivity to those who wanted him to leave TBM.  Sharma agreed to inform all \nshareholders and members of the Board, and told Plaintiff they would meet again on or \nabout July 8, 2005.  Sharma failed to give the required notice to all shareholders and \nmembers of the Board, and several shareholders were unaware of the meeting and/or \nthe circumstances around it. \n[22] During the meeting on July 8, 2005, Plaintiff met with Sharma and the \nDefendant Shareholders.  Sharma again renewed his demand that Plaintiff resign as a \nBoard member, officer and employee of TBM by July 31, 2005.  Plaintiff again inquired if \nthere were any alternatives that would allow him to remain with TBM, and was again \n                                                 \n5 Id. at ¶ 34. \ntold no.  During this meeting, Plaintiff asked if the reason for asking him to resign was \nhis level of compensation.  Schwartz responded that Plaintiff’s level of compensation \nwas too high, but that compensation was only “half of it, the other half is the direction of \nthe company.”6 \n[23] Sharma and the Defendant Shar eholders agreed among themselves to \nforce Plaintiff to leave TBM for the purpose of making him divest his TBM and ESOP \nstock as required by the Shareholder Agreements. \n[24] Plaintiff again refused to resign as a Board member, officer or employee \nand requested another meeting with all of the Shareholders upon his return from an \nupcoming business trip. \n[25] Plaintiff traveled the week of July 11-15 to Naples, Italy, to visit a \nconsulting client of TBM, where he performed his work without incident.  On or about \nJuly 18, 2005, Sharma asked to meet with the Plaintiff and Hourselt at the TBM office in \nDurham prior to a Board meeting scheduled for later that same afternoon. \n[26] During the July 18, 2005 meeting with Sharma and Hourselt, Plaintiff \npresented spreadsheets and other factual information demonstrating his consistent \nproductivity, showing his contribution to TBM.  During the meeting, Sharma asked \nPlaintiff if Plaintiff had reconsidered his resignation.  Sharma also told Plaintiff that the \nDefendant Shareholders had discussed the situation and had decided that they would \nnot accept Plaintiff’s remaining as an employee, and that the only option was for Plaintiff \nto resign as a director, officer and employee of TBM.  Sharma again told Plaintiff that \nSharma and the Defendant Shareholders had the votes to get rid of Plaintiff, so Plaintiff \nmight as well resign.  Sharma told Plaintiff that “he shouldn’t bother to come to the \n                                                 \n6 Id. at ¶ 45. \nBoard meeting”7 that afternoon.  Plaintiff did not attend the Board meeting on July 18, \n2005. \n[27] Feeling he had no other  option, by e-mail on July 18, 2005, Plaintiff \ntendered his resignation as a TBM Board member.  At this time, Plaintiff was still an \nofficer and employee at TBM. \n[28] Plaintiff returned to work  at the Avio facility in Italy.  While at the Avio plant \non or about July 22, 2005, an Avio representative asked Plaintiff for information which \nnecessitated Plaintiff accessing his employee account on TBM’s computer system.  \nFinding that his user name and password no longer worked, he called TBM computer IT \nrepresentative Michael Hunt (“Hunt”). \n[29] Hunt indicated that  he had been given a directive by Sharma to “not let \n[Plaintiff] into the computer system.”8  Plaintiff was blocked from the necessary and \ncustomary tools to complete his job as an employee of TBM. \n[30] Upon returning to the United States on July 27, 2005, Plaintiff received an \ne-mail and attachment from Sharma.  The attachment, dated July 26, 2005, is a letter \nstating, in part, “[y]ou have tendered your resignation from the [Board] and we have \naccepted that resignation.  We also ask that you tender your resignation as an officer \nand employee of TBM effective as of the close of business, July 31, 2005.”9  Plaintiff did \nnot accept or acknowledge the July 26, 2005 letter. \n[31] On or about July 28, 2005, Plaint iff received a voicemail message from \nSharma, which again demanded that Plaintiff resign as a TBM officer and employee.   \n                                                 \n7 Id. at ¶ 54(d). \n8 Id. at ¶ 62. \n9 Id. at ¶ 69 (citing to Compl., Ex. D.) \n[32] On Friday July 29, 2005, Plaintiff sent an e-mail to Sharma which stated, \n“Effective Friday the 29th I resign as an officer and employee.” 10 \nIII. \nTHE DEFENDANTS’ MOTION \n[33] Dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate when the \ncomplaint fails to state claim upon which relief can be granted.  Rule 12(b)(6). \n[34] When deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) moti on, the well-pleaded allegations of the \ncomplaint are taken as true and admitted, but conclusions of law or unwarranted \ndeductions of facts are not admitted.  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 98 (1970). \n[35] A complaint fails to state a clai m upon which relief can be granted when \neither (a) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim, (b) \nthe complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim or \n(c) some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.  \nJackson v. Bumgardner, 318 N.C. 172, 175 (1986).  However, a complaint should not \nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted unless it (a) \ndoes not give sufficient notice to the defendant of the nature and basis of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, or (b) appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff could not prove any \nset of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.  Sutton v. Duke, 277 \nN.C. at 108. \n[36] When determining whether a compla int states a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court may consider \ndocuments that are the subject of the action and specifically referenced in the \ncomplaint.  See Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60–61 (2001) (“This \n                                                 \n10 Compl., at ¶ 73. \nCourt has further held that when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court may properly \nconsider documents which are the subject of a plaintiff’s complaint and to which the \ncomplaint specifically refers even though they are presented by the defendant.”); \nRobertson v. Boyd, 88 N.C. App. 437, 441 (1988) (“[b]ecause these documents were \nthe subjects of some of plaintiffs’ claims and plaintiffs specifically referred to the \ndocuments in their complaint, they could properly be considered by the trial court in \nruling on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6)”).  Consequently, the documents attached as \nexhibits or otherwise referred to in the Complaint in this action are deemed to be before \nthe court for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes.  \nIV. \nDISCUSSION \nA. \nPlaintiff’s Second Claim – Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \n[37] Defendants contend that in  substance, Plaintiff’s Second Claim is simply a \nway of restating, through the use of tort language, the breach of contract action stated in \nPlaintiff’s First Claim.  In support of their argument, Defendants rely primarily upon the \nseminal case of N.C. State Ports Authority v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 294 N.C. 73 \n(1978), which held that a tort action generally is not supportable as a separate claim \narising from an alleged breach of contract, even if the breach is alleged to be either \nnegligent or intentional.  To support a separate tort claim in the context of a breach of \ncontract action, the plaintiff must allege and prove a claim that is separate and distinct \nfrom the contended contract breach.  Id. \n[38] In response, Plaintiff argues t hat in appropriate circumstances, North \nCarolina recognizes a cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith and fair \ndealing.  He cites various cases supporting his contention, including Richardson v. Bank \nof America, N.A., 182 N.C. App. 531 (2007); Eastway Wrecker Service, Inc. v. City of \nCharlotte, 165 N.C. App. 639 (2004) and Gant v. NCNB, 94 N.C. App. 198 (1989). \n[39] Plaintiff contends that the tota lity of alleged circumstances surrounding \nPlaintiff’s leaving his employment with TBM, as alleged in the Complaint, dictates that \nhis Second Claim is entitled to survive Rule 12(b)(6) scrutiny.  Plaintiff argues that his \nposition is supported by the standard articulated by Chief Justice Sharp in Sutton v. \nDuke, in which the North Carolina Supreme Court adopted and quoted with approval the \nfollowing language from Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957): \n[W]e follow . . . the accepted rule  that a complaint should not \nbe dismissed for failure to st ate a claim unless it appears \nbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in \nsupport of his claim which would entitled him to relief. \n \n Id . at 102. \n \n In Sutton v. Duke, the Court further held that Rule 12(b)(6) “generally precludes \ndismissal except in those instances where the face of the complaint discloses some \ninsurmountable bar to recovery,” quoting from American Dairy Queen Corp. v. \nAugustyn, 278 F. Supp. 717 (1967).  Id. \n Further, the Sutton Court quotes Shull v. Pilot Life Insurance Co., 313 F. 2d 445 \n(5th Cir. 1963), recognizing that survival of a complaint at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage does \nnot \nnecessarily mean that there must be a full-blown trial.   \nUtilizing the “facility of pretrial discovery, the real facts can be \nascertained and by motion for summary judgment (or other \nsuitable device) the trial cour t can determine whether as a \nmatter of law there is any right of recovery on those facts.” \n \nId. at 104. \n \n[40] In the instant action, the allegat ions go beyond a pure and simple contract \nclaim.  Rather, they raise implications of the respective fiduciary duties, if any, between \nshareholders in a closely-held corporate setting, and of possible civil conspiracy.  The \nallegations give sufficient notice of the nature and basis of this Second Claim.  Further, \nupon examination of the totality of facts alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, the court is \nunable to conclude from the face of the Complaint that as a matter of law there is no set \nof facts that might be proven that would support this Claim. \n[41] Accordingly, in his Second Claim, the Plaintiff has stated a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted. \nB. \nPlaintiff’s Third Claim – Breach of Fiduciary Duty \n[42]   By way of this Claim, Plainti ff alleges that the Defendant Shareholders, \nfor themselves and as agents of TBM, failed to discharge their fiduciary duty to Plaintiff \nin his position as a minority shareholder of TBM.  Defendants contend, in substance, \nthat since Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not allege that the Defendants’ conduct harmed \nTBM, his Claim does not pass muster under a Rule 12(b)(6) standard. \n[43] Plaintiff contends that the fiduciary  duty owed by majority shareholders to \na minority shareholder is clear, and that a violation of that duty is actionable when a \nmajority of shareholders, in the absence of good faith, care and diligence, use their \nmajority position to take advantage of a minority shareholder to his injury.  Among other \ncases, Plaintiff relies upon Farndale Co. v. Gibellini, 176 N.C. App. 60 (2006).  Plaintiff \ncontends that Defendants’ statement of the duty is too narrow. \n[44] The court is forced to agree with Plaintiff.  Our courts long have \nrecognized that a controlling corporate shareholder owes a fiduciary duty to minority \nshareholders not to misuse his management power to promote his personal interests. \nIn Freese v. Smith, 110 N. C. App. 28 (1993), the Court of Appeals held: \nAs a general rule, shareholders do not owe a fiduciary duty \nto each other or to the corporati on . . . . However, this rule is \nnot without exception.  In North Carolina, it is well \nestablished that a controlling shareholder owes a fiduciary \nduty to minority shareholders. . . . Once a minority \nshareholder challenges the actions of the majority, the \nburden shifts to the majority to establish the fairness and \ngood faith of [the majority’s] actions. \n \n  Id.  at 37. \n \nEarlier, in Gaines v. Long Manufacturing Co., 234 N.C. 331 (1951), the Supreme \nCourt, quoting from Am. Jur., Corporations, §§ 422-23, held: \n [T]he holders of the majority of the stock of a corporation \nhave the power, by the election of directors and by the vote \nof their stock, to do everything that the corporation can do.  \nTheir power to . . . direct the action of the corporation places \nthem in its shoes and constitutes them the actual, if not the \ntechnical, trustees for the holders of the minority of the stock. \n. . . . The devolution of unlim ited power imposes on holders \nof the majority of the stock a correlative duty, the duty of a \nfiduciary or agent, to the holders of the minority of the stock, \nwho can act only through them – the duty to exercise good \nfaith, care, and diligence to make the property of the \ncorporation produce the larges t possible amount, to protect \nthe interests of the holders of the minority of the stock, and \nto secure and pay over to them  their just proportion of the \nincome and of the proceeds of  the corporate property.  The \ncontrolling majority of the stock holders of a corporation, \nwhile not trustees in a technical sense, have a real duty to \nprotect the interests of the minority in the management of the \ncorporation, especially where they undertake to run the \ncorporation without giving the minor ity a voice therein.  This \nis so because the holders of a majority of the stock have a \ncommunity of interests with the minority holders in the same \nproperty and because the latter can act and contract in \nrelation to the corporate property  only through the former.  It \nis the fact of control of  the common property held and \nexercised, and not the particula r means by which or manner \nin which the control is exercise d, that creates the fiduciary \nobligation on the part of the majority stock holders in a \ncorporation for the minority holders.  Actual fraud or \nmismanagement, therefore, is not essential to the application \nof the rule. \n \n Id. at 344-45. \n \nThe Court in Gaines further observed, quoting from White v. Kincaid, 149 N.C. \n415 (1908), that if it was established that controlling shareholders took action that was  \nnot taken for the benefit of the corporation, or in furtherance \nof its interest, but for t he mere purpose of unjustly \noppressing the minority of the stockholders or any of them, \nand causing a destruction or sacrifice of their pecuniary \ninterests or holders . . . such action could well become the \nsubject of judicial scrutiny and control. \n \nId. at 345. \n \n[45] It ultimately may tu rn out that any motives and/or actions taken by \nDefendants with regard to Plaintiff’s position with TBM were supported by one or more \nlegitimate business reasons and constituted the exercise of good corporate judgment.  If \nso, this Third Claim will fail.  However, in a Rule 12(b)(6) context, the court concludes \nthat the allegations give sufficient notice of the nature and basis of this Third Claim.  \nFurther, the court is unable to conclude from the face of the Complaint that as a matter \nof law there is no set of facts that might be proven that would support this Claim. \n[46] Accordingly, in his Third Claim, th e Plaintiff has stated a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted. \nC. \nPlaintiff’s Fourth Claim – Civil Conspiracy  \n[47] Defendants contend that North Caro lina does not recognize a cause of \naction for civil conspiracy.  They rely upon Toomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. 462 (2002); \nDove v. Harvey, 168 N.C. App. 687 (2005) and Reid v. Holden, 242 N.C. 408 (1955). \n[48] As reflected by the holdings in the above reported decisions, Defendants \nare correct in their assertion that North Carolina does not recognize an independent \ncause of action for civil conspiracy.  However, the reported cases also make it clear that \nwhere there exists a separate but underlying claim for unlawful conduct, a plaintiff also \nmay state a claim for civil conspiracy by alleging that two or more persons came \ntogether in agreement to carry out the unlawful conduct complained of in the separate \ncause of action, and that injury to the plaintiff proximately resulted from the agreement. \nIn Reid, the Supreme Court stated: \nThe gist of the civil action for conspiracy is the act or acts \ncommitted in pursuance ther eof – the damage – not the \nconspiracy or the combination.  The combination may be of \nno consequence except as bea ring upon rules of evidence \nor the persons liable. . . . To create civil liability for \nconspiracy there must have been an overt act committed by \none or more of the conspirators pursuant to the scheme and \nin furtherance of the objective. \n \nId. at 415. \n \n[49] The Complaint in this action al leges that the Defendant Shareholders \nagreed on a combined course of various actions designed to force Plaintiff out of TBM \nin all his corporate capacities, one of those actions resulting in breach of Plaintiff’s \nEmployment Agreement.  It alleges that Plaintiff was injured as a result of those actions.  \nThe court concludes that the allegations give sufficient notice of the nature and basis of \nthis Fourth Claim.  Further, the court is unable to conclude from the face of the \nComplaint that as a matter of law there is no set of facts that might be proven that would \nsupport this Claim. \n[50] Accordingly, in his Fourth Claim, the Plaintiff has stated a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted. \nD. \nPlaintiff’s Fifth Claim – Punitive Damages \n[51] Defendants contend that Plaintiff’ s Claims fundamentally arise out of \ncontract, and that Plaintiff’s Fifth Claim is precluded by the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 1D-15(d), which provides that “punitive damages shall not be awarded against a \nperson solely for breach of contract.”  They inferentially concede that punitive damages \nmay stand when requisite aggravating factors properly are pled, and they argue the \nComplaint does not contain sufficient allegations to support such a Claim. \n[52]  It is clear that North Carolina is cautious in its approach to a punitive \ndamages claim arising from breach of contract.  Notwithstanding this caution, when a \nbreach of contract claim reflects potential fraud or deceit, or other aggravated or \nmalicious behavior, a claim for punitive damages may lie.  Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., 149 \nN.C. App. 672 (2002); Smith v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 96 N.C. App. 295 (1989); \nand Club Car, Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co., 2007 NCBC 10 ¶ 31 (N.C. Super. May 3, \n2007). \n[53] Further, the North Carolina cour ts will recognize a claim for punitive \ndamages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty when it is coupled with the requisite \naggravating factors.  Vanwyk Textile Systems, B.V. v. Zimmer Machinery America, Inc., \n994 S. Supp. 350 (W.D.N.C. 1997).11 \n[54] The Fifth Claim allege s that the Defendants’ actions constituted “malice,” \nwere “willful and wanton” and were based upon a “sense of personal ill will” toward \nPlaintiff.12  When those allegations are viewed in the light of Plaintiff’s First Claim and \nThird Claim, the court concludes that the allegations give sufficient notice of the nature \nand basis of this Fifth Claim.  Further, the court is unable to conclude from the face of \nthe Complaint that as a matter of law there is no set of facts that might be proven that \nwould support this Claim. \n[55] Accordingly, in his Fifth Claim, t he Plaintiff has stated a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted. \nV. \nCONCLUSIONS \n[56] The allegations of Plaintiff’s Se cond, Third, Fourth and Fifth Claims are \nsufficient to give Defendants notice of the nature and basis of each of the Claims. \n[57] The court is unable to conclude as a matter of law that on the face of the \nComplaint there is no set of facts that might be proven that would support each of the \nClaims. \n[58] This case is not appropriate for a determination under Rule 12(b)(6) that \nthere can be no liability to Plaintiff under any of the Claims.  To dismiss any of the \n                                                 \n11 The Plaintiff also contends that on this theory, his Claim for civil conspiracy would support the punitive \ndamages Claim.  However, the evidentiary showing of aggravating factors required to support Plaintiff’s \npunitive damages Claim would be the same whether the underlying supportive Claim arises from breach \nof contract, breach of fiduciary or civil conspiracy.  Consequently, determination of this contention is not \nnecessary to resolving the Defendants’ Motion, and the court does not rule at this time on the issue of \nwhether the civil conspiracy Claim will support the punitive damages Claim. \n12 Compl., ¶ 110. \nClaims at this point would be to “go too fast too soon.”  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. at 108.  \nBy utilizing discovery, Defendants may be able to ascertain “more precisely the details \nof [P]laintiff’s [C]laim[s] and whether he can prove facts which will entitle him to have a \njury decide the merits of his [C]laim[s].”  Id.  If there then exists a good faith contention \nthat Plaintiff cannot prove sufficient facts as to any such Claim, Defendants may utilize \nthe pre-trial procedures of Rule 56, or other suitable procedural device. \nVI. \nORDER \n[59] NOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing CONCLUSIONS, it is \nORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Second, Third, Fourth and \nFifth Claims is DENIED. \n[60] The parties shall confer and s ubmit a Case Management Report with \nregard to this matter, pursuant to Rule 17 of the Business Court Rules, on or before \nSeptember 18, 2009. \n[61] The court will hold a Case Mana gement Conference at 11:00 a.m. on \nSeptember 29, 2009, at the North Carolina Business Court, 227 Fayetteville Street, \nRaleigh, North Carolina 27601. \n[62] In addition to appropriate counsel of  record, the individual parties are \ndirected to attend the Case Management Conference in person.   \nThis the 21st day of August, 2009.
