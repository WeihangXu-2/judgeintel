MCFEE and \nSAVAGE MCFEE, INC., \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nWILLIAM C. PRESLEY; BILL \nSTACKS; SABR LEME, INC.; C. \nPRESLEY PROPERTIES, LLC; \nSTACKS HOLDING, INC.; and CPP \nINTERNATIONAL, LLC, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION  \nON CROSS-MOTIONS FOR \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n \n1. For over a decade, Jacqueline McFee was  CPP International, LLC ’s lead \ndesigner.  CPP fired her in 2015.  Shortly after, she sued it in federal court and then \nagain in  state court  to reclaim and enforce intellectual property rights in artistic \ndesigns that she created while working for the company .  The first suit ended in \ndismissal, but the second suit produced a $7 million default judgment after CPP had \ngone out of business.   \n2. This lawsuit is the third in the trilogy.  Here, McFee has sued not only CPP \nbut also some of its former officers and their personal holding companies.  Among the \ndefendants is William Presley, a past president of CPP.  McFee  alleges that Presley \ntricked her into assigning her intellectual property  rights to CPP during her \nemployment and that he fraudulently conveyed  CPP’s assets to av oid paying her \njudgment.  Presley denies all of this and faults McFee for having waited years to bring \nclaims that he contends are stale under governing statutes of limitations. \nMcFee v. Presley, 2023 NCBC 89. \n3. McFee and Presley ha ve filed cross -motions for summary judgment .1  For \nthe following reasons, the Court GRANTS  Presley’s motion and DENIES McFee’s \nmotion.  \nTerpening Law P.L.L.C., by William R. Terpening and Tomi M. Suzuki, \nand Allan Law Firm, PLLC, by Albert P. Allan, for Plaintiffs Jacqueline \nS. McFee and Savage McFee, Inc. \nJohnston, Allison & Hord, P.A., by Kimberly J. Kirk and Katie D. \nBurchette, for Defendants William C. Presley and C. Presley Properties, \nLLC. \nNo counsel appeared for Defendants Bill Stacks, Sabr Leme, Inc., Stacks \nHolding, Inc., and CPP International, LLC. \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  The following background, drawn from the evidence submitted \nby the parties, provides context for the Court’s analysis and ruling only.  \n5. In its heyday, CPP  manufactured and sold all sorts of stationery,  office \nproducts, and school supplies.  It is now dissolved and out of business. \n6. Presley joined CPP in 2000 and soon became its president , CEO, and part \nowner (though he he ld his Class A membership interest indirectly through other \nentities).  He recruited McFee, a friend and former colleague, to work for CPP.  She \n \n1 Technically, McFee and her fellow plaintiff, Savage McFee, Inc. , filed one motion, and \nPresley and his fellow defendant, C. Presley Properties, LLC, filed the other.  Savage McFee \nand C. Presley Properties are  holding companies  wholly owned by McFee and Presley, \nrespectively.  In their briefs, both sides largely ignore these entities.  For simplicity, the Court \nrefers to McFee and her co-plaintiff Savage McFee as “McFee” and refers to Presley and his \nco-defendant C. Presley Properties as “Presley.” \nagreed to become CPP’s lead designer.  (See Presley Dep. 17:3 –4, 22:1–23:17, 27:1–\n28:4, ECF No. 148.3.) \n7. In 2008, McFee became a  Class B  member of CPP with a ten percent \ninterest.  Class B members could not vote on company matters.  Nor did they receive \nregular distributions.  But they had broad rights to inspect CPP’s books and records \nand received annually a balance sheet, a statement of income or loss, and a statement \nof cash flow.  McFee acknowledges that she never exercised her inspection rights and \ntypically did not review  the financial information received from the company .  ( See \nPresley Aff. Ex. 3  §§ 5.1, 6.1, 7.2, 7.3 , ECF No. 147.4  [“Op. Agrmt.”]; McFee Dep.  \n108:7–15, ECF No. 148.2.) \n8. At the same time  that McFee obtained her membership interest , she also \nentered into a written employment agreement.   Most relevant here is s ection 12 , \nwhich deals with  intellectual property  rights related to the designs  that McFee \ncreated during her employment .  She agreed that all intellectual property  arising \nfrom her work would be the “sole and exclusive property” of CPP and assigned to the \ncompany the worldwide right to “license, sell or otherwise control” it .  But she \nretained an option to reclaim  rights to her designs either when CPP stopped selling \nor distributing  them or two years after it stopped producing them.  According to \nMcFee, Presley falsely promised then and later that he would protect her rights and \nensure that CPP reassigned them to her when the time came .  ( See Terpening Aff. \nEx. E § 12, ECF No. 153.5; McFee 2d Aff. ¶¶ 10–13, ECF No. 166.1.) \n9. Over the nex t few years, CPP considered selling its business , but those \nefforts fizzled by 2012.   This seems to have been the turning point in McFee’s \nrelationship with Presley.  In mid -2012, she agreed to amend her employment \nagreement and reduce  her compensation.  T hen, at the start of 2013, sh e and the \nother Class B members abandoned their membership interests.  According to McFee, \nPresley tricked her into doing so by falsely representing that CPP was performing so \npoorly that it had become worthless.  Further salary reductions followed, and in 2015, \nCPP fired McFee.  ( See Terpening Aff. Exs. F–H, ECF Nos. 153.6–.8; McFee 2d Aff. \n¶¶ 9, 18, 20; McFee Dep. 112:16–21, 118:11–13.) \n10. After CPP let her go, McFee made a formal request for reassignment of the \nrights to her designs.  Presley refused, so McFee sued CPP in federal court  in April \n2016.  She claimed that CPP had breached her employment agreement by refusing to \nreassign her rights and that its continued use of her designs amounted to  copyright \ninfringement.  At that point, Presley agreed to re assign the rights to some designs \nbut not many others that McFee believed were rightfully hers .  (See Terpening Aff. \nExs. L, M, ECF No s. 153.12, 153.13.)  The federal court concluded that McFee did \n“not have ownership of the intellectual property rights” at issue , dismissed her \ncopyright claim with prejudice, and dismissed her other claims without prejudice to \nher right to refile in state court.  McFee v. CPP Int’l, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21462, at \n*8, *10 (W.D.N.C. Feb. 15, 2017). \n11. McFee sued CPP in state court in October 2017.  This time, she claimed not \nonly that CPP had breached her employment agreement but also that it had \ndefrauded her by promising to reassign the rights to her designs when it never truly \nintended to do so.  In February 2020, McFee obtained a default judgment in the state \naction against CPP, which included an award of damages and an assignment of \nintellectual property to her as of the date of the judgment .  (See Terpening Aff. Exs. \nO, P, ECF Nos. 153.15, 153.16.)  \n12. Several key events occurred while the state action was pending.  On the day \nafter McFee filed her complaint in that case, CPP sold assets from its arts and crafts \ndivision to a company called Pacon for roughly  $11 million.  CPP then paid some of \nthe proceeds to its secured lender (Wells Fargo), distributed some to Presley, and kept \nthe rest as capital .  At the end of 2017 , Presley stepped down as president and \ntransferred his membership in  CPP to Bill Stacks for a nominal sum .  B usiness \ncontinued under Stacks’s direction but began to decline rapidly, and within eighteen \nmonths or so, CPP was defunct.  In 2019, it defaulted on a line of credit from Wells \nFargo.  After the default, Wells Fargo foreclosed on assets used as collateral and sold \nthem to a company called Bay Sales.  ( See Terpening Aff. Ex. C, ECF No. 153.3; \nPresley Aff. Ex. 13, ECF Nos. 147.14, 181.3; Defs.’ Exs. 4, 6, 7, ECF Nos. 148.5, 148.7, \n148.8, 181.1; Stacks Dep. 24:15–18, ECF No. 153.25.) \n13. In this action, McFee has sued Presley for fraud, unjust enrichment, breach \nof fiduciary duty, and constructive fraud.  She also claims that the asset sale to Pacon \nand the foreclosure sale to Bay Sales were fraudulent transfer s under N.C.G.S. \n§§ 39-23.4(a)(1) and 39-23.5(b), for which she seeks to pierce CPP’s veil to hold Presley \nliable.  (Am. Compl., ECF No. 98.) \n14. Discovery has closed.  Both McFee and Presley have moved for summary \njudgment on all claims .  ( See ECF Nos. 148, 154.)  Their motions have been fully \nbriefed, and the Court held a hearing on 11 October 2023.  The motions are ripe for \ndecision. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n15. Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact an d that any party is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In ruling on a motion \nfor summary judgment, the Court must consider the evid ence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party, draw ing all inferences in the nonmoving party’s \nfavor.  See, e.g., Morrell v. Hardin Creek, Inc., 371 N.C. 672, 680 (2018). \n16. The moving party “bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of \na genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, \n579 (2002).  If the moving party carries this burden, the opposing party “may not rest \nupon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings,” N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e), but must \ninstead “come forward with specific facts establishing the prese nce of a genuine \nfactual dispute for trial,” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 356 N.C. at 579.  “An issue is ‘genuine’ \nif it can be proven by substantial evidence and a fact is ‘material’ if it would constitute \nor irrevocably establish any material element of a claim or defense.”  Lowe v. \nBradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369 (1982) (quoting Bone Int’l, Inc. v. Brooks, 304 N.C. 371, \n374–75 (1981)). \n17. “When the party with the burden of proof mo ves for summary judgment, a \ngreater burden must be met.”  Almond Grading Co. v. Shaver, 74 N.C. App. 576, 578 \n(1985).  The moving party “must show that there are no genuine issues of fact, that \nthere are no gaps in his proof, that no inferences inconsistent with his recovery arise \nfrom the evidence, and that there is no standard that must be applied to the facts by \nthe jury.”  Parks Chevrolet, Inc. v. Watkins, 74 N.C. App. 719, 721 (1985); see also \nKidd v. Early, 289 N.C. 343, 370 (1976) .  For that reason, it is “rarely  . . . proper to \nenter summary judgment in favor of the party having the burden of proof.”  Blackwell \nv. Massey, 69 N.C. App. 240, 243 (1984).   \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n18. A hard truth in civil litigation is that those who sleep on their rights lose \nthem.  “Statutes of limitations are inflexible and unyielding,” commanding “that \nlitigation be initiated within the prescribed time or not at all.”  Shearin v. Lloyd, 246 \nN.C. 363, 370 (1957).  The intent isn’t to punish plaintiffs for procrastinating.  It is to \nshield the accused “against stale demands.”  Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, \nInc., 370 N.C. 1, 5 –6 (2017) (quoting Shearin, 246 N.C. at 371).  Time, after all, is a \nthief and a vandal, stealing memories and destroying evidence.   \n19. Whether McFee slept on her rights  is the main issue her e.  She filed this \naction in November 2021, based largely on alleged events that occurred at least four \nand as many as thirteen years earlier.  Although she attributes the delay to a lack of \nawareness (that she didn’t know about the misconduct until just before commencing \nthis action and couldn’t have discovered it sooner), Presley contends that her \ndeposition testimony and the written record show otherwise.  His position is that the \napplicable statutes of limitations and repose bar nearly every claim. \n20. Although timeliness concerns predominate, the parties saved room to argue \nthe merits as well.  For her part, McFee keys on Presley’s role in CPP’s 2017 sale  of \nassets to Pacon, often to the neglect of her other allegations.  Presley neglects nothing, \narguing that McFee lacks evidence to establish essential elements of each claim. \n21. All told, the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment cover every claim \nin the amended complaint.  The Court considers each in turn.  \nA. Fraudulent Transfer \n22. McFee bases her claims for fraudulent transfer on CPP’s asset sale to Pacon \nin October 2017 and the foreclosure sale to Bay Sales in March 2019.  She challenges \neach sale under sections 39-23.4(a)(1) and 39-23.5(b).  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 125, 128, \n129, 132, 133, 137–40.) \n23. Section 39-23.5(b) Claim.  At the hearing, McFee’s counsel conceded that \nher claim under section 39 -23.5(b) is untimely.   The concession is well taken.  A \nplaintiff must bring  a claim under section 39 -23.5(b) “not later than one year after \nthe transfer was made .”  N.C.G.S. § 39-23.9(3).  McFee brought her claim over four \nyears after the sale to Pacon and over two years after the sale to Bay Sales, entitling \nPresley to summary judgment. \n24. S ection 3 9-23.4(a)(1) Claim—Pacon Transaction .  The limitations \nperiod for claim s under section 39-23.4(a)(1) is more generous : “not later than  four \nyears after the transfer was made .  . . or, if later, not later than  one year after the \ntransfer . . . was or could reasonably have been discovered.”  N.C.G.S. § 39-23.9(1).  \nMcFee’s challenge to  the Bay Sales foreclosure sale falls comfortably within the \nfour-year window.  Thus, although the parties tangle over the merits of that challenge \n(more on that later), they do not dispute its timeliness.   \n25. The Pacon asset sale, on the other hand, was more than four-years-old when \nMcFee filed suit.  McFee maintains that she became aware of that sale in 2021 and \nsued to challenge it soon after, making her claim timely.  Presley asserts that McFee \nreceived actual notice of the sale in October 2019. \n26. The undisputed evidence favors Presley.  By October 2019, McFee’s earlier \nstate-court lawsuit against CPP had bee n pending for two years.  CPP’s counsel \nmoved to withdraw at that time because the company was no longer doing business \nor replying to inquiries.  In response  to the motion to withdraw , McFee’s counsel \nsurmised that funds may have been “distributed to the owners” of CPP and that the \ncompany likely had not kept “reserves” to cover a potential judgment.  (Hearing Tr., \nECF No. 169.2.)  To assuage those concerns, the presiding judge  ordered CPP’s \ncounsel to give McFee information  about the company’s past and present owners  \nbefore withdrawing.  Within t he information that CPP’s counsel provided was  a \nnotation that the “[e]ffective date of sale to Pacon was 10/26/17.”  ( Defs.’ Ex. 3, ECF \nNo. 148.4.) \n27. McFee objects that this reference to the “sale to Pacon” was too vague to put \nher on notice of the transfer.  But the key information is all there.  She knew that a \nsale had occurred, that the date of the sale was October 2017, and that the buyer was \nPacon.  She also knew, from the stated reasons for the motion to withdraw, that CPP \nwas moribund.  At a minimum, CPP’s disclosure was enough to put McFee on inquiry \nnotice, especially given her  counsel’s suspicions that the company’s  principals had \nabsconded with its assets.  Yet she performed n o diligence at all.  She did not ask \nCPP’s counsel for a more detailed description of  the sale.  Nor did she investigate \npublicly available information, which in cluded a press release t outing Pacon’s \nacquisition of “assets of CPP International, LLC’s Arts and Crafts Division.”  (McFee \nDep. Ex. 3.)   \n28. As a result, McFee’s challenge to the Pacon sale under section 39-23.4(a)(1) \nis untimely.  No reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.  See, e.g. , Pembee Mfg. \nCorp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co. , 313 N.C. 488, 493 (1985) (concluding that claim was \nbarred by statute of limitations when plaintiff “was put on inquiry as to the nature \nand extent of the problem” but “failed to inform itself”); KB Aircraft Acquisition, LLC \nv. Berry, 249 N.C. App. 74, 89 (2016) (concluding t hat claim for fraudulent transfer \nwas time -barred when information available to plaintiff  “was enough to cause a \nreasonable person” to investigate). \n29. Section 39-23.4(a)(1) Claim—Bay Sales Transaction.  The only part of \nMcFee’s claim for fraudulent transfer that isn’t time -barred is her challenge to the \nBay Sales foreclosure sale under section 39 -23.4(a)(1).  That section provides as \nfollows: \n (a)  A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is v oidable as \nto a creditor, whether the creditor’s claim arose before or after the \ntransfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor \nmade the transfer or incurred the obligation: \n \n(1)  With intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the \ndebtor;  \n. . . .   \nSee also Fischer Inv. Cap., Inc. v. Catawba Dev. Corp., 200 N.C. App. 644, 658 –59 \n(2009). \n30. Presley seeks summary judgment on two grounds.  The first is that he was \nnot affiliated with CPP at the time of the foreclosure sale and received none of the \nproceeds from it.  (See Presley Aff. ¶ 12, ECF No. 147; Presley Dep. 119:2–19; see also \nMcFee Dep. 159:3 –6 (“Q. Do you have any evidence to support your allegation that \n[Presley] shared in the proceeds and benefits of the Bay Sales transaction?  A. No.”).)  \nMcFee offers no response to this argument and appears to concede the point in her \nbrief in support of her own motion for summary judgment.  ( See McFee Br. in Supp. \nSumm. J. 15, ECF No. 155.) \n31. The second ground is that a foreclosure sale is not a “transfer made . . . by a \ndebtor” within the meaning of section 39-23.4(a)(1).  The statute defines “transfer” to \nmean disposal of an “asset” and goes on to define “asset” to exclude property \n“encumbered by a valid lien.”  N.C.G.S. § 39-23.1(2)(a), (12).  Presley’s evidence shows \nthat the property sold to Bay Sales was collateral that CPP used to secure a line of \ncredit from Wells Fargo and was therefore encumbered by a valid lien.   And it was \nWells Fargo that foreclosed on the collateral and sold it to Bay Sales.  (See Defs.’ Exs. \n4, 5.)  Once more, McFee offers no response. \n32. McFee had the burden “to rebut these arguments by identifying the evidence \nthat supports [her] claim and articulating how that evidence creates a genuine issue \nof material fact for trial.”  Brewster v. Powell Bail Bonding, Inc. , 2020 NCBC LEXIS \n27, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 11, 2020).  She did not carry that burden.  The Court \ntherefore concludes that there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding her \nchallenge to the Bay Sales foreclosure sale under  section 39 -23.4(a)(1) and grants  \nsummary judgment to Presley on that claim.   \nB. Fraud \n33. McFee claims that Presley defrauded her while she was employed by CPP.  \nShe alleges that he promised, at unspecified times between 2008 and 2015, to protect \nher intellectual property rights and to ensure that CPP would reassign them to her \nin keeping with the terms of her employment agreement .  She also alleges that \nPresley induced her to abandon her membership interest in CPP in 2013 by falsely \nrepresenting that the company was worthless.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35, 39, 117.)   \n34. Presley begins by argu ing that the claim is time -barred.  T he statute of \nlimitations for fraud is three years, see N.C.G.S. § 1-52(9), and the limitations period \n“begins to run from the discovery of the fraud or from the time it should have been \ndiscovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence, ” Carlisle v. Keith, 169 N.C. App. \n674, 685 (2005) (citation and qu otation marks omitted) .  Presley’s  position , which \nMcFee denies, is that she knew or should have known of any fraud by the time she \nsued CPP in 2016 and 2017.   \n35. The Court agrees  with Presley.  Soon after CPP fired McFee, she made a \ndemand to reclaim her intellectual property rights  under the terms of her \nemployment agreement.  In McFee’s words, Presley refused that demand and instead \n“attempted to cajole [her] into relinquish ing her design rights” through a formal \nseparation agreement.  (McFee Br. in Supp. Summ. J. 6; see also Terpening Aff. Ex. \nK, ECF No. 153.11 .)  Presley’s refusal is what led her to sue CPP for breach of her \nemployment agreement in federal court in 2016.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 50.)  While \nthat lawsuit was pending, Presley agreed to have CPP reassign some rights to McFee, \n(see Terpening Aff. Ex. M), yet she maintains that he “improperly withheld” other \nrights, (McFee Br. in Supp. Summ. J. 7).  These undisputed facts—which come from \nMcFee’s own account of what happened—show that she knew or should have known \nat that point that Presley had reneged on any alleged promise to ensure the \nreassignment of her rights. \n36. There’s more.  When the federal court dismissed McFee’s claims, she refiled \nin state court  in 2017 , again alleging that CPP had ref used to reassign rights as \nrequired by her employment agreement  and that it h ad pushed her to sign a \nseparation agreement that would have let it keep her rights .  She also added \nallegations that CPP had defrauded her by making promises about her membership \ninterest and intellectual property  rights that it never intended to keep .  ( See \nTerpening Aff. Ex. O.)  In her deposition , McFee testified that she viewed CPP and \nPresley to be “all one in the same” at the time she brought the 2016 and 2017 lawsuits \nand confirmed that her earlier allegations of fraud against it were the same as her \nallegations of fraud against him in this case.  (McFee Dep. 149:8–17, 167:1–12.)  Thus, \nby her own admission, McFee knew about Presley’s alleged fraud when she sued CPP \nin state court in 2017.  Her unequivocal testimony leaves no doubt about that. \n37. It is striking that McFee’s opposition brief never directl y addresses the \ntimeliness of her fraud claim.  At most, she alludes to it in a footnote, urging the Court \nto look past her testimony that she is suing Presley now for the same reasons that \nshe sued CPP in 2017.  ( See McFee Opp’n Br. 12 n.2, ECF No. 165.)  But her \nadmissions are what they are: candid answers to fair questions.   And her testimony \nsimply confirms what the written record already shows.   \n38. In short, McFee has not offered evidence that would create a genuine issue \nof material fact concerning when her fraud claim accrued.  The undisputed evidence \nshows that she knew or should have known about the alleged fraud before filing  her \n2017 lawsuit, and the three-year limitations period therefore expired long before she \nfiled this action in late 2021.2 \n39. Presley also contends that the claim lacks merit .  Fraud has five “essential \nelements”: “(1) False representation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably \ncalculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, \n(5) resulting in damage to the injured party.”  Ragsdal e v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, \n138 (1974).  The plaintiff must show not only that s he actually relied on the \nmisrepresentation but also that her reliance was reasonable.  See Forbis v. Neal, 361 \nN.C. 519, 527 (2007).  In addition, “mere unfulfilled promises c annot be made the \nbasis for an action of fraud”; a promise is fraudulent only when made “with no \nintention to carry it out.”  Williams v. Williams, 220 N.C. 806, 810 (1942). \n \n2 Arguably, McFee should have known of any alleged fraud even earlier.  She admits that she \nmade no effort in 2012 to investigate Presley’s alleged representation that CPP was worthless \neven though she held broad rights to inspect CPP’s financial records at the time.  (See McFee \nDep. 109:17–19.) \n40. Presley denies having made any false representations about CPP’s financial \nstate or false promises regarding McFee’s intellectual property rights.  The evidence, \nhe contends, shows that McFee negotiated her intellectual property rights at \narm’s-length with the advice of counsel.  ( See McFee Dep. 184:12–15.)  It also shows \nthat he and other officers were openly bullish about CPP’s performance in 2012.  (See \nMcFee Dep. Exs. 11, 12 (company -wide e -mails stating that CPP “will be more \nbalanced, profitable” in 2013 and that Presley was “very excited” about its prospects).)  \nAsked to reconcile her allegations with these communications, McFee conceded that \nshe couldn’t and was unable to recall when or where Presley had supposedly told her \nthat CPP was worthless.  (See McFee Dep. 106:9–12, 149:18–150:16.) \n41. These arguments stand unrebutted.  McFee’ s one -paragraph response \nignores Presley’s evidence and makes no attempt to substantiate either the alleged \nmisrepresentation about CPP’s value or the promise to guard her intellectual \nproperty rights.  She has not carried her burden “to come forward with specific facts \nestablishing the presence of a genuine factual dispute for trial.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. , \n356 N.C. at 579. \n42. Worse yet, McFee attempts to resurrect an obsolete theory from her original \ncomplaint: that Presley induced her to abandon her membership interest by falsely \nrepresenting that “others were surrendering their interests” as well.  (McFee Opp’n  \nBr. 21.)  Having scrapped that theory when she amended her complaint, McFee \ncannot rely on it to avoid summary judgment.  See, e.g., Fund 19-Miller, LLC v. Isbill, \n2021 N.C. App. LEXIS 624, at *11–12 (N.C. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2021) (unpublished). \n43. The Court grants Presley’s motion for summary judgment on the claim for \nfraud and denies McFee’s motion. \nC. Unjust Enrichment  \n44. As best the Court can tell, McFee bases her claim for unjust enrichment on \nallegations that she conferred her intellectual property rights and her shares of the \nproceeds from the Pacon and Bay Sales  transactions on Presley without receiving \ncommensurate value in return.  (See Am. Compl. ¶ 144.)  Her briefs, however, ignore \neverything other than the Pacon transaction. \n45. Once again, Presley argues that McFee’s claim is untimely.  The statute of \nlimitations for unjust enrichment is three years.  See N.C.G.S. § 1-52(1).  Our Court \nof Appeals has held that t he clock begins to tick when the wrongful act occurs, not \nwhen it is discovered.  See Stratton v. Royal Bank of Can., 211 N.C. App. 78, 83 (2011) \n(concluding that “ the discovery rule [did]  not apply to [plaintiff’s] conversion and \nunjust enrichment claims”) ; Lau v. Constable, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 10, at *13 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 7, 2017) (“The discovery rule does not apply to an unjust enrichment \nclaim.”). \n46. The Court concludes that  the statute of limitations bars McFee’s claim \nexcept to the extent that it is based on the Bay Sales foreclosure sale, which occurred \nless than three years before McFee filed her complaint.  The Pacon asset sale occurred \nin 2017, and Presley denied McFee’s demand for the reassignment of her intellectual \nproperty rights in 2016 .  The limitations period had expired for purposes of those \nallegations by the time McFee filed her complaint in 2021.   \n47. Turning to the merits, Presley contends that the evidence does not support \nMcFee’s claim assuming any part of it is timely.  He is correct. \n48. “The general rule of unjust enrichment is that where services are rendered \nand expenditures made by one party to or for the benefit of another, without an \nexpress contract to pay , the law will imply a promise to pay a fair compensation \ntherefor.”  Krawiec v. Manly, 370 N.C. 602, 615 (2018) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  But when the parties have made an express contract, the law will not imply \none “with reference to the same matter.”  Vetco Concrete Co. v. Troy Lumber Co., 256 \nN.C. 709, 713 (1962).  As Presley observes, McFee’s employment agreement governs \nher intellectual property rights.  McFee does not challenge the agreement’s validity  \nor otherwise respond to Presley’s argument.   Having failed to respond,  she has \nabandoned any claim for unjust enrichment based on her intellectual property rights. \n49. In addition, McFee must show that she conferred a benefit on Presley  with \nthe “expectation of compensation or other benefit in return. ”  Butler v. Butler , 239 \nN.C. App. 1, 12 (2015); see also JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Browning , 230 N.C. \nApp. 537, 541–42 (2013).  Her claim is the opposite.  She denies having conferred any \nbenefit on Presley and contends instead that  he “transferred $5,050,000 to himself,” \n(McFee Opp’n Br. 22)—that is, he took proceeds that she believes she was entitled to \nreceive from the Pacon and Bay Sales transactions .  Even if true, evidence that \nPresley took for himself “some benefit to which [McFee] believes [she] is rightfully \nentitled” is insufficient to support a claim for unjust enrichment.   KNC Techs., LLC \nv. Tutton, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *36 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, 2019); see also Barrett \nv. Coston, 261 N.C. App. 311, 315 (2018) (affirming order granting motion to dismiss \nwhen “the benefit was allegedly conferred upon Defendant by” someone other than \nthe plaintiff); Caliber Packaging & Equip., LLC v. Swaringen, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 74, \nat *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 31, 2023)  (granting motion t o dismiss claim for unjust \nenrichment). \n50. The Court grants Presley’s motion for summary judgment as to the claim for \nunjust enrichment and denies McFee’s motion. \nD. Breach of Fiduciary Duty & Constructive Fraud \n51. McFee alleges that Presley breached fiduciary duties that he owed to her in \ntwo ways.  One was by duping her into assigning her intellectual property rights  to \nCPP and then failing to guard those rights against encroachment by Pacon and Bay \nSales.  The other was that he took proceeds from th e Pacon and Bay Sales \ntransactions that should have been applied toward the  judgment that she obtained \nin her earlier state -court litigation.  The s ame allegations underlie her claim for \nconstructive fraud.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 103, 104, 112, 113.)   \n52. Breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud are related, though distinct, \ncauses of action.   An essential element of each is the existence of a fiduciary \nrelationship.  To establish a breach of fiduciary duty, McFee must show the existence \nof a fiduciary duty, a breach of that duty, and injury proximately caused by the \nbreach.  See Green v. Freeman , 367 N.C. 136, 141 (2013).  To establish constructive \nfraud, she must show  an additional element: that Presley  sought to benefit himself \nthrough the breach.  See White v. Consol. Plan., Inc., 166 N.C. App. 283, 294 (2004). \n53. A fiduciary relationship exists when a person places special confidence in a \nparty who “is bound to act in good faith and in the best interest of the” person reposing \nthe confidence.  Lynn v. Fannie Mae, 235 N.C. App. 77, 81 (2014).  North Carolina \ncourts recognizes both de jure and de facto fiduciary relationships .  A de jure \nrelationship “arise[s] from legal relations” —attorney–client, principal–agent, and \nsimilar relationships.  S.N.R. Mgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC , 189 N.C. \nApp. 601, 613 (2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  A de facto relationship \nis one that exists “as a fact, in which there is confidence reposed on one side, and the \nresulting superiority and influence on the other.”  Id.  (citation and quotation marks \nomitted). \n54. Constructive fraud  is one of the few claims  untouched by timeliness \nconcerns, and that is because it is subject to a ten -year statute of limitation s.  \nN.C.G.S. § 1-56(a).  This is not so for  breach of fiduciary duty , which is subject to a \nthree-year statute of limitations , and Presley argues that the claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty is time -barred for many of the same reasons as the claims for frau d \nand unjust enrichment .  But b ecause the claim for constructive fraud is \nunquestionably timely and virtually identical  to the claim for breach of fiduciary \nduty, the efficiencies weigh in favor of addressing the parties’ substantive arguments. \n55. The dispositive issue is whether Presley owed McFee a fiduciary duty.  The \namended complaint  alleges three theories  to support the existence of a fiduciary \nrelationship.  After careful review, the Court concludes that none of the three \npresents a triable issue. \n56. McFee’s first theory is that Presley, as an officer of CPP, owed her a fiduciary \nduty during the years in which she held a minority membership interest in the \ncompany.  (See Am. Compl. ¶ 96.)  This is wrong as a matter of law.   Our appellate \ncourts have made clear that officers of an LLC owe a fiduciary duty to the company, \nnot to its members, former members, or employees.  See Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., \n196 N.C. App. 469, 474 (2009).  McFee does not dispute that issue.  \n57. Next, McFee alleges that she was one of CPP’s creditors at the time of the \nasset sale to Pacon and the foreclosure sale to Bay Sales.  She further alleges that \nCPP’s managers, including Presley, owed her a fiduciary duty as a result.   \n58. “When an LLC finds itself in ci rcumstances amounting to a winding -up or \ndissolution, the managers of the LLC owe a fiduciary duty to  the LLC’s creditors to \ntreat members of the same creditor class fairly and equally.”  Insight Health Corp. v. \nMarquis Diagnostic Imaging of N.C., LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 91, at *7 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Oct. 3, 2017).  The manager “is generally prohibited from taking advantage of his \nintimate knowledge of the corporate affairs and his position of trust for his own \nbenefit and to the detriment of the creditors to whom he owes the duty.”  Keener \nLumber Co. v. Perry, 149 N.C. App. 19, 33 (2002). \n59. The undisputed evidence shows that Presley was not a manager at the time \nof the Bay Sales foreclosure sale.   (See Presley Aff. ¶  12; Defs.’ Ex. 3 ; see also  \nTerpening Aff. Ex. C. )  Thus, he could not have owed  a fiduciary duty to CPP’s \ncreditors in connection with that transaction. \n60. The undisputed evidence also shows that  CPP was not “in circumstances \namounting to a winding -up” at th e time of the asset sale to Pacon .  Insight Health, \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 91, at *7.  McFee insists that CPP was insolvent after the sale, \nbut o ur Court of Appeals  has held that “more than balance sheet insolvency is \nrequired in order to impose on directors a fiduciary duty to creditors.”  Whitley  v. \nCarolina Clinic, Inc., 118 N.C. App. 523, 527 (1995) (cleaned up).  The circumstances \nmust be akin to liquidation —such as when a company sells nearly all its property \n“with a view of going out of business.”  Bassett  v. Pamlico Coo perage Co., 188 N.C.  \n511, 512 (1924).   \n61. CPP’s sale of its arts and crafts division to Pacon  was a significant \ntransaction, but it was not a liquidation .  Indeed, CPP conducted the sale with the \napproval of its secured lender, Wells Fargo, on condition that the company would \nretain over $1 million of the proceeds for future operations.  Moreover, CPP continued \nto employ workers, to market products, and to maintain a sizeable line of credit well \ninto 2018.  (See, e.g., McFee Dep. Ex. 2; Presley Dep. 162:15–17; Terpening Aff. Exs. \nI, S, ECF Nos. 153.9, 153.18.)  Because CPP continued to conduct business after the \nasset sale to Pacon, Presley did not owe a fid uciary duty to the company’s creditors.   \nSee Whitley, 118 N.C. App. at 527– 28 (holding that no fiduciary duty existed as to \npayments that “occurred some eight months before the corporation ceased doing \nbusiness”); see also Gen . Fid. Ins. Co. v. WFT, Inc. 269 N.C. App. 181 , 187 (2002) \n(finding that a fiduciary duty arose once company “laid off its las t employees and \nceased operations”). \n62. McFee’s third and final theory is that a de  facto fiduciary relationship \nexisted.  The standard for showing a de facto fiduciary relationship “is a demanding \none.”  Lockerman v. S. River Elec. Membership Corp., 250 N.C. App. 631, 636 (2016).  \n“Only when one party figuratively holds all the cards —all the financial power or \ntechnical information, for example —have North Carolina courts found that the \nspecial circumstance of a fiduciary relationship has arisen.”  Id.  at 637 (citation and \nquotation marks omitted). \n63. No reasonable jury could conclude that a  de facto fiduciary relationship \nexisted.  Yes, Presley was McFee’s boss, co-owner, and friend for many years .  But \nthose relationships are not fiduciary in nature.   In all but extraordinary \ncircumstances, “the relation of employer and employee is not one of those regarded \nas confidential.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 652 (2001).   And “even an intimate \nfriendship” does not give rise to a fiduciary relationship.  rFactr, Inc. v. McDowell , \n2020 NCBC LEXIS 144, at *30– 31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 8, 2020).  Even if true that \nMcFee was not a financial whiz  and that she trusted Presley as a close friend, she \nhas not offered evidence tending to show that he had dominion and control over her.  \nSee Kingsdown, Inc. v. Hinshaw , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 30, at *25 –26 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMar. 25, 2015) (dismissing claim for constructive fraud). \n64. The Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding \nthe existence of a fiduciary relationship.  In the absence of a fiduciary duty, there can \nbe no claim for brea ch.  The Court grants summary judgment in favor of Presley on \nthe claims for breach of fiduciary duty  and constructive fraud and denies McFee’s \nmotion.3  \nE. Veil Piercing \n65. The entry of summary judgment in favor of Presley on every claim for relief \nnecessitates the entry of summary judgment on McFee’s request to pierce CPP’s \ncorporate veil to hold Presley accountable for CPP’s acts.  See Nicks v. Nicks, 241 N.C. \nApp. 487, 497 (2015) (“ There must also be an underlying legal claim to which \n[veil-piercing] liability may attach.”). \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n66. For all these reasons, the Court GRANTS Presley and C. Presley Properties’ \nmotion for summary judgment and DENIES McFee and Savage McFee’s \ncross-motion.  The claims against Presley and C. Presley Properties are DISMISSED \nwith prejudice. \nSO ORDERED, this the 28th day of December, 2023. \n \n \n        /s/ Adam M. Conrad                     \n      Adam M. Conrad \n      Special Superior Court Judge \n        for Complex Business Cases \n \n \n3 One other point bears mention.  McFee alleges that the Bay Sales foreclosure sale harmed \nher because Bay Sales began to sell products using her designs directly and through a \ncompany called Carolina Pad, LLC.  She brought a parallel lawsuit against Carolina Pad in \nfederal court for copyright infrin gement.  Just a few weeks ago,  though, the federal court \ngranted summary judgment in favor of Carolina Pad, holding that its designs were not \n“substantially similar” to McFee’s, and that McFee did not hold copyright registrations for \nthe designs at the time she filed the complaint.  See McFee v. Carolina Pad, LLC, 2023 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 20573, at *8–14 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 16, 2023). "
