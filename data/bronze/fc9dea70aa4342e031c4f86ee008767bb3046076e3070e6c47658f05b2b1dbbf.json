  "raw_text": "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nWAKE COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n20 CVS 10452 \n \nCRAIG FORSYTHE and TAMMY \nFORSYTHE, \n \nPetitioners, \n \nv. \n \nTHE NORTH CAROLINA \nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, \n \nRespondent, \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nRESPONDENT’S MOTION TO \nDISMISS AND PETITIONERS’ \nMOTIONS [CORRECTED] \n \n \n1. This case—involving both a request for judicial review of a contested tax \ncase under N.C.G.S. § 105-241.16 as well as a constitutional challenge to a tax statute \nunder N.C.G.S. § 105 -241.17—has taken a circuitous path to reach this Court.  As \nexplained below, that path —involving the case shifting back and forth between the \nregular docket of the Wake County Superior Court and  the Business Court —is the \nresult of Petitioners Craig and Tammy Forsythe’s (“Petitioners”) failure to timely \ncomply with the procedures of N.C.G.S. § 7A-45.4(d) for mandatory complex business \ncase designation under N.C.G.S. § 7A-45.4(b)(1).  That failure has deprived the Court \nof subject matter jurisdiction to hear Petitioners’ claims under either section 105 -\n241.16 or 105- 241.17, necessitating dismissal of Petitioners’ claims against \nRespondent North Carolina Department of Revenue (the “Department”) with \nprejudice.  \n2. There are presently six motions pending before the Court: \na. Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss  Petitioner’s Petition for Judicial \nReview, (ECF No. 41), (“Respondent’s Motion”); \nForsythe v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 2022 NCBC 49A. \nb. Petitioner’s Motion to Proceed with Judicial Review and Civil Action as \nOrdered, (ECF No. 31); \nc. Petitioner’s Motion to Proceed with Judicial Review and Civil Action in \nthe Alternative, (ECF No. 33); \nd. Petitioner’s Motion to Accept and Continue the Originally Filed Petition \nas Both a Petition for Judicial Review Under N.C.G.S. § 105-241.16 and \nas a Civil Action Under N.C.G.S. § 105-241.17, (ECF No. 35); \ne. Petitioner’s Motion to Reconsider the State Defendants’ Dismissal and \nto Reinstate All State Defendants as Originally Filed, (ECF No. 37); and  \nf. Petitioner’s Motion to Reverse the Office of Administrative Hearings ’ \nFinal Decision Due to Reliance on Invalid Source of Law, (ECF No. 39), \n(together with the motions identified in paragraphs 1(b) –(d) above, \n“Petitioner’s Motions”). \n3. Having considered Respondent’s Motion and Pet itioner’s Motions \n(together, the “Motions), the related briefing, and the arguments of counsel at the \nhearing on the Motion, the Court hereby GRANTS Respondent’s Motion , \nDISMISSES Petitioners’ Petition for Judicial Review with prejudice,  and DENIES \nPetitioner’s Motions as moot, all as set forth below. \nPetitioners Craig Forsythe and Tammy Forsythe, Pro se. \n \nNorth Carolina Department of Justice, by Special Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Ashley Hodges Morgan, for Respondent  North Carolina \nDepartment of Revenue.    \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n4. The Court is required to make findings of fact on a motion under Rule \n12(b)(1) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rule(s)”) only when \nrequested to do so by the parties, see N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 52(a)(2).  No such request \nhas been made here, but the Court nonetheless makes the following findings of fact \nfor purposes of resolving the Motions, all of which are undisputed and fully supported \nby the filings reflected on the Court’s docket and in the Final Administrative Record, \nfiled on 3 August 2022, (ECF No. 49.).    \n5. The Department is an agency of the State of North Carolina responsible \nfor collecting the State’s tax funds and administering the tax laws set forth in \nSubchapter I of Chapter 105 of the North Carolina General Statutes.  N.C.G.S. § \n143B-218.  This matter arises from Petitioners’ challenge to the Department’s denial \nof their request for a refund of the taxes they paid on the retirement benefits \nPetitioner Craig Forsythe received under the North Carolina Teachers’ and State \nEmployees’ Retirement System (“TSERS”) in tax year 2016.1   \n6. Petitioners, proceeding pro se , timely initiated a contested tax case in \nthe Office of Administrative Hearings (“OAH”) challenging the Department’s \ndetermination and, as part of that action, raised a facial constitutional challenge to a \ntax statute, N.C.G.S. § 105 -153.5(b)(5)(a), conte nding that the statute \n \n1 (Resp’t Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss ¶ 2, ECF No. 42); OAH File No. 19 REV 00598 ¶ 2.  \nunconstitutionally delegated State taxing authority to the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina.2   \n7. On 20 August 2020, OAH Administrative Law Judge Tenisha S. Jacobs \nentered a Final Decision granting the Department’s motion for summary judgment, \nconcluding that the Department’s denial of Petitioners’ request for a refund was \nproper, and dismissing Petitioners’ constitutional challenge for lack of jurisdiction.3 \n8. On 16 September 2020, Petitioners, again proceeding pro se, timely filed \na Petition for Judicial Review in Wake County Superior Court raising the same \nrequest for a refund and the same facial constitutional challenge to  section 105 -\n153.5(b)(5)(a) as they did before the OAH. 4  Rather than file a Notice of Designation \ncontemporaneously with their Petition as required by section 7A -45.4(d), however, \nPetitioners did not file a Notice of Designation in this action until 15 October 2020,5 \ntwenty-nine days after the Petition was filed. \n \n2 OAH File No. 19 REV 00598 ¶ 11. \n \n3 OAH File No. 19 REV 00598  at ¶ 12.  \n \n4 (Pet. Judicial Review, ECF No. 2 .)  In addition to the Department, Petition ers named as \nRespondent-Defendants Ronald G. Penny, in his capacity as Secretary of the North Carolina \nDepartment of Revenue; the North Carolina Department of State Treasurer, Dale R. Folwell, \nin his capacity as Treasurer of the State of North Carolina; the North Carolina House of \nRepresentatives, Tim Moore, in his capacity as Speaker of the House, North Carolina General \nAssembly; and the North Carolina Senate, Phil Berger, in his capacity as President Pro \nTempore, North Carolina General Assembly (the “State Respondents”). \n \n5 (Notice Designation, ECF No. 3.) \n9. On 16 October 2020, then -Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina, the Honorable Cheri L. Beasley, entered a Determination Order directing \nthis Court to:  \nascertain whether the action is (1) properly designated as a mandatory \ncomplex business case in accord with N.C.G.S. 7A -45.4(b), and if so, to \nassign the case to a Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business \nCases; or (2) if not so properly designated, to advise the Senior Resident \nSuperior Court Judge of Judicial District 10 so that the action may then \nbe treated as any other civil action, wherein designation as a Rule 2.1 \nexceptional case may be pursued with the Senior Resident Judge.\n6 \n \n10. Later t hat same day, the Court en tered its Order on Designation, \nconcluding that “[t]he contemporaneous filing requirement of section 7A-45.4(d)(1) is \nmandatory, and Petitioners’ failure to comply with that requirement render[ed]  the \nNotice of Designation untimely.”  The Court therefore determined that the action was \n“not properly designated as a mandatory complex business case in accord with \nN.C.G.S. § 7A-45.4(d)(1) and thus [would] not be assigned to a Special Superior Court \nJudge for Complex Business Cases.”  Consistent with the Determi nation Order, the \nCourt also advised “the Senior Resident Superior Court Judge of Judicial District 10 \nthat this action [was] not properly designated as a mandatory complex business case \nso that the action may be treated as any other civil action, wherein designation as a \nRule 2.1 exceptional case may be pursued with the Senior Resident Judge.”7 \n11. The case thereafter proceeded on the regular docket of the Wake County \nSuperior Court.  On 18 November 2020, the Department moved to dismiss the \n \n6 (Determination Order, ECF No. 1.) \n \n7 (Order Designation, ECF No. 4.) \n \nPetition against the Department and the State Respondents. 8  The motion came on \nfor hearing before Wake County Superior Court Judge, the Honorable A. Graham \nShirley, II , on 10 March 2022, and, on 5 April 2022, Judge Shirley dismissed the \nPetition against the State Respondents, stayed the action against the Department \npursuant to N.C.G.S. § 7A -45.4(g), declined to consider dismissal of the Petition \nagainst the Department, and recommended to the Chief Justice that the case be \ndesignated as a mandatory complex business case un der section 7A -45.4(b)(1) and \nassigned to a Business Court Judge.9   \n12. On 27 April 2022, the  Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina, the Honorable Paul M. Newby, issued an order designating this case as \n“mandatory complex business,” pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 7A -45.4(b).10  The case was \nthereafter assigned to the undersigned.11     \n13. The parties filed the Motions on 1 July 2022, and after full briefing, the \nCourt held a hearing on the Motions on 1 September 2022. 12  The Motions are ripe \nfor resolution.   \n \n8 (Order ¶ 9; ECF No. 8.) \n \n9 (Order ¶¶ 10–23, ECF No. 8.) \n \n10 (Designation Order, ECF No. 6.) \n \n11 (Assignment Order, ECF No. 7.) \n \n12 (Am. Notice Hr’g, ECF No. 44.) \n  \nII. \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \n14. The Court first addresses Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss , which \nchallenges the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction to consider the matters raised in \nthe Petition under Rule 12(b)(1).13   \n15. “Subject-matter jurisdiction . . . refers to a tribunal’s ‘power to hear a \ncase[.]’ ”  Union Pac. R.R. v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen Gen. Comm. of \nAdjustment, 558 U.S. 67, 81 (2009) (citations omitted); see Catawba Cty. v. Loggins, \n370 N.C. 83, 88 (2017) (defining subject matter jurisdiction as “ ‘[j]urisdiction over \nthe nature of the case and the type of relief sought’ “)  (citations omitted; alteration \nin original).  Rule 12(b)(1) “requires the dismissal of any action ‘based upon a trial \ncourt’s lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim.’ ”  Watson v. Joyner -\nWatson, 263 N.C. App. 393, 394 (2018) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)).  In ruling on \na motion under Rule 12 (b)(1), the Court must “view the allegations [of the petition] \nas true and the supporting record in the light most favorable to the non -moving \nparty.”  Mangum v. Raleigh Bd. of Adjustment, 362 N.C. 640, 644 (2008).   \n16. Here, the relevant facts are not in dis pute and are dispositive.  \nPetitioners have sought judicial  review of the OAH’s determination to uphold the \nDepartment’s denial of Petitioners’ refund request.  Petitioners’ request for judicial \nreview is therefore governed by section 105-241.16.  In the same Petition, Petitioners \nseek to advance their facial constitutional challenge to section 1 05-153.5(b)(5)(a).  \n \n13 (Resp’t’s Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 41.) \nPetitioners’ constitutional challenge to this tax statute is therefore subject to the \nrequirements of section 105-241.17.14   \n17. Both sections requ ire that a taxpayer comply with the designation \nprocedures and requirements of section 7A -45.4(b)–(f) as a mandatory pre condition \nto proceed under each section.  See section 105-241.16 (“a petition for judicial review \nmust be filed in the Superior Court of Wake County and in accordance with the \nprocedures for a mandatory business case set forth in G.S. 7A -45.4(b) through (f)”); \nsection 105-241.17 (“In filing an action under this section, a taxpayer must follow the \nprocedures for a mandatory business case set forth in G.S. 7A-45.4(b) through (f).”).   \n18. The requirement to comply with section 7A-45.4(b)–(f) is jurisdictional, \nnot discretionary.  See In re State ex rel. Employment Sec. Com., 234 N.C. 651, 653 \n(1951) (an administrative “appeal must conform to the statute granting the right and \nregulating the procedure.  The  statutory requirements are mandatory and not \ndirectory.15  They  are conditions precedent to obtaining a review by the courts and \nmust be observed.  Noncompliance therewith requires dismissal.”) (cleaned up); \n \n14 The Court recognizes that section 105- 241.16 concerns a petition for judicial review in \nwhich the trial court sits as an appellate court engaging in de novo review, see, e.g., Meza v. \nDiv. of Soc Servs., 364 N.C. 61, 75 (2010) (when the trial court “exercises judicial review over \nan agency’s final decision, it acts in the capacity of an appellate court”) (cleaned up), while \nsection 105- 241.17 concerns a civil action in the trial division in the first instance.  For \ncurrent purposes, the Court assumes w ithout deciding that the Petition suffices to advance \nPetitioners’ claims under both sections. \n \n15 A “directory statute” is “a law that indicates only what should be done, with no provision \nfor enforcement.”  Statute, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019); see also Catawba Cty. v. \nLoggins, 370 N.C. 83, 95 (2017) (“ ‘Generally speaking, those provisions which are a mere \nmatter of form, or which are not material, do not affect any substantial right, and do not \nrelate to the essence of the thing to be done so that compliance is a matter of convenience \nrather than substance, are considered to be directory.’ ”) (citing State v. House, 295 N.C. 189, \n203 (1978)). \nReynolds v. Motley, 96 N.C. App. 299, 304 (1989) (no subject matter jurisdiction where \nstatutory prerequisite unsatisfied). \n19. Section 7A -45.4(d) expressly and unambiguously requires that “[t]he \nNotice of Designation shall be filed: (1) by the plaintiff  . . . or the petitioner for judicial \nreview contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint . . . or the petition for \njudicial review in the action.”  See, e.g., MDG Constr. Servs., Ltd. v. MDG Roofing & \nContracting, LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 80 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 29, 2019) (determining \ndesignation was improper when the notice of designation was filed two days after the \nfiling of the complaint).  It is undisputed  that Petitioners filed their Notice of \nDesignation twenty-nine days after they filed their Petition.  As a result, Petitioners \nhave failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of both sections 105 -241.16 \nand 105-241.17, precluding them from proceeding under either section against the \nDepartment.   \n20. It is well-settled that the State is immune from suit unless it expressly \nconsents to be sued.  E.g., Smith v. State, 289 N.C. 303, 309–10 (1976).  This immunity \nalso extends to “departments, institutions, and Agencies of the State.”  Jones v. Pitt \nCty. Mem’l Hosp., Inc. , 104 N.C. App. 613, 616 (1991).  Given that the State has \nwaived sovereign immunity here only to the extent that the requirements of the \nstatutory sections re ferenced above are met, see RPR & Assocs. v. State, 139 N.C. \nApp. 525, 528 (2000) (“The State’s sovereign immunity is only waived to the extent \nthe procedures prescribed by the statute are strictly followed .”), Petitioners’ failure \nto comply with section 7 A-45.4(d) necessarily divests the Court of subject matter \njurisdiction to hear the issues raised in the Petition.  See, e.g. , Battle Ridge Cos. v . \nN.C. Dep’t of Transp., 161 N.C. App. 156, 157 (2003), rev. denied, 358 N.C. 233 (2004) \n(“Our courts have held  that the defense of sovereign immunity is a Rule 12(b)(1) \ndefense.”).  The Court therefore has no choice but to dismiss the Petition for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).   \n21. And because 7A -45.4(b)(1) mandates that this action —an “action \ninvolving a material issue related to tax law that has been the subject of a contested \ntax case for which judicial review is requested under G.S. 105 -241.16” as well as “ a \ncivil action under G.S. 105 -241.17 containing a constitutional challenge to a tax \nstatute”—can only proceed as a mandatory complex business case before a Business \nCourt Judge, there is no other forum available to Petitioners to advance the claims \nraised in the Petition.   \n22. Accordingly, although “[a] dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is generally \na dismissal without prejudice” to permit a plaintiff to pursue the dismissed claims in \na different forum, N .C. Acupuncture Licensing Bd. v. N.C. Bd. Of Physical Therapy \nExaminers, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 33, *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 26, 2016) , the fact that \nPetitioners cannot cure their procedural default or proceed in an y other forum  \nrequires that Petitioners’ Petition and all claims advanced therein be dismissed with \nprejudice.  See, e.g. , Frigard v. United States, 862 F.2d 201, 204 (9th  Cir. 1988) 16 \n \n16 North Carolina courts routinely look to federal decisions for guidance on procedural \nmatters.  See, e.g., Turner v. Duke Univ., 325 N.C. 152, 164 (1989) (“The North Carolina Rules \nof Civil Procedure are, for the most part, verbatim recitations of the federal rules[,]” so \n“[d]ecisions under the federal rules are t hus pertinent for guidance and enlightenment in \ndeveloping the philosophy of the North Carolina rules”); Harper v. Vohra Wound Physicians \n(affirming dismissal with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where \nplaintiffs could not cure procedural default and “no other court [had] the power to \nhear the case”); Penn v. Army & Air Force Exch. Serv., Civil Action No. 3:21-CV-402-\nL-BK, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124944, *2 (N.D. Tex. Jul. 6, 2021) (dismissing with \nprejudice under Rule 12(b)(1) “because there is no other forum in which Plaintiff can \nbring these claims, and . . . the fatal flaw in Plaintiff's claims in failing to bring them \nin a court of appropriate jurisdiction within the time mandated by the statute, cannot \nbe cured”) ; Cunningham v. General Dynamics Info. Tech., Inc., Civil No. 1:16 -cv-\n00545, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66094, *17 (E.D. Va. May 1, 2017) (“when courts \ndismiss claims on sovereign immunity grounds, they frequently do so with \nprejudice”). \n23. In light of the Court’s ruling, the Court further concludes that it does \nnot have subject matter jurisdiction to hear Petitioners’ Motions and therefore shall \ndeny those motions as moot.  See, e.g., In re T.R.P., 360 N.C. 588, 590 (2006) (“Subject \nmatter jurisdiction is the indispensable foundation upon which valid judicial \ndecisions rest, and in its absence a court has no power to act[.]”); In  re Z.T.B., 170 \nN.C. App. 564, 572 (2005) (“[L]ack of subject matter jurisdiction divests the trial court \nof any authority to adjudicate[.]”).\n \n \nof NY, 270 N.C. App. 396, 403 (2020) (noting that the court “looked to  federal decisions for \nguidance” when interpreting North Carolina’s rules of civil procedure). \n \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n24. WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Court hereby \nGRANTS Respondent’s Motion, DISMISSES Petitioners’ Petition with prejud ice, \nand DENIES Petitioners’ Motions as moot. \nSO ORDERED, this the 9th day of September, 2022. \n \n     /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III     \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Chief Business Court Judge \n \n \n "
