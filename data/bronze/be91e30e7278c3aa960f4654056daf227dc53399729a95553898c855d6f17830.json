Hugh Shelton.\n \n \nI.\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n{3}\n             \nThis shareholder derivative action was filed in Wake County Superior Court on August 18, 2004.\n \nThe case was designated complex business and assigned to the undersigned Special Superior Court Judge\nfor Complex Business Cases by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated\nDecember 29, 2004.\n  \nPlaintiff’s Amended Shareholder Derivative Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) was\nfiled on July 21, 2005.\n{4}\n             \nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss on September 9, 2005, asserting that Plaintiff’s claims should\nbe dismissed for failure to make demand on the corporation prior to filing suit.\n  \nThe Court heard oral\narguments on the motion on February 2, 2006.\n{5}\n             \nSeveral related class actions have been filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina against Red\nHat, Inc. and Matthew J. \nSzulik\n, et al., alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n  \nThose\nactions remain pending.\n \nII.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA.\nTHE PARTIES\n{6}\n             \nPlaintiff Andrew \nEgelhof\n was at one time a common stock shareholder of Red Hat.\n  \nAt oral\nargument Plaintiff’s counsel did not know how many shares \nEgelhof\n owned; nor did he have any other\nknowledge about Plaintiff, whose only contact appears to have been with the “shareholder relations”\ndepartment of Robbins, \nUmeda\n & Fink.\n  \nSubsequent to the hearing, plaintiff’s counsel contacted the Court\nto give notice that, sometime in the previous year, Mr. \nEgelhof\n had in fact sold his shares of stock.\n{7}\n             \nNominal Defendant Red Hat is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of\nDelaware\n, with its headquarters located in \nRaleigh\n, \nWake \nCounty\n, \nNorth Carolina\n.\n  \nRed Hat, one of the\nworld’s leading open source and Linux providers, provides operating system platforms along with\nmiddleware, applications, and management solutions, as well as support, training, and consulting services\nto large global enterprises.\n{8}\n             \nDefendant Matthew J. \nSzulik\n (“\nSzulik\n”) is, and at all relevant times has been, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer of Red Hat and Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n{9}\n             \nDefendant Kevin B. Thompson (“Thompson”) was Executive Vice President, Chief Financial\nOfficer (“CFO”), and Treasurer of Red Hat until he resigned on June 14, 2004.\n{10}\n         \nDefendant Paul J. Cormier (“Cormier”) is, and at all relevant times has been, Executive Vice\nPresident of Engineering at Red Hat.\n \n{11}\n         \nDefendant Timothy J. Buckley (“Buckley”) was, at all relevant times hereto, the Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) of Red Hat until 2004.\n{12}\n         \nDefendant Mark H. \nWebbink\n (“\nWebbink\n”) is, and at all relevant times has been, the Senior Vice\nPresident, Secretary, and General Counsel of Red Hat.\n{13}\n         \nDefendant Alex \nPinchev\n (“\nPinchev\n”) is, and at all relevant times since April 2003 has been, the\nExecutive Vice President of Worldwide Sales and has been the President of International Operations of\nRed Hat.\n \n{14}\n         \nDefendant Robert F. Young (“Young”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of the\nBoard of Directors of Red Hat.\n{15}\n         \nDefendant Eugene J. McDonald (“McDonald”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of\nthe Board of Directors of Red Hat.\n{16}\n         \nDefendant F. Selby Wellman (“Wellman”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of the\nBoard of Directors of Red Hat.\n{17}\n         \nDefendant \nMarye\n Anne Fox (“Fox”) is, and at all relevant times since December 2002 has been, a\nmember of the Board of Directors of Red Hat.\n{18}\n         \nDefendant William S. Kaiser (“Kaiser”) is, and at all relevant times since July 2003 has been, a\nmember of the Board of Directors of Red Hat.\n{19}\n         \nDefendant Dr. W. Steve Albrecht (“Albrecht”) is, and at all relevant times has been, a member of\nthe Board of Directors of Red Hat.\n{20}\n         \nDefendant Gen. Henry H. “Hugh” Shelton (“Gen. Shelton”) is, and at all relevant times has been,\na member of the Board of Directors of Red Hat.\n \n{21}\n         \nAt the time the original complaint was filed, the Red Hat Board of Directors thus consisted of one\ninsider—\nSzulik\n—and seven outside directors—Young, McDonald, Wellman, Fox, Kaiser, Albrecht, and\nGen. Shelton.\n \nB.\nOVERVIEW OF THE FACTS\n{22}\n         \nPlaintiff alleges the following facts, which, for the purposes of this motion to dismiss, will be\ntreated as true.\n  \nPlaintiff’s claims center around Red Hat’s decision in July 2004 to modify its long-\nstanding method of reporting revenue generated by software subscription agreements.\n \n{23}\n         \nRed Hat, which was formed in 1993, is a software company that is headquartered in \nRaleigh\n,\nNorth Carolina\n.\n  \nRed Hat went public in 1999 and has thirty-one offices and over 1,000 employees\nworldwide.\n  \nIt creates and markets open source\n[1]\n and LINUX based solutions, including an operating\nsystem called Red Hat Linux, which is based on the open source operating system originally developed by\nLinus\n \nTorvalds\n, a Finnish student, in 1991.\n  \nThe original version of Red Hat Linux was first sold in 1994.\n \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 55.)\n \n{24}\n         \nRed Hat introduced the first enterprise-class operating system, originally named Red Hat\nAdvanced Server, in March 2002.\n  \nEnterprise\n operating systems allow customers—generally businesses,\nacademic institutions, and governmental entities—to operate multiple computer systems with different\ntypes of computers on a single network.\n  \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux, now in release in its fourth version, is\nsold through a subscription model, under which its software and services are sold to customers in the form\nof annual subscriptions on a per-computer basis. (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 57.)\n \n{25}\n         \nOn July 13, 2004, Red Hat announced a plan to modify its method of revenue recognition for\nthose subscription agreements and to restate its financial statements over a two-year period to reflect that\nchange.\n  \nRed Hat, with the approval of its outside accountants, \nPriceWaterhouseCoopers\n (“PWC”), had\npreviously reported revenue from its subscription agreements on a monthly basis.\n  \nIn June 2004, the\nCompany met with its new audit partner, who took over under the normal rotation of auditing partners at\nPWC.\n  \nThe new auditing partner advised that the Company should begin recognizing revenue from its\nsubscription agreements on a daily rather than a monthly basis.\n   \nRed Hat opted to follow the new auditing\npartner’s advice and begin recognizing that revenue on a daily basis.\n[2]\n  \nFinancial statements from the\nfiscal years ending February 28, 2002, February 28, 2003, and February 29, 2004, were restated to reflect\nthe change.\n \n{26}\n         \nThe day Red Hat announced its plan to restate earnings, its stock dropped to as low as $15.59 per\nshare and closed at $15.73 per share.\n  \nThe stock eventually fell to as low as $14.77 per share.\n  \nAs of the\ndate of this opinion, however, Red Hat’s stock had climbed to $27.46 per share.\n[3]\nC.\nIMPROPER REVENUE RECOGNITION\n{27}\n         \nPlaintiff alleges that Red Hat misled investors and violated Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (“GAAP”) and federal securities laws and regulations by reporting revenue from its subscription\nagreements on a monthly rather than a daily basis.\n  \nIt alleges that the individual defendants disregarded\ntheir duty to maintain oversight over the Company’s accounting practices by allowing it to do so.\n \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 58-59.)\n{28}\n         \nBefore the Company altered its accounting practices on July 13, 2004, whenever it signed a one-\nyear subscription agreement with a customer, it would report 1/12 of the revenue for that contract in the\nmonth in which the agreement was made—regardless of which day of the month the contract was formed.\n \nFor instance, if a customer purchased a one-year subscription to Linux Enterprise or signed a contract for\nservices on August 28, instead of reporting four days of income for that month, Red Hat would record a\nfull month of revenue, or 1/12 the total revenue associated with the contract.\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 60-\n61.)\n  \nThis specific example is particularly notable because, plaintiff argues, given that August is the final\nmonth of the Company’s second fiscal quarter, the practice had the effect of exaggerating the earnings that\nRed Hat reported in its quarterly financial statements.\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 61.)\n  \nThe effect was not to\nreport earnings that the company would never receive but to report earnings in the first month of a given\ncontract that would not actually be received until later.\n  \nWhen earnings were restated, therefore, earnings\nfor some quarters were restated slightly higher and some slightly lower.\n{29}\n         \nAll parties agree that GAAP rules specify that revenue must be recognized “ratably.”\n  \nPlaintiff\ngives no indication, however, either in his Amended Complaint or in his brief filed in response to the\ndefendants’ motion, that GAAP rules ever define the term “ratably” to specifically require that revenue be\nreported daily rather than monthly.\n  \nEvidently the two different partners at PWC who advised Red Hat on\nthe issue interpreted “ratably” differently under GAAP rules.\n{30}\n         \nThe Amended Complaint alleges that the defendants “knew or should have known” that the\npractice was improper and should have acted to prevent it.\n  \nPlaintiff complains that the problem could\neasily have been solved by merely having someone “push a button” causing the figures to be tallied on a\ndaily basis rather than a monthly basis.\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 64.)\n  \nThe Amended Complaint suggests, but\ndoes not state outright, that the practice was fueled by a desire by Red Hat’s management and directors to\nmanipulate sales figures to meet the Company’s unreasonable financial objectives for each quarter by\ncausing a large “spike” in business late in the last days of each month and quarter.\n  \nPlaintiff contends that\nthe individual defendants “could easily manipulate” the recognition of revenue in order to “hit particular\nrevenue targets and enjoy bonuses and other incentive compensations that were approved by the\nCompensation Committee.”\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 64.)\n{31}\n         \nThe effect of the earnings restatement was to shift some earnings from earlier months to later\nmonths.\n  \nFor each one-year subscription, a portion of what was reported for the first month was shifted to\nthe twelfth month.\n  \nThe result was that some quarters were restated slightly higher than originally reported\nand some slightly lower.\n  \nThe total shift in revenue for the entire period was less than one-half of one\npercent (approx. .37%).\n  \nSee\n Red Hat 10Q for 1Q of FY 2005, at 21 (Defendants’ Brief in Support of\nMotion to Dismiss (“Defendants’ Brief”), Ex. B);\n  \nRed Hat 8K for 2004, at Ex. 99.2 (filed June 17, 2004)\n(Defendants’ Brief, Ex. C); Red Hat 10K/A for FYE Feb. 29, 2004, at 57, 70-71 (Defendants’ Brief, Ex.\nD); Red Hat 10K for FYE Feb. 29, 2004, at 65-66 (Defendants’ Brief, Ex. E); Red Hat 10K for FYE Feb.\n28, 2003, at 15, 62-63 (Defendants’ Brief, Ex. F).\n{32}\n         \n \nPlaintiff claims that defendants misled investors by failing to adopt sufficient internal controls,\nwhich allowed the Company to improperly inflate the percentage of customers who were going to renew\ntheir subscriptions, in turn motivating it to manipulate its accounting practices in order to keep sales\nfigures in line with those unreasonable forecasts of renewal rates.\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 66-76.)\n \nDefendant Thompson allegedly involved himself directly in the dissemination of false subscription\ninformation to investors and the public at large by threatening the jobs of any members of the sales staff\nwho did not “produce rosy sales forecasts.”\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 74-75.)\n  \nDefendant \nSzulik\n is also\nalleged to have been involved in the subscription renewal process.\n{33}\n         \nRed Hat’s lack of internal controls also allegedly led to manipulation of the Company’s quarterly\nearnings estimates with respect to consulting services offered to its customers.\n  \nThe Amended Complaint\nalleges that “a large quantity of revenues were being recognized in association with consulting hours that\nhad not actually been worked,” causing Red Hat to be “‘stuck’ with a ‘bunch of work’ for the consultants\nto do and no budget with which to compensate the consultants.”\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 77-78.) \n \nThe\nindividual defendants are also alleged to have orchestrated an “atmosphere of fear and intimidation” which\nultimately led to much of the activity about which plaintiff complains.\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 79-88.)\n \nHowever, no restatement of income by Red Hat was based upon charges for consulting services.\nD.\nINSIDER TRADING\n{34}\n         \nPlaintiff’s Amended Complaint alleges insider trading by several of Red Hat’s officers and\ndirectors, only two of whom, Defendants \nSzulik\n and Kaiser, are members of the Board of Directors.\n \nSpecifically, Defendants \nSzulik\n, Buckley, Thompson, Kaiser, Cormier, and \nWebbink\n are alleged to have\nsold shares of Red Hat stock while in possession of undisclosed material adverse information.\n  \n(Amended\nCompl\n. ¶¶ 14-19, 24, 119.)\n \n{35}\n         \nPlaintiff does not indicate what non-disclosed material information any of the defendants\npossessed at the time of any particular sale.\n  \nNowhere in the Amended Complaint does plaintiff allege the\nexistence of any specific knowledge on the part of any of the insider trading defendants at the time of any\nspecific sale; nor does Plaintiff point to any specific sources of such information.\n  \nThe extent of plaintiff’s\nallegations of insider trading is that five of Red Hat’s officers and two directors owned and sold stock\nduring a three-year period and that because of their positions in the company they must have known some\nadverse non-public information at some unstated time during the same period.\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 14-\n19, 24, 119.)\nE.\nTHE MISSTATEMENTS\n{36}\n         \nIn addition to allegations of improper revenue recognition and insider trading, the Amended\nComplaint alleges a failure of the Board of Directors to properly supervise the conduct of and statements\nmade by company officers during the period between December 17, 2002, and September 20, 2004.\n  \nThe\nAmended Complaint includes a 19-page long string of press releases, articles from \nTheStreet.com\n, and one\nSEC filing, all of which include allegedly improper statements made by Red Hat officers.\n  \nThe only\ndefendants to whom any of the statements are directly attributed are Defendants Thompson and \nSzulik\n.\n \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶¶ 89-109.)\n  \nNone of the statements are attributed specifically to any of the outside\ndirectors.\n{37}\n         \nMost of the press releases pasted into the Amended Complaint were issued by the Company prior\nto the restatement of earnings, and Plaintiff claims that they include false statements of exaggerated\nearnings and earnings estimates generated by Red Hat’s faulty revenue reporting practices.\n  \nA press\nrelease issued on July 13, 2004, was entitled “Red Hat Announces Plan to Change Method of Revenue\nRecognition for Subscription Agreements and to Restate Financial Statements to Reflect Change.”\n  \nIn that\npress release, Red Hat explained the nature and background of its decision to modify its revenue reporting\npractices and informed the public of its plan to restate its financial statements for the fiscal years ending in\n2002, 2003, and 2004 and for the fiscal quarter ending May 31, 2004.\n  \nThe press release stated that the\nRed Hat’s independent auditors advised the Company that it should consider the change on June 16, 2004,\nand that the Company had decided to act on that suggestion.\n   \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 104.)\n{38}\n         \nOn August 6, 2004, Red Hat filed a Form 10-K/A with the SEC restating its earnings for fiscal\nyear 2002 through fiscal year 2004.\n  \nThe restatement sought to bring the Company’s financial earnings for\nthat time period in line with its recently adopted practice of recognizing income from subscription\nagreements on a daily basis.\n  \nThe filing stated that “[t]he effect of using the new method on our previously\nreported financial statements is to defer a portion of the revenue that had been previously recognized in the\nmonth of commencement of a subscription to the month in which the subscription ends.” (Amended\nCompl\n. ¶ 108.)\n{39}\n         \nOn August 18, 2004, just 36 days after Red Hat announced its decision to restate earnings, plaintiff\nfiled suit alleging that, in adopting and failing to timely correct the Company’s prior reporting methods,\nthe director and officer defendants named in this lawsuit disrupted corporate controls, caused inflation in\nthe company’s billing and consulting services, and breached their fiduciary duties owed to the\ncorporation.\n  \nAt no time prior or subsequent to the filing of the Amended Complaint did Plaintiff conduct\nany inspection of the books and records of Red Hat or make any demand for any action or information\nfrom the Board or the Company.\n \nIII.\nMOTION TO DISMISS\n{40}\n         \nThis matter comes before the Court on the defendants’ motion to dismiss.\n  \nDefendants argue first\nthat the Amended Complaint should be dismissed because Plaintiff has failed as a matter of law to\nadequately plead demand futility.\n  \nSecond, Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to state any claim\nwhich sufficiently alleges damages which are not premature, speculative, or defectively \nconclusory\n.\n \nBecause Plaintiff has failed to make a demand on the Company before filing suit or to adequately plead\ndemand futility, the Court does not need to reach the defendants’ second argument.\n \n{41}\n         \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss centers largely around Plaintiff’s failure to make a demand on the\ncorporation prior to bringing this derivative action.\n  \nBecause Red Hat is a \nDelaware\n corporation, this Court\napplies \nDelaware\n law in determining whether Plaintiff’s failure to make demand should be excused.\n  \nN.C.\nGen. Stat. § 55-7-47 (2004); \nKamen\n v. Kemper Fin. \nServs\n., Inc.\n, 500 \nU.S.\n 90, 95-96 (1991).\n  \nThis Court\nrecently applied \nDelaware\n law in the demand futility context in \nIn\n re \nPozen\n \nS’holders\n \nLitig\n., 2005 NCBC 7\n(N.C. Super. \nCt.\n Nov. 10, 2005).\n  \nThe right of a Delaware corporation’s shareholder to bring a derivative\naction does not come into existence until (1) he has made a demand on the corporation to institute the\naction itself, (2) his demand has been refused, or (3) he demonstrates that demand on the corporation\nwould have been futile. \n \nStepak\n v. Dean\n, 434 A.2d 388, 390 (Del. Ch. 1981).\n{42}\n         \nPlaintiff concedes that he did not make a demand on the corporation before filing suit.\n  \n(Amended\nCompl\n. ¶ 123.)\n  \nTherefore, he may only proceed if he can adequately demonstrate that demand would have\nbeen futile here.\nB.\nDEMAND FUTILITY\n \n{43}\n         \n“Pleadings in derivative suits . . . must comply with stringent requirements of factual particularity\nthat differ substantially from . . . permissive notice pleading.”\n  \nBrehm\n v. Eisner\n, 746 A.2d 244, 254 (Del.\n2000).\n  \nUnder Delaware law, in order for a derivative plaintiff to survive a motion to dismiss in a case\nwhere demand is not first made on the corporation, he must plead facts \nwith particularity\n that demonstrate\nthe reasons why demand would have been futile.\n  \nAronson\n, 473 A.2d 805, 8115 (Del. 1984); \nBrehm\n, 746\nA.2d at 254.\n  \nIf that heavy burden is not satisfied, the complaint must be dismissed, regardless of the\nstrength of his claim on the merits.\n  \nBrehm\n, 746 A.2d at 249.\n \n{44}\n         \nAs this Court discussed in its earlier decision in \nPozen\n, \nDelaware\n courts have established two\nseparate lines of inquiry in demand futility cases.\n  \nSee \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶¶ 47-50. Where the\ncomplaint challenges a specific action of the board of directors, \nDelaware\n courts apply the two-prong test\nset forth by the Delaware Supreme Court in \nAronson v. Lewis\n.\n  \nAronson\n, 473 A.2d at 811.\n  \nWhere no\nspecific action of the board is challenged, however, \nDelaware\n courts apply the singular inquiry\n \nestablished\nin \nRales\n v. \nBlasband\n.\n  \n634 A.2d 927 (Del. 1993).\n  \nAs defendants have argued and as plaintiff’s counsel\nconceded at oral argument, plaintiff does not challenge any specific action of Red Hat’s Board of\nDirectors.\n  \nTherefore, the Court applies the \nRales\n test.\n{45}\n         \nUnder the \nRales\n analysis, the court asks “whether or not the particularized factual allegations of a\nderivative stockholder complaint create a reasonable doubt that, as of the time the complaint is filed, the\nboard of directors could have properly exercised its \nindependent and disinterested business judgment\n in\nresponding to the demand.”\n  \nRales\n, 634 A.2d at 934 (emphasis added).\n  \nThe focus of the \nRales\n test is on\n“the disinterestedness and the independence of a majority of the board of directors in responding to a\ndemand.”\n  \nRattner\n v. \nBidzos\n, 2003 WL 22284323, at *8 (Del. Ch. Oct. 7, 2003).\n  \nDemand futility is\nanalyzed with a reasonable doubt standard, but a derivative plaintiff must plead particularized facts to\nsupport that reasonable doubt.\n  \nGrimes v. Donald\n, 673 A.2d 1207, 1217 (Del. 1996); \nGrabow\n v. Perot\n, 539\nA.2d 180, 186-87 (Del. 1988).\n \n{46}\n         \nTherefore, in analyzing plaintiff’s demand futility allegation the Court asks whether plaintiff has\npled particularized facts which raise a reasonable doubt that a majority of Red Hat’s Board of Directors at\nthe time the original complaint was filed would have been sufficiently disinterested and independent to\nadequately consider a demand had one been made.\n  \nSee \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 51.\n  \nFor the purposes of\nthis opinion only, the Court considers the only inside director, Defendant \nSzulik\n, to be interested.\n  \nPlaintiff\ndoes not allege that any of the directors here lacked the independence to properly consider demand;\nplaintiff focuses instead on the directors’ lack of disinterest.\n  \nTherefore, to survive the motion to dismiss,\nthe Amended Complaint must raise a reasonable doubt, based on particularized facts, as to the disinterest\nof at least three of the seven outside directors.\n{47}\n         \nUnder \nRales\n, in order to properly allege that a director is “interested,” a plaintiff must establish\nwith particularized facts that (1) the director “will receive a personal financial benefit from a transaction\nthat is not equally shared by the shareholders” or (2) the decision to bring suit would “have a materially\ndetrimental impact on a director, but not on the corporation and the stockholders.”\n  \nRales\n, 634 A.2d at\n936.\n  \nPlaintiff seeks to establish directorial interest by launching a laundry list of arguments.\n  \nPlaintiff\nchallenges the disinterestedness of the members of Red Hat’s Board of Directors on the following\ngrounds\n[4]\n:\n \n1.\n         \nDefendant Kaiser himself committed acts of illegal insider trading while in possession of\nmaterial, non-public information (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(a));\n2.\n         \nFive of the directors, Defendants Wellman, McDonald, Kaiser, Fox, and Albrecht, are\nmembers of the Audit Committee, which was responsible for exercising oversight over the\ncompany’s independent auditors and reviewing the audited financial statements and other\ndisclosures, and which also recommended that the Board include improper statements of\nRed Hat’s earnings in statements to both the SEC and the Company’s shareholders\n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(d));\n3.\n         \nAll of the outside directors receive annual cash fees and annual grants of stock options for\ntheir services as members of the Board of Directors (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(f) & (k));\n4.\n         \nDefendants Albrecht and McDonald possess specialized financial expertise, creating a\nheightened duty to insure the accuracy and fairness of the Company’s financials (Amended\nCompl\n. ¶ 123(g) & (h));\n5.\n         \nAll of the board members approved, permitted, or participated in the wrongs complained of\nby failing to prevent and correct the improper financials (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(f), (l),\n(n), & (o)).\n  \nAlso, five of the directors, Defendants Wellman, Kaiser, McDonald, Albrecht,\nand Gen. Shelton, as members of the Compensation Committee, directly permitted or\ncondoned the Company’s unlawful practices by approving incentive compensation for the\ndirector defendants and unduly compensating its officers (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(e));\n6.\n         \nIn order to bring suit, the directors would be forced to sue themselves (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶\n123(m));\n7.\n         \nAny suit brought by Red Hat’s Board of Directors would expose those directors to liability\nelsewhere (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(p) & (r));\n8.\n         \nRed Hat’s directors have to date failed to bring the action themselves despite having\nknowledge of the claims raised by plaintiff (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(q) & (t));\n9.\n         \nThe Company’s liability insurance policy does not cover suits brought by the Company\nagainst the directors directly.\n  \nTherefore, if the directors were to authorize suit, they would\nopen themselves up to uninsured liability (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(s)).\n{48}\n         \nThese arguments very closely resemble those made and rejected by this Court in \nPozen\n.\n  \nThey are\nsimilarly rejected here.\n \n{49}\n         \nInsider Trading.\n  \nPlaintiff’s argument that Defendant Kaiser is too interested to properly consider\ndemand on the grounds that he participated in alleged insider trading during the relevant period fails for\nlack of particularized pleading.\n  \nTo establish demand futility on the personal culpability of one or more of\na board’s directors, a plaintiff must demonstrate through particularized pleading that the director or\ndirectors face a “substantial likelihood” of personal liability—not just a “mere threat” of liability.\n  \nRales\n,\n634 A.2d at 936 (citing \nAronson\n, 473 A.2d at 815).\n  \nUnder \nDelaware\n law, to make out a prima facie claim\nfor insider trading, a plaintiff must allege “that each sale by each individual defendant was entered into\nand completed on the basis of and because of, adverse material non-public information.”\n  \nStepak\n v. Ross\n,\n1985 WL 21137, at *5 (Del. Ch. Sept. 5, 1985).\n{50}\n         \nThe Amended Complaint does not state what insider information Kaiser possessed at the time he\nsold Red Hat stock—only that because of his position in the Company, he was in a position to know\ninsider information.\n  \nPlaintiff does not tie either of Kaiser’s two alleged trades to any specific knowledge\non his part or even state that the transactions were based on or motivated in any way by such knowledge.\n \nPlaintiff merely alleges that Kaiser generally possessed material non-public information at the time of each\nsale.\n  \nMoreover, plaintiff fails to give any indication of the size of the two sales relative to his total\nownership of Red Hat stock.\n  \nPlaintiff would ask this Court to adopt a rule that the act of selling company\nstock would render any director so interested that he or she could not adequately consider demand,\nregardless of the point in time at which the sale took place, no matter what the size of the sale, and without\nany question as to what specific knowledge the selling director may have had at the time of the sale.\n \nPlaintiff’s insider trading claim does little more than suggest a “mere threat” of liability for Defendant\nKaiser.\n  \nIt certainly doesn’t rise to the level of a “substantial likelihood of liability” required by \nRales\n and\nAronson\n.\n{51}\n         \nAudit Committee\n.\n  \nPlaintiff alleges that five of the eight directors are rendered interested by their\nroles on the Board’s Audit Committee.\n  \nPlaintiff charges that they breached their fiduciary duties by\nfailing to regulate the Company’s internal controls with regard to its financials, recommending that the\nCompany include improper audited consolidated financial statements in its filings with the SEC, and\napproving quarterly and interim earnings estimates that were published to the investment community.\n{52}\n         \nA Board of Directors’ duty with regard to a system of internal controls is to “exercise a good faith\njudgment that the corporation’s information will come to its attention in a timely manner as a matter of\nordinary operations.”\n  \nIn re Caremark \nDeriv\n. \nLitig\n.\n, 698 A.2d 959, 970 (Del. Ch. 1996).\n  \nIn order to\nadequately plead demand futility on the ground that the directors failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties to\nregulate the company’s system of internal controls, a plaintiff must allege particularized facts that point to\n“red flags” that should have alerted the board to any wrongdoing.\n  \nSee In re Caremark\n, 698 A.2d at 969-\n70; \nGuttman\n v. Huang\n, 823 A.2d 492, 507 (Del. Ch. 2003) (demand not excused where the complaint\nincluded no “well-pled factual allegations—as opposed to wholly \nconclusory\n statements—that the\n[defendant] directors committed any culpable failure of oversight under the \nCaremark\n standard”).\n \n{53}\n         \nPlaintiff’s argument boils down to an assertion that these directors are interested merely because\nof their status as members of the Board’s Audit Committee.\n  \nThe Amended Complaint indicates that the\nAudit Committee relied on the Company’s outside auditor’s determination that income on the subscription\nagreement should be recorded on a monthly basis and that once the auditor suggested that it should change\nthat practice it acted quickly to adopt that change and restated its earlier financial statements to reflect the\nchange.\n  \nPlaintiff does not point to any specific facts indicating the existence of “red flags” which would\nhave suggested to the members of the committee that there were problems with Red Hat’s financials prior\nto June 2004 or of any conscious decision not to take action despite any such red flags.\n  \nPlaintiff merely\nargues that because members of the committee had general access to “internal corporate documents,” were\nincluded in “conversations,” and attended various “meetings,” they “knew or should have known” that the\nCompany’s internal controls were a “complete mess.”\n  \n(Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 10.)\n{54}\n         \nAs noted by this Court in \nPozen\n, the effect of such a ruling would be to make it virtually\nimpossible to find a disinterested board of directors anywhere because audit committee members would be\nconsidered interested simply on account of their membership on the committee—a conclusion entirely\ninconsistent with the requirement that companies select disinterested and independent directors to serve on\nthe committee.\n  \nSee \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 59.\n  \nWere the Court to recognize demand futility on the\ngrounds asserted by plaintiff, the demand requirement would be rendered void in all cases where a\ncompany opts to restate earnings.\n  \nSuch a ruling would be inconsistent with the public policy that\ncorporations act diligently to correct reported earnings when mistakes or inconsistencies are discovered or\nwhere current accounting practices dictate a change in reporting practices.\n   \nPlaintiff’s \nconclusory\n demand\nfutility arguments with respect to the five members of the Audit Committee are insufficient for the Court\nto find that his failure to make demand is excused.\n{55}\n         \nDirector Compensation\n.\n  \nPlaintiff alleges that demand is excused here because all of Red Hat’s\noutside directors received compensation for their services on the Board of Directors.\n  \nPlaintiff argues that\nin approving director compensation in the form of annual fees and stock options at the time of the alleged\nwrongdoing, defendants engaged in self-dealing which disqualifies them from properly considering any\ndemand.\n  \nThe Supreme Court of Delaware has held that a director’s disinterest is not impeached by the\nmere fact that he received compensation for his services.\n  \nGrobow\n v. Perot\n, 539 A.2d 180, 188 (Del.\n1988).\n  \nOther courts applying \nDelaware\n law have reached the same conclusion.\n  \nSee, e.g. In re E. F.\nHutton Banking Practices \nLitig\n.\n, 634 F. Supp. 265, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (apply \nDelaware\n law) (stating\nthat “[s]\nuch\n a rule would eviscerate the rationale for \never\n making a demand and would strip [the demand\nrequirement] of all meaning”).\n  \nThe mere adoption and approval of annual fees and moderate increases or\nstock option grants for directors is not enough to cast a reasonable doubt on a defendant directors’\ndisinterest.\n{56}\n         \nSpecialized Expertise\n.\n  \nPlaintiff alleges that because Defendants Albrecht and McDonald possess\nunique financial expertise, they owe a heightened duty to safeguard the Company’s financials.\n  \nPlaintiff\nessentially takes the position that merely because Red Hat sought and obtained the services of two\nprofessionals whom plaintiff claims are experts in their field, those two professionals are then incapable of\nobjectively considering demand as a matter of law when the wrongful conduct alleged involves a matter\nwithin that area of expertise.\n  \nPlaintiff’s \nconclusory\n allegation is insufficient to excuse failure to make pre-\nsuit demand.\n{57}\n         \nApproval of or Participation in the Wrongs Alleged\n.\n  \nPlaintiff also contends that the Board of\nDirectors as a whole lacks disinterest because it approved, permitted, or participated in the wrongs\nalleged.\n  \nAs this Court recognized in \nPozen\n, \nDelaware\n courts have consistently rejected demand futility\narguments based on blanket allegations that the directors participated in or approved the alleged\nmisconduct.\n  \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 60.\n  \nSee, e.g., Aronson\n, 473 A.2d at 817 (stating that “mere\ndirectorial approval of a transaction, absent particularized facts . . . establishing the lack of independence\nor disinterestedness of a majority of the directors, is insufficient to excuse demand”); \nRales\n, 634 A.2d at\n936; \nKaufman v. Belmont\n, 479 A.2d 282, 288 (Del. Ch. 1984); \nHaber v. Bell\n, 465 A.2d 353, 359 (Del. Ch.\n1983); \nDecker v. Clausen\n, 1989 Del. Ch. LEXIS 143, at *7-8 (Del. Ch. Sept. 8, 1989).\n \n{58}\n         \nPlaintiff asserts a blanket \nCaremark\n claim that the director defendants “knew or should have\nknown” of the wrongful conduct alleged and that they breached their fiduciary duties by failing to have\ninternal controls in place that would have worked to prevent or correct that misconduct.\n  \nPlaintiff has\nfailed, however, to point to any specific facts that brought or should have brought any wrongdoing to the\ndirectors’ attention—the “red flags” required by \nCaremark\n.\n  \nSee supra\n, at ¶ 52.\n  \nPlaintiff also fails to plead\nfacts that would call into question the good faith efforts of the directors to have systems in place that\nwould prevent or correct such wrongdoing.\n  \nThe Board’s action in promptly responding to a suggestion\nfrom its \nouside\n auditors demonstrates good faith—not bad faith or callous indifference.\n{59}\n         \nPlaintiff attempts to bolster his argument by asserting that the five members of the Compensation\nCommittee are interested because they “directly contributed to the unlawful practices herein” by\napproving incentive compensation packages for Red Hat’s officers.\n  \nThis assertion, though more specific,\nis also unsupported by particularized facts that would tie the incentive-based compensation plan to the\nwrongs alleged or that would show that any “red flags” existed which would alert the Board to any such\nconnection.\n  \nGiven that plaintiff relies on mere conclusions, this Court rejects this argument as it did in\nPozen\n.\n{60}\n         \nDirectors Forced to Sue Themselves\n.\n  \nPlaintiff argues that demand would be futile simply\nbecause the directors would be required to sue themselves in order to properly bring suit.\n  \nAs this Court\nrecognized in \nPozen\n, \nDelaware\n courts have consistently rejected this argument, which “raises no legally\ncognizable issue under \nDelaware\n corporate law.”\n  \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 63 (quoting \nAronson\n, 473,\nA.2d at 818).\n \n{61}\n         \nPotential Liability in other Litigation\n.\n  \nPlaintiff also bases his demand futility argument on the\nassertion that the defendants would likely open themselves up to liability in other potential litigation.\n  \nThis\nargument was also made and rejected in \nPozen\n, as has it been rejected by the courts of \nDelaware\n.\n  \nPozen\n,\n2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 64; \nsee Decker\n, 1989 \nDel.\n \nCh.\n LEXIS 143, at *8.\n{62}\n         \nThe Board’s Failure to Bring Direct Action\n.\n  \nThe Court also rejects plaintiff’s argument that\ndemand is futile because the directors failed to bring a direct action themselves prior to the filing of the\ncomplaint.\n  \nThe bare allegation that a board of directors failed to take action before suit was filed is not\nsufficient to establish demand futility.\n  \nSee \nRichardson\n v. Graves\n, 1983 \nDel.\n \nCh.\n LEXIS 466, at *8-9 (Del.\nCh. June 17, 1983) (“The mere fact that [the board has] not elected to sue before the derivative action was\nfiled should not of itself indicate ‘interestedness.’\n  \nAs a matter of fact, it is the Board’s inaction in most\nevery case which is the \nreason \nd’etre\n for Rule 23.1.”).\n{63}\n         \nLiability Insurance\n.\n  \nFinally, plaintiff alleges that demand would have been futile since the\ndefendants would not have opted to bring suit themselves because the Company’s liability insurance\nwould not cover a suit brought by the Company directly.\n  \nThis argument was also asserted and rejected by\nthis Court in \nPozen\n.\n  \n2005 NCBC 7, at ¶¶ 65-66.\n  \nSee Decker\n, 1989 \nDel.\n Ch. LEXIS 143, at *8; \nCaruana\nv. \nSaligman\n, 1990 WL 212304, at *4 (Del. Ch. Dec. 21, 1990).\n{64}\n         \nOverall, plaintiff asserts a myriad of arguments commonly made in demand futility cases and\ndevoid of the type of particularized facts required by \nDelaware\n law to establish demand futility.\n \nConsequently, each of these arguments is rejected, and plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed for failure to\nmake demand on the corporation prior to bringing suit.\nC.\nBOOKS & RECORDS\n{65}\n         \nThe Amended Complaint filed in this action is 84 pages long and has 151 numbered paragraphs.\n \nNotwithstanding the considerable length of the document, it nonetheless fails to plead sufficient facts to\nenable the Court to conclude that the plaintiff may proceed with his claims despite his failure to make a\ndemand on the corporation prior to filing suit.\n  \nAs this Court noted in footnote 4 of its earlier opinion in\nPozen\n, Plaintiff is possessed of the right under \nDelaware\n law and as a shareholder of Red Hat to conduct\nan inspection of the Company’s books and records.\n  \nPlaintiff opted not to avail himself of that right,\ndespite the fact that in doing so he may have discovered facts on which to establish a proper basis for\npleading demand futility.\n \n{66}\n         \nAs noted in \nPozen\n, “\nDelaware\n courts have offered strong words for plaintiffs who, after failing to\n[conduct an inspection of the corporation’s books and records] and filing inadequate pleadings, cause\n‘substantial cost to the parties and the judiciary.’”\n  \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 82 n. 4 (quoting \nBeam v.\nStewart\n, 845 A.2d 1040, 1057 (Del. 2004)).\n  \nThis Court echoes the concerns of Chancellor Chandler in\nBeam v. Stewart\n:\nIt is troubling to this Court that, notwithstanding repeated suggestions,\nencouragement, and downright admonitions over the years both by this Court and by the\nDelaware Supreme Court, litigants continue to bring derivative complaints pleading\ndemand futility on the basis of precious little investigation beyond perusal of the morning\nnewspapers.\n  \nThis failure properly to investigate whether a majority of directors fairly can\nevaluate demand may lead to either (or both) of two equally appalling results. If there is no\nreasonable doubt that the board could respond to demand in the proper fashion, failure to\nmake demand and filing the derivative action results in a waste of the resources of the\nlitigants, including the corporation in question, as well as those of this Court. If the facts to\nsupport reasonable doubt could have been ascertained through more careful pre-litigation\ninvestigation, the failure to discover and plead those facts still results in a waste of\nresources of the litigants and the Court and, in addition, ties the hands of this Court to\nprotect the interests of shareholders where the board is unable or unwilling to do so. This\nresults in the dismissal of what otherwise may have been meritorious claims, fails to\nprovide relief to the company's shareholders, and further erodes public confidence in the\nlegal protections afforded to investors.\n833 A.2d 961, 981-82 (\nDel.\n \nCh.\n Sept. 30, 2003).\n{67}\n         \nFor the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\n{68}\n         \nBased upon the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that defendants’\nmotion to dismiss plaintiff’s claims is granted and plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed with prejudice.\n[5]\n \n            \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 13th day of March 2006.\n[1]\n      \nOpen source software is constructed using code that is free and available to the public at large to use and make\nimprovements.\n[2]\n \n      \nSee infra\n ¶ 28.\n \n[3]\n \n      \nThe dramatic recovery in stock price may explain Mr. \nEgelhof’s\n stock sale.\n[4]\n \n      \nOne of Plaintiff’s stated grounds for demand excusal is the fact that the Company issued an interest-free loan to Defendant\nThompson in 2003, which is forgiven ratably over four years—an arrangement that Thompson would not want to jeopardize by\ntaking action against the other directors (Amended \nCompl\n. ¶ 123(j).)\n   \nAs Defendant Thompson is not, nor has he ever been, a\nmember of Red Hat’s Board of Directors, that argument is of no consequence to the Court’s demand futility analysis.\n[5]\n \n      \nSee \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 82, n. 4."
