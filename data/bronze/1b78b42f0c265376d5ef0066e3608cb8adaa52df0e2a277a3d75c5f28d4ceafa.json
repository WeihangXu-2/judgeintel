(“GSI”) and John Griffin, \n                                            \n1  Though this motion was made by both CP&L and Progress, the court has since granted Progress’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment.  Order and Opinion on Motion for Summary Judgment by Plaintiff \nProgress Energy, Inc., Nov. 12, 2009.  As such, the court generally refers only to CP&L in this opinion.  \nIndividually, (“Griffin”) (the “Motion”) and was made pursuant to the provisions of Rule \n56, North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”) and BCR 15; and \n THE COURT, having considered the Defendants’ Motion, the arguments and \nbriefs in support of and in opposition to the Motion, and appropriate matters of record, \nCONCLUDES that the Motion for Summary Judgment on Claims of Griffin Services, Inc. \nand John Griffin, Individually, should be GRANTED for the reasons stated herein. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n[1] Plaintiffs filed their first Complaint on November 20, 2003.  Griffin Mgmt. \nCorp. et al. v. Carolina Power & Light Co., et al., 03 CVS 7367 (Forsyth County).  \nPlaintiffs dismissed this action on October 28, 2004.  \n[2] On October 18, 2005, Plaint iffs re-filed their action.  Griffin Mgmt. Corp. et \nal. v. Carolina Power & Light Co. et al., 05 CVS 14428 (Wake County).  Plaintiffs \nalleged new and additional claims in their re-filed Complaint.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs \nadded new causes of action for tortious interference with contract, unjust \nenrichment/quantum meruit and special damages for GSI.  These claims were not \nalleged in the first Complaint. \n[3] CP&L and Progress collectively filed an Answer and Counterclaim on \nJanuary 13, 2006, as well as a Motion to Dismiss the claims against Progress pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.2   \n[4] On April 11, 2008, Defendants filed this Motion.  The Motion, ripe for \nadjudication, was heard and decided by the court on September 18, 2008.  \n                                            \n2 The Motion to Dismiss was filed prior to this matter being assigned to the Business Court, and never \nbecame ripe for adjudication.  The court deems this Motion to Dismiss to be abandoned and therefore \nnow rules only on the Motion for Summary Judgment.  \nII.  \nMOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n[5] Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment is to be rendered “forthwith” if \nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together \nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \nthat any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  When the forecast of \nevidence demonstrates that the plaintiff cannot satisfy an essential element of a claim or \novercome an affirmative defense established by the defendant, summary judgment for \nthe defendant should be granted.  Grayson v. High Point Dev. Ltd. P’ship, 175 N.C. \nApp. 786, 788 (2006). \n[6] Unless otherwise indicated herein, the material facts reflected in  \nparagraphs 7 through 9 of this Order exist, are undisputed3 and are pertinent to the \nissues raised by the Motions. \nIII. \nFACTS \n[7] Plaintiff Griffin Management Cor poration (“GMC”) is a company  \nformerly engaged in the business of providing meter reading and related services to \nutility companies, including CP&L.  GMC and CP&L entered into a Meter Reading \nServices Contract on March 8, 1994.\n4  Neither GSI nor Griffin were parties to this \ncontract.5  Indeed, GSI has never performed any work for CP&L.6   \n                                            \n3 It is not proper for a trial court to make findings of fact in determining a motion for summary judgment \nunder Rule 56.  However, it is appropriate for a Rule 56 order to reflect material facts that the court \nconcludes exist and are not disputed, and which support the legal conclusions with regard to summary \njudgment.  Hyde Ins. Agency v. Dixie Leasing, 26 N.C. App. 138 (1975). \n4 Blanchard Dep. Ex. 1.  See also Defs.’ Ans., ¶ 40.  \n5 Blanchard Dep. Ex. 1. \n[8] GMC was initially created in the ear ly 1990s as a subsidiary of GSI  \nto perform “outsourcing” work.7  During the start-up phase of GMC, GSI provided \nfinancial support and information technology, human resources and employee training \nservices to GMC.8  The companies later disassociated because “[i]t was decided that \n[GMC] was strong enough to stand on its own.”9  A line of credit with Lighthouse \nFinancial Corporation (“Lighthouse”) the two companies initially shared10 was \nrenegotiated such that the companies had separate credit lines with separate limits.11  \nAs a client, GMC was charged for the services GSI rendered.12  GMC did not, however, \npay GSI for its services.13   \n[9] When GMC was formed, Griffin bec ame the majority shareholder and \nassumed responsibility for GMC’s operations.14  However, Griffin has testified that he \nwas not an employee of GMC. 15  Griffin’s wife, Betty Griffin, neither participated in the \n                                                                                                                                             \n6 B. Griffin Dep. 58:19-22 (Deponent testifies she is not able to recall whether CP&L was ever a client of \nGSI); see 3 J. Griffin Dep. 20:10-20 (testifying that there was never a contract between GSI and CP&L). \n7 B. Griffin Dep. 17:7-9, 28:22-29:11, 101:7-23.   \n8 Id. at 36:16-37:6. \n9 Id. at 40:12-17.  Before the split, there were no individuals employed by both GMC and GSI.  Id. at 39: \n9-17.  At some point, the companies began to lease space separately, id. at 37: 7-16, 38:17-22, and they \nobserved their own corporate formalities, 2 J. Griffin Dep. 52:12-23.  After the split, the companies \ncontinued to share the same health plan,  3 J. Griffin Dep. 109:21-110:2, as well as the use and costs of a \ncommunications system, computers and computer software, 3 J. Griffin Dep. 110:19-111:14.    \n10 Miller Dep. 39:10-22. \n11 B. Griffin Dep. 48:7-10; Miller Dep. 58:5-20, 63:16-64:22.  However, these lines of credit required cross-\ncollateralization of the two accounts.  3 J. Griffin Dep. 113: 4-17.  See also B. Griffin Dep. 56:3-8. \n12 B. Griffin Dep. 57:19-21. \n13 3 J. Griffin Dep. 17:2-18:1 (noting three payments as exceptions), 114:18-116:4 (explaining that GSI \nhad charged GMC a monthly fee between $37,500 and $45,000 for its work since 1998, but most of those \ninvoices were not paid by GMC because it could not afford to do so).  Griffin also testified that GSI made \nloans to GMC over the years.  Id. at 116:5-118:16. \n14 B. Griffin Dep. 15:19-22, 30:9-11. \n15 Instead, Griffin stated he was an employee of GSI.  2 J. Griffin Dep. 113: 1-25; 3 J. Griffin 60: 20-25.  \nHowever, Griffin did serve as CEO of GMC, 2 J. Griffin Dep. 99:21, in fall of 2000 and otherwise “worked \nfor” GMC.  Id. at 113:18 -114:1.  \noperations of GMC nor owned any stock in GMC.16  Griffin personally guaranteed \nseveral of the debts of GMC, including an advance made by CP&L.17   \nIV. \nTHE PARTIES’ CONTENTIONS \n[10] CP&L argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on all claims  \nmade against it by Plaintiffs GSI and Griffin pursuant to Rule 56(c) on the grounds that \nthere are no genuine issues of material fact and they are entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.  \n[11] CP&L contends that GSI and Gri ffin lack standing to assert the  \nclaims against it for the following reasons: \na. CP&L did not have a contract or  other business relationship with \nGriffin or GSI.  The relationship that forms the basis of this litigation was GMC’s \nmeter-reading contract with CP&L; \nb. Griffin, as the majority shareholder of GMC, cannot sue for \ndamages in his individual capacity; \nc. There was no joint venture between GMC and GSI that would \ncreate a cause of action on GSI’s behalf against CP&L; and \nd. GSI and Griffin were merely creditors of GMC and lack a legal \nbasis to pursue litigation on behalf of GMC.   \n[12] GSI claims to have standing because: \na. GSI was not a shareholder of GMC; \nb. GSI’s claims are rooted in tort theor y instead of contract; and                                 \n                                            \n16 B. Griffin Dep. 17:13-16, 29:21-25, 30:5-8. \n17 See Dep. Ex. 12, Fountain Aff. at ¶ 3; Oliver Dep. Ex. 26.  See also 2 J. Griffin Dep. 23:14-22; 3 J. \nGriffin Dep. 119:1-120:9.  \nc. GSI and GMC were joint venturers.   \n[13]  According to Griffin, he has standing and summary judgment is  \ninappropriate because: \na. Griffin was not merely a sharehol der of GMC, as CP&L had forced \nhim into a personal contractual relationship in which CP&L (i) made Griffin sign a \nguarantee; (ii) made Griffin a primary obligor; (iii) created a special duty to Griffin; \n(iv) disregarded GMC corporate formalities and (v) secreted its plan to gut GMC, \nplunder its assets and leave Griffin with the remaining debt; and \nb. Griffin’s damages are different fr om that of GMC in that while \nGMC’s damages are the value of the workforce and other assets, Griffin holds \npersonal losses himself as a guarantor, damages not claimed by GMC. \n[14] CP&L contends that pursuant to such arguments, the claims of GSI  \nand Griffin against it should be denied. \nV. \nRELEVANT LAW \n[15] In order for a joint venture to ex ist in North Carolina, there must be  \n“(1) an agreement, express or implied, to carry out a single business venture with joint \nsharing of profits, and (2) an equal right of control of the means employed to carry out \nthe venture.”  Rhoney v. Fele, 134 N.C App. 614, 620 (1999).   \n[16] The parties must share profits of  the venture directly – not simply  \nagreeing to a sum certain to be exchanged for services rendered.  Southeastern Shelter \nCorp. v. BTU, Inc. 154 N.C. App. 321, 328 (2002) (distinguishing an obligation to pay a \ndebt from an obligation to share one’s profits with another). \n[17] The control necessary for a join t venture “is not actual physical  \ncontrol, but the legal right to control the conduct of the other with respect to the \nprosecution of the common purpose.”  Slaughter v. Slaughter, 93 N.C. App. 717, 721 \n(1989), disc. review allowed, 325 N.C. 273 (1989), disc. review dismissed as \nimprovidently allowed, 326 N.C. 479 (1990).  \n[18] The North Carolina Supreme Court has adopted the majority  \nposition that “[s]hareholders, creditors or guarantors of corporations generally may not \nbring individual actions to recover what they consider their share of the damages \nsuffered by the corporation. . . . Recovery is available, naturally, when the defendant \nowes an individual shareholder, creditor, or guarantor a special duty, or when the \nindividual suffered an injury separate and distinct from that suffered by other \nshareholders, creditors, or guarantors.”  Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, \n660-661(1997).  Essentially, a shareholder cannot assert claims against a third party for \nloss of its equity investment in a corporation.  Id. at 658-60.  The effect of this rule is to \npreclude standing for individual causes of action against third parties for wrongs or \ninjuries to a corporation and to prevent a double recovery for the same damages.  In \nthis way, damage alleged by individuals in acts against a corporation is derivative \nbecause it arises out of work done pursuant to a contract between third parties.  Energy \nInvestors Fund, L.P. v. Metric Constructors, Inc., 133 N.C. App. 522, 526-27 (1999).   \n[19] As suggested above, two exceptions apply to this rule.  First, a  \nshareholder may pursue an individual action if it is owed a special duty by the \nwrongdoer.  Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 661.  Second, a shareholder may also pursue an \nindividual action if it suffered an injury “separate and distinct from the injury sustained by \nthe other shareholders or the corporation itself.”  Id.  \n[20] A special duty is one that t he alleged wrongdoer owed directly to  \nthe shareholder, creditor or guarantor as an individual, separate and apart from any \nduty owed to the corporation.  Id.  A special duty has been found when the wrongdoer \ninduced individual action of the shareholder, creditor or guarantor, when the wrongful \naction constituted a breach of fiduciary duty to the individual or when the wrongdoer \nperformed individualized services to the individual or undertook to personally advise the \nindividual.  Id. (citing authority). \n[21] In order for an indi vidual to have a separate and distinct injury,  \nthere must be a legal basis to support plaintiffs’ allegations of an individual loss, a loss \nthat is separate and distinct from any damage suffered by the corporation.  Barger, 346 \nN.C. at 659.  An injury of a different amount than the injury to the corporation, for \nexample, is not enough to constitute a separate injury.  Energy Investors, 351 N.C. at \n336.  An individual’s close relationship with a company does not demonstrate such \nseparate and distinct injury.  Aubin v. Susi, 149 N.C. App. 320, 325-26(2002) (giving no \nconsideration to the defendant’s knowledge that the plaintiff was in a close relationship \nwith the injured corporation as 50% owner).  Also, consequential damages incurred as a \nresult of personally guaranteeing corporate debts do not constitute a separate and \ndistinct injury from that injury which was suffered by the corporation.  McDaniel v. Alcon \nLabs., Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93172. \nVI. \nANALYSIS \nA. \nGSI Does Not Have Standing to Sue CP&L for Damages \n[22] CP&L did not have a contract or other business relationship with GSI.   \n[23] There is an insufficient forecast of evidence that there was a joint venture  \nbetween GSI and GMC such that would create a cause of action on GSI’s behalf \nagainst CP&L.  While GSI and GMC do share an intertwined history, GMC has been a \nstand-alone entity since 2000.  Furthermore, GSI had no right to control the meter-\nreading contract between GMC and CP&L.  The shared employee benefit plan, absent \nproof of any sharing of profits or joint control, does not demonstrate the existence of a \njoint venture.18\n[24] The forecast facts do not support a claim that GMC owed GSI, a creditor,  \nany special duty or that GSI suffered an injury separate and distinct from that suffered \nby the GMC or other creditors.  Indeed, the Complaint does not distinguish between \nspecial damages suffered by GMC and GSI.19\nB. \nGriffin Does Not Have Standing to Sue CP&L for Damages \n[25] Griffin was not a party to the agreement between CP&L and  \nGMC.  \n                                            \n18  The damages alleged in Plaintiffs’ Twelfth Claim for Relief are premised on the existence of a joint \nventure.  Without such a joint venture, these damages are unsupportable. \n19  Compl., ¶¶80-81 (“Specifically, as a direct and proximate result of the conduct of the defendants, as \nherein alleged, Plaintiff Griffin Management suffered special damages as follows. . . . The special \ndamages of Griffin Management and Services, as alleged herein, are the direct and proximate result of \nthe conduct of the defendants. . . .”). \n[26] There is no basis for a special duty ow ed to Griffin.  Griffin’s choice to act \nas guarantor of GMC did not create a special duty owed by CP&L to Griffin.  The \nforecast facts do not support a claim that CP&L forced Griffin to enter a contract,20 that \nany acts of CP&L breached a fiduciary duty owed to Griffin or that CP&L performed \nindividualized services to Griffin or undertook to personally advise him.   \n[27] Griffin’s injury resulted from his decision to guarantee personally GMC’s \ndebts.  Such an injury is not separate and distinct because the injury to GMC is the only \nsource of the damages claimed by Griffin – all stem from Griffin’s loss of investment.     \nVII. \nCONCLUSION \n[28] The court concludes that there exis t no material issues of fact, and that \nneither GSI nor Griffin has standing in this civil action.   \n[29] Accordingly, Defendants Carolina Power and Light Co. and Progress \nEnergy, Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the Claims of Plaintiffs Griffin Services, \nInc. and John Griffin, Individually, is granted; and said Claims hereby are DISMISSED.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 13th day of November, 2009. \n                                            \n20  A contract at issue in the Complaint includes GMC as a party, not Griffin as an individual. See Compl. \n¶14 (“Upon information and belief, thereafter CP&L . . . demand[ed] that [GMC] enter into a contract with \nSuperTel whereby [GMC] would grant Supertel the authority to take control of all financial matters of \n[GMC].  CP&L, by and through Chip Hutchins, did coerce [GMC] to sign the agreement with SuperTel by \nthreatening to terminate [GMC] if it did not sign the agreement demanded by CP&L.”) "
