Bennett, for Defendants Carrbridge Berkshire Group, Inc., \nTruNorth Warranty Plans of North America, LLC, and CompassOne \nWarranty Plans of North America, LLC. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n2. This litigation arises between competitors in the commercial used truck \nwarranty business.  Plaintiff claims that Defendants falsely advertise and represent \nto consumers that they have insurance, assets, and business associations that they \ndo not actually have, thereby unfairly usurping a commercial advantage that \nDefendants would othe rwise have been required to earn through skill, labor, and \nefforts.  Plaintiff complains that it does have substantial insurance and assets to pay \nits customers’ warranty claims, and is, thus, unfairly harmed by Defendants’ conduct. \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n3. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the motions. \n4. Plaintiff filed its Complaint on August 21, 2017.  (ECF No. 4.) \n5. This action was designated as a mandatory complex business case by order \nof the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated November 9, 2017, \n \n \n \n(ECF No. 3), and assigned to the undersigned by order of Chief Business Court Judge \nJames L. Gale on November 13, 2017, (ECF No. 2). \n6. On December 13, 2017, Carrbridge Berkshire, on behalf of itself and \nCarrbridge Fidelity, filed a Motion to Quash Service of Process (the “First Motion to \nQuash”).  (ECF No. 14.)  After Plaintiff made a second attempt to serve the Carrbridge \nDefendants, Carrbridge Berkshire stipulated that it had bee n properly served, but \nmaintained the motion on behalf of Carrbridge Fidelity.  (ECF No. 31.)  On February \n7, 2018, Carrbridge Berkshire, on behalf of Carrbridge Fidelity, filed a Second Motion \nto Quash Service of Process (the “Second Motion to Quash”), (ECF No. 43), and a brief \nin support asserting that Carrbridge Fidelity was never properly served, (ECF No. \n44).  Plaintiff did not respond to the Second Motion to Quash.  The First and Second \nMotion to Quash will be referred to collectively as the “Motions to Quash.” \n7. Also on December 13, 2017, the Warranty Defendants filed a motion to \ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim (the \n“Warranty Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss”).  (ECF No. 16.)  The motion has been fully \nbriefed. \n8. On December 22, 2017, the Warranty Defendants filed their answer and \nasserted counterclaims against Plaintiff.  (ECF No. 23.) \n9. On January 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to Amend the \nComplaint (the “Motion to Amend”), with an attached proposed First Amended \nComplaint (the “Amended Complaint”).  (Mot. Leave to Amend Compl., Ex. A, ECF \nNo. 33 [“Am. Compl.”].)  On February 14, 2018, Carrbridge Berkshire and the \n \n \n \nWarranty Defendants collectively filed a brief in opposition to the Motion to Amend.  \n(ECF No. 50.)  Plaintiff did not file a reply brief. \n10. On February 12, 2018, Carrbridge Berkshire filed a motion to dismiss for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim (“Carrbridge \nBerkshire’s Motion to Dismiss”) and a brief in support , (ECF Nos. 45–46), as well as \nits answer and counterclaims, (ECF No. 47).  Plaintiff did not file a response in \nopposition to Carrbridge Berkshire’s Motion to Dismiss. \n11. On March 29, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the Motions to Quash, the \nWarranty Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, Carrbridge Berkshire’s Motion to Dismiss, \nand the Motion to Amend.  All parties were represented by counsel at the hearing. \n12. The motions are ripe for resolution. \nIII. MOTIONS TO QUASH \n13. Carrbridge Berkshire filed its First Motion to Quash on behalf of itself and \nCarrbridge Fidelity.  (Mot. Quash Service Process ¶¶ 12–13, ECF No. 14.)  Carrbridge \nBerkshire asserted that service was improper under Rule 12(b)(5) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”) as to both Carrbridge Defendants \nbecause copies of the summons and Complaint were not delivered to an officer, \ndirector, managing agent, or member of the Carrbridge Defendants; rather, service \nwas delivered to the property manager of a building at which neither of the \nCarrbridge Defendants maintain an address.  (Br. Supp. Mot. Quash Service Process \n1–2, ECF No. 15 [“Br. Supp. Mot. Quash”].)  Carrbridge Berkshire further argued \nthat, as to Carrbridge Fidelity, the summons was invalid on its face under Rule \n \n \n \n12(b)(4) because Carrbridge Fidelity is an entity that has never existed.  (Br. Supp. \nMot. Quash 5–6.) \n14. After Plaintiff’s second attempt to serve the Carrbridge Defendants, (Br. \nOpp’n Mot. Quash Service Process, Ex. A, ECF No. 32), Carrbridge Berkshire \nstipulated that it had been  properly served but maintained that the First Motion to \nQuash, to the extent it was brought on behalf of Carrbridge Fidelity, should be \ngranted, (Def. Carrbridge Berkshire’s Stipulation Service Process 1 –2, ECF No. 31).  \nCarrbridge Berkshire filed a Second Motion to Quash as to Plaintiff’s second attempt \nto serve Carrbridge Fidelity, again arguing that the summons is facially invalid \nbecause Carrbridge Fidelity does not exist.  (Second Mot. Quash Service Process 2, \nECF No. 43; Br. Supp. Second Mot. Quash Service Process 2, ECF No. 44.) \n15. At the hearing, the parties stipulated that Carrbridge Fidelity never existed \nand, therefore, is not a proper party to this action.  Accordingly, the Motions to Quash \nare denied as moot and Carrbridge Fidelity is dismissed from this action. \nIV. PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO AMEND \n16. Under Rule 15(a), a party may amend a pleading to which a responsive \npleading is permitted as a matter of course before the responsive pleading is served.  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule 15(a).  Thereafter, a party  may only amend a pleading \nby leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party, and leave shall be freely \ngiven when justice so requires.  Id.  A motion for leave to amend is addressed to the \nsound discretion of the trial court.  E.g., Draughon v. Harnett Cty. Bd. of Educ., 166 \nN.C. App. 464, 467, 602 S.E.2d 721, 724 (2004).  Reasons justifying denial of a motion \n \n \n \nto amend are undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure defects \nby previous amendments, undue prejudice, and futility of amendment.  Bodie Island \nBeach Club Ass’n v. Wray, 216 N.C. App. 283, 288–89, 716 S.E.2d 67, 73 (2011). \n17. The Warranty Defendants and Carrbridge Berkshire oppose the Motion to \nAmend solely on the basis of futility, arguing that the Amended Complaint f ails to \nstate any claim upon which relief may be granted.  (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Leave \nAmend 1 –6, ECF No. 50.)  Plaintiff argues that the Motion to Amend should be \ngranted because whether the claims in the Amended Complaint are futile is best left \nto a later determination.  (Br. Supp. Mot. Leave Amend Compl. 3–4, ECF No. 34.) \n18. Plaintiff’s original Complaint alleged that Defendants falsely claim to have \ninsurance and business associations that they do not actually have, and further \nalleged that the Warranty Defendants’ company names and designs infrine on other \ncompanies’ trademarks, causing confusion in the relevant market.  (Compl. ¶¶ 19 –\n36.)  The Complaint asserted claims for (1) “false representation,” (2) unfair \ncompetition, and (3) unfair and deceptive trade practices (“UDTP”), and requested \nthat the Court enjoin Defendants from falsely representing their affiliations and \ninsurance coverage.  (Compl. 3–5, 7.) \n19. In contrast, the Amended Complaint makes no mention of trademark \ninfringement and does not reassert a claim for false representation, but again asserts \nclaims for unfair competition and UDTP based on nearly identical facts to those \nalleged in the Complaint.  (Compare Compl. ¶¶ 19–32, 40–44, 51–68, with Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 16–33, 36–56.)  The Amended Complaint also adds a claim for tortious interference \n \n \n \nwith contract.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 61 –66.)  Finally, the Amended Complaint asserts \nclaims against the Warranty Defendants and Carrbridge Fidelity, but does not name \nCarrbridge Berkshire as a defendant.  (Am. Compl. 1.) \n20. At this early stage of the litigation, the Court finds no reason to depart from \nthe general rule that leave to amend pleadings should be freely given where justice \nso requires and, therefore, grants Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend. \n21. Although an amended pleading would ordinarily moot a pending motion to \ndismiss, the Court will consider Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss as to the Amended \nComplaint because Defendants and Plaintiff both addressed the sufficiency of the \nAmended Complaint in their respective brief s and at the hearing.  (Reply Br. Supp. \nMot. Dismiss Lack Subject Matter Jurisdiction & Failure State Claim of Defs. \nTruNorth & CompassOne 2, ECF No. 48 [“Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss”]; Br. Opp’n \nMot. Dismiss Lack Subject Matter Jurisdiction & Failure to State Claim of Defs. \nTruNorth and CompassOne 9–15, ECF No. 35 [“Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Dismiss”].) \n22. Because Plaintiff did not name Carrbridge Berkshire as a defendant in the \nAmended Complaint, Carrbridge Berkshire is no longer a named party-defendant in \nthis action, having been effectively dismissed by Plaintiff.  Therefore, Carrbridge \nBerkshire’s Motion to Dismiss is denied as moot.  Accordingly, the Court limits its \nfurther discussion to the Motion to Dismiss filed by the Warranty Defendants, \nreferred to hereafter as Defendants. \n \n \n \nV. MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. Factual Background \n23. The Court does not make determinations of fact on motions to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”) but only \nrecites those factual allegations of the  Amended Complaint that are relevant and \nnecessary to the Court’s determination of the motions to dismiss.  To the extent \nadditional facts are presented by the record that are relevant to Defendants’ \narguments that dismissal is proper under Rule 12(b)(1), those facts will be addressed \nin later relevant portions of this Order and Opinion. \n1. The Parties \n24. Gateway is a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of business \nin Forsyth County.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 1.) \n25. TruNorth is a North Carolina limited liability company with its principal \nplace of business in Mecklenburg County.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 2.) \n26. CompassOne is a North Carolina limited liability company that maintained \nits principal place of business in Mecklenburg County before it was administratively \ndissolved.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 3.) \n27. The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants are affiliated companies \nowned in whole or in part by William Kirk Eskridge (“Eskridge”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 5.) \n28. Prior to the instant litigation, in 2014 Plaintiff filed a complaint against \nCarrbridge Berkshire and Eskridge to recover money owed to Plaintiff on a \npromissory note (the “2014 Litigation”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 14.)  Plaintiff alleges that the \n \n \n \nclaims in this a ction were neither a part of the 2014 Litigation nor included in the \nsettlement thereof.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 14.) \n2. Commercial Truck Warranty Business \n29. Gateway and Defendants are direct competitors in the used commercial \ntruck warranty business.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 6.) \n30. Because Gateway and Defendants often issue warranties for older model \ncommercial trucks with extensive mileage, the parties must maintain substantial \ncapital, adequate reserves, and adequate insurance to be able to cover customers’ \nwarranty claims.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 8–9.) \n31. Gateway maintains substantial capital, reserves, and insurance to cover its \noutstanding warranty claims.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 10.)  Gateway alleges that, although \nDefendants do not have substantial assets or sufficient insurance to pay all of the ir \nvalid warranty claims, Defendants falsely represent to the public that they have \nsubstantial assets and insurance and are affiliated with or reinsured by companies \nwith substantial assets and insurance.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11–12.)  Specifically, Gateway \nalleges that (1) TruNorth, although not insured, advertises and represents that it is \ninsured by “Barclay/CF/LOL,” with “LOL” referring to Lloyd’s of London Insurance \nCompany (“Lloyd’s of London”), (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17 –18); and (2) the Warranty \nDefendants advertise and represent that they are insured or reinsured by Carrbridge \nFidelity, (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 19, 23 –24).  Gateway alleges that neither the Warranty \nDefendants nor Carrbridge Fidelity are insured or reinsured by Lloyd’s of London, \n \n \n \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20, 22), and  that Carrbridge Fidelity is not an insurance or \nreinsurance company, or even an existing company, (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 26–27). \n32. The Amended Complaint further alleges that Defendants falsely advertise \nthat they are part of or affiliated with Berkshire Hathaway, a  multibillion dollar \ncompany that is partly owned by Warren Buffett.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28–29.) \n33. Gateway alleges that Defendants’ above-described false representations led \nto confusion in the marketplace, constituted unfair competition, and usurped \nGateway’s c ommercial advantage that Gateway earned through skill, labor, and \nefforts, causing Gateway to lose customers and revenue.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, 40–48.) \n34. The Amended Complaint asserts claims against Defendants for (1) unfair \ncompetition, (2) UDTP, and (3) tortious interference with contract and requests that \nthe Court enjoin Defendants from falsely representing their affiliations and \ninsurance coverage.  (Am. Compl. 3–7.) \nB. The Motion to Dismiss \n35. Defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and additionally pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for \nfailure to state a claim.  (Mot. Dismiss Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction & Failure \nState Claim of Defs.’ TruNorth & CompassOne, ECF No. 16.) \nC. Legal Standard \n1. Rule 12(b)(1) \n36. “Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court’s proper exercise of subject \nmatter jurisdiction.”  Neuse River Found., Inc. v. Smithfield Foods, Inc. , 155 N.C. \n \n \n \nApp. 110, 113, 574 S.E.2d 48, 51 (2002).  When it appears that the court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction, the court shall dismiss the action.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule \n12(h)(3).  “A motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not viewed in \nthe same manner as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted.”  Tart v. Walker, 38 N.C. App. 500, 502, 248 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1978).  \nA court may consider matters outside the pleadings in determining whether subject \nmatter jurisdiction exists.  Keith v. Wallerich, 201 N.C. App. 550, 554, 687 S.E.2d 299, \n302 (2009); Tart, 38 N.C. App. at 502, 248 S.E.2d at 737.  However, “if the trial court \nconfines its evaluation [of standing] to the pleadings, the court must accept as true \nthe plaintiff’s allegations and construe them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.”  Munger v. State, 202 N.C. App. 404, 410, 689 S.E.2d 230, 235 (2010). \n2. Rule 12(b)(6) \n37. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)( 6), the Court \nreviews the allegations of the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiff.  The Court’s inquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the \ncomplaint, treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which rel ief may be \ngranted under some legal theory.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank of N.C., 85 N.C. App. \n669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).  The Court construes the Amended Complaint \nliberally and accepts all allegations as true.  Laster v. Francis , 199 N.C. App. 572, \n577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009).  The Court is not required “to accept as true \nallegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human \n \n \n \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005).  The Court can also ignore \na party’s legal conclusions set forth in its pleading.  McCrann v. Pinehurst, LLC, 225 \nN.C. App. 368, 377, 737 S.E.2d 771, 777 (2013). \n38. Where the pleading refers to and depends on certain documents, the Court \nmay consider those documents without converting the motion into one for summary \njudgment under Rule 56.  Schlieper v. Johnson, 195 N.C. App. 257, 261, 672 S.E.2d \n548, 551 (2009).  A “trial court can reject allegations that are contra dicted by the \ndocuments attached, specifically referred to, or incorporated by reference in the \ncomplaint.”  Laster, 199 N.C. App. at 577, 681 S.E.2d at 862.  At the same time, the \nCourt may not consider materials that are not mentioned, contained, or atta ched in \nor to the pleading; otherwise, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion will be converted into a Rule 56 \nmotion and subject to its standards of consideration and review.  Fowler v. \nWilliamson, 39 N.C. App. 715, 717, 251 S.E.2d 889, 890−91 (1979). \n39. Dismissal of a clai m pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports [the] claim; (2) when the complaint \nreveals on its face the absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; [or] (3) when \nsome fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the . . . claim.”  Oates v. JAG, \nInc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985); see also Jackson v. Bumgardner, \n318 N.C. 172, 175, 347 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1986).  Otherwise, “a complaint should not \nbe dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff is entitled \nto no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.”  \nSutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) (emphasis omitted). \n \n \n \nD. Plaintiff’s Standing \n \n40. Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert claims for unfair \ncompetition and UDTP.  (Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 3 –5.)  Although the Court \nmay consider matters that are outside the pleadings in deciding whether subject \nmatter jurisdiction exists, Keith, 201 N.C. App. at 554, 687 S.E.2d at 302, Defendants’ \nmaterials filed in support of the motion to dismiss relate to whether Plaintiff, in \nsettling the 2014 Litigation, released its claims against Defendants, (s ee Aff. \nRaymond M. Bennett, ECF No. 1 8; Bennett Aff. Exs. A –B, ECF Nos. 19 –20).  The \nCourt declines to consider these materials as they have no bearing on whether \nPlaintiff has standing to assert an unfair competition or UDTP claim.  As a result, \nthe Court confines its analysis of Plaintiff’s standing to the pleadings.  \n41. “Standing refers to whether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise \njusticiable controversy such that he or she may properly seek adjudication of the \nmatter.”  Am. Woodland Indus., Inc. v. Tolson, 155 N.C. App. 624, 626, 574 S.E.2d 55, \n57 (2002).  Standing requires “that the plaintiff have been injured or threatened by \ninjury or have a statutory right to institute an action.”  Bruggeman v. Meditrust Co., \nL.L.C., 165 N.C. App. 790, 795, 600 S.E.2d 507, 511 (2004) (quotation marks omitted).  \n“If a party does not have standing to bring a claim, a court has no subject matter \njurisdiction to hear the claim.”  Estate of Apple v. Commercial Courier Express, Inc. , \n168 N.C. App. 175, 177, 607 S.E.2d 14, 16 (2005). \n42. Under North Carolina law, a party has standing if he is the real party in \ninterest.  Energy Inv’rs Fund, L.P. v. Metric Constructors, Inc., 351 N.C. 331, 337, 525 \n \n \n \nS.E.2d 441, 445 (2000).  “A real party in interest is one who benefits from or is harmed \nby the outcome of the case and by substantive law has the legal right to enforce the \nclaim in question.”  Id. at 824, 611 S.E.2d at 193–94. \n43. Although North Carolina courts are not constrained by the federal standing \nrequirements of Article III of the Un ited States Constitution, our courts have \nfrequently considered the federal standard as instructive in deciding whether a party \nis a real party in interest.  See Goldston v. State, 361 N.C. 26, 35, 637 S.E.2d 876, 882 \n(2006); Teague v. Bayer AG, 195 N.C. App. 18, 22, 671 S.E.2d 550, 554 (2009).  Under \nthat standard, the elements of standing are: \n(1) “injury in fact” —an invasion of a legally protected interest that is \n(a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical ; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to \nmerely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision. \n \nNeuse River Found., Inc. , 155 N.C. App. at 114, 574 S.E.2d a t 52 (quoting Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560−61 (1992)).  “Standing most often turns on \nwhether the party has alleged ‘injury in fact’ in light of the applicable statutes or case \nlaw.”  Id. \n44. Plaintiff, as the party invoking the Court’s ju risdiction, has the burden of \nestablishing standing.  Cherry v. Wiesner, 781 S.E.2d 871, 876 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016).  \n“In establishing the elements of standing, each element must be supported in the \nsame way as any other matter on which [Plaintiff] bears the burden of proof, i.e., with \nthe manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  \n \n \n \nCherry Cmty. Org. v. City of Charlotte , 809 S.E.2d 397, 400 (N.C. Ct. App. 2018) \n(quotation marks and emphasis omitted). \n45. Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert its unfair \ncompetition claim because that claim is based on Defendants’ alleged \nmisappropriation of the commercial advantage of third parties, not Plaintiff.  (Reply \nBr. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 3 –4.)  Defendants argue tha t Plaintiff’s UDTP claim is, in \nreality, a fraud claim for which Plaintiff lacks standing because Plaintiff does not \nallege that it was deceived by Defendants’ alleged false statements.  (Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss Lack Subject Matter Jurisdiction & Failure St ate Claim of Defs. TruNorth \n& CompassOne 1 –2, 8–9, ECF No. 17 [“Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss”]; Reply Br. Supp. \nMot. Dismiss 4, 7–8.) \n46. The Court notes initially that Plaintiff’s claims for common law unfair \ncompetition and UDTP are premised on nearly identical fa ctual allegations that \nDefendants’ false association with third parties resulted in unfair competition in the \ncommercial truck warranty business.  (Compare Am. Compl. ¶¶ 16–28, 33, with Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 36–40, 43–51.) \n47. The distinction between common law unfair competition and UDTP claims \nis not clear as “[t]he standard for violation of the UDTPA and common law unfair \ncompetition are not ‘appreciably different.’”  Silicon Knights, Inc. v. Epic Games, Inc., \nNo. 5:07-CV-275-D, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31039, at *52–53 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2011) \n(quoting BellSouth Corp. v. White Directory Publishers, Inc., 42 F. Supp. 2d 598, 615 \n(M.D.N.C. 1999)).  The key distinction between the two claims is that common law \n \n \n \nunfair competition claims are limited to claims between busine ss competitors, \nwhereas a UDTP claim may be maintained by a consumer or a business competitor.  \nSee Henderson v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 124 N.C. App. 103, 108, 476 S.E.2d 459, 462 \n(1996) (“The primary purpose of [unfair and deceptive acts] statutes was to extend to \nthe consuming public the protection once afforded only to business competitors \nthrough the common law  tort of unfair competition , which required a showing of \ncompetitive injury and hence was not an effective remedy for consumers.  On the \nother ha nd, statutory unfair competition  extends to all unfair and deceptive \npractices.”). \n1. Common Law Unfair Competition \n48. Defendants contend that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert a claim for \ncommon law unfair competition, which Defendants characterize as a tradem ark \ninfringement claim, because Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants have infringed \na trademark or commercial advantage belonging to Plaintiff.  (Reply Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss 3, 5–7; see also Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 10.)  Plaintiff contends that it doe s \nnot assert a trademark infringement claim, but instead alleges that Defendants \nunfairly usurped Plaintiff’s commercial advantage by falsely associating themselves \nwith other companies.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Dismiss 9–10.) \n49. “Traditionally at common law, including that of North Carolina, the tort of \nunfair competition has consisted of acts or practices by a competitor which are likely \nto deceive the consuming public.”  Stearns v. Genrad, Inc. , 564 F. Supp. 1309, 1320 \n(M.D.N.C. 1983) (citing Charcoal Steak H ouse of Charlotte, Inc. v. Staley , 263 N.C. \n \n \n \n199, 139 S.E.2d 185 (1964)).  “The gravamen of unfair competition is the protection \nof a business from misappropriation of its commercial advantage earned through \norganization, skill, labor, and money.”  Henderson v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 346 N.C. \n741, 749, 488 S.E.2d 234, 239 –40 (1997).  Unfair competition has been found to \nencompass a range of behaviors “such as trademark infringement, imitation of a \ncompetitor’s product or its appearance, interference with a c ompetitor’s contractual \nrelations, [and] disparagement of a competitor’s product or business methods, and \nmisappropriation of a competitor’s intangible property rights such as advertising \ndevices or business systems.”  Stearns, 564 F. Supp. at 1320. \n50. A review of cases involving a defendant’s advertisements alleged to \nconstitute unfair competition reveal that such claims generally involve a defendant’s \nattempt to capitalize on or harm plaintiff’s goodwill by, for example, falsely \nrepresenting that defen dant’s products are identical or superior to plaintiff’s \nproducts, passing off its products as plaintiff’s products, or disparaging plaintiff’s \nproduct or business methods.  See id. at 1309, 1320; Henderson, 124 N.C. App. at 109, \n476 S.E.2d at 463 (collect ing cases).  Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants falsely \nadvertised and represented to the consuming public that they are insured by Lloyd’s \nof London and associated with Berkshire Hathaway when they are not so insured or \nassociated.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11, 16–29, 36–50.)  Thus, to the extent Defendants have \nmisappropriated any business’s commercial advantage, it has misappropriated the \ncommercial advantage of Lloyd’s of London or Berkshire Hathaway, or those \n \n \n \ncompanies who in fact are affiliated with Lloyd’s of London or Berkshire Hathaway—\nnot Plaintiff. \n51. Based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that Plaintiff is not the real \nparty in interest with respect to its common law unfair competition claim and, \ntherefore, lacks standing to assert this claim.  Acco rdingly, Plaintiff’s unfair \ncompetition claim is dismissed without prejudice.  See Holton v. Holton, ___ N.C. App. \n___, No. COA17-467, 2018 N.C. App. LEXIS 297, at *13 (N.C. Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2018) \n(“[A] dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) must be made without prejudice, since a trial court \nwithout jurisdiction would lack authority to adjudicate the matter.”). \n2. UDTP Claim \n52. Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s UDTP claim is a misnamed claim for \nfraud for which Plaintiff lacks standing because Plaintiff does not allege that \nDefendants made any misrepresentation to Plaintiff.  (Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 8–10.)  \nThe Court does not agree that Plaintiff’s UDTP claim is an improperly pleaded fraud \nclaim.  Rather, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 creates a cause of action broader than common \nlaw fraud and may include conduct that does not meet the requirements for fraud.  \nSee Bumpers v. Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 267 N.C. 81, 87–88, 747 S.E.2d 220, 226 (2013) \n(noting that § 75 -1.1 “is broader and covers more than traditional common law \nproscriptions on tortious conduct, though fraud and deceit tend to be included within \nits ambit”).  Thus, for purposes of the Motion to Dismiss, the Court treats Plaintiff’s \nallegations as a claim that Defendants, by falsely representing to the consuming \npublic that Defendants have ample insurance and assets to pay warranty claims, \n \n \n \nunfairly attract customers to their bus iness and away from Plaintiff’s business, \nthereby causing Plaintiff harm. \n53. Standing for redress of UDTP is governed by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-16, which \nprovides: \nIf any person  shall be injured or the business of any person, firm or \ncorporation shall be broken up, destroyed or injured by reason of any act \nor thing done by any other person, firm or corporation in violation of the \nprovisions of this Chapter, such person, firm or corporation so injured \nshall have a right of action on account of such injury done . . . . \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-16 (emphasis added).  Thus, standing for a UDTP claim is broad \nand gives anyone whose injury is proximately caused by an unfair or deceptive act \nstanding to sue.  See Walker v. Fleetwood Homes of N.C., Inc. , 362 N.C. 63, 67 –68, \n653 S.E.2d 393, 396 –97 (2007).  However, as with other causes of action, to have \nstanding to bring a UDTP claim, “the plaintiff must prove the elements of standing, \nincluding ‘injury in fact.’”  Carcano v. JBSS, LLC, 200 N.C. App. 162, 175, 684 S.E.2d \n41, 52 (2009).   \n54. Plaintiff contends that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges an \ninjury in fact by alleging that Defendants’ conduct has diminished Plaintiff’s position \nin the truck warranty market and has caused Plaintiff to lose current and potential \ncustomers.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Dismiss 7.) \n55. Plaintiff’s allegations of harm are that Defendants, by falsely associating \nthemselves with third parties, misappropriated a commercial advantage, deceived \nthe public and Plaintiff’s customers and potential cust omers, “unfairly usurp[ed] \nbusiness potential from Plaintiff by enticing customers and potential customers” \n \n \n \naway from Plaintiff, and caused Plaintiff to lose revenue.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, 30–33, \n51–54, 56.)  The only allegations of harm incurred by Plaintif f, as opposed to the \npublic, are conclusory allegations that Defendants misappropriated a commercial \nadvantage, usurped “business potential” by luring away customers and potential \ncustomers, and caused Plaintiff to lose revenue.  However, as discussed above, while \nit is generally alleged that Defendants misappropriated a commercial advantage, \nPlaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that Defendants misappropriated Plaintiff’s \ncommercial advantage.  Thus, the only non-conclusory allegation of harm to Plaintiff \nis that Defendants’ advertising enticed customers to select Defendants instead of \nPlaintiff for their commercial truck warranty needs, thereby causing Plaintiff to lose \nrevenue. \n56. While the Court must view the allegations of the Amended Complaint in \nthe lig ht most favorable to Plaintiff on a motion to dismiss for lack of standing, \nMunger, 202 N.C. App. at 410, 689 S.E.2d at 235, the Court cannot conclude that the \nAmended Complaint alleges anything other than speculative or conjectural injuries. \n57. Therefore, Plaintiff fails to allege a concrete, particularized injury sufficient \nto establish that Plaintiff has standing to bring its UDTP claim based on Defendants’ \nconduct.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s UDTP claim is dismissed without prejudice.  \nE. Failure to State a Claim Under Rule 12(b)(6) \n1. Tortious Interference with Contract \n58. The Amended Complaint asserts a claim for tortious interference with \ncontract alleging that Plaintiff had valid contracts with customers and that \n \n \n \nDefendants, through their prior affiliation with Plaintiff, were aware of the existence \nof Plaintiff’s contracts with its customers.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 61 –62.)  Plaintiff further \nalleges that Defendants, by falsely representing their insurance coverage and \naffiliations, “intentionally induced certain customer s of Plaintiff to discontinue \nbusiness, and thus breach their contracts” with Plaintiff and instead engage in \nbusiness with Defendants.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, 31 –33, 51–53, 63.)  The Amended \nComplaint alleges that Defendants’ conduct lured away customers and potential \ncustomers who were doing business with Plaintiff, were likely to continue to do \nbusiness with Plaintiff, or would engage in new business with Plaintiff in the future.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 33, 51.)  Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants intended to damage \nPlaintiff’s business and that their actions were intentional, malicious, and without \njustification.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 64–65.) \n59. In order to state a claim for tortious interference with contract, Plaintiff \nmust allege: \n(1) A valid contract between the p laintiff and a third person which \nconfers upon the plaintiff a contractual right against a third person; \n(2) defendant knows of the contract; (3) the defendant intentionally \ninduces the third party not to perform the contract; (4) and in doing so \nacts without justification; (5) resulting in actual damage to the plaintiff. \n \nBeverage Sys. of the Carolinas, LLC v. Associated Beverage Repair, LLC , 368 N.C. \n693, 700, 784 S.E.2d 457, 462 (2016). \n60. Defendants contend that the allegations of the Amended Complaint fail to \nadequately allege that Plaintiff had a valid contract with a third party or that \nDefendants acted without justification.  (Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 9 –11.)  \n \n \n \nPlaintiff does not disp ute that it is required to adequately allege the existence of a \nvalid contract; instead, Plaintiff only addresses whether it has adequately alleged \nthat Defendants’ conduct was not justified.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Dismiss 14–15.) \n61. The Amended Complaint all eges that Defendants induced “certain \ncustomers of Plaintiff to discontinue business, and thus to breach their contracts, \nwith Plaintiff.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 63.)  The Amended Complaint also alleges that \n“Defendants . . . were aware of the identity of customers of [Plaintiff] and were aware \nof the existence of contracts between [Plaintiff] and customers.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 62.)  \nThe Court concludes that these threadbare allegations are insufficient, even under \nthe liberal Rule 12(b)(6) standard, to adequately alle ge the existence of a valid \ncontract. \n62. Because Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently identify a contract with which \nDefendants allegedly interfered, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to state \na claim for tortious interference with contract, and t his claim is dismissed with \nprejudice. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n63. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: \nA. Because all parties agree that Carrbridge Fidelity is not a proper \nparty to this action, the Court DENIES as moot the Motions to \nQuash and all claims against Carrbridge Fidelity are dismissed. \nB. The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Amend. \n \n \n \nC. As a result of Plaintiff’s amendment of its Complaint, whereby \nPlaintiff does not assert any claims against Defendant Carrbridge \nBerkshire in the Amended Complaint, Carrbridge Berkshire is no \nlonger a party-defendant in this litigation.  Accordingly, Carrb ridge \nBerkshire’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED as moot. \nD. The Court GRANTS the Warranty Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  \nThe Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s unfair \ncompetition and UDTP claims against the Warranty Defendants, \nand those claims are dismissed without prejudice.  Plaintiff’s tortious \ninterference with contract claim is dismissed with prejudice. \nSO ORDERED, this the 9th day of May, 2018. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
