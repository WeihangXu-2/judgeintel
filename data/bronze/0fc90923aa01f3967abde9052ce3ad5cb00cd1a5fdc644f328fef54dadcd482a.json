JT Russell and Sons, Inc. (“JT Russell”) is a family business.  In this lawsuit, \nit alleges that Atlas James (“Jim”) Russell, a onetime officer, unlawfully diverted its \nassets to benefit himself, his son, and two companies that he partly owns.  Jim denies \nthese allegations and has moved to dismiss some of the claims against him.  His fellow \ndefendants—The Tillery Tradition, Inc. and Mid -Eastern Asphalt, LL C—have \nlikewise moved to dismiss certain claims .  For the following reasons, the Cou rt \n \n \nGRANTS Mid-Eastern Asphalt’s motion and GRANTS in part and DENIES in \npart Jim’s and Tillery Tradition’s motions.1 \nTroutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP , by William C.

Russell, Raymond Russell, and Tony W. Russell. \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n2. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion to dismiss.  The \nfollowing background assumes that the allegations of the amended complaint are \ntrue. \n3. JT Russell has been in the asphalt and road construction business for nearly \nsixty years.  At issue here are JT Russell’s allegations that Jim—an officer from 1998 \nto 2018  and still a minority shareholder today —abused his official position \nthroughout his twenty -year tenure  by channeling company money and resources \ntoward his other personal and business interests.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 3, 29, ECF \nNo. 15.) \n \n1 Jim has also counterclaimed against JT Russell and some of its officers and directors.  A \nseparate opinion addresses the motions to dismiss his counterclaims. \n \n \n4. One of these interest s is Tillery Tradition, a country club and residential \ncommunity in which Jim is a n offi cer and  shareholder.  As alleged , Jim secretly \nfunded Tillery Tradition’s development and built much of its infrastructure using JT \nRussell’s cash, equipment, and workers.  Jim also named JT Russell as a guarantor \non two loans taken by Tillery Tradition and advanced dividends to himself so that he \ncould repay a third loan.  At no point did Jim seek or get the approval of JT Russell’s \nshareholders or directors for these activities.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 32, 36, 37, 40, 56–\n58, 60, 61, 68, 71, 72, 77.) \n5. According to JT Russell, Jim and Tillery Tradition agreed after the fact to \npay back all the cash used to fund the community’s development.  But they didn’t \nfollow through.  At the end of 2019, after relieving Jim of his official duties, JT Russell \nwrote to Tillery Tradition to demand repayment of nearly $11 million in principal and \ninterest.  Tillery Tradition did not respond.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 45, 48, 50–54.) \n6. Another of Jim’s interests is Mid-Eastern Asphalt, which he formed in 2013.  \nMid-Eastern Asphalt is itself a member of another company called JTR Asphalt, LLC.  \nSome allegations concerning these entities point to trademark infringement: that \nJTR Asphalt’s name mislead s customers into believing that it is affiliate d with JT \nRussell when it is not.  Other allegations point to a scheme involving sales of liquid \nasphalt to JT Russell by a company called SWT Group.  How that scheme worked is \nunclear; the most that can be said is that  Jim supposedly used the business \nrelationship with SWT Group to divert profits to JTR Asphalt (and, thus,  to \n \n \nMid-Eastern Asphalt and himself).  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶  83, 85, 98, 102, 104, 106, \n107.) \n7. In addition to advancing his personal interests,  Jim allegedly dished out \nfavors to his son, Nathan.  Among other things, Jim let Nathan run a competing \nbusiness (NJR Group, Inc.) while employed by JT Russell, engaged NJR Group as a \nsubcontractor for JT Russell, and gave NJR Group jobs that JT Russell had bid for \nand won.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 125, 126, 128–30.) \n8. Based o n these allegations, JT Russell sued Jim, Tillery  Tradition, and \nMid-Eastern Asphalt.  The amended complaint includes claims for breach of fiduciary \nduty and constructive fraud (against Jim  only); account stated (against Tillery \nTradition only); conversion, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract  (against Jim \nand Tillery Tradition); and unfair or deceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 \n(against Jim, Tillery Tradition, and Mid-Eastern Asphalt).  There is also a remedial \nclaim for constructive trust. \n9. Jim, Tillery Tradition, and Mid-Eastern Asphalt have each moved to dismiss \nsome of these  claims under Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  (See ECF Nos. 20, 21, 24.)  The motions have been fully briefed, and the \nCourt held a hearing on 17 January 2024.  The motions are ripe for decision.  \nII. \nANALYSIS \n10. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim “tests the legal sufficiency of \nthe complaint.”  Isenhour v. Hutto, 350 N.C. 601, 604 (1999) (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  Dismissal is proper when “(1) the complaint on its face reveals that \n \n \nno law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence \nof facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that \nnecessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. \n605, 615 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  In deciding the motion, the \nCourt must treat all well -pleaded allegations as true and view the facts and \npermissible inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See, e.g., \nSykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, 332 (2019).   \nA. Section 75-1.1 \n11. Section 75-1.1 states that “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting \ncommerce” are “unlawful.”  Our Supreme Court has held that this language is broad \nenough “to regulate a business’s regular interactions with other market participants” \nbut not so broad as to capture conduct “solely related to the internal operations of” a \nbusiness.  White v. Thompson , 364 N.C. 47, 51 –52 (2010).  Thus, “any unfair or \ndeceptive conduct contained solely within a single business is ” not in or affecting \ncommerce and “not covered by” the statute.  Id. at 53; see also Nobel v. Foxmoor Grp., \n380 N.C. 116, 121–22 (2022). \n12. JT Russell ’s claim is rooted in Jim’s alleged advancement of his own \ninterests at its expense : funneling cash and services to Tillery Tradition , siphoning \nprofits through Mid-Eastern Asphalt, and diverting corporate opportunities to  his \nson’s business.  Jim, Tillery Tradition, and Mid -Eastern Asphalt argue that these \nmisuses of corporate resources, if true, are matters internal to JT Russell and, thus, \nnot in or affecting commerc e within the meaning of section 75 -1.1.  JT Russell \n \n \nresponds that its allegations go beyond its internal operations because they involve \ntransactions with outside entities that occurred in the broader marketplace. \n13. This is a well-worn area of law.  The docket brims with section 75-1.1 claims \nalleging that a rogue owner or officer abused his official position to further personal \ninterests.  Uniformly, our appellate courts and this Court have held that an insider’s \nmisappropriation of corporate resources  and usurpation of corporate opportunities  \nare internal matters that are not in or affecting commerce , even when the insider \ndiverts those resources and opportunities to his own separate business entity or to a \nfamily member.  Various rationales support t hese decisions, the most powerful  of \nwhich is that any unfairness arising from this kind of insider misconduct occurs \nwithin the company  rather than in regular interactions with other market \nparticipants.  See White, 364 N.C. at 5 4 (concluding tha t partner’s diversion of \ncorporate opportunities to his competing business involved “conduct within the ACE \npartnership”).2 \n \n2 See also, e.g. , Conservation Station, Inc. v. Bolesky , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 164, at * 29 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Dec. 12, 2023) (“Bolesky’s formation of CTS and usurpation of CSI’s corporate \nopportunities was not in or affecting commerce for purposes of” section 75 -1.1.); Langley v. \nAutocraft, Inc., 2023 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 7, 2023) (“[T]he fact that \nLangley formed LBM and used that entity to usurp some of Autocraft’s opportunities does \nnot transform the misconduct into an unfair or deceptive trade practice that affected \ncommerce.”); Poluka v. Willette, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 105, at  *17–21 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 2, \n2021) (“The mere presence of BR Ventures as a potential beneficiary of Willette’s alleged \nwrongful conduct does not alter the fundamental character of this internal dispute.”); \nBotanisol Holdings II, LLC v. Propheter , 2021 NCBC LEXIS 94, at *26 –28 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 18, 2021) (“The fact that another entity or entities benefitted .  . . does not make the \ndispute one ‘in and affecting commerce.’ ”); Kane v. Moore, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 184, at *13 –\n14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 4, 2018)  (“North Carolina courts have consistently held that \nallegations that a corporate manager  breached fiduciary duties by diverting opportunities \nfrom a corporation to [himself], or to other third -party businesses the manager controlled, \ndoes not amount to un fair conduct ‘in or affecting commerce.’  ”); LLG-NRMH, LLC v. N. \nRiverfront Marina & Hotel, LLLP , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 105, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, \n \n \n14. Add this case to the pile.  Over and over, the amended complaint  accuses \nJim of “sabotage,” “theft,” “pillaging,” “loot[ing],” and “personally profiting” from the \nabuse of his official position within JT Russell.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19.)  \nIt is neither here nor there that  Jim may have routed the fruits of his theft to  or \nthrough separate entities (Tillery Tradition, Mid -Eastern Asphalt) and family \nmembers (Nathan, NJR Group) .  The unfairness of his conduct, if any, is wholly \ninternal to JT Russell.  See White, 364 N.C. at 53–54 (holding that section 75-1.1 did \nnot apply to  partner’s diversion of opportunities to his separate business and away \nfrom the partnership); Alexander v. Alexander, 250 N.C. App. 511, 517 (2016) (holding \nthat insider’s payments made “for the benefit of himself and his family members are \nmore properly classified as the misappropriation of corporate funds within a single \nentity rather than commercial transactions between separate market participants”). \n15. The cases cited by JT Russell are inapposite  for that reason.  There, unlike \nhere, the claims involved “buyer-seller relations in a business setting,” Sara Lee Corp. \nv. Carter, 351 N.C. 27, 32–33 (1999), and “misrepresentations to [third-party] clients,” \nWilkie v. Stanley, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 11, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 20, 2011).  The \n \n2018) (“That Schoninger advanced the interests of his own entities at the expense of the \nHarnett Entities does not change the fundamental character of the dispute.” (citation and \nquotation marks omitted)); Potts v. KEL, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMar. 27, 2018) (“Rives may have carried out his . . . misappropriation of Steel Tube’s assets \nby channeling money and equipment to Elite Tube and diverting a corporate opportunity to \nKEL.  But the unfairness of these actions, if any, inheres in the relationship between Potts \nand Rives as co-owners of Steel Tube.”); JS Real Est. Invs. LLC v. Gee Real Est ., LLC, 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 104, at *21 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 9, 2017) (“The fact that Defendants channeled \nmanagement fees to Gvest Capital, an outside entity, does not change the fundamental \ncharacter of the dispute.”); Bandy v. Gibson, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 66, at *21 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJuly 26, 2017) (“Any indirect dealings that Margaret or Perfect Fit had with other market \nparticipants was incidental to the alleged unfair conduct that took place solely within Perfect \nFit.”). \n \n \nunfairness, in those circumstances,  was not internal.  It  “occurred in the broader \nmarketplace.”  Powell v. Dunn, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 3, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 28, \n2014). \n16. JT Russell also argues in passing  that JTR Asphalt  has used the letters \n“JTR” to trade on its name and  mislead customers , all o f which  is conduct in or \naffecting commerce .  Without d oubt, trademark infringement  may serve as a \npredicate for a section 75-1.1 claim.  See Ray Lackey Enters., Inc. v. Vill. Inn Lakeside, \nInc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 9, at *37 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 29, 2016).  But JT Russell has \nnot pleaded the elements of trademark infringement.  Nor has it alleged a basis for \nattributing trademark infringement by JTR Asphalt, a nonparty, to Jim.  \n17. For all these reasons, the Court concludes that JT Russell has not alleged \nthat Jim, Tillery Tradition, or Mid -Eastern Asphalt committed any unfair or \ndeceptive acts in or affecting commerce within the meaning of section 75 -1.1.  T he \nCourt therefore dismisses this claim. \nB. Breach of Contract & Account Stated \n18. JT Russell’s claims for breach of contract and account stated are based on  \nallegations that Jim and Tillery Tradition promised, expressly or implicitly, to repay \nmillions of dollars in undocumented transf ers.  Jim seeks to dismiss  the claim for \nbreach of contract; Tillery Tradition seeks to dismiss the claim for account stated. \n19. Breach of Contract Against Jim.   The elements of a claim for breach of \ncontract are the existence of a valid contract and a breach  of that contract’s terms.  \nSee Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26 (2000).  “ Our system of notice pleading means \n \n \nthe bar to plead a valid contract is low.”  Lannan v. Bd. of Governors of the Univ. of \nN.C., 285 N.C. App. 574, 596 (2022) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also \nVanguard Pai Lung, LLC v. Moody , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 39, at * 11 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJune 19, 2019) (“[S]tating a claim for breach of contract is a relatively low bar.”). \n20. JT Russell’s allegations, though succinct, are sufficient.  Viewed in the light \nmost favorable to JT Russell, the allegations show that Jim offered to pay back all \nthe money that he had transferred to Tillery Tradition without board approval, that \nthe amount of repayment would be $9 million,  that JT Russell accepted that offer, \nand that the parties formed a valid contract.  The allegations also show that Jim then \nbreached this contract by failing to pay what he had promised.  Having thus alleged \nthe existence of a contract and a breach of its terms, JT Russell has stated a claim for \nrelief.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 45, 302–05.)   \n21. The main argument in Jim’s opening brief rests on a misreading of the claim.  \nHe points to allegations that he guaranteed Tillery Tradition’s debt to JT Russell in \na series of written agreements between 201 2 and 2017, (see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 47), \nand goes on to argue that these guaranties  cannot support a claim for breach of \ncontract because they expired and are no longer enforceable.  Jim’s argument misses \nthe mark because JT Russell bases its claim on a promise to repay the transfers that \nis distinct from the written guaranties.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 45, 302.)   \n22. Separately, Jim argues that any oral agreement to repay Tillery Tradition’s \ndebt would be barred by the statute of frauds.  It is true that a  “promise to answer \nthe debt, default or miscarriage of another person ” is unenforceable unless \n \n \nmemorialized in writing and signed by the promi sor.  N.C.G.S. §  22-1.  Construed \nliberally, though, the amended complaint alleges that  Jim promised to pay his own \ndebts attributable to breaches of the fiduciary duties that he owed to JT Russell .  \nSection 22 -1 “is inapposite  regarding the payment of one ’s own debts .”  Cooper v. \nCameron, 2015 N.C. App. LEXIS 337, at *13  (N.C. Ct. App. May 5, 2015) \n(unpublished). \n23. Jim’s reply brief argues that the amended complaint lacks particularized \nallegations about when the contract was formed, whether the contract  had other \nmaterial terms , and what consideration JT Russell promised in return.  In its \ndiscretion, the Court declines to consider arguments “raised by the moving party for \nthe first time in a reply brief.”  BCR 7.7. \n24. For these reasons , the Court denies Jim’s motion to dismiss as to JT \nRussell’s claim for breach of contract.  \n25. Account Stated Against Tillery Tradition.   “An account stated is by \nnature a new contract to pay the amount due based on the acceptance of or failure to \nobject to an account rendered.”  Carroll v. McNeill Indus., Inc. , 296 N.C. 205, 209 \n(1978).  To plead its claim, JT Russell must allege that it calculated “the balance due,” \nthat it submitted a statement of account to Tillery Tradition, that Tillery Tradition \nacknowledged “the correctness of that statement,” and that Tillery Tradition made a \npromise, express or implied, “to pay the balance due.”  Id.   \n26. Tillery Tradition  begins by  arguing that a statement of account usually \ntakes the form of an invoice or periodic billing statements.   JT Russell ’s \n \n \ncorrespondence, according to Tillery Tradition , was neither.   It contends that  JT \nRussell sent  a demand for repayment  and an invitation to negotiate , not a true \nstatement of account. \n27. This is a question for discovery.  The relevant correspondence is not attached \nto the amended complaint  (the operative pleading) , and the facts concerning JT \nRussell’s transfers of funds to Tiller y Tradition are disputed and undeveloped .  \nFurthermore, Tillery Tradition has not cited any binding authority that limits a claim \nfor account stated to  the regular exchange of goods and services  documented by  \ninvoices or periodic billing statements.   The purpose of the claim is to enforce  “a \npromise to pay a pre-existing debt,” whether that debt arises from a sale of goods, a \nloan grant, or some other type of transaction.   Id. at 210 ( quoting 6 Corbin on \nContracts §  1307, at 244 (1962)).  And t he statement of account that the claim \nrequires is simply a statement by the creditor calculating the amount of debt owed \nby the debtor.  Construed in the light most favorable to JT Russell, that is exactly \nwhat the amended complaint alleges : that Jim made a series of undocumented \ntransfers of funds from JT Russell  to Tillery Tradition  and that JT Russell later  \n“calculated the balance due” and “submitted” a “statement of the indebtedness” to \nTillery Tradition.  (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 51, 307, 308.)   \n28. Next, Tillery Tradition argues that the claim is barred by the three-year \nstatute of limitations that applies to claims for account stated.  See N.C.G.S. § 1-52(1).  \n“A statute of limitation . . . may be the basis of a 12(b)(6) dismissal if on its face the \ncomplaint reveals the claim is barred.”  Forsyth Mem’l Hosp., Inc. v. Armstrong World \n \n \nIndus., Inc., 336 N.C. 438, 442 (1994).   Tillery Tradition contends that the claim is \nuntimely because JT Russell submitted the statement of account in December 2019 \nbut filed this suit in May 2023, more than three years later.   \n29. This, too, is a question for discovery.  JT Russell alleges that Tillery \nTradition implicitly agreed to the correctness of the statement of account  when it \nfailed to object within a reasonable time, (Am. Compl. ¶ 310).  See Mast v. Lane, 228 \nN.C. App. 294, 297 (2013) (noting that “agreement may be implied by failure of the \nparty to be charged  to object within a reasonable time after the other party has \ncalculated the balance and submitted a statement of the account”  (cleaned up) ).  \n“Consequently, an account stated cause of action did not accrue, if at all, until the \nexpiration of a reasonable amount of time during which [Tillery Tradition] could have \nobjected to the statement at issue.”  Channel Grp., LLC v. Cooper , 2010 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 312, at *12 (N.C. Ct. App. Feb. 16, 2010) (unpublished).   What constitutes a \nreasonable time is a question  of fact that cannot be resolved from the face of the \namended complaint.   \n30. Accordingly, the Court d enies the motion to dismiss the  claim for account \nstated. \nC. Constructive Trust \n31. In its opposition brief, JT Russell state s that it does not object to dismissal \nof its constructive trust claim so long as it may still pursue the imposition of a \nconstructive trust as a remedy.  See Haddock v. Volunteers of Am., 2021 NCBC LEXIS \n8, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 22, 2021) (“A constr uctive trust is not a standalone \n \n \nclaim for relief or cause of action.  Rather, it is a remedy which may or may not be \navailable depending on the underlying causes of action.” (cleaned up)) .  The Court \ntherefore dismisses the remedial claim for constructive trust without prejudice to JT \nRussell’s right to seek a constructive trust as a remedy at a later stage.   \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n32. For these reasons, the Court GRANTS Mid-Eastern Asphalt’s motion to \ndismiss and GRANTS in part and DENIES in part  Jim’s and Tillery Tradition’s \nmotions to dismiss as follows: \na. The Court DISMISSES JT Russell’s section 75 -1.1 claim against Jim, \nTillery Tradition, and Mid-Eastern Asphalt with prejudice.  \nb. The Court  DISMISSES JT Russell’s  claim for constructive trust \nwithout prejudice to its right to pursue a constructive trust as a remedy.   \nc. The Court DENIES the motions to dismiss JT Russell’s claims for \nbreach of contract and account stated. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 28th day of February, 2024. \n \n \n       /s/ Adam M.
