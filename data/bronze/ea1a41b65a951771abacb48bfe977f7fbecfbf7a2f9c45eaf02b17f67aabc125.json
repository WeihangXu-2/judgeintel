(“Sompo”), to\namend its complaint to assert a cause of action for aiding and abetting fraud.\n  \nThe proposed amended\ncomplaint contains a cause of action for fraud.\n  \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the\nmotion to amend to assert a cause of action for aiding and abetting fraud.\nSmith Moore LLP by Alan W. Duncan and Allison O. Van Laningham; Cadwalader, Wickersham\n& Taft, LLP by Michael G. Dolan, Howard R. Hawkins, Jr., Philip J. Loree, Jr. and Clifford H.\nSchoenberg, for Plaintiff Sompo Japan Insurance Inc.\n \nKilpatrick Stockton LLP by Susan H. Boyles, Daniel R. Taylor, Jr. and E. Danielle Thompson\nWilliams; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP by Robert S. Bennett, Mitchell S. Ettinger,\nJohn L. Gardiner, Christopher P. Malloy and Edward J. Yodowitz; Bartlit Beck Herman\nPalenchar & Scott LLP by Philip S. Beck, James B. Heaton, III and Tarek Ismail, for Defendant\nDeloitte & Touche LLP.\n \nI.\n{2}\n      \nThis cause of action is brought by Sompo, a Japanese insurance and reinsurance company that\nparticipated in a reinsurance pool known as the Fortress Re insurance pool, against Deloitte & Touche LLP\n(“Deloitte”), one of the largest accounting firms in the United States.\n  \nSompo asserts claims arising out of\nDeloitte’s role as an independent auditor of financial statements of the Fortress Re insurance pool\nmanaged by Sompo’s former pool agent, Fortress Re, Inc. (“Fortress Re”).\n  \nIn the complaint filed on April\n16, 2003, Sompo seeks monetary relief and asserts claims for negligent misrepresentation, aiding and\nabetting Fortress Re’s breach of its fiduciary duties, fraud, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in\nviolation of N.C.G.S. §§ 75-1.1, \net seq.\n and § 58-63-15(5).\n{3}\n      \nOn December 30, 2004, Sompo filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint.\n  \nIn its\nmotion, Sompo seeks to file an amended complaint “to make editorial changes, to refine certain factual\nallegations and to expand its Aiding and Abetting claim” to include a claim for aiding and abetting fraud.\n \n(Pl.’s Mot. Amend at 1; \nsee also\n Pl.’s Ex. A to Mot. Amend at 50-53.)\nII.\n{4}\n      \nThe parties disagree with respect to the adoption of Section 876(b) of the Restatement (Second) of\nTorts (1979) by the North Carolina appellate courts.\n[1]\n  \nThis Court concludes that: (1) the North Carolina\nappellate courts have not adopted and will not adopt Section 876 on a wholesale basis; (2) the North\nCarolina courts will adopt portions of Section 876 on a case-specific basis, guided by the “concert of\naction” involved; and (3) the result of that approach would be to reject application of the Section to aiding\nand abetting fraud because such a claim would be duplicative and redundant.\n  \nThe latter conclusion is\nbased upon this Court’s belief that an aiding and abetting fraud claim would include an element of intent\nto defraud, making it indistinguishable from fraud for purposes of this case.\n \n{5}\n      \nThe Court starts with the general proposition that the Restatement of Torts is not the law in North\nCarolina unless a specific section has been adopted.\n  \nSee Cassell v. Collins\n, 344 N.C. 160, 472 S.E.2d 770\n(1996); \nMarcus Bros. Textiles, Inc. v. PriceWaterhouse LLP\n, 350 N.C. 214, 513 S.E.2d 171 (1999)\n(Mitchell, C.J. dissenting); \nHedrick v. Raines\n, 344 N.C. 729, 477 S.E.2d 171 (1996).\n{6}\n      \nThere are no North Carolina appellate court decisions directly recognizing a cause of action for\naiding and abetting fraud.\n  \nPlaintiff relies upon the decision of the North Carolina Court of Appeals in\nStetser v. TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.\n, 165 N.C. App. 1, 598 S.E.2d 570 (2004).\n{7}\n      \nIn \nStetser\n, the trial court certified a national class in a class action alleging a collusive scheme\nbetween drug manufacturers and others which inflated the price of a prescription drug over a ten-year\nperiod.\n  \nThe North Carolina Court of Appeals granted the petition for writ of certiorari pursuant to Rule 21\ndue to the “significant impact of the lawsuit, the importance of the issues involved and the need for\nefficient administration of justice.”\n  \nId.\n at 12, 598 S.E.2d at 578-79.\n{8}\n      \nThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s certification of the national plaintiff class.\n  \nThe\nStetser\n court held that the trial court erred in applying North Carolina law to all of the plaintiffs’ claims.\n \nThe Court of Appeals then discussed the issue of conflict of laws and advised that the “substantive law of\nthe state where the injury occurred would be applied to the plaintiffs’ claims for common law fraud, civil\nconspiracy and tortious concert of action.”\n  \nId.\n at 16, 598 S.E.2d at 581.\n  \nThe court further stated that the\ntrial court’s application of North Carolina law to these claims would only have passed constitutional\nmuster if the substantive law of each of the fifty states did not materially differ from North Carolina law.\n \nId.\n at 16-17, 598 S.E.2d at 581.\n  \nThe court then discussed each claim and how the laws applicable to these\nclaims in other states sometimes differ from the applicable law in North Carolina.\n  \nWhen discussing the\n“tortious action in concert” or “aiding and abetting” claim, the court quoted Section 876 of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts.\n  \nId.\n at 19-20, 598 S.E.2d at 583.\n  \nDirectly following this quote, the court\nstated “Our Supreme Court has adopted this section of the Restatement as it is applied to the negligence of\njoint tortfeasors [citing \nBoykin v. Bennett\n, 253 N.C. 725, 118 S.E.2d 12 (1961), \nMcMillan v. Mahoney\n, 99\nN.C. App. 448, 393 S.E.2d 298 (1990) and \nBlow v. Shaughnessy\n, 88 N.C. App. 484, 364 S.E.2d 444\n(1988)].\n  \nSeveral states have not adopted the Restatement’s definition of action in concert as it is outlined\nin [Section] 876 [citing plaintiffs’ exhibit].”\n  \nId.\n at 20, 598 S.E.2d at 583.\n  \nThis discussion by the \nStetser\ncourt illustrated the process by which the trial court should consider the issue of conflict of laws upon\nremand.\n  \nPlaintiff argues that during this discussion the “Court of Appeals had every opportunity to\ndisavow a cause of action for aiding and abetting common law fraud [and] [] did not.”\n  \n(Pls.’ Combined\nMem. Re Aiding and Abetting Fraud at 6.)\n  \nHowever, the Court of Appeals did not undertake to determine\nif a cause of action for aiding and abetting fraud would be recognized in North Carolina.\n  \nIt remanded to\nthe trial court to make appropriate determinations as to the law to be applied in all states, including North\nCarolina.\n{9}\n      \nFurthermore, plaintiff cites this statement in \nStetser\n as proof of North Carolina courts’ adoption of\nthe entirety of Section 876 as the “analytical framework for all aiding and abetting claims.”\n  \n(Pls.’\nCombined Mem. Re Aiding and Abetting Fraud at 3.)\n  \nStetser\n neither recognizes all aiding and abetting\nclaims nor specifically recognizes a claim for aiding and abetting fraud.\n  \nThis statement by the Court of\nAppeals does not apply wholesale to any claims outside of its application in \nBoykin\n, \nMcMillan\n, and \nBlow\n.\n \nHowever, it is instructive with respect to the analytical framework.\n  \nIt does focus clearly on an\nexamination of “acting in concert.”\n{10}\n    \nActing in concert means acting together.\n  \nAs a noun, concert means an agreement in design or plan,\na union formed by mutual communication of opinion and views.\n  \nMerriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n, \nat\nhttp://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary.\n  \nAs a verb, it means to participate or assist in a joint effort to\naccomplish an end.\n  \nId.\n  \nBoykin\n and \nMcMillan\n fit precisely this concept of acting in concert in which the\nconcerted action results in injury.\n  \nEqual culpability led to equal liability.\n  \nThere existed dual fault in those\ncases.\n  \nBlow\n presents an unusual situation in that the decision to apply aiding and abetting to state\nsecurities fraud rested upon federal securities law decisions doing precisely the same thing.\n  \nShortly after\nthe decision in \nBlow\n, its federal underpinnings were removed by the United States Supreme Court in\nCentral Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A.\n, 511 U.S. 164 (1994), which held\nthat there was not a cause of action for aiding and abetting under federal securities laws.\n  \nThe decision in\nBlow\n did make it clear that there could be no aiding and abetting breach of duty without knowledge on the\npart of the abettor of the underlying fraud of the person to whom assistance was provided.\n  \nIn this case, in\norder to establish a claim for aiding and abetting fraud, plaintiff would be required to prove that Deloitte\nintentionally furnished fraudulent financial statements to Fortress Re and Carolina Reinsurance, Ltd.\nknowing that those false statements were being used by the Fortress Re-related parties to defraud\nplaintiff.\n  \nThis Court cannot distinguish that claim from a direct fraud claim.\n  \nThere must be direct\nknowledge and intent to defraud.\n  \nIf that is required, the claims are redundant.\n  \nWhy would it be prudent to\nengraft the requirements of knowledge and intent on an aiding and abetting fraud claim under these\ncircumstances?\n  \nUnintended consequences will result from the elimination of those requirements.\n  \nIf\nprofessionals such as accountants and lawyers could be held liable for fraud when their clients used their\nservices to defraud a third party without the professionals’ intent to participate in the fraud, the costs of\nsuch services would be prohibitive to all but the affluent.\n  \nSuch professionals would either have to incur\nthe expense of investigation into how their services were being used or be placed in the position of\ninsurers of their clients’ honesty.\n  \nEither burden would add an unacceptable cost to the provision of\nnecessary and desirable services.\n  \nAlso, it seems illogical to impose liability for aiding and abetting fraud\nbased upon a lower level of scienter than fraud itself.\n  \nNor would it be consistent with the cases in which\nthe North Carolina courts have based joint liability on comparable culpability.\n  \nWithout knowledge and\nsimilar intent, there can be no joint effort or concert in action.\n{11}\n    \nIf, as plaintiff alleges in its fraud claim, Deloitte acted with knowledge and intent to defraud\nplaintiff, the proof requirements would be the same as they would be for aiding and abetting fraud.\n \nSubmission of both a fraud and an aiding and abetting fraud claim with the same burden of proof would be\nduplicative and confusing to a jury.\n  \nIt would create the possibility of conflicting and inconsistent verdicts.\n{12}\n    \nThe decision of the Bankruptcy Court in \nVendsouth, Inc. v. Arth\n, No. 00-10112C-7G, 2003 WL\n22399581 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Oct. 10, 2003), involved a claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary\nduty.\n  \nJudge Stocks relied on the decision in \nBlow\n exclusively in making his determination that North\nCarolina would recognize such a claim.\n  \nAlthough the underlying rationale for the \nBlow\n opinion was\neliminated by \nCentral Bank\n, the \nBlow\n decision and Judge Stocks’ analysis of it are helpful.\n  \nBoth \nBlow\nand Judge Stocks’ application of it make clear that knowledge of the underlying breach of fiduciary duty\n(or fraud) by the direct tortfeasor is a prerequisite to liability for aiding and abetting.\n  \nMoreover, the\nabettor must provide substantial assistance toward the acknowledged common goal: i.e., help the direct\nactor accomplish the breach of fiduciary duty (or fraud).\n  \nThe distinguishing factor in breach of fiduciary\nduty cases is that the abettor may not stand in a fiduciary relationship to the victim.\n  \nRather than altering\nor expanding the well-established definitions of fiduciary relationships, the courts will likely use aiding\nand abetting breach of fiduciary duty as a better vehicle to accomplish liability for equally culpable acts.\n \nThat same rationale does not apply to fraud, where the elements of proof are the same for fraud and for\naiding and abetting fraud.\n  \nA claim for aiding and abetting fraud is duplicative and redundant since it\nrequires the same scienter as a fraud claim.\n  \nIn contrast, a claim for aiding and abetting a breach of\nfiduciary duty may not be redundant if the abettor has no fiduciary relationship with the victim.\n  \nWhat is\nclear from all the cases and the Restatement is that there is not a lower level of culpability or scienter for\naiding and abetting than for the underlying tort.\n  \nIn this case, Deloitte could not have a fiduciary\nrelationship with the plaintiff and still aid and abet a breach of fiduciary duty if it knew the fiduciary was\nbreaching a duty and it acted to substantially assist in the breach while knowing that its services were\nbeing used for that purpose.\n  \nWere a jury to find that Deloitte knew that the Fortress Re defendants were\ndefrauding plaintiff and intentionally prepared false financial statements to assist them in doing so,\nDeloitte would be guilty of fraud and there would be no need for an aiding and abetting claim.\n{13}\n    \nThe inclusion of an aiding and abetting fraud claim would thus carry with it inherent confusion for\nthe jury.\n  \nWhy should it be called upon to make the same determination twice?\n  \nIf the elements are no\ndifferent, the verdict would have to be the same.\n{14}\n    \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that under the circumstances of this case, the\nNorth Carolina courts would not recognize a claim for aiding and abetting fraud.\n  \nPlaintiff’s motion to\namend the complaint to add that claim is denied.\n  \nExcept as herein provided, plaintiff’s motion for leave to\nfile an amended complaint is granted.\n \n \n            \nSo ordered, this 10th day of June, 2005.\n \n                   \n                                      \n         \n[1]\n Section 876 of the Restatement is entitled “Persons Acting in Concert” and states:\nFor harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he\n(a)  does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a common design with him, or\n(b)  knows that the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the\nother so to conduct himself, or\n(c)  gives substantial assistance to the other in accomplishing a tortious result and his own conduct, separately considered,\nconstitutes a breach of duty to the third person.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 876 (1979)."
