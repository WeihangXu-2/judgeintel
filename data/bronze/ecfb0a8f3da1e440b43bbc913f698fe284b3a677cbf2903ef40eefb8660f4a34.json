Harriott, M.D. v. Cent. Carolina Surgical Eye Assocs., P.A., 2015 NCBC 39.\n \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{3} Plaintiff John T. Harriott, M.D. (“Dr. Harriott” or “Plaintiff”)2 commenced \nthis action by filing a Verified Complaint on October 27, 2014 and a Verified \nAmended Complaint on November 26, 2014 (“Amended Complaint”). \n{4} On January 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder, Preliminary Injunction and Appo intment of Receiver, which this Court \ngranted in its Amended Order on Plaintiff’s Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder, Appointment of Receiver, and Expedited Discovery and Notice of Hearing \ndated January 12, 2015. \n{5} On January 11, 2015, Defendants f iled the Motion to Disqualify with \nsupporting papers. \n{6} On February 25, 2015, this Court ente red an Order Appointing Receiver in \nthis case for the duration of this litigation or until otherwise ordered by this Court. \n{7} On March 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed a brief in opposition to Defendants’ \nMotion to Disqualify along with supporting exhibits.  \n{8} The time for additional briefing, arguments, and submissions has now \nexpired and the Motion to Disqualify is ripe for resolution. \nII. \nBACKGROUND FACTS \n{9} The Court limits its recitation of the background to the facts and \nallegations that are relevant for purposes of resolving the present Motion to \nDisqualify. \n{10} CCSEA was an ophthalmological surgery practice engaged in business at \n3312 Battleground Avenue in Greensboro, North Carolina and at various other \nlocations around the State.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.)  CCSEA conducted business as \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff John T. Harriott, M.D. died on March 5,  2015.  On April 2, 2015, this Court entered an \nOrder granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Substitution of Personal Representatives as Party-Plaintiffs in \nPlace of Now Deceased Party-Plaintiff, whereby Douglas Edward Harriott, Paul Jeffrey Harriott, \nand Brandy Dallas Pressley Infinger were substituted as Party-Plaintiffs. \n \n \n \n“Southeastern Eye Center,” using this trad e name in its operations.  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 12–13.) \n{11} Dr. Epes was an owner, officer, and director of CCSEA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.) \n{12} Dr. Harriott executed an employment contract with CCSEA that ended in \n2010 when he was terminated.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 20.) \n{13} Dr. Harriott commenced an action in Forsyth County Superior Court \nagainst CCSEA for breach of his employme nt contract, and the jury awarded Dr. \nHarriott a verdict against CCSEA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 22–23.) \n{14} On September 10, 2012, the Superior Court of Forsyth County entered \njudgment on the jury’s verdict in favor of Dr. Harriott and against CCSEA in the \namount of $1,835,084.30 (the “Judgment”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 24.)3 \n{15} Although Dr. Harriott attempted to execute on the Judgment, Plaintiff \ncontends that it remains unsatisfied, in pa rticular, because in or around May 2012, \nDr. Epes created Southeastern Cataract Laser Center, PLLC (“SCLC”), and caused \nCCSEA to transfer all or substantially all of CCSEA’s assets to SCLC.  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 25–27; Dr. Epes Aff. ¶ 14.)  Dr. Epes is the sole owner of SCLC, and he and J. \nMark McDaniel, Jr. (“Mr. McDaniel”), Dr . Epes’ business partner, are SCLC’s \nmanagers.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 31; Dr. Epes Aff. ¶¶ 5–6.) \n{16} According to Plaintiff, “SCLC has continued to operate at the same \nprincipal place of business as CCSEA under the trade name Southeastern Eye \nCenter; SCLC utilizes many of the same ke y management staff as SCLC (including \nfamily members of Mr. McDaniel); and SCLC maintains CCSEA is no longer \nproviding medical services.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 42.) \n{17} Plaintiff contends that the transfer of  CCSEA’s assets to SCLC was part of \na scheme to avoid creditors and intended to hinder, defraud, and delay the collection \nof Dr. Harriott’s Judgment.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 35.) \n{18} Plaintiff asks this Court for appropriate relief based on his claims against \nDefendants for breach of fiduciary duty/c onstructive fraud, piercing of corporate \n                                                 \n3 A copy of the Judgment is attached to Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint as Exhibit A. \n \n \nveil, successor liability as to SCLC, fraudulent transfer under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-\n23.1, et seq., unfair trade practices, and constructive trust. \n{19} Defendants filed the current Motion to Disqualify, arguing that Charles T. \nHagan, Esq. (“Mr. Hagan”) formerly repres ented them on matters related to this \nlawsuit, and now Mr. Hagan is currently a member of the law firm of Hagan Davis \nMangum Barrett & Langley, PLLC (the “Firm”), which currently represents \nPlaintiff.  (Defs.’ Mot. Disqualify, pp. 1 –2.)  Defendants allege that from 1999 \nthrough 2002, Mr. Hagan served as corporate and business counsel for CCSEA, \nwhereby Mr. Hagan represented CCSEA on the following matters: \ni. consulted with and advised Dr. Epes to form SEC Acquisitions, Inc.; \n \nii. was the Incorporator of SEC Acquisitions, Inc.; \n \niii. advised and prepared the documents to change the corporate name of SEC \nAcquisitions, Inc. to Southeastern Eye Management, Inc. (“SEM”); \n \niv. consulted with and advised Dr. Epes and Mr. McDaniel with regard to a \nfinancing transaction wherein CCSEA and SEM would enter into a series \nof loan transactions wherein the pr oceeds would be used to pay off \nobligations of HUTA Leasing Company (a general partnership between \nformer Defendant John D. Matthews, M.D., Mr. McDaniel, and Dr. Epes), \nHUTA Leasing, LLC (whose members were Mr. McDaniel and Dr. Epes), \nand SEC Investments, LLC (whose me mbers were Mr. McDaniel and Dr. \nEpes); \n \nv. consulted with and advised Dr. Epes and Mr. McDaniel with regard to \nchanging the name of Southeastern Eye Surgeons, PLLC to Carolina \nRefractive Surgeons, PLLC; \n \nvi. used “Southeastern Eye Center” in his communications to Dr. Epes and \nCCSEA; \n \nvii. encouraged and advised Dr. Epes to fragment his ownership in various \nbusinesses by the use of corporations, partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies; and \n \nviii. never advised Dr. Epes or CCSEA that the creation of numerous \ncompanies for specific business ventures or purposes would pose any \ndanger to CCSEA or Dr. Epes. \n \n \n \n(Defs.’ Mot. Disqualify, pp. 1–2; Dr. Epes Aff. ¶¶ 19–22.) \n{20} Defendants contend that Mr. Hagan advised them between 1999 and 2002 \nto fragment the corporate structure of thei r businesses and that this advice relates \nto Defendants’ defense against Plaintiff’s effort to pierce the corporate veil of both \nCCSEA and SCLC in this action.  Defendants argue that because the issues \nconcerning Mr. Hagan’s prior representation of CCSEA overlap with the issues \nregarding Defendants’ liability in this lawsuit, the Firm should be disqualified from \nrepresenting Plaintiff in this matter und er North Carolina Rule of Professional \nConduct 1.9(a) (“Rule 1.9(a)”).  Defendants also argue that Mr. Hagan will likely be \na necessary witness in their case to ex plain how and why they fragmented the \ncorporate structure of various corporate entities, which further warrants the Firm’s \ndisqualification under North Carolina Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7 (“Rule 3.7”). \n{21} In response, Plaintiff maintains that the claims and issues in this case are \ncentered on Defendants’ actions to hinder, defraud, and delay payment of Plaintiff’s \nJudgment arising out of the 2012 transfer of CCSEA’s assets to the newly formed \nSCLC and that these issues are not the “same or substantially related” to the \nmatters upon which Mr. Hagan formerly represented Defendants.  Moreover, \nPlaintiff argues that Rule 3.7 explicitly allows Beth Langley (“Ms. Langley”), the \nFirm lawyer representing Plaintiff in this action, to represent Plaintiff even if Mr. \nHagan, her law partner in the Firm, is likely to be called by Defendants as a \nwitness at trial. \nIII. \nANALYSIS \nA.  Legal Standard \n{22} “Decisions regarding whether to disqualify counsel are within the \ndiscretion of the trial judge and, absent an  abuse of discretion, a trial judge’s ruling \non a motion to disqualify will not be disturbed on appeal.”   Robinson & Lawing, \nLLP v. Sams , 161 N.C. App. 338, 339, 587 S. E.2d 923, 925 (2003) (quoting Travco \nHotels v. Piedmont Natural Gas Co., 332 N.C. 288, 295, 420 S.E.2d 426, 430 (1992)).  \n“‘[A] motion to disqualify counsel . . . is not a referendum on the trustworthiness of \n \n \nthe counsel sought to be disqualified.  It is, rather, a motion that should succeed or \nfail on the reasonableness of a client’s pe rception that confidences it once shared \nwith its lawyer are potentially available to its adversary.’”  Chemcraft Holdings \nCorp. v. Shayban , 2006 NCBC 13 ¶ 34 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 5, 2006), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2006%20NCBC%2013.htm (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Healthnet, Inc. v. Health Net, Inc., 289 F. Supp. 2d 755, 763 (S.D. \nW. Va. 2003)).   \n{23} Nevertheless, “[t]he drastic nature of disqualification requires that courts \navoid overly-mechanical adherence to disciplinary canons at the expense of \nlitigants’ rights freely to choose their counsel; and that they always remain mindful \nof the opposing possibility of misuse of  disqualification motions for strategic \nreasons.”  Shaffer v. Farm Fresh, Inc. , 966 F.2d 142, 146 (4th Cir. 1992) (citation \nomitted).  Indeed, “[i]n order to avoid the potential for abuse, the Fourth Circuit has \nheld that disqualification for violations of an ethical canon ‘may not be rested on \nmere speculation that a chain of events whose occurrence theoretically could lead \ncounsel to act counter to his client’s interests might in fact occur.’” Blaney v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. , 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103159, at *7 \n(W.D.N.C. Sept. 13, 2011) (quoting Shaffer, 966 F.2d at 145). \nB.  Rule 1.9 \n{24} Rule 1.9(a) provides that “[a] lawyer who has formerly represented a \nclient in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a \nsubstantially related matter in which that person’s interests are materially adverse \nto the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, \nconfirmed in writing.”  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.9(a). \n{25} To prevail on their Motion to Disqualify under Rule 1.9(a) here, \nDefendants must show:  (1) an attorn ey-client relationship existed between \nDefendants and a member of the Firm in  a prior legal matter; (2) the current \nlawsuit concerns the same matter or a su bstantially related matter to the prior \nlegal matter; and (3) Plaintiff’s position is materially adverse to Defendants’ \ninterests in this case.  \nFerguson v. DDP Pharmacy, Inc. , 174 N.C. App. 532, 536, \n \n \n621 S.E.2d 323, 327 (2005).  If De fendants are able to carry this burden, the Firm is \ndisqualified from representing Plaintiff by operation of  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct \n1.10(a).  Id. at 538, 621 S.E.2d at 328 (imputing th e conflict of interest that existed \nbetween a firm’s partner and his former clie nt to the firm); N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct \n1.10(a) (“While lawyers are associated in  a firm, none of them shall knowingly \nrepresent a client when any one of them pr acticing alone would be prohibited from \ndoing so by Rules 1.7 or 1.9 . . . .”). \n{26} There is no dispute that Mr. Haga n and Defendants shared a prior \nattorney-client relationship, 4 Plaintiff’s position is materially adverse to \nDefendants’ interests in this case, and Defendants have not consented to the Firm’s \nrepresentation of Plaintiff.  Accordingly, to succeed on their Motion to Disqualify, \nDefendants must show that the current lawsuit concerns the same matter or a \nsubstantially related matter to the pr ior legal matters in which Mr. Hagan \nrepresented Defendants. \n{27} Matters are “substantially related” fo r purposes of Rule 1.9 “if they \ninvolve the same transaction or legal disput e or if there otherw ise is a substantial \nrisk that information as would normally have been obtained in the prior \nrepresentation would materially advance th e client’s position in the subsequent \nmatter.”  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.9, cmt. 3.  “The substantially related test requires \na virtual congruence of issues, and the rela tionship between the issues in the prior \n[representation] must be patently clear.” \nPlant Genetic Sys., N.V. v. Ciba Seeds, 933 \nF. Supp. 514, 518 (M.D.N.C. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) \n(interpreting North Carolina Rules of Profes sional Conduct).  “In the context of a \nmotion to disqualify, substantially related ‘has been interpreted to mean ‘identical’ \nor ‘essentially the same.’’” Hepburn v. Workplace Benefits, LLC , 2014 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 52628, at *7 (E.D.N.C . Apr. 15, 2014) (quoting Plant Genetic Sys. , 933 F. \nSupp. at 518) (applying North Carolina law) .  “[T]he concern is whether there is a \nreasonable probability that confidences were disclosed in the prior representation \n                                                 \n4 There is no evidence before the Court that any other lawyer in the Firm has represented either \nDefendant at any time. \n \n \nwhich could be used against the former client in the current litigation.”  Plant \nGenetic Sys., 933 F. Supp. at 518 (citing In re Stokes, 156 Bankr. 181, 187 (Bankr. \nE.D. Va. 1993) (applying North Carolina law)).  However, “[i]nformation acquired in \na prior representation may have been rend ered obsolete by the passage of time, a \ncircumstance that may be relevant in determining whether two representations are \nsubstantially related.”  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.9, cmt. 3.   \n{28} Based on its review of the facts pres ented, the Court concludes that the \nmatters upon which Mr. Hagan represen ted Defendants from 1999 until 2002 while \nhe was associated with his prior firm, Adams Kleemeier Hagan Hannah & Fouts \nPLLC (“Adams Kleemeier”), are not “the same or substantially related to” the issues \nin this case.   \n{29} First, the focus of Plaintiff’s Co mplaint is the May 2012 allegedly \nfraudulent transfer between CCSEA and the newly formed SCLC and “Defendants’ \nunfair and deceptive trade practices associated with their scheme to hinder, defraud \nand delay payment of Dr. Harriott’s [September 2012] [J]udgment, and Dr. Epes’ \nand Mr. McDaniel’s breach of fiduciary duty to Dr. Harriott.” (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. \nDisqualify, p. 14.)  Mr. Hagan ceased repr esenting Defendants in 2002, ten (10) \nyears before CCSEA participated in the a llegedly fraudulent transfer that is the \nsubject of Plaintiff’s action.  Defendan ts have not brought forward sufficient \nevidence to show that Mr. Hagan’s advice, given a decade earlier, in a different \ncontext, and for a different purpose, is substantially related to the issues in this \ncase involving Defendants’ allegedly fraudulent efforts to avoid a judgment creditor.  \n{30} Further, records on file with the North Carolina Secretary of State \ndemonstrate that Defendants established numerous related or interconnected \nbusiness entities before Mr. Hagan began representing Defendants in 1999, \nestablishing that Mr. Hagan’s alleged advice to fragment Defendants’ business \nentities was not the basis for their decisions to form at least some (if not all) of their \nmultiple entities.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Disqualify, p. 14, Ex. C.) \n{31} Moreover, Plaintiff has offered evidence demonstrating that matters \nmaterial to Mr. Hagan’s purported 1999 – 2002 advice have substantially changed \n \n \nsince that time.  For example, Plaintiff’s evidence suggests that CCSEA’s debt \nstructure and debt facilities have chan ged, Dr. Epes and Mr. McDaniel have \ntransferred their ownership interest in EMS Partners, LLC to their wives (“Mrs. \nEpes” and “Mrs. McDaniel”), Dr. Epes and Mr. McDaniel have paid themselves and \ntheir wives over $1.4 million dollars from CCSEA’s and SCLC’s bank accounts over \nthe past three years, and HUTA Leasing Company, LLC has been administratively \ndissolved.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Disqualify, pp. 10–11.) \n{32} Finally, Plaintiff’s counsel has offered satisfactory evidence that neither \nshe nor her Firm possesses any information concerning Mr. Hagan’s representation \nof Defendants that could be used to Defe ndants’ disadvantage.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ \nMot. Disqualify, p. 3.)  In particular, Mr. Hagan’s previous firm, Adams Kleemeier, \nno longer exists, and Defendants’ old client files kept at Adams Kleemeier were \n“closed” in 2002 and were not transferred to  the Firm.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. \nDisqualify, p. 3.)  Indeed, Plaintiff’s ev idence shows that the Firm has never had \naccess to Defendants’, or any of Defendants ’ related entities’, client file materials \nand that no attorney at the Firm posse sses confidential material information of \nDefendants. (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Disqualify, p. 3.)  For these reasons, therefore, \nthe Court finds that Rule 1.9(a) does not require the Firm’s disqualification.  \n{33} In addition, Rule 1.9(b) provides that “[a] lawyer shall not knowingly \nrepresent a person in the same or a subs tantially related matter in which a firm \nwith which the lawyer formerly was associ ated had previously represented a client \n(1) whose interests are materially adverse to that person; and (2) about whom the \nlawyer had acquired information protected by  Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is material \nto the matter; unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in \nwriting.”  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.9(b) .  Although Ms. Langley was a member of \nAdams Kleemeier at the time Mr. Hagan re presented Defendants, Rule 1.9(b) does \nnot require the Firm’s disqualification because the Court has concluded that Mr. \nHagan’s prior representation of Defendants is not “the same or substantially related \nto” the issues in this case. \n \n \n \n \nC.  Rule 3.7 \n{34} Defendants also contend that Rule 3.7 requires the Firm’s \ndisqualification in this action.  The Court disagrees. \n{35} North Carolina Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7 provides: \n(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is \nlikely to be a necessary witness unless: \n \n(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue; \n \n(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal \nservices rendered in the case; or \n \n(3) disqualification of the lawy er would work substantial \nhardship on the client. \n \n(b) A lawyer may act as advocate in a trial in which another lawyer in \nthe lawyer’s firm is likely to be called as a witness unless precluded \nfrom doing so by Rule 1.7 or Rule 1.9. \n \n{36} First, there is no evidence that Mr. Hagan has represented, or intends to \nrepresent, Plaintiff against Defendants.  As  a result, Rule 3.7(a) has no application \nto this case.  In addition, our courts ha ve made clear that, except in conflict of \ninterest situations under Rules 1.7 and 1.9, a law firm’s lawyers are not barred \nunder Rule 3.7(b) from representing a client even when one partner in the law firm \nserves as a necessary witness at trial.  Cunningham v. Sams , 161 N.C. App. 295, \n300, 588 S.E.2d 484, 488 (2003);  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 3.7, cmt. 5 (“Because the \ntribunal is not likely to be misled when a la wyer acts as advocate in a trial in which \nanother lawyer in the lawyer’s firm will testify as a necessary witness, paragraph \n(b) permits the lawyer to do so except in situ ations involving a conflict of interest.”).  \nBecause, as Defendants acknowledge, Rules 1.7 and 1.9 do not preclude Ms. \nLangley and the Firm’s other counsel of record from representing Plaintiff in this \naction, Rule 3.7(b) likewise does not require the Firm’s disqualification. \n \n \nD.  Appearance of Impropriety \n{37} Although not raised by Defendants, our courts have observed that an \noverarching consideration on a motion to disqualify is to “prevent even the \nappearance of impropriety and thus resolve any and all doubts in favor of \ndisqualification.” \nChemcraft, 2006 NCBC 13 ¶ 34 (quotation omitted). The Court’s \n“primary concern in preventing the appearance of impropriety is the client’s \nperception of events,” Kingsdown, Inc. v. Hinshaw, 2015 NCBC 27 ¶ 49 (N.C. Super. \nCt. March 25, 2015), http://www.ncbusine sscourt.net/opinions/2015_NCBC_27.pdf \n(citation omitted), and Defendants’ motion to disqualify “should succeed or fail on \nthe reasonableness of [their] perception that confidences [they] once shared with \n[their] lawyer are potentially available to [their] adversary,” \nChemcraft, 2006 \nNCBC 13 ¶ 34.  \n{38} Applying these principles here, it a ppears clear that Mr. Hagan provided \nonly general corporate representation to Defendants in this case during a limited \nthree-year period between 1999 and 2002.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Disqualify, p. 10.)  \nIt is equally clear that Mr. Hagan’s repr esentation ended approximately ten years \nbefore SCLC was formed and the allegedly fraudulent transfer of CCSEA’s assets to \nSCLC occurred – and it is this 2012 conduct that Plaintiff complains about in this \nlitigation.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Disqualify, p. 10.)  Given the nature and scope of \nMr. Hagan’s general corporate advice to Defendants, which mostly consisted of \ncounseling on the formation of business entities and the structuring of various \nunrelated loan transactions as described in Dr. Epes’ own affidavit, and the fact \nthat Plaintiff’s claims are founded upon an allegedly fraudulent transfer to avoid a \njudgment that arose a decade after Mr. Hagan’s representation of Defendants \nended, the Court cannot conclude that Defendants have a reasonable perception \nthat “confidences [they] once shared with [their] lawyer are potentially available to \n[their] adversary.” \nChemcraft, 2006 NCBC 13 ¶ 34.  As a result, the Court does not \nfind that an appearance of impropriety exists that precludes the Firm from \nrepresenting Plaintiff against Defendants in this action. \n \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{39} Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that \ndisqualification of the Firm from representing Plaintiff against Defendants in this \nlitigation is neither appropriate nor required.  \n{40} WHEREFORE, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants’ Motion to \nDisqualify. \nSO ORDERED, this the 28th day of April, 2015. \n \n  "
