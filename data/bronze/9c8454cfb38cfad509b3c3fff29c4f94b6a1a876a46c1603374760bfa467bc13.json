Vreeland; Anderson Kill & Olick,\nP.C., by Eugene R. Anderson and \nEdward Stein, for plaintiff.\nAdams Kleemeier Hagan Hannah & Fouts, by James W. \nBryan and Daniel W. Fouts; Drinker\nBiddle & Reath, LLP, by Alan J. \nJoaquin, for defendant.\nI.\n{2}\n                         \nTo date, this relatively straightforward breach of contract case has been more about\nprocedural maneuvers than resolution of the substantive issues.\n  \nPolo claims to have suffered a $5 million\nloss due to employee theft of merchandise; theft, it claims, is covered by a blanket crime insurance policy\nissued by Gulf.\n  \nThat policy provides coverage for loss of money, securities or other property incurred as a\nresult of an employee’s dishonest or fraudulent acts.\n  \nGulf does not deny coverage but disputes the amount\nof the loss.\n  \nAt issue is (1) the nature and amount of the merchandise stolen, and (2) the method of valuing\nthat merchandise for purposes of the insurance policy.\n  \nPolo’s original complaint alleged that the policy\nprovides that the merchandise be valued at retail selling price.\n  \nGulf contends that the policy provides that\nthe merchandise be valued at replacement value.\n  \nThe pertinent clause is found in Section 9 of the policy\nand reads:\nIn case of damage to the [p]remises or loss of property \nother than Securities, [Gulf] shall not\nbe liable for more than the actual \ncash value of such property, or for more than the actual cost\nof repairing \nsuch [p]remises or property or of replacing same with property or material of \nlike\nquality and value.\n  \n[Gulf] \nmay, at its election, pay such actual cash value, or make such\nrepairs or \nreplacements.\n  \nIf [Gulf] and \n[Polo] cannot agree upon such cash value or such cost\nof repairs or \nreplacements, such cash value or such cost shall be determined by arbitration.\n{3}\n                         \nPolo seeks to amend the complaint to add a second cause of action for reformation of the\nabove clause based upon mutual mistake.\n  \nPolo contends that if the actual clause provides for replacement\nvalue it does not reflect the actual agreement of the parties and that therefore there has been a mutual\nmistake. Polo requests that the Court enter an order “reforming the Insurance Policy to include a selling\nprice valuation clause for finished goods as per the expiring Affiliated FM policy.”\n  \n(Pl.’s Mot. Amend\nCompl. at 22).\n  \nThe Affiliated FM policy refers to a policy Polo had with another company prior to the\neffective date of the Gulf policy.\n  \nPolo contends that this reformation, by expunging the current\nreplacement value clause, will eliminate the only reference to arbitration in the entire insurance policy.\nII.\n{4}\n                         \nThis is not the first procedural detour the parties have taken in this case.\n  \nGulf commenced a\ndeclaratory judgment action in New York State on March 10, 2000, by filing a summons with notice.\n  \nOn\nMarch 23, 2000, Polo filed this action in North Carolina and obtained service of process upon Gulf on\nMarch 24, 2000.\n  \nOn April 13, 2000, Gulf filed its complaint in the New York action and obtained service\nof process upon Polo on April 14, 2000.\n  \nThereafter, on June 1, 2000, Judge William H. Freeman\ndetermined that the North Carolina action was the prior pending action and enjoined Gulf from pursuing\nthe New York action.\n  \nIn the complaint filed by Gulf in New York, Gulf did not seek arbitration.\n  \nGulf\nfiled its answer and counterclaim in North Carolina on June 1, 2000, in which it asserted a twelfth\naffirmative defense demanding that the dispute be resolved by arbitration.\n  \nThe parties then consented to\nhave this case transferred to the North Carolina Business Court.\n{5}\n                         \nPolo claims it was prejudiced by Gulf “serving and requiring a response to pleadings,\nincluding counter claims . . . .\n  \nGulf has served extensive interrogatories and document requests, in\nresponse to which to Polo has drafted responses and undertaken document reviews to respond to these\ndemands.”\n  \n(Pl.’s Br. Opp’n\n  \nMot. Compel Arbitration at 12).\n{6}\n                         \nGulf’s motion to compel arbitration was filed on November 14, 2000.\n  \nThereafter, Polo filed\nits motion to amend the complaint on December 7, 2000.\n  \nBoth sides have served written discovery, but no\nresponses have been filed pending resolution of the current motions.\nIII.\n{7}\n                         \nPracticality requires that the Court turn first to the motion to amend even though it was filed\nafter the motion to compel arbitration.\n  \nUnder Rule 15(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure,\nafter a responsive pleading has been filed, a party may amend its prior pleading by leave of court, “and\nleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.”\n  \nIt is well settled that motions to amend the\npleadings should be granted unless there is a compelling reason not to do so.\n  \nSee Mauney v. Morris \n316\nN.C. 67, 340 S.E.2d 397 (1986).\n   \nThere are five potential reasons to deny such a motion: “(a) undue\ndelay, (b) bad faith, (c) undue prejudice, (4) futility of amendment, and (5) repeated failure to cure defects\nby previous amendments.”\n  \nWalker v. Sloan,\n 137 N.C. App. 387, 402, 529 S.E.2d 236, 247 (2000).\n  \nIn this\ninstance, Gulf cites two of these grounds for denying the motion.\n \n{8}\n                         \nGulf first asserts that the motion to amend should not be considered because it was filed after\nthe motion to compel arbitration, which should be considered a dispositive motion.\n  \nThus, the motion\nshould be denied because of undue delay.\n  \nAfter oral argument on the motions, counsel for Gulf, with\ncommendable candor, brought to the Court’s attention the case of \nSmith v. Young Moving and Storage,\nNo. 98 Civ. 01214 (N.C. App. filed Dec. 29 2000), a slip opinion yet to be published.\n  \nIn the \nSmith\n case,\nthe majority held that a motion to compel arbitration was not a dispositive motion.\n  \nId.\n at 5.\n   \nThe trial\njudge denied a motion to compel arbitration because it was filed after the deadline set by the court for\nfiling dispositive motions.\n  \nId.\n at 2-4.\n  \nThe trial court ruled that the motion to compel was a dispositive\nmotion as contemplated by the scheduling order and as such was filed too late.\n  \nId.\n  \nThe Court of Appeals\nreversed, holding that the motion to compel did not dispose of the whole case and was therefore not a\ndispositive motion that had to be filed before the scheduling order deadline.\n  \nId. \nat 5.\n[FN1]\n  \nUnder the\nholding in \nSmith\n, Gulf’s motion to compel is not a dispositive motion, and hence the failure to plead the\nclaim for reformation until after the motion to compel was filed is inconsequential.\n  \nThe \nSmith \ncourt held\nthat the plaintiff had failed to show prejudice by the delay in filing the motion to compel arbitration.\n  \nId. \nat\n6.\n   \nThere was no record of expense incurred by the plaintiff, and the alleged prejudice consisted of “the\ninconveniences and expenses consistent with normal trial preparation.”\n  \nId\n.\n \n{9}\n                         \nGulf next argues that the motion to amend should be denied because it is futile.\n  \nIn support of\nthat argument, Gulf submitted the affidavit of the broker for Polo at the time the policy was issued, who\nswore under oath that Gulf never agreed to issue a policy based upon selling price but always insisted\nupon replacement value.\n  \nGiven this evidence, Gulf contends that Polo will never be able to establish\nmutual mistake to support reformation of the contract.\n  \nIn fact, the allegations supporting the reformation\nclaim are conclusory in nature, and the rebuttal affidavits submitted by Polo thus far fall short of\nestablishing mutual mistake.\n  \nIn addition, Polo may have a statute of limitations\n[FN2]\n problem in asserting\nits reformation claim, and there may be other defenses asserted in the amended answer.\n  \nHowever, those\nissues are best left to summary judgment, not a motion to amend.\n{10}\n                     \nAccordingly, the Court will grant the motion to amend.\n  \nIn doing so, it is not the intent of the\nCourt to let the amendment dictate the arbitration issue.\n  \nPolo may not defeat Gulf’s right to arbitration\nsimply by filing the motion to amend.\n  \nIn order to preserve the position of the parties, the Court will set a\nsixty-day discovery period on the reformation issue and the issue of the meaning of the language in\nSection 9 of the policy.\n  \nEither during or at the end of that period, either party may file a motion for\nsummary judgment on the reformation or contract interpretation issues.\n  \nIf Polo fails to establish the right\nto proceed with the reformation claim, the Court will enter an order compelling arbitration on the basis set\nforth below.\nIV.\n{11}\n                     \nThe \nSmith\n case was instructive on other issues.\n  \nSignificantly, the court held:\nIn our review, we are mindful that North Carolina has a \nstrong public policy favoring\nresolution of disputes through arbitration.\n  \nSee Johnston County v. R.N. Rouse & Co.,\n 331\nN.C. 88, 414 \nS.E.2d 30 (1992).\n  \n“Any doubt \nconcerning the scope of arbitrable issues should\nbe resolved in favor of \narbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the\ncontract \nlanguage itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to \narbitrability.”\n \nCyclone \nRoofing Co. v. LaFave Co.,\n 312 N.C. 224, 229, 321 S.E.2d 872, 876 (1984).\nId. \nat 2-3.\n{12}\n                     \nPolo first asserts that the arbitration clause is unenforceably vague.\n  \nWhile the arbitration\nclause does not provide any details on the arbitrator or procedures for arbitration, these omissions are\ninsufficient to strike the arbitration clause.\n  \nThe Uniform Arbitration Act in sections 1-567.4 through 1-\n567.10 identifies procedures under which arbitration may occur.\n  \nFor example, section 1-567.4 provides:\nIf the arbitration agreement provides a method of \nappointment of arbitrators, this method shall\nbe followed. In the absence \nthereof, or if the agreed method fails or for any reason cannot be\nfollowed, \nor when an arbitrator appointed fails or is unable to act and his successor \nhas not\nbeen duly appointed, the court on application of a party shall appoint \none or more arbitrators.\nThis express provision requiring the court, at the request of either party, to name an arbitrator when the\nparties’ agreement has not named one contemplates an arbitration clause that does not specify an\narbitrator.\n  \nOther sections provide the arbitrator guidelines for the arbitration process.\n  \n§§ 1-546.4-.10.\n \nAccordingly, a clause failing to name an arbitrator or procedures for arbitration is not unenforceably\nvague.\n \n{13}\n                     \nPolo also argues that Gulf has, through delay, waived any right to arbitrate. At this point in the\nlitigation the parties have submitted their pleadings and propounded some discovery upon one another.\n  \nAs\na general rule “the mere filing of a complaint or answer does not result in waiver of arbitration absent\nevidence showing prejudice to the adverse party.”\n  \nServomation Corp. v. Hickory Constr. Co., \n316 N.C.\n543, 544, 342 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1986).\n \nA party may be prejudiced by his adversary’s delay in \nseeking arbitration if (1) it is forced to\nbear the expense of a long trial, \n(2) it loses helpful  evidence, (3) it takes steps in litigation to\nits \ndetriment or expends significant amounts of money on the litigation, or (4) \nits opponent\nmakes use of judicial discovery procedures not available in \narbitration.\nId\n.\n  \nIn \nSmith\n, the plaintiff claimed that evidence of expenses it incurred in answering defendant’s\ninterrogatories was sufficient to find that defendant waived its right to arbitration.\n  \nSmith v.\n \nYoung Moving\nand Storage, \nNo. 98 Civ. 01214, slip op. at 6 (N.C. App. filed Dec. 29 2000).\n  \nThe \nSmith \ncourt held:\nThe prejudice described by plaintiff in the case at bar \nconsists, for the most part, of\ninconveniences and expenses consistent with \nnormal trial preparation . . . .\nIn any event, we are of the opinion that evidence of \nexpenses related to defendant’s\ninterrogatories would have been irrelevant \nsince plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the\njudicial discovery \nprocedures used by defendant, or their equivalent, would be unavailable in\narbitration.\n  \nThus plaintiff might \nwell have incurred the same expense during arbitration.\nId.\n, quoting \nServomation Corp. v. Hickory Constr. Co., \n316 N.C. 543, 544, 342 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1986).\n \n{14}\n                     \nAs in \nSmith\n, Polo’s expenses are expenses consistent with normal trial preparation and\ntherefore insufficient to find that Gulf waived its right to arbitration.\n  \nFurther, given the lack of details in\nthe arbitration agreement, section 1-567.8 could apply.\n  \nSection 1-567.8 states:\nWitnesses; subpoenas; depositions.\n     \n(a) The arbitrators may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses \nand for the\nproduction of books, records, documents and other evidence, and \nshall have the power to\nadminister oaths. Subpoenas so issued shall be served, \nand upon application to the court by a\nparty or the arbitrators, enforced, in \nthe manner provided by law for the service and\nenforcement of subpoenas in a \ncivil action.\n     \n(b) On application of a party and for use as evidence, the arbitrators \nmay permit a\ndeposition to be taken, in the manner and upon the terms \ndesignated by the arbitrators, of a\nwitness who cannot be subpoenaed or is \nunable to attend the hearing.\nSimilar to \nSmith,\n the discovery expenses of which Polo complains are equivalent to those that may be\nincurred during arbitration.\n  \n{15}\n                     \nPolo also complains that it has been prejudiced “through the expense and delay of combating\nboth the New York action and Gulf’s use of the litigation process here in North Carolina.”\n  \n(Pl.’s Br.\nOpp’n Def.’s Mot. Compel Arbitration at 9).\n  \nIn \nSmith\n the discovery period was closed and the arbitration\nargument was not introduced until after dispositive motions were due, and yet the court found no undue\ndelay.\n  \nSmith v.\n \nYoung Moving and Storage, \nNo. 98 Civ. 01214, slip op. at 6 (N.C. App. filed Dec. 29\n2000).\n  \nUnlike \nSmith,\n where the discovery period was closed before the motion for arbitration was filed,\nGulf filed its motion well in advance of trial.\n  \nFurther, it is commonplace for plaintiffs and defendants to\ndisagree on the appropriate forum in which to adjudicate a case, and moving a case to a different\njurisdiction is a frequent pretrial maneuver.\n  \nHence, this Court finds that arguing over where the case is\nadjudicated is insufficient grounds for which to find waiver.\n{16}\n                     \nPolo argues that even if the arbitration clause applied to the contract, it only applies insofar as\nit applies to the method used to determine price per unit of merchandise sold.\n  \nAs stated above, the parties\ndispute both the amount of the merchandise stolen and the method of valuing that merchandise for\npurposes of the insurance policy. \n \nThe clause in question states, “If [Gulf] and [Polo] cannot agree upon\nsuch cash value or such cost of repairs or replacements, such cash value or such cost shall be determined\nby arbitration.”\n  \nPolo claims that this language conveys that the volume of the merchandise allegedly\nstolen is not subject to the arbitration clause.\n  \nAccording to Polo’s theory, the clause only applies to the\ncash value per unit of merchandise, and the volume of missing merchandise is a separate, non-arbitrable\nissue.\n  \nGiven North Carolina’s strong public policy in support of arbitration, this Court refuses to apply\nsuch a restrictive reading of the clause. “There is a strong public policy favoring the settlement of disputes\nby arbitration, and doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues will be resolved in favor of the party\nseeking\n \narbitration.”\n  \nServomation Corp. v. Hickory Constr. Co., \n316 N.C. 543, 544, 342 S.E.2d 853, 854\n(1986).\n  \nThe Court believes that the nature and volume of the merchandise are essential components in\ndetermining the cash value or replacement cost of the merchandise and therefore within the scope of the\narbitration clause.\n{17}\n                     \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court finds that Polo has failed to overcome North Carolina’s\nstrong policy favoring arbitration, and, therefore, it is hereby ordered, adjudged and decreed:\n1.\n      \nPolo’s motion to amend is granted followed by a sixty-day discovery \nperiod, dispositive\nmotions and trial on the reformation issue;\n2.\n      \nIf Polo does not prevail on the reformation issue, the Court will grant \nGulf’s motion to\ncompel arbitration, motion to stay proceedings, and motion \nfor preliminary injunction.\n \n \nThis is the 31st day of January 2001.\n \n                                                \n                        \n         \n                                                \n                        \n            \n    \nBen F. Tennille\n                                                \n                        \n            \n    \nSpecial Superior Court Judge\n                                                \n                        \n            \n      \nfor Complex Business Cases\n \n[FN1]\n \nThe dissent held that a motion to compel arbitration is a dispositive \nmotion.\n  \nYoung Moving and\nStorage, \nNo. 98 Civ. 01214, slip op. at 8-10\n  \n(N.C. App.\n  \nfiled Dec. 29 \n2000).\n[FN2]\n \nThere is a three year statute of limitations on a reformation claim, which \n“begins to run from the\ntime the mistake has been discovered or should \nhave been discovered in the exercise of due diligence.”\n \nHuss v.
