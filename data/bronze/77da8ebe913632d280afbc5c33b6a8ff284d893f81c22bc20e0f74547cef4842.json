Rather, the Court recites the allegations asserted and the documents \nreferenced in the challenged pleading that are relevant to the Court’s determination \nof the Motion. \n4. JBC is a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in Grapevine, \nTexas.2  URS is a c orporation registered with the North Carolina Secretary of State \nand authorized to do business in North Carolina.3   \n5. On 5 May 2014, Defendant City of Charlotte (the “City”)  and URS entered \ninto a written contract  for Engineering/Design Services and Other Project Services \n(the “Design Contract”) for the CityLYNX Gold Line – Phase 2 Project in Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina (the “Project”).4  The Project contemplated a 2.5 mile extension of the \nCityLYNX Gold Line streetcar system, and, on 21 December 2016, JBC, as general \ncontractor, and the City, as owner, entered into a contract for the construction of the \nProject (the “Construction Contract”).   \n6. Pursuant to the Design Contract, URS develop ed design plans for , among \nother things, “light rail track alignment geometry, track plans and profiles, structural \nplans for the Hawthorne Lane Bridge crossover, new and SSP stop layouts, stop \ndetails, cross sections, and storm drainage .”5  The drawings and specifications that \nURS created in accordance with the Design Contract were ultimately incorporated \ninto and included in the Construction Contract (the “Design Documents”).6 \n \n2 (Pl.’s Reply and Affirmative Defenses Def.’s Countercl. and Pl.’s Third-Party Compl. Against \nURS Corporation ¶ 1 [hereinafter, “Third-Party Compl.”], ECF No. 7.)  The Court’s citations \nto this document reference the section titled “Third -Party Complaint A gainst URS \nCorporation” beginning on page ten. \n \n3 (Third-Party Compl. ¶ 3.) \n \n4 (Third-Party Compl. ¶¶ 6–7.) \n \n5 (Third-Party Compl. ¶¶ 7–8.) \n \n6 (Third-Party Compl. ¶ 8.) \n \n7. JBC alleges that the Design Documents  were “inaccurate, deficient, and \ninadequate” as to storm drainage 7 and included numerous errors, omissions,  and \ndiscrepancies in regard to the Hawthorne Lane Bridge .8  JBC further alleges that \n“URS’s negligence and failure to use reasonable care in undertaking the scope of the \nDesign Contract, including, but not limited to, design issues, errors, and omissions, \ndirectly led to” the damages the City asserts that JBC is responsible for in the City’s \ncounterclaims.9 \nII. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n8. JBC filed the Complaint initiating this litigation on 12 April 2023, asserting \nten claims against the City .10  The City answered  JBC’s Complaint on 1 June 2023  \nand asserted counterclaims against JBC for breach of contract and breach of \nwarranty.11  In response to the City’s counterclaims, JBC filed a T hird-Party \nComplaint against URS on 31 July 2023, asserting claims for: (i) indemnity / \ncontribution, (ii) negligence, and (iii) professional negligence/malpractice.12   \n \n7 (Third-Party Compl. ¶ 10.) \n \n8 (Third-Party Compl. ¶ 11.) \n \n9 (Third-Party Compl. ¶ 12.) \n \n10 (First Am. Verified Compl.) \n \n11 (Def. City Charlotte’s Mots. Dismiss, Answer First Am. Verified Compl. & Countercl., ECF \nNo. 3.) \n \n12 (Third-Party Compl. ¶¶ 13–25.) \n \n9. On 23 October 2023, URS filed the pending Motion, seeking the dismissal of \nJBC’s third-party claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).13  \n10. After full briefing, the Court convened a hearing on the Motion on 14 \nDecember 2023, at which all parties were re presented by counsel (the “Hearing”).  \nThe Motion is now ripe for resolution.  \nIII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n11. When deciding whether to dismiss  a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the \nCourt considers “whether the allegations of the complaint , if treated as true, are \nsufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under some legal theory.”  \nCorwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco , PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoti ng CommScope \nCredit Union v. Butler & Burke, LLP, 369 N.C. 48, 51 (2016)). \n12. “[D]ismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when ‘(1) the complaint on \nits face reveals that no law supports the [claimant’s]  claim; (2) the complaint on its \nface reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint \ndiscloses some fact that necessarily defeats the [claimant’s]  claim.’ ”  Corwin , 371 \nN.C.  at 615 (quoting Wood v. Guilford County, 355 N.C. 161, 166 (2002)). \n13. Under Rule 12(b)(6), “the trial court is to construe the pleading liberally and \nin the light most favorable to the [claimant] , taking as true and admitted all well -\npleaded factual allegations contained within the [pleading] .”  Donovan v. Fiumara, \n114 N.C. App. 524, 526 (1994) (cleaned up).   \n \n13 (URS Corporation’s Mot. Dismiss.) \nIV. \nANALYSIS  \nA. Economic Loss Rule \n14. URS seeks dismissal of all of JBC’s third-party claims on grounds that they \nare barred by the economic loss rule.14   \n15. “Originating in the products liability context, the economic loss rule, in its \nsimplest form, holds that purely economic losses are not ordinarily recoverable under \ntort law.”  Crescent Univ. City  Venture, LLC v. AP Atl., Inc. , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 49, \nat *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 14, 2019) (citation omitted) , aff’d, 376 N.C. 54 (2020)  \n(hereinafter, “Crescent II”).  Our Supreme Court embraced the principles underlying \nthe economic loss rule in North Carolina State Ports Auth . v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing \nCo., 294 N.C. 73 (1978), explaining that “ordinarily, a breach of contract does not give \nrise to a tort action by the promisee against the promisor,”15 id. at 81, and the Court \n \n14 (URS Corporation’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss [hereinafter, “URS’ s Br. Supp.”], ECF No. \n78.) \n \n15 In Ports Authority, the Supreme Court not ed that, while it h ad never held that “a tort \naction lies against a promisor for his simple failure to perform his contract, even though such \nfailure was due to negligence or lack of skill,” 294 N.C. at 83, the re are four, non-exclusive \nsituations in which the North Carolina courts have recognized that “a promisor [may be held] \nliable in a tort action for a personal injury or damage to property proximately caused by his \nnegligent, or wilful, act or omission in the course of his performance of his contract ,” id. at \n82.  Ports Authority’s four exceptions are as follows:  \n \n(1) The injury, proximately caused by the promisor’s negligent act or omission \nin the performance of his contract, was an injury to the person or property of \nsomeone other than the promisee. \n \n(2) The injury, proximately caused by the promisor’s negligent, or wilful, act or \nomission in the performance of hi s contract, was to property of the promisee \nother than the property which was the subject of the contract, or was a personal \ninjury to the promisee. \nof Appeals formally adopted the rule in Chicopee, Inc. v. Sims Metal Works, Inc. , 98 \nN.C. App. 423, 432 (1990) (“The majority of courts which have considered this \nquestion have held that purely economic losses are not ordinarily recoverable under \ntort law.  We adopt this rule[.]” (internal citation omitted)).   \n16. The rule’s rationale posits that while “[t]he average plaintiff in a tort \nlawsuit does not choose his or her tortfeasors[, c]ontracting parties, by comparison, \nhave the ability to allocate risk among themselves at the outset of a transaction and \nare encouraged to do so.”  Crescent  Univ. City Venture, LLC v. AP Atl., Inc., 2019 \nNCBC LEXIS 46, at *76 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 8, 2019) (hereinafter, “Crescent I”) \n(citing Lord v. Customized Consulting Specialty, Inc., 182 N.C. App. 635, 639 (2007)).  \nThe result is that “[t]he tort claim ‘must be grounded on a violation of a duty imposed \nby operation of law, and the right invaded must be one that the law provides without \nregard to the contractual relationship of the parties.’ ”  Window Gang Ventures, Corp. \nv. Salinas, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 2, 2019) (quoting \nRountree v. Chowan County., 252 N.C. App. 155, 160 (2017)).   \n \n \n(3) The injury, proximately caused by the promisor’s negligent, or wilful, act or \nomission in the performa nce of his contract, was loss of or damage to the \npromisee’s property, which was the subject of the contract, the promisor being \ncharged by law, as a matter of public policy, with the duty to use care in the \nsafeguarding of the property from harm, as in the case of a common carrier, an \ninnkeeper or other bailee. \n \n(4) The injury so caused was a wilful injury to or a conversion of the property \nof the promisee, which was the subject of the contract, by the promisor. \n \nId. (cleaned up).  \n \n17. In short, to avoid the reach of the economic loss rule, “a plaintiff must \nallege a duty owed to him by the defendant [that is] separate and distinct from any \nduty owed under a contract.”  Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc. v. Rogers, 2011 NCBC LEXIS \n42, at *48 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 3, 2011).  As this Court has previously observed, in \ndetermining whether the economic loss rule bars  a negligence claim, “the true \nquestion the Court must answer is whether [the defendant owed the plaintiff] a duty \nof care to avoid causing [the plaintiff] purely economic loss.”  Crescent II, 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 49, at *42. \n18. URS contends that the economic loss rule bars JBC’s third -party claims \nbecause “[t]he tort theories now advanced by JBC and the damages it seeks vis-à-vis \nits third-party claims against URS are precisely the type of ‘pure economic losses’ \nbarred by Ports Authority  and the [economic loss rule,]” 16 and none of Ports \nAuthority’s exceptions apply .17  URS further contends that the Court should not \nrecognize a new public policy exception to the economic loss rule to permit JBC to \nassert its negligence claims here.18   \n19. JBC argues in opposition that the Court need not recognize a new exception \nto the economic loss rule to deny the Motion because “clear, settled, and binding North \nCarolina precedent” provides that a general contractor, like JBC,  “in the absence of \nprivity of contract, [may] sue design professionals[, like URS,] based on the \n \n16 (URS’s Br. Supp. 14–16.) \n \n17 (URS’s Br. Supp. 16–19.) \n \n18 (URS’s Br. Supp. 19–26.) \n \nprofessionals’ breach of a common law duty of care.” 19  After careful consideration, \nthe Court agrees with JBC. \n20. As this Court recognized in Crescent  II, our C ourt of Appeals, through its \ndecisions in Davidson & Jones, Inc. v. New Hanover C ounty, 41 N.C. App. 661, 666–\n68 (1979) , and Shoffner Indus., Inc. v. W. B. Lloyd Constr . Co., 42 N.C. App. 259 \n(1979), has “recognized a duty of care imposed upon architects f or the benefit of \nconstruction contractors in the absence of contractual privity because of the parties ’ \nworking relationship[.]”  Crescent II, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 49, at *39 (cleaned up).   \n21. More specifically, the Court of Appeals held in Davidson & Jones as follows: \n[a]n architect, in the performance of his contract with his employer, is \nrequired to exercise the ability, skill, and care customarily used by \narchitects upon such projects.  Where breach of such contract results in \nforeseeable injury, economic or otherwise, to persons so situated by their \neconomic relations, and community of interests as to impose a duty of \ndue care, we know of no reason why an architect cannot be held liable \nfor such injury.  Liability arises from the negligent breach of a common \nlaw duty of care flowing from the parties ’ working relationship.  \nAccordingly, we hold that an architect in the absence of privity of \ncontract may be sued by a general contractor or the subcontractors \nworking on a construction project for economic loss foreseeably resulting \nfrom breach of an architect ’s common law duty of due care in the \nperformance of his contract with the owner.   \n \nId. at 667.  \n \n19 (Third-Party Pl. Johnson Bros. Corporation, a Southland Company’s Br. Opp’n Third-Party \nDef. URS Corporation’s Mot. Dismiss 3–5 [hereinafter, “JBC’s Br. Opp’n”], ECF No. 83.)  JBC \nalso contends that the economic loss rule does not apply because it is not in privity with URS.  \n(JBC’s Br. Opp’n 5–7.)  Our Supreme Court held in Crescent University City Venture, LLC v. \nTrussway Manufacturing, Inc. , however, that “[t]he  lack of privity in the commercial \ncontext . . . is immaterial to the application of the economic loss rule.”  376 N.C. 54, 60 (2020).  \nAs such, JBC’s contention falls flat in the commercial context pleaded here.  \n22. The Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in Shoffner Industries, in \nwhich it held that “a contractor hired by the client to construct a building, although \nnot in [contractual] privity with the architect, may recover from the architect any \nextra costs resulting from the architect’s negligence.”  42 N.C. App. at 265–66.  The \nCourt of Appeals most recently explained its rationale for this legal rule i n Wright \nConstruction Services, Inc. v. Hard Art Studio, PLLC as follows: \nFirst, there is nothing peculiar about these duties —when this Court \nfirst recognized them, we described them as ordinary legal duties arising \nout of the need for architects and engineers to use due care in the \nexercise of their skills and abilities to avoid foreseeable harm to others.  \nSecond, these negligence claims are entirely separate from any rights or \nresponsibilities that exist between [a] property owner and [a] builder \nunder [a] construction contract.  \n \n275 N.C. App. 972, 975–76 (2020) (cleaned up).   \n23. Numerous North Carolina state and federal decisions have followed \nDavidson & Jones  to permit negligence claims against design professionals in the \nabsence of privity of contract.  See, e.g., Pompano Masonry Corp. v. HDR Architecture, \nInc., 165 N.C. App. 40 1, 406–09 (2004) (applying Davidson & Jones to permit \ncontractor to pursue negligence claim against project expediter with whom it was not \nin privity of contract); Kaleel Builders, Inc. v. Ashby , 161 N.C. App. 34, 46 (2003) \n(recognizing that there is a “discrete common law tort between a general con tractor \nand an architect specifically applicable when there is no contractual relationship \nbetween the two[ ]”); Browning v. Maurice B. Levien & Co., 44 N.C. App. 701, 704–05 \n(1980) (concluding from Davidson & Jones and Shoffner Industries that “it is the law \nthat an architect who contracts to perform services is liable for damages proximately \ncaused by his negligence to anyone who can be reasonably foreseen as relying on that \narchitect’s performing his services in a reasonable manner [ ]”); see also, e.g. , \nWalbridge Aldinger, LLC v. Cape Fear Eng’g , Inc., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17111, at \n*20 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 31, 2022) (concluding that a third-party plaintiff contractor had \nstated a claim for negligence against a third -party defendant engineer since it \n“alleged a breach of a duty other than any contractual duties binding upon [the] third-\nparty defendant [ ]”); Ellis-Don Constr., Inc. v. HKS, Inc., 353 F. Supp. 2 d 603 \n(M.D.N.C. Dec. 29, 2004) ( relying on Davidson & Jones to permit a contractor’s \nnegligence claim against an architect in the absence of contract privity). \n24. Here, JBC alleges that URS agreed under its Design Contract with the City \nto create the Design Documents,20 that URS owed a common law duty to the City and \nto foreseeab le beneficiaries of the Design Contract to exercise reasonable care in \ncreating the Design Documents and performing its work under the Design Contract,21 \nand that URS breached this common law duty by failing to prepare and provide the \nDesign Documents in accordance with the required standard of care.\n22  Considering \nthese allegations in the light most favorable to JBC, the Court concludes that JBC \nhas alleged facts showing that URS owed a common law duty of reasonable care to \nJBC arising from both URS’s role as a design professional under its Design Contract \nwith the City and JBC and URS’s working relationship and community of interests \n \n20 (Third-Party Compl. ¶ 7.) \n \n21 (Third-Party Compl. ¶¶ 17, 22.) \n \n22 (Third-Party Compl. ¶¶ 18, 22, 23.) \n \nas participants in the Project.  Since JBC has alleged that it was not in privity of \ncontract with URS and that , under N orth Carolina law,  URS owed JBC a common \nlaw duty of reasonable care under Davidson & Jones and its progeny , the Court \nconcludes that JBC’s allegations are sufficient to state its claims against URS and \nrequire the Court to deny URS’s motion on this ground.   \n25. URS attempts to distinguish Davidson & Jones , arguing that the damages \nat issue in Davidson & Jones  resulted from property damage , not purely economic \nloss, and thus that Davidson & Jones  fits neatly within the second exception \nenumerated in Ports Authority, whereas JBC’s negligence claim, which asserts purely \neconomic losses, does not. 23  The Court finds this argument unpersuasive  for two \nreasons.   \n26. First, the plain language of the holding in Davidson & Jones  specifically \nprovides for the recovery of economic loss for a breach of an architect’s common law \nduty of due care.  See Davidson & Jones, 41 N.C. App. at 667 (“[W]e hold that an \narchitect in the absence of privity of contract may be sued by a general contractor or  \nthe subcontractors working on a construction project for economic loss foreseeably \nresulting from breach of an architect ’s common law duty of due care in the \nperformance of his contract with the owner.” (emphasis added)).   \n27. Second, the Court of Appeals ha s applied Davidson & Jones when the tort \nclaim at issue , like the negligence claim here,  sought recovery for  only economic \nlosses.  For example, in Pompano Masonry Corp., the defendant was hired to oversee \n \n23 (URS’s Br. Supp. 25.) \nproject design work related to the construction of a building , and the plaintiff was \nhired as a subcontractor to perform masonry work on that  building.  165 N.C. App. \nat 403–04.  The plaintiff asserted a tort claim against the defendant, alleging that \nthe defendant “failed to properly schedule and coordinate the work on the project, and \nthat as a result, plaintiff was forced to perform out -of-sequence work and incurred \nsignificant disruptions to its work, substantially impairing plaintiff's ability to \nefficiently perform its work thereby increasing plaintiff's costs to perform its work.”  \nId. at 404 (cleaned up).  The defendant sought dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim , in \npart based on the economic loss rule.  Id. at 405.   \n28. The Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant could be “held liable for \nthe foreseeable economic injury resulting from its alleged negligent performance of \nits duties as project expediter[,]”  reasoning that “ Davidson [& Jones] authorize[d] \nplaintiff to sue defendant for the economic l oss resulting from defendant’s alleged \nbreach of its common law duty of care[,]” which arose from the “working relationship \nand community of interests” between the defendant and the plaintiff.  Id.  at 408 \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added).   \n29. URS seeks to distinguish Pompano on grounds that the court partially relied \nupon the absence of a contractual remedy for the plaintiff, while here the existence of \nJBC’s contract rights against the City should “compel this Court to defer to those \ncontractual terms as the sole means to resolve the instant disputes.”\n24  The court in \nPompano, however, did not base its ruling on the availability of a contractual or \n \n24 (URS Corporation’s Reply Supp. Mot. Dismiss 8, ECF No. 85.) \nstatutory remedy for the plaintiff.  Rather, the court concluded that the plaintiff, who \ndid not have  contract rights against the defendant, nonetheless had a common law \nduty of care  arising from the  defendant design professional’s working relationship \nand community of interest s with the plaintiff , which was wholly separate from any \nduty or remedies arising under statute or by contract.   \n30. Based on the above, the Court concludes that JBC has sufficiently pleaded \nthat URS, independent of any contract, owed and breached a common law duty of due \ncare to JBC in rendering its services on the Project and that, under Davidson & Jones \nand its progeny, JBC has adequately stated its negligence claims against URS.  \nAccordingly, URS’s M otion to dismiss JBC’s T hird-Party Complaint through \napplication of the economic loss rule must be denied.25  \n \n25 The Court recognizes that tension exists between Davidson & Jones and its progeny, on \nthe one hand —which permit a negligence claim based on a breach of a duty of reasonable \ncare that is tied to the design professional’s performance of a contract with a party other than \nthe plaintiff—and Ports Authority, Crescent II, and their progeny, on the other hand—which \nfind privity of contract immaterial and reject claims based on the negligent performance of a \ncontract.  The Court’s response is that Davidson & Jones, Pompano, and the other cases cited \nabove are squarely on point  with the instant case , have established the law of design \nprofessional liability in this State for many years, and therefore must  be applied, even if to \ndo so may be characterized as recognizing another exception to the economic loss rule.  See, \ne.g., Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. v. RSM US, LLP , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 101, at * 54 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 2, 201 8) (holding that accountants have a common law duty of care \nindependent of contract); Austin v. Regal Inv. Advisors, LLC , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 3, at *27 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 8, 2018) ( finding investment advisor had duty of care independent of \ncontract). \n \nB. Statute of Limitations \n31. Separate and apart from the economic loss rule, URS  also seeks dismissal \nof JBC’s claims for negligence and professional negligence on grounds that they are \nbarred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.26  \n32. “A statute of limitations defense may properly be asserted in a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss if it appears on the face of the complaint that such a statute bars \nthe claim.”  Horton v. Carolina Medicorp, Inc., 344 N.C. 133, 136 (1996).  “Whether a \nstatute of limitations defense may be determined at the 12(b)(6) stage depends on \nwhether the facts necessary to adjudicate the defense are demonstrated by the \ncomplaint itself or whether additional evidence must be considered.”  Window World \nof Baron Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc. , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *23 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. July 12, 2017) (citation omitted).  Importantly for this Motion, under Rule \n12(b)(6), a trial court “may not consider materials that are not mentioned, contained, \nor attached in or to the pleading; otherwise, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion will be converted \ninto a Rule 56 motion and subject to its standards of consideration and review. ”  \nAlamance Fam. Prac., P.A. v. Lindley, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 83, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nAug. 14, 2018) (citing Fowler v. Williamson, 39 N.C. App. 715, 717 (1979)).   \n33. URS argues that JBS’s Third-Party Complaint was filed on 31 July 2023 \nand that “[i]nsofar as JBC’s claims are premised upon issues raised in correspondence \nprior to July 31, 2020 and/or issues JBC otherwise knew ab out prior to July 31, \n2020 . . . , such claims are barred by the applicable three -year statute of \n \n26 (URS’s Br. Supp. 26–28.) \nlimitations.”27  The  “correspondence” URS relies upon  to establish the accrual of \nJBC’s claims, however, are letters JBC sent to the City between 18 March 2020 and \nSeptember 2020 that are referenced in JBC’s Complaint against the City  (the \n“Letters”)28 but are not attached to or referenced anywhere in the T hird-Party \nComplaint.   \n34. At the Hearing, JBC objected to the Court’s consideration of the Letters and \nto the conversion of URS’ s motion into one under Rule 56 .  The Court agrees with \nJBC that it cannot consider the Letters under Rule 12(b)(6) because they are not \n“mentioned, contained, or attached in or to the [Third-Party Complaint],” and the \nCourt finds it inappropriate to exercise its discretion to treat URS’s M otion as one \nunder Rule 56 at this early stage of the litigation.  As a result, the Court will not \nconsider the Letters on URS’s Motion.   \n35. Looking then to the allegations of the Third-Party Complaint (and without \nconsidering the Letters), the Court cannot conclude that JBC’s claims accrued more \nthan three years prior to the filing of that pleading  under either party’s view of the \ndate of accrual of those claims.29  As a result, the Court will deny the Motion to the \n \n27 (URS’s Br. Supp. 28.)   \n \n28 (See First Am. Verified Compl. ¶¶ 49–53.) \n \n29 URS argues that JBC’s negligence claims accrued “when the wrong giving rise to the right \nto bring suit is committed,” quoting Harrold v. Dowd , 149 N.C. App. 777, 781 (2002) .  \nAccording to URS, the wrongs on which JBC bases its negligence claims occurred more than \nthree years prior to the filing of JBC’s Third-Party Complaint.  (URS’s Br. Supp. 26.)  There \nare no allegations in the T hird-Party Complaint, however,  from which the Court can \nascertain the date upon which JBC’s claims accrued  under URS’s theory of accrual.  JBC \nargues in opposition that “a cause of action accrues, so as to start the running of statute of \nlimitations, as soon as the right to institute and maintain a suit arises,” quoting Thurston \nMotor Lines, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 258 N.C. 232, 235 (1962).  According to JBC, its right \nextent it seeks dismissal of JBC’s negligence and professional negligence claims on \nstatute of limitations grounds. \nC. Indemnity \n36. JBC asserts a claim against URS for indemnity, alleging that “[s]everal of \nthe claims made b y the City against JBC in its [counterclaims] arise out of, or are \nconnected with URS’ [s] negligence and failure to perform design services in \nconformance with its Design Contract with the City[.]”30 \n37. URS contends that this claim should be dismissed because  the claims the \nCity asserts against JBC do not sound in tort, and in the absence of a tort claim, JBC \ncannot seek indemnification from URS.31  The Court agrees. \n38. “In North Carolina, a party’s rights to indemnity can rest on three bases: (1) \nan express contract; (2) a contract implied- in-fact; or (3) equitable concepts arising \nfrom the tort theory of indemnity, often referred to as a contract implied -in-law.”  \nKaleel Builders, Inc., 161 N.C. App. at 38.  JBC does not allege an express contract \nor a contract implied -in-fact giving rise to a right to indemnity, so JBC’s right to \nindemnity, if it exists at all, is based on a right to indemnity implied-in-law. \n \nto institute and maintain suit did not arise until the City filed its counterclaims  in 2023, \nbecause that was when JBC first suffered injury.   (JBC’s Br. Opp’n 12 –13.)  Under JBC’s \ntheory of accrual, JBC filed it s third -party claims well within the applicable three -year \nstatute of limitations.  Given that URS’s motion necessarily fails on the pleaded facts under \neither party’s theory of accrual, however, the Court need not , and therefore does not, \ndetermine which theory of accrual shall prevail in resolving the Motion.  \n \n30 (Third-Party Compl. ¶ ¶ 13–15.)  URS also seeks dismissal of JBC’s third -party claim \nagainst URS for contribution.  (URS’s Br. Supp. 30.)  Since JBC agreed in its opposition brief \nto withdraw that claim, (JBC’s Br. Opp’n 15), the Court will grant the Motion to this extent \nand dismiss JBC’s contribution claim. \n \n31 (URS’s Br. Supp. 29.) \n39. “For indemnification implied -in-law, more an equitable remedy than an \naction in and of itself, North Car olina law requires there be an underlying injury \nsounding in tort.  The party seeking indemnity must have imputed or derivative \nliability for the tortious conduct from which indemnity is sought.”  Id. at 41.   \n40. Our appellate courts have held that: \n[p]rimary and secondary liability between defendants exists only when: \n(1) they are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff; and (2) either (a) \none has been passively negligent but is exposed to liability through the \nactive negligence of the other or (b) one alone has done the act which \nproduced the injury but the other is derivatively liable for the negligence \nof the former. \n \nId. (emphasis in original) (citing Edwards v. Hamill, 262 N.C. 528, 531 (1964)). \n41. The Third-Party Complaint makes plain that the claim for which JBC seeks \nindemnity is the City’s claim for breach of contract.  There is no tort claim for which \nindemnity is sought.  As a result, JBC’s claim does not fit the “ active-passive tort-\nfeasor framework” required to state a claim for a right to indemnity implied -in-law.  \nSee id. at 47 (holding that “the parties do not fit the active -passive tort -feasor \nframework required to support an equitable right to indemnity implied-in-law” where \nthe plaintiff’s claim sought indemnification from a claim for breach of contract and \nnot one sounding in tort).  Since JBC has not sufficiently alleged any of the three \nbases that permit a right to indemnity , the Court will grant the Motion dismissing \nJBC’s claim for indemnification. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n42. WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Court hereby GRANTS \nin part and DENIES in part the Motion as follows: \na. The Motion is hereby GRANTED as to JBC’s third-party claims against \nURS for contribution and indemnity , and those claims are hereby \nDISMISSED with prejudice; and  \nb. The Motion is hereby DENIED as to JBC’s third- party claims against \nURS for negligence and professional negligence, and those claims shall \nproceed to discovery.   \n    SO ORDERED, this the 27th day of February, 2024. \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A.
