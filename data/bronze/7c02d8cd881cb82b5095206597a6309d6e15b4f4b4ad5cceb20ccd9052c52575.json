Having considered the Motion, the parties’ briefs, affidavits, and materials \noffered in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the arguments of counsel at the \nhearing on the Motion, and other relevant matters of record, the Court h ereby \nGRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Motion. \nTonkon Torp LLP, by Samantha Taylor and Caroline Harris Crowne, \nand DeVore, Acton & Stafford, PA, by F.

Amend Compl. Include Additional Party, [hereinafter, “Mot.”], ECF No. 30.) \n \nVista Horticultural, Inc. v. Johnson Price Sprinkle, PA, 2024 NCBC 4. \nI. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n3. Plaintiff Vista Horticultural, Inc. d/b/a Eden Brothers initiated this action \nin Buncombe County Superior Court on 2 5 April 2023 alleging malpractice against \nan accounting firm, DMJPS, PLLC (“DMJPS”) ,2 and shortly thereafter filed an \nAmended Complaint on 9 May 2023 adding another accounting firm, Johnson Price \nSprinkle, PA (“JPS” ; together with DMJPS, “Defendants” ), as a party -defendant.3  \nBoth the original and amended complaints assert claims, the former against DMJPS \nand the  latter against both DMJPS and JPS, for breach of contract, professional \nmalpractice/professional negligence, common law negligence, gross \nnegligence/punitive damages, and breach of fiduciary duty.  Defendants filed separate \nanswers to the Amended Complaint on 13 June 2023.4  \n4. On 13 August 2023, Defendants’ original lead counsel passed away, and \nDefendants’ current lead counsel entered notices of appearance on 28 August 2023. 5  \nThereafter, the Court held a BCR 9.3 Case Management Conference on 26 September \n20236 and entered the Case Management Order in this case on 27 September 2023.7 \n \n2 (Compl., ECF Nos. 3, 5.)  ECF Nos. 3 and 5 are identical. \n \n3 (Am. Compl., ECF No. 4.) \n \n4 (Answer DMJPS, PLLC Am. Compl., ECF No. 8 ; Answer Johnson Price Sprinkle, PA Am. \nCompl., ECF No. 9.) \n \n5 (Notice Appearance, ECF No. 19 (Melissa Dewey Brumback); Notice Appearance, ECF No.  \n20 (John Nunnally).) \n \n6 (Am. Notice BCR 9.3 Case Management Conference, ECF No. 22.) \n \n7 (Case Management Order, ECF No. 26.) \n5. The parties exchanged document discovery and produced documents to one \nanother in November and December 2023, and Plaintiff filed the Motion to add Sok \nHeang Cheng (“Cheng”), JPS’s lead shareholder and owner, as a party-defendant on \n20 December 2023 after determining that JPS’s insurance coverage was insufficient \nto cover the full extent of Plaintiff’s damages claim.8  On 24 January 2024, the parties \nfiled a Stipulated Notice of Dismissal of all claims against DMJPS without prejudice.9 \n6. After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motion on 30 January \n2024, at which all parties were represented by counsel (the “Hearing”).  The Motion \nis now ripe for resolution.  \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n7. When a party seeks leave of court to amend a pleading, “leave shall be \nfreely given when justice so requires.”  N.C.R. Civ. P. 15(a).  “A motion to amend is \naddressed to the sound discretion of the trial [court]” and is reviewable only for abuse \nof discretion.  House of Raeford Farms, Inc. v. City of Raeford, 104 N.C. App. 280, 282 \n(1991).  A motion to amend may be denied for “(a) undue delay, (b) bad faith, (c) undue \nprejudice, (d) futility of amendment, and (e) repeated failure to cure defects by \nprevious amendments.”  Id. at 282–83. \n8. “The futility standard under Rule 15 is essentially the same standard used \nin reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)[.]”  Simply the Best Movers, LLC \n \n8 (Mot. Ex. A, Aff. Samantha Taylor Supp. Pl.’s Mot. Leave File Am. Compl. , dated Dec. 18, \n2023, at ¶¶ 7–9 [hereinafter “Taylor Aff.”].) \n \n9 (ECF No. 37.) \nv. Marrins’ Moving Sys., Ltd., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 28, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 6, \n2016).  When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court views \nthe allegations in the pleading at issue “in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty[,]” Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, Inc., 370 N.C. 1, 5 (2017) (cleaned \nup), and determines “whether the allegations of the complaint, if treated as true, are \nsufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under some legal theory[,]” \nCorwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoting CommScope \nCredit Union v. Butler & Burke, LLP, 369 N.C. 48, 51 (2016)). \n9. “[T]he [pleading] is to be liberally construed, and the trial court should not \ndismiss the [pleading] unless it appears beyond doubt that [the] [claimant] could \nprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  State \nex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, 362 N.C. 431, 444 (2008) (fourth \nalteration in original) (quoting Meyer v. Walls, 347 N.C. 97, 111–12 (1997)).  Dismissal \nof a pleading under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper only: “(1) when the [pleading] on its face \nreveals that no law supports [the] claim; (2) when the [pleading] reveals on its face \nthe absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; [or] (3) when some fact disclosed \nin the [pleading] necessarily defeats the [ ] claim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, \n278 (1985). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n10. Plaintiff’s Motion seeks leave to amend its First Amended Complaint to add \nCheng, a Certified Public Accountant , as a party -defendant in this action.  For the \nmost part, Plaintiff’s proposed amendments seek to assert against Cheng many of the \nfactual allegations asserted against JPS (mostly by changing “JPS” to “Defendants”) \nand to assert against Cheng the same claims it has asserted against JPS (breach of \ncontract, professional malpractice/professional negligence, common law negligence, \ngross negligence/punitive damages, and breach of fiduciary duty).10  \n11. JPS opposes the Motion on grounds of undue delay, ulterior tactical \nadvantage/bad faith, and futility.11 \n12. After careful consideration and review, the Court, in the exercise of its \ndiscretion, will grant the Motion in part and deny the Motion in part for the reasons \nset forth below. \nA. Undue Delay \n13. First, the Court is not persuaded, in the circumstances of this case, that \nPlaintiff has unduly delayed in bringing the Motion.12  Plaintiff has offered evidence \nthat it did not file the Motion until eight months after it filed the initial Complaint \nbecause, despite its  diligence in  seeking information concerning Defendant’s \ninsurance coverage in discovery, it did not succeed in obtaining relevant coverage \ninformation until Defendant  produced documents on 13 October 2023 and 9 \nNovember 2023.  Plaintiff thereafter promptly sought JPS’s consent to add Cheng as \n \n10 (See Mot., Ex. A-1, proposed Second Am. Compl.  [hereinafter, “SAC”]; Mot. Ex. B, Redline \nComparison Proposed Second Am. Compl. and First Am. Compl., ECF No. 30.)   \n \n11 (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n  Pl.’s Mot. Amend Compl. Include Additional Party 3 –12 [hereinafter, \n“Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot.”], ECF No. 33.) \n \n12 (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. 3–5.) \n \na party -defendant, but JPS declined to consent on 30 November 2023.  Plaintiff \nthereafter filed the Motion with its supporting brief and materials.13  The Court notes \nthat, typically, North Carolina courts have found undue delay in situations where \nthere is far more delay than that alleged here.  See, e.g., Wilkerson v. Duke Univ., 229 \nN.C. App. 670, 679 (2013) (thirteen months); Carmayer, LLC v. Koury Aviation, Inc., \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *21 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 11, 2017) (seventeen months); \nAlkemal Sing. PTE Ltd. v. DEW Global Fin., LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 112, at *31 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 12, 2017) (collecting cases to similar effect)).   \n14. Moreover, discovery in this case is ongoing ; the discovery period does not \nexpire until 28 May 2024. 14  Indeed, JPS’s counsel admitted at the Hearing that \nCheng’s addition as a party-defendant would not prejudice or change JPS’s litigation \nconduct in any respect, and the Court concludes that, while Cheng’s addition may \nprompt additional motion practice, it will not result in any discovery in addition to \nthat already planned.  For all these reasons, therefore, the Court concludes that \nDefendant’s objection based on undue delay is without merit. \nB. Bad Faith/Ulterior Tactical Advantage \n15. Defendant’s bad faith/ulterior tactical advantage argument fares no \nbetter.15  Although JPS argued at the Hearing that adding Cheng to the case and \nexposing her personal assets to liability would create unnecessary “tension” between \n \n13 (Taylor Aff. ¶¶ 3–9.) \n \n14 (Case Management Order 4.) \n \n15 (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. 5–6.) \n \nCheng and JPS’s shareholders concerning  settlement, Plaintiff’s allegations are \nsupported by facts that must be taken as true, and the Court cannot conclude that \nPlaintiff has engaged in bad faith or any other unfair or inappropriate tactical or \nstrategic action through the Second Amended Compl aint.  See,  e.g., Bundy v. Com. \nCredit Co., 202 N.C. 604, 607 (1932) (“[B]ad faith . . . implies a false motive or a false \npurpose, and hence it is a species of fraudulent conduct.”); Vitaform, Inc. v. Aeroflow, \nInc., 2021 NCBC LEXIS 79, at * *15–16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 16, 2021) (“Bad faith \namendments are those which may be abusive or made in order to secure some ulterior \ntactical advantage.”) (quoting GSS Props., Inc. v. Kendale Shopping Ctr., Inc., 119 \nF.R.D. 379, 381 (M.D.N.C. 1988)). \nC. Futility \n16. Defendant makes several arguments based on the alleged futility of the \nproposed amendment.   \n17. First, Defendant contends that “any claim against Ms. Cheng personally for \ndisgorgement [of fees paid to JPS] is futile on its face.” 16  Perhaps in recognition of \nthe strength of Defendant’s argument, Plaintiff conceded at the Hearing that it no \nlonger seeks disgorgement from Cheng of the fees Plaintiff paid to JPS for its services.  \nAccordingly, the Court will exercise its discretion to deny the Motion to the exten t \nPlaintiff seeks to add Cheng to its request for disgorgement. \n \n16 (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. 10–11.) \n \n18. The Court next turns to Defendant’s contention that Plaintiff’s claims are \nbarred by the economic loss rule and finds that contention without merit.17   \n19. First, “ the economic loss rule, in its simplest form, holds that purely \neconomic losses are not ordinarily recoverable under tort law.”  Crescent Univ. City \nVenture, LLC v. AP Atl., Inc., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 49, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 14, \n2019) (citation omitted ), aff’d, 376 N.C. 54 (2020).  Consequently, the rule does not  \nbar Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.   \n20. Neither does the rule bar Plaintiff’s claims for professional \nmalpractice/professional negligence , common law negligence, and gross negligence \nbecause North Carolina law is clear that an accountant , like Cheng, “owes a duty to \ncompetently perform [her]  services independent of the contractual engagements \nbetween the parties.”  Provectus Biopharms. , Inc. v. RSM US LLP , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 101, *55 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 28, 2018).  Because the economic loss rule does \nnot bar tort claims that are based on a duty “that is separate and apart from any duty \nowed under a contract,” Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc. v. Rogers, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, \nat *48 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 3, 2011), Plaintiff’s proposed negligence-based claims \nagainst Cheng survive JPS’s futility challenge based on the economic loss rule.   \n21. Finally, although JPS initially asserts that all proposed claims against \nCheng are barred by operation of the economic loss rule,18 JPS subsequently asserts \nin the same brief that the rule bars Plaintiff’s claims for negligence, gross negligence, \n \n17 (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. 11–12.) \n \n18 (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. 9.) \n \nand disgorgement and nowhere mentions Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim.19  \nNor did Defendants’ counsel mention th at claim at the Hearing.  The Court thus \nconcludes that Defendant has abandoned any contention that leave to amend should \nbe denied as to Plaintiff’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty and will grant the Motion \non that basis.  Cf. Cohen Schatz Assocs., Inc. v. Perry, 169 N.C. App. 834, 837 (2005) \n(“Issues raised in defendant’s brief, but not supported by argument or authority, are \ndeemed abandoned.”) (quoting Pharmarsch. Corp. v. Mash , 163 N.C. App. 419, 428 \n(2004))). \n22. Defendants also contend that Plaintiff’s request for leave to assert its gross \nnegligence/punitive damages claim should be denied as futile because Plaintiff has \nfailed to allege sufficient facts to sustain a gross negligence claim. 20  “Gross \nnegligence has been defined as ‘wanton c onduct done with conscious or reckless \ndisregard for the rights and safety of others.’ ”  Toomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. App. 462, \n482 (2002) (quoting Bullins v. Schmidt, 322 N.C. 580, 583 (1988)).  “An act is wanton \nwhen it is done of wicked purpose, or when  done needlessly, manifesting a reckless \nindifference to the rights of others.”  Yancey v. Lea, 354 N.C. 48, 52 (2001)  (internal \ncitation omitted).  “An act or conduct rises to the level of gross negligence when the \nact is done purposely and with knowledge that such act is a breach of duty to others, \ni.e., a conscious disregard of the safety of others.”  Id. at 53 (emphasis in original) .  \n“Aside from allegations of wanton conduct, a claim for gross negligence requires that \n \n19 (Defs. Br. Opp’n Mot. 10.) \n \n20 (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. 7–9.) \n \nplaintiff plead facts on each of the elements of negligence, including duty, causation, \nproximate cause, and damages.”  Toomer, 155 N.C. App. at 482 (cleaned up).  \n23. Plaintiff pleads here that Cheng had “professional and legal duties” to \nprovide her professional services to Plaintiff, that she “was fully aware that Plaintiff \nwould rely on [her] services,”21 that she “knew about the [the United States Supreme \nCourt’s] Wayfair decision,22 and that she failed to “properly advise [Plaintiff] of its \nstate tax liability after the  Wayfair decision in 2018, despite the significance of this \nchange in the law and the specific significance for online retailers” like Plaintiff. 23  \nPlaintiff further alleges that Cheng “had in [her] possession information from \n[Plaintiff] showing substantial sales revenues outside of North Carolina,” and that \n \n21 (SAC ¶ 64.) \n \n22 (SAC ¶ 66.)  Plaintiff alleges the following concerning the Wayfair decision: \n \n17.  On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in South \nDakota v. Wayfair, Inc. , 138 S.Ct. 2080 (2018), overruling past precedent to \nhold that states had the authority to assess taxes on online merchants —with \nno physical presence in the tax ing state —based on sales to the state’s \nresidents.   \n \n18.  The Wayfair decision was a major development in the accounting world \ndue to its far-reaching implications for businesses of all sizes engaged in online \nsales.  Firms like JPS issued urgent alerts to their clients who sold goods out \nof state, warning them that they co uld now be obligated to pay sales taxes in \nother states.   \n \n19.  Specifically, as to Eden Brothers, the Wayfair  decision meant that the \nadvice JPS had given Eden Brothers at the beginning of the engagement—that \nit was only necessary to collect and remit ta x on sales to North Carolina \nresidents— was no longer correct.”   \n \n(SAC ¶¶ 17–19.) \n \n23 (SAC ¶ 64.) \nshe “willfully or recklessly failed to inform [Plaintiff] that it could have liability for \nsales taxes to states other than North Carolina, and failed to take any action to help \n[Plaintiff] avoid continuing and increasing sales tax liability in those other states, \ndespite being armed with this knowledge.”\n24  Plaintiff otherwise alleges facts showing \ncausation, proximate cause, and damages. \n24. Although Plaintiff’s gross negligence claim may face a different fate at \nsummary judgment, the Court concludes that these allegations are sufficient to allege \nthat Cheng engaged in “intentional wrongdoing or del iberate misconduct affecting \nthe safety of others,” Yancey, 354 N.C. at 53, and t hus that she engaged in “wanton \nconduct.”  As a result, since the Court concludes that Plaintiff has pleaded all required \nelements of its gross negligence claim against Cheng, the Court will grant the Motion \nto the extent Plaintiff  seeks leave to assert its gross negligence/punitive damages \nclaim against Cheng in the proposed Second Amended Complaint. \n25. Defendants also raised a futility challenge at the Hearing as to Plaintiff’s \nbreach of contract claim against Cheng.  The Court will deny the Motion to the extent \nPlaintiff seeks to add Cheng as a party -defendant t o its breach of contract claim \nagainst JPS because Plaintiff does not allege in its proposed Second Amended \nComplaint that Plaintiff entered into a contract with Cheng.  See, e.g., Supplee v. \nMiller-Motte Bus. Coll., Inc., 239 N.C. App. 208, 216 (2015) (“The elements of a claim \nfor breach of contract are (1) existence of a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms \nof that contract.”) (cleaned up) (emphasis added).  \n \n24 (SAC ¶ 65.) \n \n26. To the contrary, Plaintiff alleges that it “engaged JPS’s accounting \nservices,”25 that “[Plaintiff] and JPS would execute specific engagement letters for \nannual tax return preparation,” that “JPS was involved in all of [Plaintiff’s] financial \nand accounting functions,” and that “JPS’s invoices to [Plaintiff] from 2017 through \nthe course of the engagement reflect that JPS provided regular business consulting \nservices, monthly accounting and bookkeeping services, federal and state tax return \npreparation, and period sales tax assistance.” 26  Plaintiff n owhere allege s that it \nentered into a  contract, oral or written, with Cheng, that Cheng is  a third -party \nbeneficiary of a contract with Plaintiff, or that Cheng is JPS’s alter ego through veil-\npiercing allegations.  Accordingly, the Court will exercise its discretion to deny  the \nMotion and disallow Plaintiff’s proposed Second Amended Complaint to the extent \nPlaintiff seeks to add Cheng to its breach of contract claim against JPS.   \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n27. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in part \nthe Motion as follows: \na. Plaintiff’s Motion is hereby DENIED as to Plaintiff’s proposed claims \nagainst Cheng for disgorgement and for breach of contract, and those \n \n25 (SAC ¶ 9.) \n \n26 (SAC ¶ 10.)  The Court notes, but does not rely upon, the fact that the engagement letters \nattached to JPS’s opposition brief show that each was entered into by JPS, not Cheng in her \nindividual capacity.  (See ECF No. 33.1.)  \n \nclaims and the allegations supporting them shall be excluded from the \nSecond Amended Complaint. \nb. Plaintiff’s Motion is  otherwise GRANTED, and Plaintiff’s proposed \nclaims against Cheng for professional malpractice/professional \nnegligence, common law negligence, gross negligence/punitive damages, \nand breach of fiduciary duty , with supporting allegations , may be \nincluded in the Second Amended Complaint. \nc. Plaintiff shall file the proposed Second Amended Complaint, modified to \nreflect the Court’s rulings hereunder, no later than 9 February 2024. \nSO ORDERED, this the 5th day of February, 2024. \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A.
