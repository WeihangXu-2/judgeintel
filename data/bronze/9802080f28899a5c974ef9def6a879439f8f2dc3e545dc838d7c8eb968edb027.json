Moore, 2019 NCBC 32. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nWAKE COUNTY \n IN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17-CVS-13761 \nMICHAEL PATRICK O’DONNELL, \nderivatively on behalf of LOOKOUT \nCAPITAL, LLC,  \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nWILLIAM M. MOORE, \nW. MERRETTE MOORE, and \nTIDEWATER EQUITY PARTNERS, \nLLC, \nDefendants, \n \nand \n \nLOOKOUT CAPITAL, LLC,  \n \nNominal \nDefendant. \nORDER ON JOINT MOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF \nPROPOSED SETTLEMENT \n \nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on the Parties’1 Joint Motion for \nPreliminary Approval of Proposed Settlement.  (“Joint Motion for Approval”, ECF No. \n78.)  The Parties move pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D -8-04(a) (hereinafter, \nreference to the General  Statutes shall be “G.S”)  for preliminary approval of a \nsettlement reached by the parties in this derivative proceeding.  The Parties also filed \na Brief in Support of Joint Motion, (ECF No. 80), a Settlement Agreement and Mutual \nRelease, (“Proposed Settlement Agreement”, ECF No. 78.1), and a proposed Notice of \nPreliminary Approval of Proposed Settlement (“Proposed Notice”) (ECF No. 78.2).  On \nMay 29, 2019 , the Court held a telephone conference with counsel for the Parties , \n                                                 \n1 For purposes of this Order, “ Parties” means the Plaintiff and Defendants currently \nremaining in the lawsuit. \n \n \nJohn McCormick Kane (“Kane” ), and Skelton & Associates, LP (“Skelton & \nAssociates”) regarding the Court’s proposed amendments to the Proposed Settlement \nAgreement and Proposed Notice , and Parties, Kane, and Skelton & Associates \nconsented to the proposed amendments. \n THE COURT, having considered the Joint Motion for Approval, the supporting \nbrief (“Brief in Support of Joint Motion”, ECF No. 80) , the Proposed Settlement \nAgreement and Proposed Notice , the consent of the Parties, Kane, and Skelton & \nAssociates to the Cour t’s proposed amendments, and other appropriate matters of \nrecord, concludes that the Motion should be GRANTED for the reasons and on the \nterms set forth below. \n1. The Court has set out the factual allegations and the procedural \nbackground of this lawsuit it its Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), (ECF No. 71), and its Order and Opinion on Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), (ECF No. 72), and will not repeat them \nhere. \n2. On March 7, 2018, Plaintiffs Michael Patrick O’Donnell (“O’Donnell”) , \nKane, and Skelton & Associates  filed a verified amended derivative complaint \n(“Amended Complaint”) on behalf of Lookout  Capital, LLC (“Lookout”) , a Delaware \nlimited liability company, and eight other North Carolina limited liability companies: \nBeta Investment, LLC (“Beta”), LC Gamma, LLC (“Gamma”), LC Delta Investment, \nLLC (“Delta”), LC Epsilon Investment, LLC (“Epsilon”), LC Eta Investment, I, LLC \n(“Eta I”), LC Theta Investment, LLC (“Theta”), LC Theta Investment II, LLC (“Theta \nII”), and LC Capitola Investment, LLC (“Capitola”) (collectively the “Investment \n \n \nEntities”).  (Am. Compl, ECF No. 36.)  Plaintiffs alleged derivative claims on behalf \nof Lookout and the Investment Entities against Defendants William M. Moore (“Bill \nMoore”) and W. Merrette Moore (“Merrette Moore”)  (collectively, Bill Moore and \nMerrette Moore are referred to as “the Moores”), and Defendant Tidewater Equity \nPartners, LLC (“Tidewater”), for (1) breach of fiduciary duty against the Moores; (2) \nbreach of Lookout’s Operating Agreement against the Moores; (3) breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against the Moores; (4) aiding and \nabetting breach of fiduciary duty against Tidewater; (5) waste of corporate assets \nagainst the Moor es; (6) tortious interference with contract against Tidewater; (7) \ntortious interference with prospective economic advantage against Tidewater; (8) \nunfair or deceptive trade practices against all Defendants; and (9) unjust enrichment \nagainst all Defendants. \n3. Defendants subsequently moved to dismiss, and on December 14, 2018, \nthe Court issued orders granting in part and denying in part the motions to dismiss.  \n(the “Orders”, ECF Nos. 71, 72.)  In the Orders, the Court dismissed the derivative \nclaims brought on behalf of the Investment Entities; dismissed the derivative claims \nbrought on behalf of Lookout by Kane and Skelton & Associates, and concluded that \nonly O’Donnell had standing to pursue the derivative clai ms on behalf of Lookout ; \ndismissed the unfair or deceptive trade practices  claims against the Moores and \nTidewater; and dismissed the aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty claim \nagainst Tidewater. \n4. On March 25, 2019, the Parties, along with Kane, Skelton & Associates, \nand Skelton & Associates ’ principal, Thomas Allen Skelton  (hereinafter Skelton & \n \n \nAssociates and Thomas Allen Skelton are collectively referred to as “Skelton & \nAssociates”) reached a settlement on all claims  following a second mediated \nsettlement conference and , on or about May 8, 2019, agreed to the terms of the \nProposed Settlement Agreement. \n5. On May 8, 2019, the Parties filed the Joint Motion for Approval, Brief in \nSupport of Joint Motion, Proposed Settlement Agreement, and Proposed Notice.  \n6. In the Brief in Support of Joint Motion, t he Parties represent that \nduring this litigation they engaged in extensive written discovery and took numerous \ndepositions.  While the Parties dispute the merit s of the remaining claims, “ the \nParties all recognize the uncertainty of litigation and the risk and expenses \nassociated with proceeding with this case through summary judgment and trial. ”  \n(ECF No. 80, at p. 7.)  Plaintiff represents that the terms of the Proposed Settlement \nAgreement, which includes, inter alia, removal of the Moores from the management \nof Look out and the Investment Entities and a substantial monetary payment to \nLookout by the Moores, “[are] in Lookout’s best interests.”  (Id.)  Finally, the Parties \nhave agreed upon a method of providing notice to the members of Lookout regarding \nthe terms of the settlement and an opportunity for members to make objections before \nfinal approval of the Proposed Settlement Agreement.  ( Id. at pp. 10 –11; ECF No. \n78.2.) \nA. Preliminary Approval of Settlement and Notice, and Setting of Final Approval \nHearing \n  \n7. G.S. §  57D-8-04(a) provides, in relevant part, that “[a] derivative \nproceeding may not be discontinued or settled without the court's approval. If the \ncourt determines that a proposed discontinuance or settlement will substantially \n \n \naffect the interests of the LLC's members,  the court shall direct that notice be given \nto the members who would be affected.”2  “The court shall determine the manner and \nform of the notice and the manner in which costs of the notice will be borne.” G.S. \n§ 57D-8-04(b). \n8. In determining whether to approve the settlement of a derivative action, \n“the court is to balance (1) any legitimate corporate claims as brought forward in the \nderivative shareholder suit against (2) the corporation ’s best interests [.]” Alford v. \nShaw, 327 N.C. 526, 540, 398 S.E.2d 445, 453 (1990). The factors generally considered \nin balancing these interests include costs to the corporate entity of litigating the \nclaim, the benefits to the corporate entity in continuing the suit, and any “ethical, \ncommercial, promotional, public relat ions, and fiscal factors ” that may be \ninvolved.  Id.  This Court has applied the Shaw factors in deciding whether to approve \na settlement of derivative claims brought on behalf of a limited liability company.  \nWhite v. Hyde, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 202, at *2 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 23, 2017) \n9. After review of the Joint Motion for Approval, the Brief in Support of \nJoint Motion, the Proposed Settlement Agreement, and other matters of record, t he \nCourt finds that the Settlement Agreement was entered into after extensive litigation \nand arm’s length negotiation by experienced counsel for the parties, assisted by a \nneutral mediator, and that the Parties, Kane, and Skelton & Associates consent to \nthe preliminary approval of the Proposed Settlement Agreement.  The Court also  \n                                                 \n2 Although Lookout is a foreign LLC, section 57D-8-04 of the North Carolina General Statutes \napplies to this motion for approval. See G.S. § 57D-8-06 (“In any derivative proceeding in the \nright of a foreign LLC, the matters covered by this Article will be governed by the law of the \njurisdiction of the foreign LLC’s organization except for the matters governed by G.S. 57D-8-\n02, 57D-8-04, and 57D-8-05.”). \n \n \nfinds that the Parties have not raised any concerns regarding the ethical, commercial, \npromotional, or public relations impact of the Proposed Settlement Agreement, and \nthe Court identifies none.  Shaw, 327 N.C. at 540, 398 S.E.2d at 453. \n10. With regard to  attorneys’ fees and costs, section IX of the Proposed \nSettlement Agreement provides as follows: \nEach of the Parties, Kane, and Skelton shall be separately \nresponsible for their own attorneys’ fees and costs incurred \nduring the Lawsuit, including the negot iation of this \nAgreement and any disputes that may arise from this \nAgreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent \nPlaintiff from seeking Court approval to redistribute the \nSettlement Payment, in part, as an award for his attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n11. The Court has requested, and the Parties, Kane, and Skelton & \nAssociates have consented to,  amend the language of Section IX of the Proposed \nSettlement Agreement, prior to executing the Agreement, to replace the second \nsentence of section IX with the following sentence: “Nothing in this Agreement shall \nprevent Plaintiff from seeking an Order from the Court that Lookout pay Plaintiff’s \nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in this lawsuit pursuant to N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 57D-8-05(1).” \n12. The Court concludes that , with the agreed-upon amendment to section \nIX, the Proposed Settlement Agreement should be preliminarily approved.   \n13. The Court also finds that Lookout’s members will be substantially \naffected by the settlement of this matter and should, as requested by Plaintiff, be \nprovided with notice prior to a final approval of the settlement .  The Parties intend \nto provide notice to Lookout’s members by sending the Proposed Notice and a copy of \nthe Proposed Settlement Agreement to each member via electronic mail.  The \n \n \nProposed Notice provides a thirty (30) day period for members to provide any \nobjections to the terms of the Settlement Agreement by electronic mail.  The Parties \nrepresent that electronic mail has been an effective means of communicating with the \nmembers during this litigation.  Plaintiff will bear responsibility for, and any \nassociated costs of, sending the Proposed Notice, discussed below, and fielding any \nobjections from Lookout’s members.  \n14. With regard to the Proposed Notice, the Court has requested, and the \nParties, Kane, and Skelton & Associates have consented to, amend the language of \nProposed Notice, prior to sending the Proposed Notice to Lookout’s members, to \ninclude the following language  between the first and  second sentences of the third \nparagraph of the Proposed Notice: \nPlease note that, pursuant to Section IX of the Settlement \nAgreement, Michael O’Donnell has reserved the right to \nseek an Order from the Court that Lookout pay the \nexpenses he and other members incurred, including \nattorneys’ fees, in bringing this lawsuit.  Any payment of \nthose expenses would be paid by Lookout from its general \nassets following receipt of the Settlement Payment amount \ndefined in Section II of the Settlement Agreement. \n \n15. The Court concludes that, with the agreed upon amendment to the third \nparagraph of the Proposed Notice, the  manner and form of the Proposed Notice are \napproved. \n16. If the Parties receive any objections from members, they shall notify the \nCourt of such objections and provide copies of the objections to the Court by no later \nthan ten (10) calendar days following the deadline for members to provide objections.  \nOnce any objections have been considered, the Court will determine whether it is \n \n \nnecessary to hold a hearing on final approval of the settlemen t and will notify the \nparties of the date and time for such hearing.   \n17. Therefore, the Joint Motion for Approval  is GRANTED on the terms \nprovided herein. \nSO ORDERED, this the 29th day of May, 2019. \n \n \n      /s/ Gregory P. McGuire  \n    Gregory P. McGuire \n    Special Superior Court Judge \n     for Complex Business Cases \n "
