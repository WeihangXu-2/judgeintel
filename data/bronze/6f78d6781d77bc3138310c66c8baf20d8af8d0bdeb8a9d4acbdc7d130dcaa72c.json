  "raw_text": "Zloop, Inc. v. Parker Poe Adams & Bernstein, LLP, 2018 NCBC 39. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \nCOUNTY OF MECKLENBURG \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 5480 \nZLOOP, INC., \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nPARKER POE ADAMS & BERNSTEIN, \nLLP; ALBA-JUSTINA SECRIST a/k/a  \nA-J SECRIST, and R. DOUGLAS \nHARMON,  \n \nDefendants. \n \nORDER & OPINION ON MOTION TO \nDISMISS APPEAL AND MOTION FOR \nLEAVE TO FILE AMENDED NOTICE \nOF APPEAL   \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants Parker Poe Adams & \nBernstein, LLP, Alba -Justina Secrist, and R. Douglas Harmon’s Motion to Dismiss \nAppeal and on Plaintiff Zloop, Inc.’s Motion for Leave to File Amended Notice of \nAppeal (collectively, the “Mot ions”).  For the reasons discussed below, the Court \nGRANTS the Motion to Dismiss Appeal and DENIES the Motion for Leave to File \nAmended Notice of Appeal.   \nRossabi Reardon Klein Spivey PLLC, by Gavin J. Reardon, for Plaintiff \nZloop, Inc.  \n \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A., by Robert W. Fuller, for Defendants \nParker Poe Adams & Bernstein, LLP, Alba -Justina Secrist a/k/a A -J \nSecrist, and R. Douglas Harmon. \n \nGale, Chief Judge.  \n2. On February 16, 2018, this Court entered its Order & Opinion granting \nDefendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“Judgment”), which was served \nelectronically on the parties that same day.  A written copy of the Judgment was \n   \nreceived and filed by the Clerk of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court on \nFebruary 20, 2018.  On February  21, 2018, Defendants certified service of the \nJudgment on Plaintiff’s counsel.  \n3. There is no dispute that Plaintiff filed its notice of appeal (“Notice”) less \nthan thirty days from when the Judgment was filed and served, which reads in full \nas follows: \nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA: \nPlaintiff Zloop, Inc. hereby gives notice of appeal to the North Carolina \nCourt of Appeals from all rulings contained in the “Order & Opinion on \nDefendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Pursuant to \nN.C.R.P. 12(c)” of the Honorable James L. Gale, Chief Business Court \nJudge, filed in this action on February 16, 2018, as ECF No. 55, which \ngranted Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings and \ndismissed all claims of the Amended Complaint with prejudice. \n \nThis 2nd day of March, 2018. \n(Pl’s. Notice of Appeal, ECF No. 57.)   \n4. Plaintiff electronically filed the Notice on March 2, 2018, filed the Notice \nof Appeal with the Clerk of Mecklenburg County Superior Court on March 5, 2018, \nand has since timely s erved a proposed record on appeal, to which Defendants’ \nresponse is not yet due. \n5. Section 7A -27 of the North Carolina General Statutes requires any \nappeal from this Court to be taken to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.  N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 7A-27(a) (2015). \n6. On March 26, 2018, Defendants moved pursuant to Rule 25(a) of the \nRules of Appellate Procedure to dismiss the appeal, contending that the Notice fails \n   \nto comply with Rule 3(d) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure because it does not \nproperly designate the  Supreme Court of North Carolina as the appellate court to \nwhich the appeal must be taken, and that the time for filing a proper notice of appeal \nhad expired.   \n7. Defendants addressed their Motion to Dismiss Appeal to this Court \npursuant to Appellate Rule 25(a) because the record on appeal has not been finalized \nand filed in the appellate court.  See Carter v. Clements Walker PLLC, 08 CVS 4333, \n2014 NCBC LEXIS 12, at *6 –10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2014) (discussing Rule 25 \nand concluding that “when an appeal  has not yet been docketed with the appellate \ncourt, the trial court retains jurisdiction over the case” to determine whether the \nnotice of appeal was properly filed); Ehrenhaus v. Baker, 08 CVS 22632, 2014 NCBC \nLEXIS 30, at *3 –4, (N.C. Super. Ct. July 16,  2014) (quoting N.C. R. App. P. 25(a)) \n(stating that Appellate Rule 25 “permits the trial court, upon motion of a party and \nprior to the filing of an appeal in the appellate court, to dismiss an appeal if the \nappellant ‘fail[s] . . . to take any action required to present the appeal for decision’”). \n8. On April 5, 2018, Plaintiff requested leave from this Court to file an \namended notice of appeal, supported by counsel’s affidavit and a supporting \nmemorandum. \n9. As directed by the Court, both parties submitted additional memoranda \naddressing the Motions on April 18, 2018. \n10. The Court conducted a hearing on the Motions on April 25, 2018, at which \ncounsel for both parties presented argument and submitted additional authorities. \n   \n11. The Notice does not comply with Rule 3 (d) of the Rules of Appellate \nProcedure because it specifies that appeal is being taken to the North Carolina Court \nof Appeals, which does not have jurisdiction over final orders in cases designated to \nthis Court on or after October 1, 2014.  Christenbury Eye Center, P.A. v. Medflow, \nInc., 783 S.E.2d 264, 266 (N.C. App. 2016), aff’d 802 S.E.2d 888 (N.C. 2017). \n12. The Supreme Court of North Carolina has held that “the provisions of \nRule 3 are jurisdictional.”  Bailey v. State, 353 N.C. 142, 156, 540 S.E.2d 313,  322 \n(2000).  Nevertheless, multiple opinions of the North Carolina Court of Appeals \nsuggest, at least implicitly, that appellate courts may have discretionary authority to \nallow an appeal to proceed notwithstanding a notice of appeal’s noncompliance with \nRule 3.  See, e.g., Phelps Staffing, LLC v. S.C. Phelps, Inc. , 217 N.C. App. 403, 410, \n720 S.E.2d 785, 791 (2011).  It is also clear that the Court of Appeals has not always \nexercised any such discretion to salvage an appeal in the face of a notice that fails to \ncomply with Rule 3.  See, e.g., Guilford Cty. Dep’t of Emergency Servs. v. Seaboard \nChem. Corp., 114 N.C. App. 1, 9, 441 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1994). \n13. This Court has previously held that the trial court is not vested with such \ndiscretion and is required to strictly construe Rule 3.   See Carter, 2014 NCBC LEXIS \n12, at *18. \n14. Although the Court acknowledges that its Judgment addressed \nsignificant issues that would present matters of first impression before the Supreme \nCourt of North Carolina, and that both parties were aware that any appeal from the \nJudgment would be before the Supreme Court, the Court concludes that it does not \n   \nhave authority to excuse the Notice’s failure to comply with Rule 3.  Having found \nthat Plaintiff has not met the requirements of Rule 3, the Court concludes that it does \nnot have jurisdiction to allow an amended notice of appeal. \n15. Accordingly, the Court: \na. GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Appeal and DISMISSES \nthe appeal; and  \nb.  DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Amended Notice of \nAppeal. \nSO ORDERED, this the 30th day of April, 2018. \n \n/s/ James L. Gale                              l \nJames L. Gale \nChief Business Court Judge \n \n \n \n "
