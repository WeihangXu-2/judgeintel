INTRODUCTION. \nThis matter involves a dispute between Petitioners Belinda Johnson , CPA \n(“Johnson”) and Belinda Johnson, CPA, P.A. (“the F irm”) (collectively, “Petitioners”) \nand Respondent North Carolina State Board of Certified Public Accountant \nExaminers (“the Board”). Petitioners seek judicial review of the final decision of the \nBoard entered June 23, 2016 (“Board Order” ). In the Board Order, the Board found \nthat Johnson (a) failed to comply with Government Auditing Standards (“GAS”) and \ngenerally accepted auditing standards  and failed to cause the Firm to comply with \nthese standards, (b) failed to fulfill the terms of a peer review contract, and (c) failed \nto timely respond to the Board’s staff during its investigation.  The Board concluded \nthat Johnson’s conduct violated rules and standards for certified public accountants \npromulgated by the Board. The Board imposed monetary sanctions against Johnson, \nsuspended the Firm’s registration for three years, and revoked Johnson’s certificate \nfor five years, but stayed the revocation conditional upon Johnson’s compliance with \nNorth Carolina accountancy laws and rules during the five year stay.  Petitioners \npurport to challenge the Board’s Order on several procedural and evidentiary bases. \nAccordingly, the Court must undertake a review of the Board Order pursuant to the \nstandards in N.C. Gen . Stat. § 150B -51 ( hereinafter, references to the General \nStatutes will be to “G.S.”). \nB. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND. \n1. Johnson is a North Carolina certified public accountant (“CPA”), and is \nthe sole owner of the Firm, a North Carolina certified public accounting corporation. \n \n \n2. The Board is an administrative agency created by the North Carolina \nGeneral Assembly. G.S. § 93-12. The Board is authorized, inter alia, “to adopt rules \nof professional ethics and conduct to be observed by certified public accountants in \nthis State and persons exercising the practice privilege authorized by this Chapter .” \nG.S. § 93 -12(9). The Board also is authorized to take certain disciplinary actions \nagainst CPAs, including “to revoke, either permanently or for a specified period, any \ncertificate issued . . . to a [CPA] or any practice privilege authorized by the provisions \nof this Chapter” and to assess civil penalties of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) \nfor “[v]iolation of any rule of professional ethics and professional conduct adopted by \nthe Board.” Id.   \n3. The Board also is authorized to “promulgate rules and regulations for \nthe administration of the report review and peer review requirements. . .” G.S. § 93 -\n12(8c). The Board has adopted rules that require CPAs and certified public \naccounting firms (“CPA firm (s)”) that perform audits or reviews of financial \nstatements to undergo a peer review every three years. 21 N.C. Admin. Code  \n08M.0105 (hereinafter, references to the North Carolina Administrative Code will be \nto “NCAC”). The rules provide that a peer review may be completed through  the \nAmerican Institute of CPAs ( “AICPA”) Peer Review Program or any equivalent \nprogram. 21 NCAC 08M.0105(d). In North Carolina, the AICPA Peer Review Program \nis administered by the North Carolina Association of C ertified Public Accountants \n(“NCACPA”).  The NCACPA maintains a list of approved peer reviewers who have \nmet the requirements established by the AICPA for conducting peer reviews. \n \n \n4. The CPA firm undergoing a peer review must choose an approved \nreviewer from the NCACPA’s approved list. The CPA firm and the peer reviewer then \nenter into a peer review engagement contract.  Under the Board’s  rules, it is  a \ndiscreditable act to fail “to fulfill the terms of a peer review engagement contract.” 21 \nNCAC 08N.0203(b)(4). \n5. The Board’s rules do not require a CPA firm to pass the peer review. The \nCPA firm is merely required to provide the Board with notice that it has completed \nthe peer review process. The Board does not discipline CPAs or CPA firms for failing \na peer review, but opens a disciplinary investigation case because the failed review \ncould be based on an underlying violation of audit or accounting standards. \n6. In May 2013, Petitioners engaged Tina Purvis of Hollingsworth Avent \nAverre & Purvis, PA (“Purvis”) to perform a peer review of the Firm’s accounting and \nauditing practice. Petitioners and Purvis entered into an  “Engagement for System \nPeer Review” (hereinafter, “ Peer Review C ontract”). ( Official Record 22–24; \nhereinafter, references to the Official Record  will be to “OR”). The Peer Review \nContract provided the terms under which Purvis would conduct the peer review, and \nthat Purvis would bill Petitioners at an hourly rate of $150. The Peer Review Contract \ncontained an estimate that the peer review would take 15 to 21 hours of work by \nPurvis to complete. (OR 23.) The Peer Review Contract  did not contain a specific \namount that would be charged. \n7. Purvis performed the peer review, and on  July 29, 2013, issued a \n“System Review Report.” (OR 25–26.) The System Review Report noted three specific \n \n \nareas of deficiencies that did not comply with  professional standards for conducting \naudits, including  GAS. Purvis stated that “the system of quality control for the \naccounting and auditing practice of Belinda Johnson, CPA, P.A. in effect for the year \nended March 31, 2013, was not suitably designed and complied with to provide the \nfirm with reasonable assurance of performing and/or reporting in conformity with \napplicable professional standards in all material respects. [The Firm] has received a \npeer review rating of fail.” (OR 26.) \n8. Petitioners disputed the results of the peer review to the North Carolina \nAssociation of Certified Public Accountants Peer Review Committee  (“Peer Review \nCommittee”). A panel of the Peer Review Committee met with Johnson and Purvis  \nvia teleconference to consider the dispute between Petitioners and Purvis. (OR 56.) \nFollowing the telephone conference, the panel accepted the failed peer review issued \nby Purvis. \n9. On April 30, 2014, Purvis filed a complaint with the Board alleging that \nPetitioners failed to fulfill the terms of the Peer Review Contract by refusing to pay \nfor the peer review. Johnson filed a complaint with the Board alleging that Purvis \nwas not qualified to perform peer audits. \n10. On August 14, 2014, the Board sent Petitioners a letter notifying them \nthat the “the Board has opened a new matter against your firm . . . based on the failed \npeer review that has been reported to the Board ,” and that the new c ase was being \nsubmitted to the Board’s Professional Standards Committee (“Standards \nCommittee”) for review with the other outstanding complaints. (OR 37–38.) \n \n \n11. On September 23, 2014, the Board emailed to Johnson a letter from the \nStandards Committee. (OR 27–29.) The email stated that “[t]he Board has dismissed \nthe complaint against Ms. Purvis as  the evidence documented that Ms . Purvis was \ndetermined qualified to perform the peer review services provided to [the Firm,]” but \nthat Purvis’s complaint against John son “has been held open.” (OR 27.) The l etter \nstated that Johnson had not complied with the Peer Review C ontract because \nJohnson had not paid Purvis and directed Johnson to “resolve this matter with Ms. \nPurvis on or before October 23, 2014.” (OR 29.) The letter also informed Johnson that \n“After you and Ms. Purvis have come to an agreement, the Committee will reconsider \nthis case after that date to “determine if the Board has any disciplinary interest.” (OR \n29.) \n12. Johnson did not resolve the dispute with Purvis. On August 28, 2015 the \nStandards Committee sent a letter to Johnson requesting that she submit documents \nrelated to Purvis’ peer review. (OR 101–03.) The letter also stated that the Standards \nCommittee had discovered what appeared to be a tax lien filed against the Firm, and \nrequested that Johnson provide documents and information regarding the tax lien. \n(OR 101 –03.) On September 4, 2015, Johnson sent a letter to the  Standards \nCommittee stating that she considered the requested documents and information \n“unnecessary and redundant” and “irrelevant and immaterial to this case,” and that \nthe request for information was “declined.” (OR 104.)  \n13. The Board noticed this matter for a hearing regarding alleged violations \nof the standa rds and rules applicable to CPA s including, inter alia : (1) Johnson’s \n \n \nfailure to comply with GAS and GAAS; (2) Petitioner’s failure to fulfill the terms of \nthe peer review engagement contract; and (3) failure to timely respond to the Board \nstaff’s inquiries. \n14. On May 19, 2016 , t he Board held a hearing . Johnson was not \nrepresented by counsel at the hearing, but Johnson attended the hearing, introduced \ntestimony and documents into evidence, and cross-examined the Board’s witnesses.  \n15. On June 23, 2016, the Board issued the Board Order. (OR 984–86.) The \nBoard Order : assessed Johnson a  $1,000 civil penalt y for “failure to comply with \n[GAS] and generally accepted accounting standards in violation of 21 NCAC \n08N.0409, 0403, and .0212, and for failing to cause [the] Firm to comply with those \nsame regulations”; assessed Johnson a $1,000 civil penalty for “failure to cooperate \nwith the Board in violation of 21 NCAC 08N.0206”; suspended the Firm’s registration \nfor three years, or until Johnson proved that she was in compliance with the peer \nreview recommendations ; and revoked Johnson’s CPA license for five years, but \nstayed the revocation on the c ondition Johnson comply  with North Carolina \naccountancy laws and rules during the stay. (OR 986.)  \n16. On July 22, 2016, Petitioners filed the Petition. On July 25, 2016, this \ncase was designated a mandatory complex business case by Order of the Chief Justice \nof the North Carolina Supreme Court, pursuant to G.S. § 7A-45.4(b), and assigned to \nthe undersigned Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases by Order \nof Chief Judge James L. Gale. \n \n \n17. On August 22, 2016, the Board filed its Response to the Petition . The \nparties briefed their positions regarding the Petition . On February 21, 2017 , the \nCourt held a hearing on the Petition and it is now ripe for disposition. \nC. ANALYSIS. \nStandard of Review \n18. Review of a final decision of an administrative agency is governed by \nG.S. § 150B-51, which provides in relevant part as follows: \n(b) The court reviewing a final decision may affirm the \ndecision or remand the case for further proceedings. It may \nalso reverse or modify the decision if the substantial rights \nof the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the \nfindings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: \n  \n(1) In violation of constitutional provisions;  \n(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the \nagency or administrative law judge; \n(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;  \n(4) Affected by other error of law; \n(5) Unsupported by substantial evidence admissible under \nG.S. 150B-29(a), 150B-30, or 150B-31 in view of the entire \nrecord as submitted; or  \n(6) Arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. \n \n(c) In reviewing a final decision in a contested case, the \ncourt shall determine whether the petitioner is entitled to \nthe relief sought in the petition based upon its review of the \nfinal decision and the official record. With regard to \nasserted errors pursuant to subdivisions (1) through (4) of \nsubsection (b) of this section, the court shall conduct its \nreview of the final decision using the de novo standard of \nreview. With regard to asserted errors pursuant to \nsubdivisions (5) and (6) of subsection (b) of this section, the \ncourt shall conduct its review of the final decision using the \nwhole record standard of review. \n \nG.S. §150B-51(b)–(c). \n \n \n \n19. The de novo  standard permits the reviewing court “to consider the \nmatter anew and to freely substitute its own judgment in place of the agency’s.” \nTrotter v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 189 N.C. App. 655, 660, 659 S.E.2d \n749, 752 (2008). \n20. An agency’s findings of fact are reviewed under the whole record \nstandard. Trotter, 189 N.C. App. at 659, 659 S.E.2d at 752. When applying the whole \nrecord test, “the reviewing court must examine all competent evidence (the ‘whole \nrecord’) in order to determine whether the agency decision is supported by \n‘substantial evidence.’” Sack v. N.C. State Univ., 155 N.C. App. 484, 491, 574 S.E.2d \n120, 126 (2002) (citation omitted). “The whole record test does not permit the court to \nreplace the agency’s judgment as between two reasonably conflicting views, even \nthough the court could justifiably have reached a different result had the matter been \nbefore it de novo , but merely gives a reviewing court the capability to determine \nwhether an administrative decision has a rational basis in the evidence.” Id. at 492, \n574 S.E.2d at 127 (citations omitted). “A proper application of the whole reco rd test \ntakes into account the expertise of an administrative agency.” Charter Pines Hosp. v. \nN.C. Dep’t of Human Res ., 83 N.C. App. 161, 171, 349 S.E.2d 639, 646 (1986).  \nTherefore, the Court should defer to the Board’s “unchallenged superiority” to make \nfindings of fact. N.C. Dep’t of Env’t & Natural Res. v. Carroll, 358 N.C. 649, 662, 599 \nS.E.2d 888, 896 (2004).  \n21. Here, the Court’s task of reviewing the Board’s Order is made \nexceedingly difficult  by the Petitioner’s failure to support their exceptions  with \n \n \nreferences to the record evidence, or with coherent arguments or ci tation to legal \nauthority. Petitioner’s brief consists primarily of declaratory statements that, for the \nmost part, are not linked to any particular exception in their Petition. Never theless, \nthe Court will review the Board’s critical findings of fact and conclusions of law to \ndetermine whether they are supported by the evidence and free from errors of law. \nFindings of Fact \n22. The Court has thoroughly reviewed the record and concludes tha t the \nBoard’s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. The Court will discuss \nbelow the critical findings of fact in the Board’s Order.  \n23. The Board found as fact that Petitioners’ work  was reviewed by an \napproved peer review firm, Petitioners failed the peer review, and the outcome of the \nreview was later reviewed and upheld by the Peer Review Committee. (OR 984–986, \nhereinafter “Board Order,” Findings of Fact no. 8.) While Petitioners dispute the \nfailed peer review,1 they do not di spute that Purvis conducted the review, issued a \n“fail” on the review, and that the Peer Review  Committee upheld the review. In \naddition, the record contains the System Review Report issued by Purvis on July 29, \n2013, which gave Petitioners’ Firm “a peer r eview rating of fail.” (OR 25 –26.) The \nrecord also shows that the System Review Report was reviewed and approved by the \nPeer Review Committee . (Hearing Transcript 73 –74; hereinafter, references to the \ntranscript of the Board’s hearing will be to “Tr.”; OR 56–57.) Finding of fact number \n8 is supported by substantial evidence. \n                                                 \n1 The Board found as fact that Petitioners “ have disputed the results of the peer review .” \n(Board Order, Findings of Fact no. 10.)  \n \n \n24. The Board also found that t he peer review “noted a material departure \nfrom Generally Accep ted Auditing Standards (‘ GAAS’). (Board Order, Findings of \nFact no. 9.) The Systems Review Report noted that the Firm had failed to comply with \n“professional standards, including [ GAS.]”2 (OR 25.)  The Board’s reference to \n“Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (‘GAAS’)” appears to be a misnomer. The \nNCAC refers to “generally accepted auditing standards,” 21 NCAC 08N.0403, and to \n“Government Auditing Standards,” 21 NCAC 08N.0409, both of which appear  to be \napplicable to the audit reviewed by Purvis in this case. Petitioners do challenge the \napplicability of GAS and generally accepted auditing standards to the audit reviewed \nby Purvis. Whether the Board meant that Purvis’s report found that Petitioners failed \nto comply with generally accepted accounting standards or GAS, both findings are \nsupported by substantial evidence. \n25. The Board found that “[t]he peer review report recommended that [the] \nFirm reissue the audited financial statement and reports,” but  that Petitioners \n“refused to reissue the Audit Client’s audited financial statements.” (Board Order, \nFindings of Fact no s. 9 and 10.) Again, Petitioners do not dispute that the Systems \nReview Report recommended that the Firm reissue the audited client’s f inancial \nstatements, but that Petitioners have refused to do so. (Tr. 144.)  Finding of fact \nnumber 10 is supported by substantial evidence. \n                                                 \n2 The Board’s reference to “Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (‘GAAS’)” appears to be a \nmisnomer.  The NCAC refers to “generally accepted auditing standards,” 21 NCAC 08N.0403, \nand to “Government Auditing Standards,” 21 NCAC 08N.0409, both of which appear to be \napplicable to the audit reviewed by Purvis in this case. \n \n \n26. The Board also found that expert testimony corroborated the findings of \nthe peer review that Petitioners failed to comply with applicable auditing standards. \n(Board Order, Findings of Fact no. 12.) Review of the expert’s testimony provided at \nthe hearing supports the Board’s finding. (Tr. 34 –48.) Although Petitioners \napparently now wish to challen ge this testimony, Johnson did not object to the \nqualifications of the expert witness nor to the introduction of the expert’s testimony \nat the hearing  and waived any such objection . (Tr.  33–34.) Jennings Glass Co. v. \nBrummer, 88 N.C. App. 44, 50, 362 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1987) (“[D]efendant at no time \nprior to or during the trial objected to  the testimony of [the] witnesses.  Failure to \nobject to the admission of evidence constitutes a waiver of the objection precluding an \nappeal of the matter.”). \n27. The Board Order found that “evidence presented at hearing established \nthat [ ] Johnson failed to take adequate steps necessary to fulfill all terms of [the] \npeer review contract.” (Board Order, Findings of Fact no. 11.) The evidence \nestablishes that Johnson signed the Peer Review Contract.  (OR 22 –24.) Johnson \nargues that she agreed to pay Purvis $2,500 for the peer review , but that Purvis \nultimately charged her more than $2,500 . (Tr. 139, 145, 152.) The Peer Review \nContract does not contain a specific fee for the review, only that it will be conducted \nat an hourly rate of $150 with an “estimate of hours” that would result in total fees \nof $2,250–$3,150. (OR 22–24.) Purvis testified that she has not received any payment \nfrom Petitioners for services rendered and that Johnson has refused to pay. (Tr. 79 –\n80.) Findings of fact 11 and 12 are supported by substantial evidence in the record. \n \n \n28. The evidence also supports the Board’s finding that Johnson failed to \nrespond to the Board’s inquiries and requests for documents within 21 days, including \nspecifically in correspondence Johnson sent to the Board dated Septembe r 4, 2015. \n(Board Order, Findings of Fact nos. 13, 14.) The evidence was undisputed, and \nestablished that  on August 28, 2015 the Board se nt correspondence to Johnson  \nrequesting written information regarding the fee dispute with Purvis and the tax lien. \n(Tr. 24; OR 101–03.) On September 4, 2015 Johnson sent a letter to the Board stating \nthat the requested documents were “unnecessary and redu ndant” and that the \nrequest to provide the information was “denied.” (OR 104.)  Again, the evidence \nsupports the Board’s factual findings. \n29.  The Court has reviewed the record and concludes that the  Board’s \nfindings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.  \nConclusions of Law \n30. The Court also reviewed the Board’s conclusions of law and concludes \nthat they are supported by the Board’s findings of fact  and free from errors of law. \nRittelmeyer v. Univ. of N.C. at Chapel Hill, No. COA15-1228, 2017 N.C. App. LEXIS \n178, *15 (Mar. 21, 2 017) (n oting that “findings of fact are required to support \nconclusions of law” reached by an agency). \n31. The Board concluded that “Johnson’s failures to comply with \nGovernment Auditing Standards and generally accepted auditing standards \nconstitute violations of 21 NCAC 08N.0409, .0403, and .0212.”  (Board Order, \nConclusions of Law no. 3.) These code sections require a CPA, when providing certain \n \n \nauditing services, to comply with generally accepted auditing standards and GAS, \nand to perform the services competently . As discussed above, t he record evidence \nestablishes that both Purvis and the Board’s expert witness testified that Petitioners \nfailed to comply with generally accepted auditing standards and GAS in performing \nthe audit that was reviewed . The expert witness testified at length regarding the \nspecific deficiencies in the audit performed by Petitioners. Analyzing the  record \nevidence under the required de novo  standard, there is substantial evidence to \nsupport the Board’s conclusion that Petitioners violated the provisions of 21 NCAC \n08N.0409, .0403, and .0212 and the Board did not err in reaching its conclusion. \n32. The Board also concluded that “Johnson’s failure to fulfill the terms of a \npeer review engagement contract constitutes a violation of 21 NCAC 08N.0203(b)(4).” \n(Board Order, Conclusions of Law no. 4.) Section 8N.0203 provides, in pertinent part, \nas follows: \n(a)  A CPA shall not engage in conduct discreditable to the \naccounting profession. \n(b) Prohibited discreditable conduct includes: \n . . .  \n (4) failing to fulfill the terms of a peer review \nengagement contract . . .  \n \n33. The record evidence establishes that Johnson has not paid Purvis under \nthe terms of the Peer Review Contract. While Johnson contends that Purvis charged \nher more than agreed, she admits that there was an agreement and that she has not \npaid Purvis anything. The dispute between Johnson and Purvis did not discharge \nPetitioner’s obligation to pay under the Peer Review Contract. The Board did not err \nin concluding that Johnson had violated the requirements of 21 NCAC 08N.0203. \n \n \n34. Finally, the Board concluded that “Johnson’s failures to timely respond \nto the Board staff’s inquir ies constitutes a violation of 21 NCAC 08N.0206.” (Board \nOrder, Conclusions of Law no. 5.) 21 NCAC 08N.0206 provides as follows: \nA CPA shall provide full cooperation in connection with any \ninquiry made by the Board. Full cooperation includes \nresponding within 21 days to all inquiries of the Board or \nrepresentatives of the Board and claiming Board \ncorrespondence from the U.S. Postal Service, private \ndelivery service, or personal delivery. \n \nAs discussed above, evidence in the record establishes that on at least one occasion, \nJohnson failed to provide reque sted documents and information  to the Board . (OR \n104.) The Board did not err in concluding that Johnson violated the requirements of \n21 NCAC 08N.0206. \nAdditional Exceptions to the Board Order \n35. Petitioners also raised an exception to the Board’s Order on the grounds \nthat “Petitioners were not afforded an opportunity to dispute noticed fact (s) through \nthe submission of evidence and argument, as required by N.C.G.S. [§] 150B-30.” (Pet. \n5) Petitioners made no argument in in their brief to support of this exception. Review \nof the record establishes that Petitioners were allowed to introduce evidence at the \nhearing, no evidence offered by Petitioners was excluded during the hearing, and \nPetitioners wer e not  prevented from making any arguments. This exception is \nwithout merit. \n36. Petitioners argue that the Board’s  “failure to include in the evidence a \nsubsequent peer review process” was “prejudicial.” (Pet. 6.) Petitioner’s argument \nrefers to an accelerated second peer review Petitioners completed in September 2014. \n \n \nThe record establishes that Johnson both testified as to the accelerated peer review, \nand placed in the record a copy of the System Review Report from the accelerated \npeer review. (Tr. 152, 165, 176, 178; OR 643.) This exception is frivolous and without \nmerit. \n37. Petitioners also claim that the Board hearing was “procedurally \ndeficient” because “Petitioner s received no advance notice”  of and “were not given \nopportunity to cross-examine” the Board’s expert witness. (Pet. 6.) Petitioners made \nno argumen t in their brief  in support of this exception. Review of the record \nestablishes that Johnson did not raise an objection to the Board’s expert testimony at \nthe hearing based on lack of notice or other grounds. (Tr. 33–34.) In addition, Johnson \ncross-examined the Board’s expert witness at the hearing. (Tr. 49–53.) This exception \nis frivolous and without merit. \nChallenge to Board’s Authority \n38. Finally, Petitioners make a number of exceptions challenging the \nlegitimacy of the Board’s authority, and contend that the Board Order violated federal \nand state anti-trust protections. Petitioners contend that: (a) “the Board’s adoption of \nthe Order was not a legitimate exercise of State authority, being a private action, and \n[ ] did not constitute State action” (Pet. 4.); (b) the Board Order was a “private action \ntaken under color of law” and was “an ultra vires act” in violation of Petitioners’ rights \nunder Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution (Pet. 5.); (c) the Board \nOrder was a “prohibited restraint of trade” in violation of the Sherman Act and Article \nI, Section 34 of the North Carolina Constitution  (Pet. 5.); and (d) “the peer review \n \n \nprocess employed by the Board was dependent on active market participants and thus \n[ ] constituted private action.” (Pet. 5.) Petitioners argue that because five of the seven \nmembers of the Board are licensed, active CPAs,3 its disciplinary action must have \nbeen intended to eliminate Petiti oners as competitors in the marketplace, and that \nthe Board’s action was an anti-competitive restraint on trade. (Pet’rs’ Br. Supp. Pet. \nJudicial Review 25–26.)   \n39. In support of the ir antitrust argument, Petitioners rely on  the United \nStates Supreme Court’s decision in N.C. State. Bd. of Dental Examiners v. FTC, 135 \nS. Ct. 1101 (2015) . In Dental Examiners, the North Carolina State Board of Dental \nExaminers (“BDE”), like the Board here, was a statutorily -created agency of North \nCarolina “for the regulation of the practice of dentistry.” Dental Examiners, 135 S. \nCt. at 1107 (citing G.S. § 90-22(b)). Six of the eight members of the BDE were “licensed \ndentists engaged in the active practice of dentistry. ” Id. at 1108. The BDE issued \ncease-and-desist letters to non-dentists performing teeth whitening services. Id. The \nevidence showed that the BDE intended to, and did, drive non -dentists out of the \nteeth whitening business in North Carolina by issuing the letters. Id.  \n40. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought an administrative action \nagainst the BDE for violation of federal antitrust law. The FTC alleged “ the [BDE]’s \nconcerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services \n                                                 \n3 G.S. § 93-12 provides in pertinent part that the “Board . . . shall consist of  seven members \nto be appointed by the Governor, five persons to be holders of valid and unrevoked certificates \nas certified public accountants issued under the provisions of this Chapter and two persons \nwho are not certified public accountants who shall re present the interests of the public at \nlarge.” \n \n \nin North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition.” \nId. at 1109. The BDE moved to dismiss the administrative action on the grounds that \nits actions were “state-action” immune from antitrust liability. Id. An Administrative \nLaw Judge  (“ALJ”) denied the motion to dismiss and subsequently held that “ the \n[BDE] had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law. ” Id. The \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ALJ’s holding. Id.  \n41. The Supreme Court affirmed the Fourth Circuit, holding that “a state \nboard on which a controlling number of decisionmakers are active market \nparticipants in the occupation the board regulates” may invoke state action immunity \nto a federal anti -trust claim only when two requirements are satisfied: first, the \nchallenged restraint must be clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state \npolicy;4 and second, the policy must be actively supervised by a state official (or state \nagency) that is not a participant in the market that is being regulated. 135 S. Ct. at \n1114. The Supreme Court concluded that the BDE  did not enjoy state -action \nimmunity because its issuance of the cease and des ist letters was not reviewed or \napproved by the State of North Car olina, and was not subject to active state \nsupervision. Id. at 1116–17. \n42. The holding in Dental Examiners has no application to this case. First, \nPetitioners have not raised federal anti-trust claims against the Board , and state -\n                                                 \n4 Petitioners do not contend that  North Carolina does not have an expressed public policy \ninterest in regulating the practice of public accountancy. \n \n \naction immunity is not at issue in this case.5 Second, the Board’s disciplinary action \nagainst Petitioners is subject to active supervision by the State through the very \njudicial review process invoked by Petitioners in this case.  The North Carolina \nAdministrative Procedure Act’s judicial review process constitutes active state \nsupervision by requiring this Court to substantively review the Board’s order and by \nempowering it to “reverse or modify the decision.” G.S. § 150B-51(b), (c). Finally, and \nmost significantly, Petitioners ad mitted at the hearing that there is no evidence in \nthe record that would support a conclusion that the Board Order or the Board’s \nprocedure have impacted competition among CPAs in North Carolina. Petitioners’ \nexceptions regarding the  Board’s authority and the anti -competitive effect of the \nBoard Order are overruled.  \nD. CONCLUSION. \n43. Petitioners have failed to establish that any of their exceptions warrant \nreversal or modification of the Board Order. The Board Order is AFFIRMED. \nSO ORDERED, this the 1st day of May, 2017. \n \n     /s/ Gregory P. McGuire   \n    Gregory P. McGuire \n    Special Superior Court Judge \n       for Complex Business Cases \n \n                                                 \n5 Exclusive jurisdiction for anti-trust claims brought under the Sherman Act is in the federal \ncourts.
