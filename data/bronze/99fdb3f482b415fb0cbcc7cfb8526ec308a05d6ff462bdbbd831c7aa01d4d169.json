In support of and in opposition to the Motion, Plaintiff s and \nDefendants filed numerous affidavits and other evidentiary materials. On December \n21, 2016, the Court held a hearing on the Motion. \nTHE COURT, having considered the Motion, briefs in support of and in \nopposition to the Motion, arguments of counsel, the record evidence filed by the \nparties, and other a ppropriate matters of record, FINDS and CONCLUDES, in its \ndiscretion, that the Motion should be DENIED for the reasons below. \n \n \nA. Factual and Procedural Background.1 \n1. This matter involves the building that formerly housed the hospital \nfacility in Belhaven, North Carolina and the land on which it sits (“Hospital”)2. Pungo \nDistrict Hospital Corporation (“PDHC”), a non -profit corporation owned by local \ncitizens of Belhaven and surrounding areas, operated the Hospital from 1947 until \n2011. In September, 2011, PDHC transferred control and authority over the Hospital \nto Vidant Health, Inc. (“Vidant”). In conjunction with the transfer of the Hospital, \nPantego Creek, LLC (“Pantego Creek”) was formed and the former shareholders in \nPDHC became members in Pantego Creek . Currently, t here are approximately 92 \nmembers of Pantego Creek.  Plaintiffs are members of Pantego Creek. \n2. At all times relevant to this action, Defendants were the Managers of \nPantego Creek. Pantego Creek’s written Operating Agreement  (“Operating \nAgreement”) gives the Managers extremely broad author ity to manage the \ncorporation. The Operating Agreement contains the following provisions:  \n3.1 Management. The business and affairs of the Company \nshall be managed by the Managers. In addition to the \npowers and authorities expressly conferred by this \nAgreement upon the Manage rs, the Managers shall have \nfull and complete authority, power and discretion to \nmanage and control the business of the Company, to make \nall decisions regarding those matters and to perform any \nand all other acts or activities customary to or incident to \nthe management of the Company's business, except only as \nto those acts and things as to which approval by the \nMembers is expressly required by the Articles of \n                                                           \n1 Additional factual background surrounding the disputes involved in this case can be found \nin the Court of Appeals recent opinion in Town of Belhaven, NC v. Pantego Creek, LLC, No. \nCOA16-373, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 1164 (November 15, 2016). \n \n2 Where necessary, this Order will refer separately to the “Hospital building” and the “land.” \nOrganization, this Agreement, the Act or other applicable \nlaw.  \n4.3 A. Majority of the Managers sh all be necessary to \nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Every \nact of decision done or made by a majority of the Managers \npresent at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is \npresent shall be regarded as the act of the Company, unless \na greater number is required by law or by the Articles of \nOrganization. \n3. In September of 2013, Vidant announced its intent to cease operation of \nthe Hospital in early 2014 because of significant operational losses and additional \ncapital investments that were required due to the building's age and condition. \nVidant also announced its intention to build a new 12,000 square foot multi-specialty \nmedical facility to provide medical services to the Belhaven area. \n4. In response to the announcement, Defendants commissioned a hospital \nmanagement company to perform a professional assessment of the cost to continue \noperating the Hospital. The professional assessment was completed in January, 2014, \nand concluded that continuing to operate the Hospital would require: (a) a cash \ninfusion of $3,000,000.00 during the current year as working capital; (b) a \n$9,250,000.00 loan to fund improvements to the Hospital; and , (c) Vidant to \nvoluntarily transfer all assets of the Hospital , including equipment, cash, and \naccounts receivable, to P antego Creek free of charge . Defendants determined that \nPantego Creek did not have the funds to operate the Hospital and would not be able \nto secure a loan in such a large amount. In addition, Vidant was not willing to transfer \nthe necessary assets to Pantego Creek free of charge. Nevertheless, Vidant offered to \ntransfer the Hospital to Pantego Creek at no charge. \n5. On February 25, 2014,3 Defendants held a meeting with the members of \nPantego Creek at which the  members voted overwhelmingly not to operate the \nHospital and to accept Vidant’s offer to transfer the Hospital to Pantego Creek at no \ncharge. \n6. On March 17, 2014, Vidant transferred the Hospital to Pantego Creek.  \nAs part of the transfer, Vidant agreed to pay for the cost of demolition of the Hospital \nbuilding if Pantego Creek wished to do so in the future. \n7. Vidant ceased operation of the Hospital in June, 2014. Vidant opened a \nnew 24-hour care medical facility in the Belhaven area in the summer of 2015. \n8. In July, 2015, the Mayor of Belhav en obtained from the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture a conditional commitment to provide a loan in the amount \nof $5,970,000.00 to Belhaven to re open and operate the Hospital. The fact that the \ntown had obtained the conditional commitment for a loan was published in the local \nnews and became widely known in the Belhaven community. Defendants determined, \nhowever, that Belhaven would not be able to meet the conditions for the loan, and \nthat the loan amount would not be sufficient to reopen and operate the Hospital. \n9. In an effort to find a productive use for the Hospital, Defendants \ncommissioned a professional appraisal of the facility. The appraisal was completed in \nJanuary, 2016, and contained the following assessment: \nThe building is in extremely poor condition due to both \nflooding, mold/mildew and general aging process. It does \nnot appear to this appraiser as if the building can be \n                                                           \n3 The parties differ on whether the meeting was held on February 24 or February 25, 2014, \nbut the difference is not relevant to the issues raised by the Motion. \nimproved to required standards for future use. The \nbuilding is a liability as is and should be demolished to \nallow for a different future use. The building \"as is\" is not \nconsidered in the appraisal of the land. However, the \ndemolition costs are deducted from the value of the land to \nproduce a final value. \n \n10. The appraised value of the land on which the Hospital sits was \n$1,115,000.00, but the value of the land was diminished by an estimated $450,000.00 \ncost to demolish the Hospital for a net appraised value of $665,000.00. \n11. On July 25, 2016, Defendants authorized an “Option to Purchase”  with \nStrategic Healthcare of Florida, LLC (“Strategic Healthcare” ), giving Strategic \nHealthcare until September 30, 2016 , to purchase the Hospital for $1,000,000 .00 in \nexchange for a $10,000.00 option fee. On July 28, 2016, the Defendants sent a letter \nto all members informing them of the Option t o Purchase, and enclosing a form to \nvote for or against the Option to Purchase. The members approved the Option to \nPurchase with 74 members affirmatively voting to approve the Option to Purchase \nand no members voting against the Option to Purchase. Strategic Healthcare , \nhowever, did not exercise the Option to Purchase  by the September 30, 2016, \ndeadline. \n12. On November 2, 2016, Defendants  sent a letter to the members of \nPantego Creek informing t hem that Strategic Healthcare ha d not exercise d the \nOption to Purchase and enclosing a form for the members to vote to either “approve” \nor “disapprove” of the demolition of the Hospital facility. Sixty-nine (69) members of \nPantego Creek voted to “approve”  the demolition, while only 9  members voted to \n“disapprove.” \n13. Since the vote approving  demolition of  the Hospital, a group of local \ncitizens calling themselves “Pungo Medical Center” has made two separate offers to \npurchase the Hospital. On or about November 17, 2016, Pungo Medical Center offered \nto purchase the Hospital f or $500,000 .00. On or about December 9, 2016, Pungo \nMedical Center made an offer of  $665,000.00. Both offers were accompanied by a \nrefundable payment of $1,000 .00 earnest money, and were contingent on Pungo \nMedical Center being able to secure funding for the purchases within 90 days. \nDefendants considered both offers but concluded that they were not sufficient to \nwarrant sale of the Hospital on the terms proposed. \n14. On December 1, 2016, Brandon Hayes, Beaufort County Lead Building \nInspector, inspected the Hospital. Hayes concluded that the Hospital building was in \nsuch a state of deterioration that it was dangerous and a hazard to the community .  \nHayes also concluded that the Hospital building  should be condemned. He has not \nyet condemned the building because of the TRO currently in place. \n15. On November 28, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint  and Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order  in th e Superior Court of Beaufort County . The \nComplaint raised a single cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, which Plaintiffs \npurport to raise derivatively on behalf of Pantego Creek pursuant to N.C. G en. Stat. \n§ 55D-8-01 (hereinafter, references to the North Carolina General Statutes will be to \n“G.S.”), against Defendants. The Complaint sought only injunctive relief, specifically \nincluding: (a) “a temporary restraining order requiring Defendants to cease and desist \nall demolition activities and removal of equipment and to cease engaging in any \naction that will cause deterioration of the condition of the Hospita l”; (b) an order \n“allowing Plaintiffs and all similarly situated members to rescind their vote in favor \nof the demolition”; and, (c) an order “[a]ppoint[ing] a special officer of the Court to \nconduct a membership meeting.” \n16. On November 28, 2016, the Honorab le Cy Grant issued an ex -parte  \nTemporary Restraining Order (“TRO”). The TRO provided that “Defendants, their \nagents and employees, are hereby enjoined and restrained from all demolition \nactivities and are further enjoined from any other actions which woul d cause the \ncondition of the Hospital buildings to further deteriorate.”  The TRO required \nDefendants to post security in the amount of $500.00, and set a hearing on the motion \nfor preliminary injunction for December 8, 2016. \n17. On November 30, 2016, Defendants filed a Notice of Designation of this \naction to the North Carolina Business Court.  On December 1, 2016, the Chief Justice \nof the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an Order designating this case as a \nmandatory complex business case pursuant to G.S. §7A-45.4(b), and the case was \nassigned to the undersigned Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business \nCases. \n18. On December 1, 2016, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and Motion \nfor Expenses. \n19. On December 2, 2016, Plaintiff s filed their Amended Compl aint.  The \nAmended Complaint raised the same claim for breach of fiduciary duty against \nDefendants as was contained in the Complaint, and sought the same injunctive relief. \n20. On December 6, 2016, this Court issued an Order extending the TRO \n“until such time as the Court issues an order on the motion for preliminary \ninjunction” upon the consent of the parties , and setting a hearing on the motion for \npreliminary injunction for December 21, 2016. \n21. On December 13, 2016, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the \nAmended Complaint and Motion for Expenses .  On December 13, 2016, Defendants \nalso filed with the Court sworn affidavits from 57 members of Pantego Creek, and on \nDecember 15, 2016, filed the affidavit of an additional member.4 The 58 affidavits are \nidentical o r nearly identical in substance. Each of the affiants states that they \nreviewed the allegations in the Complaint and were aware that Plaintiffs were \nalleging the Defendants had “withheld or misrepresented information pertaining to \nthe [Hospital], the closu re of [the Hospital], and efforts to reopen [the Hospital].” \n(Affs. of Pantego Creek Members  ¶ 4.)  Each of the affiants further states as follows: \nContrary to the allegations of the Complaint, I believe that \nthe managers of Pantego Creek have kept me ful ly and \nhonestly informed of all events, facts and circumstances \nregarding Pantego Creek's affairs, including but not \nlimited to the decision to close the [ ] Hospital and \nownership of the [Hospital]. (Id. ¶ 6.) \n \nAt the membership meeting held on February 25, 2014, I \nvoted to approve Vidant's proposal because I believed it to \nbe in the best interests of Pantego Creek and the \ncommunity. Likewise, I voted in favor of the demolition of \nthe [Hospital] because I believe d it to be in the best \ninterests of Pantego Creek and the community. (Id. ¶ 8.) \n \nThe Complaint contains no facts or allegations which, even \ntaken as true, would have caused me to vote differently in \n                                                           \n4 By contrast, Plaintiffs have filed affidavits from only 9 of the approximately 92 current \nmembers of Pantego Creek in support of their factual assertions. \nthe past regarding any matter related to Pantego Creek, \nnor does the Complaint contain any facts or allegations \nthat lead me to believe any actions of Pantego Creek or the \nmanagers of Pantego Creek to date have not been in the \nbest interests of Pantego Creek or its members. (Id. ¶ 9.) \n \n22. Defendants also have entered into contracts and incurred expenses for \ndemolition of the Hospital building that they seek to recoup. These expenses include \n$925.00 per day for rental equipment and $12.00 per day for fence rental that will \ncontinue until demolition and clean -up are completed. Accordingly, for every day \ndemolition activities are delayed, Pantego Creek incurs $937.00 in expense s, and \nfrom November 28, 2016, through December 21, 2016, this amount totals $22,488.00. \nAdditionally, Defendants are now faced with a signi ficant ad valorem tax expense \ndue to their inability to demolish and clean-up the Hospital building prior to the end \nof 2016. The 2016 tax value of the Hospital building was $2,743,481.00 which \nrepresented 77.2% of the total tax value of Pantego Creek’s as sets. As such, the \nHospital building represented $29,699.69 of Pantego Creek’s ad valorem tax expense \nfor 2016.  Unable to demolish and clean up the Hospital building before current year \nend, Pantego Creek will likely be faced with a similarly-sized ad valorem tax for 2017 \ndue to the delay. \nB. Analysis. \n \n23. A preliminary injunction may be issued during litigation when “it \nappears by affidavit that a party thereto is doing or threatens or is about to do . . . \nsome act . . . in violation of the rights of another party to the litigation respecting the \nsubject of the action, and tending to render judgm ent ineffectual.” G.S. § 1-485(2). A \npreliminary injunction is an extraordinary measure that “will not be lightly \ngranted.” Travenol Labs., Inc. v. Turner, 30 N.C. App. 686, 692, 228 S.E.2d 478, 483 \n(1976) (citation omitted). The movant bears the burden of establishing the right to a \npreliminary injunction. Pruitt v. Williams , 288 N.C. 368, 372, 218 S.E.2d 348, 351 \n(1975). \n24. To obtain a preliminary injunction a movant must show “a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of his case and . . .  [that the movant] is likely to sustain \nirreparable loss unless the injunction is issued, or if, in the opinion of the Court, \nissuance is necessary for the protection of his rights during the  course of \nlitigation.” Analog Devices, Inc. v. Michalski, 157 N.C. App. 462, 466, 579 S.E.2d 449, \n452 (2003) (citations omitted); accord Looney v. Wilson, 97 N.C. App. 304, 307-08, 388 \nS.E.2d 142, 144 -45 (1990).  Likelihood of success means a “reasonable \nlikelihood.” A.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. McClure , 308 N.C. 393, 404, 302 S.E.2d. 754, 761 \n(1983). \n25. In addition, the Court must balance the equities, and a preliminary \ninjunction “should not be granted where there is a serious question as to the right of \nthe defendant to engage in the activity and to forbid the defendant to do so, pending \nthe final determination of the matter, would cause the defendant greater damage \nthan the plaintiff would sustain from the continuance of the activity while the \nlitigation is pending.” Board of Provincial Elders, etc. v. Jones, 273 N.C. 174, 182, 159 \nS.E.2d 545, 551-552 (1968); see also County of Johnston v. City of Wilson , 136 N.C. \nApp 775, 780, 525 S.E.2d 826, 829 (2000)  (The Court should weigh “ the advantages \nand disadvantages to  the parties”  in deciding whether to issue a preliminary \ninjunction). The issuance of an injunction is “a matter of discretion to be exercised by \nthe hearing judge after a careful  balancing of the equities .” State v. Fayetteville St. \nChristian School , 299 N.C. 351, 357, 261 S.E.2d 908, 913 (1980).  The Court may \nexamine evidence from both parties in determining whether to grant a preliminary \ninjunction. See Wrightsville Winds Townhouses Homeowners’ Ass’n v. Miller , 100 \nN.C. App. 531, 535, 397 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1990) (“[A] decision by the trial court to issue \nor deny an injunction will be upheld if there is ample competent evidence to support \nthe decision, even though the evidence may be conflicting and the appellate court \ncould substitute its own findings.”). \n26. The Court must first decide if Plaintiffs have established that they are \nlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim for breach of fiduciary duty. Defendants, \nas the managers of Pantego Creek, owed a fiduciary duty to Pantego Creek. Pursuant \nto the North Carolina Limited Liability Act, a manager or officer of a limited liability \ncompany “shall discharge that person’s duties (i) in good faith, (ii) with the care an \nordinary prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar \ncircumstances, and (iii) subject to the operating agreement, in a manner the manager \nbelieves to be in the best interests of the  LLC.” G.S. §§ 57D -3-21(a); 57D-3-\n23; see Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C. , 196 N.C. App. 469, 474, 675 S.E.2d 133, 137 \n(2009) (manager owed a fiduciary duty to the limited liability company). \n27. Section 57D-3-21(b) further provides that \nIn discharging such duties, a manager is entitled to rely on \ninformation, opinions, reports, or statements, including \nfinancial statements or other financial data, if prepared or \npresented by any person or group of persons the manager \nbelieves to be reliable and competent in such matters and \nthe manager does not have actual knowledge concerning \nthe matter in question that makes such reliance \nunwarranted. \n \n28. On the record before this Court, Plaintiffs have wholly failed to establish \nany reasonable likelihood of success on the merits.  To the contrary, the evidence \nbefore the Court at this stage of the proceedings shows that Defendants acted \ncarefully and conscientiously in discharge of their duties as the managers of Pantego \nCreek at all times following Vidant’s announcement that it was closing the Hospital.  \nAt every turn, Defendants considered the relevant facts and circumstances \nsurrounding the eco nomic viability of the H ospital and the options available to \nPantego Creek. Defendants commissioned reports from appropriate subject -matter \nexperts and then relied upon the information obtained from those sources to make \ninformed decisions about the appropriate courses of action and recommendations to \nbe made to the members of Pantego Creek. \n29. In addition, t he vast majority of the members of Pantego  Creek have \nsubmitted sworn affidavit testimony that they were kept “fully and honestly informed \nof all events, facts and circumstances” surrounding the decisions regarding the \nHospital. Plaintiffs have offered no significant evidence that Defendants breac hed \ntheir obligations to Pantego Creek. \n30. Plaintiffs rely primarily on their claim, supported by the affidavits of a \nhandful of Pantego Creek members, that at the February 25, 2014, meeting, \nDefendants “materially misrepresented to the members that if they voted in favor of \nacquiring the Hospital, they would each be personally liable for $28,000.00 and they \nwould be personally liable if it failed.” (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 12.)  Plaintiffs \nargue that the terms of Pantego Creek’s Operating Agreement make clear that the \nindividual members cannot be required to make additional capital contributions and \ncannot be held personally liable for the LLC’s debts. 5 (Id. at 13.) Plaintiffs contend \nthat “[r]elying on these material misrepresentations, a majority of the members voted \nagainst acquiring and operating the Hospital.” (Id.) \n31. The weight of Defendants ’ evidence, however, simply overwhelms \nPlaintiffs’ claims.  Not only have the majority of Pantego Creek’s members stated that \nthey believe Defendants “fully and honestly informed” them regarding the \ntransaction, they have clearly stated that they do not consider the alleged \nmisrepresentation “material” to their decisions to vote against acquiring and \noperating the Hospital, and it would not have changed  their votes.  In the face of \nDefendants’ evidence, Plaintiffs simply have not established a likelihood of being able \nto prove  that Defendants made  material misrepresentation s in breach of their \nfiduciary duties.6  The Motion should be DENIED. \n                                                           \n5 At the hearing, the Court asked Plaint iffs’ counsel why Plaintiffs could not have reviewed \nthe Operating Agreement and determined for themselves that they were not required to \nmake capital contributions and were not personally liable for Pantego Creek’s debts.  In \nresponse, Plaintiffs’ counsel simply argued that Plaintiffs are “not lawyers” and should not \nbe held responsible for reviewing the Operating Agreement. \n \n6 In addition, each of the four Defendants has provided affidavit testimony denying that such \nmisrepresentation was made, and offeri ng the following highly plausible explanation of \nactual events: “At the February 24, 2014 (sic) meeting, neither the Managers nor counsel for \nPantego Creek told the Members that, if they voted to continue services at the Former \nHospital Building, they woul d be personally obligated to pay $28,000. 00. Instead, the \n$3,000,000.00 cash requirement from the RCHA assessment was discussed; a Member in the \naudience asked whether they would have personal liability for operations at the Former \n32. Finally, a balancing of equities leads the Court to the same conclusion. \nThe Hospital has been closed for two and one-half years.  During that time, no viable \nmeans of reopening and operating the Hospital has been found, despite efforts by \nPantego Creek, LLC, the Town of Belhave n, and concerned area citizens. The \nHospital building is now in a dire state of disrepair and has become a potential hazard \nto the community. The balance of the equities, at this time, leans in favor of \npermitting Defendants to carry out the duly approved will of the members of Pantego \nCreek that the building be demolished so that Pantego Creek can move forward with \ndetermining how it can best provide value to the community through alternative uses \nof the property. \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that Pl aintiff’s Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction is DENIED. \nSO ORDERED, this the 28th day of December, 2016. \n      /s/ Gregory P. McGuire    \n      Gregory P. McGuire \n      Special Superior Court Judge \n      for Complex Business Cases \n                                                           \nHospital Building; the a ttorney for Pantego Creek referred that Member to the limited \nliability company structure of Pantego Creek, but indicated that RCHA’s assessment called \nfor $3,000,000 in cash and that the money had to come from somewhere; and another Member \nin the audience  commented that the $3,000,000 cash requirement equated to $28,000 per \nmember.” (See e.g., Tillman Aff. ¶ 18.)
