Rash, for Defendants Sycamore at \nChristenbury, LLC and U.S. Specialty Insurance Company. \nConrad, Judge. \n1. This action arises from  the construction of an apartment complex in \nConcord, North Carolina.  China Construction America of South Carolina, Inc. (the \ngeneral contractor) alleges that it completed the project last year but that Sycamore \nat Christenbury, LLC (the property owner)  has not paid all that is due under  their \ncontracts.  The complaint includes claims against Sycamore for breach of contract,  \nquantum meruit, and negligent misrepresentation.  It also includes a claim either to \n \n* Clifton W. Homesley, Consuela Simmons, and Cameron Bray  of Homesley & Wingo Law \nGroup, PLLC represented the plaintiff at the time the motion to dismiss was filed but have \nsince been granted leave to withdraw. \nChina Constr. Am. of S.C., Inc. v. Sycamore at Christenbury, LLC, 2024 NCBC 38. \nenforce a mechanic’s lien against Sycamore’s property or to compel payment on a bond \nprovided by U.S. Specialty Insurance Company to discharge the lien.  ( See Compl. \n¶¶ 9, 31, 40, 44, 47, 68, ECF No. 3.) \n2. U.S. Specialty has moved to dismiss the only claim against it.  (See ECF No. \n16.)  Because China Construction has not filed an opposition brief, “ the motion will \nbe considered and decided as an uncontested motion.”  BCR 7.6.  The Court elects to \nrule without a hearing.  See BCR 7.4. \n3. The issue is this: is China Construction’s claim demanding  payment on the \nlien discharge bond ripe?  U.S. Specialty argues that it isn’t ripe, and the Court \nagrees.  A lien discharge bond under N.C.G.S. § 44A-16(6) “simply takes the place of \nthe land.”  George v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. , 330 N.C. 755, 761 (1992).  \n“Because the bond acts as a substitute for the land, logic dictates that the lien \nclaimant’s right to make demand upon the bond accrues at the same time that he \nwould have been able to enforce the lien against the land: at final judgment in his \nfavor.”  Id.  China Construction hasn’t obtained a final judgment against Sycamore ; \nthus, its right to demand payment on the bond hasn’t accrued yet.  (See Compl. ¶ 42 \n(alleging that U.S. Specialty is a party only “for the purpose of insuring that any \nultimate judgment resulting from this action will mandate” payment on the bond if \nChina Construction “is not satisfied directly by . . . Sycamore”).) \n4. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS U.S. Specialty’s motion and DISMISSES \nChina Construction’s claim for payment on the lien discharge bond without prejudice. \nSO ORDERED, this the 10th day of June, 2024. \n \n \n        /s/ Adam M.
