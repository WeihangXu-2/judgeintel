Defendants James Michael Griffin (“Griffin”) and Griffin Insurance Agency, \nInc. (“GIA”) (Griffin and GIA are collectively referred to as the “Defendants”) move to \ndismiss the  following claims for relief from Loyd’s  First Amended Complaint  (the \n“Amended Complaint”)  (ECF No. 29  [“Am. Compl.”] ): (1) Count II —Tortious \nInterference with Plaintiff’s Business; (2) Count III—Recission; (3) Count IV—Unjust \nEnrichment; and Count VI —Punitive Damages .  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Pl.’s Am. \nCompl., ECF No. 36 [“Mot. Dismiss”].)  Additionally, Defendants move to strike the \nlast sentence of Paragraph 11 of the Amended Complaint on the basis that it alleges \nmatters that are irrelevant, immaterial, impertinent, and scandalous.  (Defs.’ Mot. \nStrike, ECF No. 38 [“Mot. Strike”].)  \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss.  Instead, the Court only recites the fac tual allegations, taken from Loyd’s \nAmended Complaint, that are relevant to the Court’s determination of the Motion to \nDismiss.3 \n \n3 The Court in deciding the Motion to Dismiss will consider only such matters as are raised \nin the Amended Complaint filed in this case, per Rule 12(b)(6).  Anything referenced in \nbriefing by the parties, in oral argument at the hearing on the Motions, or that was otherwise \nnot contained in the current complaint on record in this matter or relevant lega l precedent \nwas not considered in the issuance of this Order and Opinion.   \n \n \n \nA. The Parties \n5. Loyd is a resident of Iredell County, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 1.)  At \nall relevant times, Loyd was an officer and the Vice President of GIA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ \n1.)  \n6. Griffin is a resident of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 2.)  At all relevant times, Griffin was the President of GIA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 2.)  \n7. GIA is a North Carolina corporation with a principal office located in Iredell \nCounty, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 3.)  \nB. Loyd’s Employment with GIA \n8. Around 2004 Loyd  began selling property and casualty policies for \nNationwide Mutual Insurance Company (“Nationwide”) on behalf of Defendants.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 8.)  At the start of his employment relationship with GIA, Loyd asserts \nGriffin intended to have Loyd “take over the business someday.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 8.)   \n9. “[A]t the direction of Defendant Griffin and his certified public accountant,” \nLoyd created Loyd Insurance Agency in early 2010.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12.)  Around that \nsame time, Loyd and Defendants also agreed to a Revenue Purchase Agreement and \nAsset Purchase Agreement (the “Revenue Purchase Agreement”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 13.)  \n“Under the terms of the Revenue Purchase Agreement, [Loyd]  purchased some of \nGriffin’s Nationwide book of business, the purpose being  to effectuate [Loyd’s]  \nultimate succession to owner of GIA [,]” and agreed to pay Griffin in monthly \ninstallments.   (Am. Compl. ¶ 13.)  Though he eventually became a partner of GIA, \n \n \nLoyd received “only limited access to the business’s financial records.”  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 14.)   \n10. In 2012, “[Loyd], GIA, and Nationwide entered into a Corporate Associate \nAgent Agreement” pursuant to which Loyd and GIA agreed to exclusively sell \n“Nationwide business.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.)   \n11. In 2018, Nationwide changed its agency ow nership policies from a captive \nagent policy to independent agencies.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 23.)  With this development, \nLoyd asserts that “Griffin realized he could maintain his role as head of GIA and \nbegan a campaign to force [Loyd]  out of the business and/or to significantly reduce \n[Loyd’s] partnership interest.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 23.)  Loyd further alleges that he was \n“forced” to merge Loyd Insurance Agency with GIA, with GIA being the surviving \ncorporation.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 23.)   \nC. The Shareholders’ Agreement  \n12. Loyd alleges Griffin coerced him into signing a Shareholder s’ Agreement \nfor GIA in or around 2018.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 25.)  Before the Shareholders ’ Agreement \nwas presented to Loyd, he asserts that he owned “approximately seventy-two percent \nof the  entire Nationwide book of business” and “produc[ed] the majority of the \nrevenue[ ]” for GIA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 26, 28.)  Nevertheless, the Shareholders ’ \nAgreement assigned 67.7% of GIA’s ownership to Griffin and  only 25.76% to Loyd .  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 28.)  Loyd alleges “Griffin told [Loyd] it was ‘[Griffin’s] way or no way.’ ”  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 25.)  “If [Loyd] refused to sign the Shareholder’s [sic] Agreement,” Loyd \nalleges, “Griffin would have terminated [Loyd’s]  employment and/or taken [Loyd’s]  \n \n \nbook of business, based on Griffin’s pattern and practice involving his other agents, \nemployees, or partners.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 25.)  Loyd also alleges that, if he did not sign \nthe Shar eholders’ Agreement, he would stand to  “lose a considerable amount of \nmoney[.]” (Am. Compl. ¶ 76.)   \nD. First Choice’s Formation and Activities \n13. In April 2015 , Griffin started First Choice Insurance Brokers, LLC ( n/k/a \nFirst Choice Agents Alliance, LLC (“First Choice”) ).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 17.)  Through \nFirst Choice, Griffin allegedly profited from “commercial policies sold through broker-\ndealers other than Nationwide.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.)  Griffin named his spouse and \nson, but not himself, as First Choice’s original  managing members.  (Am. Compl. ¶ \n18.)  Loyd  believes Griffin was not a memb er because of his “exclusivity and/or \nprincipal agent  agreement” with Nationwide prior to Nationwide’s 2018 policy \nchange.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.) \n14. In violation of Loyd’s exclusivity agreement with Nationwide, and although \nLoyd was not a member nor employee of First Choice , Griffin “urged [Loyd] to write \nand sell policies of insurance for First Choice[.]” (Am. Compl. ¶ 19.)  Loyd also asserts \nGriffin consistently “instructed [Loyd] to switch customers from GIA and Nationwide \nto First Choice” from 2015 to 2020.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 82.)  Loyd alleges that he complied \nwith these requests “[b]ased  on the long-standing business relationship between he \nand Griffin and Griffin’s past representations about leaving the business to [Loyd]  \none day[.]” (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.)  As a result, Loyd claims that these activities decreased \n \n \nLoyd’s Nationwide book of bu siness and indirectly benefited Griffin through his \nfamily.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 82.)   \n15. In 2018, Griffin simultaneously “accus[ed] [Loyd]  of neglecting his \nobligations to GIA[,] . . . [and] not producing sufficient Nationwide business[.]”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 24.)  \nE. Loyd’s Termination for Issuing Certificates of Insurance \n16. Loyd further alleges that in 2018 Griffin sought to sell GIA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ \n33.)  In January and February of 2020, Defendants received offers to buy GIA, and \nbased on these offers, Loyd asserts that he could have received more than five million \ndollars for his then-23% share in GIA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ ¶ 34–35.)  In March of 2020, \nhowever, Defendants “terminated [Loyd’s]  employment with GIA  . . . for the sole \npurpose of increasing Griffin’s . . . share of any purchase and acquisition of GIA.”  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 36.)  \n17. Loyd alleges that, before Defendants ended Loyd’s  employment with GIA, \nGIA’s Operations Manager, Jacqueline Sipe (“Sipe”),  searched Loyd’s email account \n“for ‘evidence’ [Defendants] could use to bolster [Loyd’s]  termination.”  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 37.)  Loyd claims that Sipe, “continuously sought to undermine him” and “berat[ed] \nhim at employee meetings.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.)  Loyd also alleges that “Sipe worked \nclosely with Defendant Griffin” and “maintained an improper personal relationship” \nwith Griffin.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.)   \n18. Sipe’s search yielded certificates of insurance which Defendants contended \nLoyd improperly issued,  notwithstanding the fa ct that Nationwide previously \n \n \napproved Loyd’s requests to issue some certificates of insurance for the convenience \nof certain Nationwide customers.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 38, 45.)   \n19. Although Loyd admits to issuing other certificates of insurance “without \nfirst obtaining Nationwide’s consent[,]” he further alleges  that his issuing such \ncertificates was a practice “authorized by Nationwide and not capable of causing any \nfinancial damage to Defendants or Nationwide.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 46, 69.)  Defendants, \nhowever, “claim[ ] [Loyd] had fraudulently issued or had instructed others at GIA to \nissue” the non-approved certificates of insurance.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 38.)   \n20. Following Sipe’s search of Loyd’s  email, Griffin notified Nationwide about \nLoyd’s allegedly fraudulent certificates of insurance.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 51.)  Nationwide \nthen terminated Loyd’s employment, and “suspend [ed] [Loyd’s] license to sell \nbusiness through Nationwide[.]” (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 52, 95(f).)   \n21. Loyd alleges Defendants “viciously, maliciously, willfully and wantonly, \nforced [Loyd] out of the business . . . solely to increase their share” of  the proceeds \nfrom selling the business and “used their influence and prestige with Nationwide to \ncoerce and/or force Nationwide to destroy its relationship with [Loyd][.]” (Am. Compl. \n¶ 95(e)–(f).)  Defendants offered Loyd  a severance agreement of  $800,000 for Loyd’s \nGIA stock, which Loyd did not accept.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 53–54.)   \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n22. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motions. \n \n \n23. Loyd initiated this action by filing his Complaint on 25 September 2020. \n(ECF No. 3 .)  The case was designated as a mandatory complex business case by \nOrder of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, (ECF No. 1), and \nassigned to the undersigned on 26 October 2020, (Assign. Order, ECF No. 2).  \n24. On 11 January 2021, Loyd filed his Amended Complaint.  (Am. Compl.)  \n25. On 29 January 2021, Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss.  (Mot. \nDismiss.)  The Motion  to Dismiss has been fully briefed.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss, ECF No. 37, [“Br. Supp.”]; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 48 , \n[“Br. Opp’n”]; Defs.’ Reply Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 50 , [“Reply \nBr.”].)  \n26. On 29 January 2021, D efendants filed the Motion to Strike in response to  \nLoyd’s Amended Complaint.  (Mot. Strike.)  The Motion to Strike has been fully \nbriefed.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Strike, ECF No. 39; Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Strike, \nECF No. 47; Defs.’ Reply Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Strike, ECF No. 49.) \n27. On 29 January 2021, Defendants filed their Answer to Loyd’s Amended \nComplaint.  (ECF No. 40.) \n28. On 22 April 2021, the Court held a hearing by video conference on the \nMotions.  (See Not. Hearing, ECF No. 51.)  The Motions are now ripe for resolution.  \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD ON MOTION TO DISMISS \n29. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rules”), the Court reviews the allegations in \nthe Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.  See Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. \n \n \nv. Medflow, Inc., 370 N.C. 1, 5 (2017).  The Court’s inquiry is “whether, as a matter \nof law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted under some legal theory[.]” Harris v. NCNB Nat’l \nBank, 85 N.C. App. 669, 670 (1987).  When making its determination, the Court \naccepts all well -pleaded factual allegations in the relevant pleading as true.  See \nKrawiec v. Manly, 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018).  The Court is not required “to accept as \ntrue allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. D.H.H.S. Div. of Facility \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274 (2005) (quoting Veney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th \nCir. 2002)).   \n30. Our Supreme Court has noted that “[i]t is well  established that dismissal \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when ‘(1) the complaint on its face reveals that no \nlaw supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence of \nfacts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that \nnecessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.’  ”  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC , 371 \nN.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoting Wood v. Guilford Cty., 355 N.C. 161, 166 (2002)).  This \nstandard of review for Rule 12(b)(6) is the standard our Supreme Court “routinely  \nuses . . . in assessing the sufficiency of complaints in the context of complex \ncommercial litigation.”  Id. at n.7. \n \n \nV. ANALYSIS \nA. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count II (Tortious Interference with \nPlaintiff’s Business)  \n \n31. Defendants first move to dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint for \nTortious Interference with Plaintiff’s Business (the “Tortious Interference” claim).  \n32. “A claim for tortious interference with ‘business relations’ embraces claims \nfor interference with both existing contracts and prospective future contracts.”  E -\nNtech Indep. Testing Servs. v. Air Masters, Inc. , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 2, at **14 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Jan. 5, 2017) (citing Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head & Engquist Equip., \nL.L.C., 2002 NCBC LEXIS 2, at **29 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 10, 2002)).  Therefore, the \nCourt will analyze Loyd’s Tortious Interference claim as one for  both tortious \ninterference with contract and tortious interference with prospective economic \nadvantage.  \n33. To state a claim for tortious interference with contract, a claimant must \nallege the following: (1) a valid contract exists between the claimant and a  third \nperson; (2) the opponent knows of the contract between claimant and the third party; \n(3) the opponent intentionally induces the third person not to perform the contract  \nwith claimant ; (4) the opponent in doing so acts without justification; and (5) the \ninterference results in actual damage to claimant.  United Labs., Inc. v. Kuykendall, \n322 N.C. 643, 661 (1988) (citing Childress v. Abeles, 240 N.C. 667, 674 (1954)).  \n34. The difference between a tortious interference with contract claim and a \ntortious interference with prospective economic advantage claim lies in the timing of \nthe interference.  Lunsford v. Viaone Servs., LLC , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 111, at *13 \n \n \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 28, 2020 ).  While a tortious interference with contract claim \nexists when the interference occurs after the contract is formed, a  tortious \ninterference with prospective economic advantage claim arises when someone \n“induces a third party ‘not to enter a contract with’ the [claimant] when the contract \nwould have resulted ‘but for the interference.’ ”  Id . (quoting Dalton v. Camp, 353 \nN.C. 647, 654 (2001) (internal citations omitted)).  “In either case, the interference is \nactionable only if done ‘without justification.’ ”  Id . (quoting United Labs., Inc. , 322 \nN.C. at 661).   \n35. Loyd alleges that Defendants tortiously interfered with Loyd’s  business \nrelationship with Nationwide in two primary ways : (1) Defendants “ wrongfully \naccus[ed] [Loyd] of issuing false certificates of insurance, a practice Defendants knew \nor should have known was authorized by Nationwide and not capable of causing any \nfinancial damage to Defendants or Nationwide,” (Am. Compl. ¶ 69) ; and (2) \nDefendants “caused [Loyd] to breach his exclusivity agreement with Nationwide  by \ncompelling him to write new business for First Choice ” and “compelling [him] to \nswitch established Nationwide/GIA customers to policies written by First Choice for \nother insurance brokers,” (Am. Compl. ¶ 71).   \n36. The first allegation, that Defendants wrongfully accused Loyd of issuing \nfalse certificates of insurance and that the accusations  resulted in Nationwide \nterminating its relationship with him, cannot support a  claim for t ortious \ninterference because Loyd also alleges, inconsistently, that Nationwide was aware \nand had previously authorized the practice.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 69.)   \n \n \n37. Taking Loyd’s allegation as true, Nationwide could not have been induced \nto terminate its relationship with Loyd if he engaged in conduct that Nationwide had \nalready approved.  As Defendants observed, such an allegation is not logical.   (Br. \nSupp. 6.)    \n38. Thus, Defendants’ accusation that Plaintiff was issuing false certificates of \ninsurance could not have induced Nationwide to terminate its relationship with \nPlaintiff.  See Charah, LLC v. Sequoia Servs. LLC , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *18 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Mar.  11, 2019)  (“induce” has been interpreted in the tortious \ninterference context to mean “purposeful conduct, active persuasion, request, or \npetition”); see also Inland Am. Winston Hotels, Inc. v. Crockett , 212 N.C. App. 349, \n354 (2011). \n39. The second allegation, that Defendants caused Loyd to breach his \nexclusivity agreement with Nationwide , also fails to support a tortious interference \nclaim because it does not allege th e essential element th at Defendants induc ed a \nthird-party (Nationwide) to refrain from performing a contract with Loyd.   \n40. Here, Loyd claims that Defendants caused Loyd to breach the contract with \nNationwide by compelling Loyd  to do things inconsistent with the contract.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 71.)  This allegation fails to allege how Defendants induced a third -party \n(e.g. Nationwide) not to perform a contract with Loyd, as is required to successfully \npursue a claim for tortious interference.  United Labs., Inc. , 322 N.C. at 661.  The \nsecond allegation in support of the Tortious Interference claim therefore also fails. \n \n \n41. Moreover, “[a] motion to dismiss a claim of tortious interference is properly \ngranted where the complaint shows the interference was justified[.]”  Pinewood \nHomes, Inc. v. Harris, 184 N.C. App. 597, 605 (2007) (citing Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. \nv. Hooks, 322 N.C. 216, 220 (1988)).  “The interference is ‘without justification’ if the \ndefendants’ motives . . . were ‘not reasonably related to the protection of a legitimate \nbusiness interest’ of the defendant.”  Privette v. Univ. of N.C. , 96 N.C. App. 124, 134 \n(1989) (quoting Smith v. Ford Motor Co. , 289 N.C. 71, 94 (1976)).  \n“Accordingly, . . . the complaint must admit of no motive for interference other than \nmalice.”  Id. at 134–35; see also Sides v. Duke Univ., 74 N.C. App. 331, 346 (1985).   \n42. The malice required to sustain a tortious interference claim is legal, not \nactual, malice.  Childress, 240 N.C. at 675.  Legal malice “denotes the intentional \ndoing of the harmful act without legal justification.”  Id.   “General allegations of \nmalice are insufficient as a matter of pleading.”  Pinewood Homes, Inc., 184 N.C. App. \nat 605.  The Complaint must provide “a factual basis to support the claim of malice.”  \nId.   \n43. No legal malice has been pleaded here.  Defendants ’ decision to disclose to \nNationwide that Plaintiff had issued allegedly false  certificates of insurance  was \njustified because it was reasonably related to the protection of Defendants’ legitimate \nbusiness interests.  \n44. Loyd alleges that  Griffin was an agent of Nationwide, Griffin located \ncertificates of insurance created by Loyd that Griffin claimed to be false, and Griffin \ntherefore notified Nationwide about the existence of the certificates.   (See Am Compl. \n \n \n¶¶ 9, 39, 51.)  This disclosure by Defendants to Nationwide about th e certificates of \ninsurance which Defendants claim ed to be false, based on the allegations in the \nAmended Complaint, was reasonably related to the protection of Defendants’  \nlegitimate business interest s and, o n these allegations,  no legal malice exists  to \nsupport a tortious interference claim. \n45. The fact that Defendants may also have been motivated to report Plaintiff \nby other factors does not negate their  justification for do ing so.  Pinewood Homes, \nInc., 184 N.C. App. at 605.   Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss is granted as to the \nclaim for Tortious Interference with Plaintiff’s Business.4 \nB. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count III (Recission)  \n46. Defendants next move for dismissal of Count III of the Amended Complaint \nin which Plaintiff alleges that the 2018 Shareholders’ Agreement between the parties \nsigned by Loyd on 25 June 2018 should be rescinded on the basis of alleged coercion \nand undue duress.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 78.) \n47. Loyd contends that Griffin engaged in wrongful conduct that forced Loyd to \nsign the document in question.   (Am. Compl. ¶ 76.)   Specifically, Griffin allegedly \n“expressly and/or impliedly t[ old] [Loyd] he did not have a choice but to sign the \nShareholder’s Agreement as drafted if he wished to continue working with GIA [and \nthat] it was [ ] [Griffin’s] way or no way.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 75.)  \n \n4 Notwithstanding the Court’s conclusions that this claim should be dismissed, “[t]he decision \nto dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the discretion of the trial cou rt.”  First \nFed. Bank v. Aldridge, 230 N.C. App. 187, 191 (2013).  The Court concludes, in the exercise \nof its discretion, that dismissal of the Tortious Interference claim should be without prejudice \nto Loyd’s right to attempt to reassert such claim through proper factual allegations by way \nof a motion to amend. \n \n \n48. Rescission is an equitable remedy that allows a wronged party to cancel a \ncontract.  Wilson v. Wilson , 261 N.C. 40, 43 (1964).  True coercion or duress in the \nformation of a contract may support such a remedy.  See, e.g., Hinson v. Jefferson, 24 \nN.C. App. 231, 237 (1974) (“[W]here a person has been induced to part with something \nof value for little or no consideration, equity will seize upon the slightest circumstance \nof fraud, duress, or mistake for the purpose of administering justice[.]”).  Thus, where \nduress exists, rescission results in the “abrogation or undoing of [the contract] from \nthe beginning.”  Brannock v. Fletcher,  271 N.C. 65, 74 (1967) (quoting Dooley v. \nStillson, 46 R.I. 332, 335 (1928)). \n49. “To adequately assert . . . duress, the claimant must demonstrate: ( 1) a \nwrongful act or threat; (2) that induces the claimant to make a contract; and (3) that \ndeprives the claimant of his or her free will.”  Paradigm Fin. Grp. , Inc. v. Church , \n2014 NCBC LEXIS 15, at **15 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 7, 2014) (citing Radford v. Keith, \n160 N.C. App. 41, 43–45 (2004) (internal citations omitted)).   \n50. Defendants seek dismissal of th is claim on the basis that Loyd  “failed to \nadequately plead the elements of duress, namely that Defendants ever made a \nwrongful act or threat toward him or that the circumstances otherwise deprived him \nof the exercise of his free will,” in connection with signing the 2018 Shareholder s’ \nAgreement.  (Br. Supp. 8.) \n51. Citing Housing, Inc. v. Weaver,  37 N.C. App. 284 (1978) , which relies on  \nRose v. Vulcan Materials Co. , 282 N.C. 643 (1973) , Loyd argues that duress exists \nbecause “[b]y forcing [Loyd] to sign a Shareholder’s Agreement, Defendants not only \n \n \nbreached their fiduciary duty to [Loyd], they also breached or threatened to breach \nthe parties’ prior agreements.”  (Br. Opp’n 13.)  Plaintiff’s arguments are unavailing. \n52. First, Loyd fails to allege that Griffin was either majority shareholder i n \nGIA or otherwise satisfies the factual prerequisites to create fiduciary duties owed to \nLoyd at the time of the alleged misconduct.  See, e.g., Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco \nPLC, 371 N.C. 605, 616 (2018) (“[T]he majority stockholder of a corporation owes \nfiduciary duties to the minority stockholders.” (citing Gaines v. Long Mfg. Co., 234 \nN.C. 340, 344 (1951))); see also Beam v. Sunset Fin. Servs., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 56, at \n**9–10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2019) (“[t]he standard for finding a de facto fiduciary \nrelationship is a demanding one: ‘only when one party figuratively holds all the \ncards . . . have North Carolina courts found that the special circumstance of a \nfiduciary relationship has arisen.” (quoting Lockerman v. S. River Elec. Membership \nCorp., 250 N.C. App. 631, 636 (2016) )).  The de facto fiduciary standard is a \ndemanding one to meet, and Plaintiff’s allegations fall well-short of the mark.  In fact, \nLoyd claims, among other things, that his own team at GIA “had been producing the \nmajority of the revenue.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 28.) \n53. Notwithstanding his pleading failures regarding the existence of fiduciary \nduties, Loyd may still survive dismissal of the rescission claim under Rule 12(b)(6) if \nhe alleges that Griffin  threatened a breach of contract that would “destroy [Loyd’s] \nbusiness where [Griffin’s] power did not come to him as a r esult of the contract.”  \nHousing, 37 N.C. App. at 299 (citing Rose, 282 N.C. at 666).  “A threatened violation \nof a contractual duty ordinarily is not in itself coercive, but if failure to receive the \n \n \npromised performance will result in irreparable injury to business, the threat may \ninvolve duress.”  Rose, 282 N.C. at 665 (finding that the plaintiff in that case yielded \ndue to economic duress caused by defendant’s threatened and actual breach of \ncontract, which was coercive, and where the defendant’s economic power was not \nderived from the contract itself) (internal citations omitted).   \n54. However, the allegations here are unlike the facts of either Housing or Rose.  \nIn Housing, the external source of power was the government threat ening to cancel \nthe project unless construction began, and in Rose, the external source of the power \nwas that the defendant was the sole supplier of stone in the area; in neither case was \nthe sole source of power the contract that the wrongdoer was threatening to breach .  \nHousing, 37 N.C. App. at 297–98.   \n55. In this case the Amended Complaint does not contain allegations regarding \nan external source of power that, combined with Plaintiff’s threatened breach,  gave \nGriffin means to exert duress o ver Loyd.  The Court concludes that Loyd has not \nsatisfied the pleading requirements under Rose and Housing and thus his rescission \nclaim must be dismissed.  George Shinn Sports, Inc. v. Bahakel Sports, Inc., 99 N.C. \nApp. 481, 487 (1990) (“a mere breach or threat of breach of contract, without more, is \ninsufficient to establish a claim or defense of duress.”) (emphasis added); see also \nRose, 282 N.C. at 665. \n56. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss is granted as to the claim for recission and \nthat claim is dismissed without prejudice.   \n \n \nC. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count IV (Unjust Enrichment)  \n57. Defendants next move for dismissal of Count IV of the Amended Complaint, \nPlaintiff’s claim for unjust enrichment. \n58. “A claim for unjust enrichment ‘is neither in tort nor contract but is \ndescribed as a claim in quasi contract or a contract implied in law.’ ”  Cty. of Wake \nPDF Elec. & Supply Co., LLC v. Jacobsen, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *28 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Sept. 9, 2020) (quoting Booe v. Shadrick, 322 N.C. 567, 570 (1988)).   \n59. “The general rule of unjust enrichment is that where services are rendered \nand expenditures made by one party to or for the benefit of another, without an \nexpress contract to pay, the law will imply a promise to pay a fair compensation \ntherefor.”  Atlantic C. L. R. Co. v. State Highway Comm'n, 268 N.C. 92, 95–96 (1966) \n(citing Beacon Homes, Inc. v. Holt, 266 N.C. 467 (1966), and Dean v. Mattox, 250 N.C. \n246 (1959)).  “The claim is not based on a promise but is imposed by law to prevent \nan unjust enrichment.  If there is a contract between the parties [then] the contract \ngoverns the claim and the law will not imply a contract.”  Booe, 322 N.C. at 570.   \n60. “In North Carolina, to recover on a claim of unjust enrichment, Plaintiff \nmust prove: (1) that it conferred a benefit on another party; (2) that the other party \nconsciously accepted the benefit; and (3) tha t the benefit was not conferred \ngratuitously or by an interference in the affairs of the other party.”  Cty. of Wake PDF \nElec. & Supply Co., LLC, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *29 (citing Southeastern Shelter \nCorp. v. BTU, Inc., 154 N.C. App. 321, 330 (2002)).   \n \n \n61. Loyd alleges that, “[a]t all times relevant to this litigation, Defendants [ ] \nowed a legal duty to [Loyd] to not unfairly and unduly take advantage of [him] or \ncommit wrongful acts to unjustly enrich themselves at [his] expense or at the expense \nof [his] property or financial interests[,]” (Am. Compl. ¶ 80), but that “from \napproximately 2015 to the present, Defendants [ ] unjustly enriched themselves by \nwrongfully converting, taking, utilizing or managing property and financial interests \nof [ ] [Loyd][,]” (¶ 81).   \n62. Specifically, Loyd alleges that, “from 2015 to 2020, [ ] Griffin continuously \ncompelled [Loyd] to write business for First Choice and instructed [Loyd] to switch \ncustomers from GIA and Nationwide to First Choice, [ ] decreasing GIA and [Loyd’s] \nbook of business with Nationwide, and increasing First Choice’s book of business, [ ] \nfinancially benefit[ing] [ ] Griffin.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 82.)  Loyd alleges that during the \nrelevant time period, Griffin’s wife served as the CEO for First Choice and that \nGriffin’s wife and son were two of the owners of First Choice, and therefore Griffin \nprofited, at least indirectly, from the profits received by First Choice.  (Am. Compl. ¶ \n82.)  Loyd concludes that Griffin has been unjustly enriched as a result.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 81.)  \n63. Defendants make three arguments  for the dismissal of the unjust \nenrichment claim:  (1) Loyd has failed to establish that a benefit was conferred to \nGriffin and/or GIA; (2) Loyd’s  claim is time -barred by the applicable statute of \nlimitations; and (3) the equitable doctrine of unclean hands bars Loyd’s  claim.  (Br. \nSupp. 11–15.) \n \n \n64. As to the first ar gument, that Loyd has failed to establish that a benefit \nwas conferred to Griffin and/ or GIA , Loyd has alleged enough  in the Amended \nComplaint to survive this challenge.  Loyd  alleges that , following First Choice’s \ncreation, he began to generate business f or First Choice and that, because Griffin’s \nwife and son hold officer and ownership positions within First Choice, Griffin has \n“profited either directly and/or indirectly from profits received by First Choice.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 82.)   \n65. Defendants treat this a llegation as conclusory and argue  that the Court \nshould not accept this allegation as true for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of \nthe Amended Complaint.  (Br. Supp. 12–13 n.3.)  The Court disagrees.  Paragraph 82 \nof the Amended Complaint is not merely a conclusory assertion that Griffin profited \nfrom First Choice, given that Defendants alleged Griffin’s close familial relationship \nwith First Choice’s officers and owners, and given the allegation that Griffin was the \none who “created” First Choice.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 17–18.)   \n66. Further, as Defendants note, (Br. Supp. 12–13 n.3), an indirect benefit can \nproperly support a claim for unjust enrichment.  See Lau v. Constable, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 10, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 7, 2017) .  Therefore, Defendants’ first \nargument for dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim fails.  \n67. As to the argument  that Loyd’s claim is time-barred, it is not clear to the \nCourt from the face of the Amended Complaint that the u njust enrichment claim is \nbarred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.  N.C.G.S. § 1-52.  Loyd \nalleges that “from 2015 to 2020, [ ] Griffin continuously compelled [Loyd] to write \n \n \nbusiness for First Choice and instructed him to switch customers from GIA and \nNationwide to First Choice, thereb y decreasing GIA and [Loyd ’s] book of business \nwith Nationwide, and increasing First Choice’s book of business, which financially \nbenefited [ ] Griffin.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 82, emphasis added.) \n68. At least some of the alleged wrongful conduct is claimed to have occurred \nwithin three years of the filing of this action.  Further, “ [t]he continuing wrong \ndoctrine is an exception to the general rule that a cause of action accrues as soon as \nthe plaintiff has the right to sue.”  Stratton v. Royal Bank of Can., 211 N.C. App. 78, \n86 (2011) (citing Williams v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of N.C., 357 N.C. 170, 179 (2003)).  \n“Under the continuing wrong doctrine, the statute of limitations does not start \nrunning ‘until the violative act ceases.’ ”  Marzec v. Nye, 203 N.C. App. 88, 94 (2011) \n(quoting Babb v. Graham, 190 N.C. App. 463, 481 (2008)  (cleaned up)).  “[I]n order \nfor the continuing wrong doctrine to toll the statute of limitations, the plaintiff must \nshow ‘[a] continuing violation’ by the defendant that ‘is occasioned by continual \nunlawful acts, not by continual ill effects from an original violation.’ ”  Stratton, 211 \nN.C. App. at 86 (quoting Marzec, 203 N.C. App. at 94 (cleaned up)). \n69. Because Loyd claims that Griffin cont inued to wrongfully compel Loyd to \nwrite business for First Choice and to switch customers from GIA to First Choice , \nconstituting unjust enrichment , until the year that the Complaint was filed, the \ncontinuing wrong doctrine allows this case to go forward a t the motion to dismiss \nstage.  \n \n \n70. As to the third argument, unclean hands, it would be improper at this stage \nof the litigation to determine that this affirmative defense has been established  to \nbar Loyd from pursuing his claim  for equitable relief .  Indeed, none of the caselaw \ncited by Defendants in support of their third argument for dismissal of the u njust \nenrichment claim, based on Loyd ’s alleged unclean hands, was decided in the Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss context.  (Br. Supp. 14.)   \n71. The doctrine of unclean hands is fact dependent and generally left for the \ntrier of fact to decide.  Ferguson v. Ferguson, 55 N.C. App. 341, 347 (1982) (“Whether \nplaintiff comm itted an unconscionable act and whether her actions were more \negregious than those of defendants, are questions of material fact to be decided by a \njury and not by the court.” (citing High v. Parks, 42 N.C. App. 707 (1979)) ); see also \nShaw v. Gee, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 109, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, 2018) (referring \nto the issue as a “classic jury question”), and Southeast Anesthesiology Consultants v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 137, at *78–80 (N.C. Super. \nCt. June 22, 2018).  \n72. For the reasons stated above, the Motion  to Dismiss with respect to th e \nunjust enrichment claim is denied.  \nD. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count VI (Punitive Damages)  \n73. Finally, Defendants seek to dismiss Count VI of the Amended Complaint \nfor punitive damages.  \n74. A claim for punitive damages is not a stand-alone cause of action.  Aldridge \nv. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *146 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 31, 2019) \n \n \n(“North Carolina courts have repeatedly held that ‘a claim for punitive damages is \nnot a stand-alone claim.’ ” (quoting Funderburk v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 241 \nN.C. App. 415, 425 (2015)) ); see also Thompson v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 242 N.C. App. \n523, 2015 N.C. App. LEXIS 660, at *12 (2015), Collier v. Bryant, 216 N.C. App. 419, \n434 (2011), and Iadanza v. Harper, 169 N.C. App. 776, 783 (2006). \n75. While the purported claim is defective for this reason  alone, Defendants \nmove to dismiss it  on the additional basis that Loyd  has made only conclusory \nallegations to support punitive damages.  (Br. Supp. 15 –17.)  The Court disagrees  \nthat the allegations are conclusory.   \n76. “Punitive damages may be awarded only if the claimant proves that the \ndefendant is liable for compensatory damages and that one of the following \naggravating factors was present and was related to the injury for which compensatory \ndamages were awarded: (1) [f]raud[;] (2) [m]alice[;] [and/or] (3) [w]illful or wanton \nconduct.”  N.C.G.S. § 1D-15(a).  “A demand for punitive damages shall be specifically \nstated, except for the amount, and the aggravating factor that supports the award of \npunitive damages shall be averred with particularity.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 9(k).   \n77. Paragraphs 94 and 95 of the Amended Complaint contain a litany of \nallegations that may support Loyd’s contention that Defendants co mmitted “willful \nand wanton” acts and acted maliciously.  Some of the allegations that may support \nLoyd’s contention of malice or willful and wanton acts, if proven, are: “[w]hen  faced \nwith the possible lucrative sale of the business, Defendants intentionally and with \nimproper purpose terminated [Loyd’s] employment so that he would not benefit from \n \n \nthe sales proceeds”; Defendants allegedly “den[ied] [Loyd] full reconciliation of t he \npartnership financial records and books”; Griffin allegedly “threaten[ed] legal action \nif Plaintiff did not execute a severance agreement, the terms of which were \nunconscionable”; among other allegations.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 94–95.)  \n78. Thus, the Court concludes that, while the Motion to Dismiss Loyd’s punitive \ndamages claim should be granted, it is without prejudice to Loyd’s later ability, upon \nproper proof, to seek an award of punitive damages at trial.5   \nE. Defendants’ Motion to Strike  \n79. By separate motion, Defendants request that the Court strike an allegation \nin paragraph 11 of the Amended Complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(f).   Defendant s \nargue that the allegation made in the last sentence of paragraph 11, namely that \nGriffin and Sipe maintained an “improper personal relationship,” is irrelevant to the \nbusiness dispute between the parties and should thus be stricken.  (Br. Supp. 2–3.)  \n80. Pursuant to Rule 12(f), a trial court “may order stricken from any pleading \nany insufficient defense or any redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, impertinent, or \nscandalous matter.”  N.C. G.S. § 1A -1, 12(f).  Whether to grant or deny a motion to \nstrike under Rule 12(f) is within the trial court's sound discretion.   Reese v. City of \nCharlotte, 196 N.C. App. 557, 567 (2009) (citing Carpenter v. Carpenter, 189 N.C. App. \n755, 759 (2008) (internal citations omitted)). \n \n5 While not necessary to its determination here, the Court notes that Defendants did not \nmove to dismiss Count I of the Amended Complaint for breach of fiduciary duty, (see Am. \nCompl. and Mot. Dismiss), and “our courts have allowed punitive damages stemming from \nproof of a breach of fiduciary duty.”  Beam, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 56, at **59; see also Lacey v. \nKirk, 238 N.C. App. 376, 394 (2014).  Therefore, a c laim remains against Defendants which \nmay warrant punitive damages. \n \n \n81. “Rule 12(f) motions are ‘ viewed with disfavor an d are infrequently \ngranted.’ ”  Daily v. Mann Media, Inc. , 95 N.C. App. 746, 748– 49 (1989) ( quoting 5 \nCharles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure § 1380 \n(1969)).  “Matter should not be stricken unless it has no possible bearing u pon the \nlitigation.”  Haddock v. Volunteers of Am., Inc., 2021 NCBC LEXIS 8, at *8 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Jan. 22, 2021) ( quoting Shellhorn v. Brad Ragan, Inc. , 38 N.C. App. 310, \n316 (1978)); see also Bochkis v. Med . Justice Servs., Inc. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 90, at \n*17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 23, 2016) (declining to strike an allegation where it was not \nclear to the Court whether the allegation would have any bearing upon the litigation).   \n82. It is unclear  to the Court at this stage  of the proceeding  whether an \nallegation by Loyd that Griffin and Sipe shared an “improper personal relationship”  \nis irrelevant to the other matters involved in this suit.   \n83. Therefore, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, denies Defendant ’s \nMotion to Strike on this basis.  \nVI.      CONCLUSION \n84. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART and  \nDENIES IN PART the Defendants’ Motions as follows: \na. the Motion to Dismiss the second claim for relief for t ortious interference is \nhereby GRANTED and that claim is DISMISSED without prejudice;  \nb. the Motion to Dismiss the third claim for relief for recission is hereby \nGRANTED and that claim is DISMISSED without prejudice; \n \n \nc. the Motion to Dismiss the fourth claim for relief for unjust enrichment is \nhereby DENIED; \nd. the Motion to Dismiss the seventh claim for relief for punitive damages is \nhereby GRANTED without prejudice to Loyd’s ability to pursue such damages \nupon proper proof; and  \ne. the Motion to Strike is DENIED.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 10th day of December, 2021.  \n \n \n /s/ Michael L.
