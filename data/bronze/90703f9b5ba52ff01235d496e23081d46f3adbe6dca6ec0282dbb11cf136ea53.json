THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants’ Motion for Judgment \nUpon the Pleadings (the “Motion”) .  (ECF No. 32.)  The Motion seeks dismissal \npursuant to Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rule(s)”) \nof Plaintiff Rossabi Reardon Klein S pivey PLLC’s (“ Plaintiff”) claim for breach of \ncontract and alternative claim for quantum meruit.   \n2. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court DENIES the Motion. \nRossabi Reardon Klein Spivey PLLC, by Gavin J. Reardon and Amiel J. \nRossabi, for Plaintiff and Third-Party Defendant.  \n \nBoydoh & Hale, PLLC, by J. Scott Hale for Defendants and Third-Party \nPlaintiff.  \n \n \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n3. On March 8, 2019, before this case was designated as a mandatory complex \nbusiness case and assigned to the undersigned, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and Motion to Strike ( the “Rule 12(b)(6) Motion”), (Defs.’ \nMot. Dismiss and Mot. Strike, ECF No. 6 [“Rule 12(b)(6) Mot.”]),  which was denied \nby the Honorable Superior Court Judge David L. Hall (“Judge Hall”), ( see ECF Nos. \n1–2, 7).  Defendants now move under Rule 12(c) to dismiss the same claims that Judge \nHall declined to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).   \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact on a  motion for judgment on the \npleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), but only recites those factual allegations from the \npleadings and matters of record that are properly considered, relevant, and necessary \nto the Court’s determination of the Motion.  \n5. Plaintiff is a law firm organized as a professional limited liability company \nunder the laws of the State of North Carolina with its principal place of business in \nGuilford County, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶¶ 4, 8, ECF No. 3.)  At all times relevant \nto this litigation, Amiel J. Rossabi (“Rossabi”) acted as Plaintiff’s managing partner.  \n(Compl. ¶ 4.)   \n6. Defendant Greater Greensboro Entertainment Group , LLC (“GGEG”) is a \nlimited liability company organized under the laws of the State of North Carolina \nwith its principal place of business in Guilford County, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶ 5.) \n \n \n7. Defendant N Club, LLC (“N Club,” collectively with GGEG “Defendants”) is \na limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of North C arolina \nwith its principal place of business in Guilford County, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶ 6.) \n8. Rocco Scarfone (“Scarfone”) is a manager for GGEG and N Club.  (Compl. ¶ \n7.)  Rossabi  and Scarfone have a close friendship and own multiple businesses \ntogether, including GGEG.  (Compl. ¶¶ 12, 15.)  Plaintiff has represented Defendants \nand Scarfone, individually and on behalf of entities he owns (the “Scarfone Group”) , \non various legal matters since 2007.  (Compl. ¶ 10.)     \n9. N Club owns property located at South Elm Street in Greensboro, North \nCarolina and leases it to GGEG .  (Compl. ¶ 21.)  GGEG does business at the leased \nproperty as the Cone Denim Entertainment Center.  (Compl. ¶ 21.)  In or around July \n2017, an employee of  the City of Greensboro (the “City”) contacted Scarfone and \ncommunicated the City’s plan to condemn N Club’s access easement and terminate \nGGEG’s shared parking agreement  for the leased property .  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 20.)   \nPlaintiff represented Defendants in an attempt to prevent the City from successfully \ncondemning the access easement and terminating the parking agreement.  ( See \nCompl. ¶¶ 23, 25, 27, 34, 43, 54.)   \n10. In or about l ate October 2017, Rossabi negotiated a Professional Services \nAgreement (“PSA”) with the City, which provided that the City would reimburse \nDefendants up to $45,000 for professional fees incurred in connection with the \npreliminary inspections and review of the City’s proposed condemnation plan .  \n \n \n(Compl. ¶¶ 30 –31.)  Pursuant to the PSA, the City paid , among other expenses,  \n$33,655 in legal fees incurred by Defendants.  (Compl. ¶ 33.)     \n11. Notwithstanding Rossabi and Plaintiff’s attempts to prevent the City from \nproceeding with its plan, on or about December 19, 2017, the Greensboro City Council \napproved the condemnation of the easement and the termination of the shared \nparking agreement.  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 34–35.)  Approval of the condemnation meant that \nDefendants would need to file a lawsuit against the City to seek protection against \nthe loss of the easement and the shared parking agreement (the “Cone Denim Case”).  \n(Compl. ¶ 36.) \n12. Scarfone advised Plaintiff that he would be “ruined financially” if he did not \nobtain a favorable outcome from the Cone Denim Case; however, neither he nor \nDefendants could pay an hourly rate for Plaintiff’s legal services.  (Compl. ¶ 38.)     \n13. During Plaintiff and the Scarfone Group’s attorney-client relationship, they \nused various billing arrangements for Plaintiff’s work, including payment on an \nhourly rate and  a contingency fee bas is.  (Compl. ¶ 11.)  O ccasionally, Plaintiff \nprovided Scarfone with free legal services .  (Compl. ¶ 11.)   In 2017, Scarfone “was \nperpetually late or slow” in making payments to Plaintiff  for the legal services \nprovided.  (Compl. ¶ 24.)  Nevertheless , Plaintiff continued to represent Defendants \nin the Cone Denim Case.  (Compl. ¶¶ 25, 27.)   \n14. Scarfone represented to Plaintiff that Plaintiff would share in the recovery \nif Rossabi was able to negotiate a deal with the City .  (Compl. ¶ 28.)  U ltimately, \nScarfone requested and Plaintiff agreed, that beginning on or about December 20, \n \n \n2017, Plaintiff would represent Defendants on a one-third (1/3) contingency fee basis.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 40, 42.)            \n15.      On January 25, 2018, Plaintiff drafted a written contingency fee \nagreement (the “Contingency Agre ement”) to memorialize the oral agreement \nbetween the parties.  (Compl. ¶ 48.)   The Contingency Agreement provides in part \nthat:  \n“[Plaintiff] will represent [Defendants] with respect to the [Cone Denim \nCase], with the understanding that [Plaintiff] will receive a contingent \nfee equal to 331 3� % of the amount of recovery.  The recovery shall mean \nany compensation GGEG and/or N Club receive, whether through \nsettlement or otherwise related to the [Cone Denim Case].”   \n \n(Compl. Ex. 3, ECF No. 4.)   \n \n16. On or about January 26, 2018, Scarfone received the Contingency \nAgreement.  (Compl. ¶ 51.)   Although Plaintiff attaches an unsigned version of the \nContingency Agreement to its Complaint, Plaintif f alleges that Scarfone informed \nRossabi that he signed the agreement on behalf of Defendants.  (Compl. ¶ 55.)  \n17. Defendants ultimately settled the Cone Denim Case for approximately $1 \nmillion.  (Compl. ¶ 62.)  Plaintiff alleges that under  the Contingency Agreement, \nPlaintiff earned and was entitled to recover approximately $333,000 resulting from \nits representation of Defendants in obtaining the settlement.  (Compl. ¶ 62.)  Plaintiff \nalleges that, notwithstanding the Contingency Agreement, Defendants have only \npaid Plaintiff $85,000 for the services rendered by Plaintiff to Defendants in the Cone \nDenim Case.  (Compl. ¶ 63).   \n \n \n18. Plaintiff has made repeated demands to Defendants to obtain the amount  \nstill owed pursuant to the C ontingency Agreement; however, Defendants refuse to \npay Plaintiff the total amount due and owing.  (Compl. ¶ 66.)   \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n19. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motion. \n20. Plaintiff filed the Complaint in itiating this action on December 5, 2018.   \n(See ECF No. 3.) \n21. On July 29, 2019, Defendants filed their Answer to Complaint and Greater \nGreensboro Entertainment Group, LLC’s Third- Party Complaint  asserting claims \nagainst Rossabi (the “Answer”).  (ECF No. 4.)     \n22. This case was designated as a mandatory complex business case and \nassigned to the undersigned on July 30, 2019.  (ECF Nos. 1–2.) \n23. Plaintiff filed the Answer to Third-Party Complaint on September 19, 2019.  \n(ECF No. 25.) \n24. Defendants filed the Motion and brief in support thereof on November 21, \n2019.   (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. J. Upon Pleadings, ECF No. 33 [“Br. Supp.”] ; see also \nECF No. 32.)        \n25. The Motion is ripe for resolution.  As permitted by Business Court Rule 7.4, \nthe Court decides this Motion on the papers submitted by the parties  without a \nhearing. \n \n \n \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n26. “A motion for judgment on the pleadings should not be granted unless the \nmovant clearly establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and \nthat he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Carpenter v. Carpenter, 189 N.C. \nApp. 755, 761, 659 S.E.2d 762, 767 (2008).  “When ruling on a motion for judgment \non the pleadings, the trial court ‘is to consider only the pleadings and any attached \nexhibits, which become part of the pleadings. ’”1  Cash v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo., 137 N.C. App. 192, 202, 528 S.E.2d 372, 378 (2000) (quoting Minor v. Minor, 70 \nN.C. App. 76, 78, 318 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1984)).   \n27. On a Rule 12(c) motion, “[t]he movant is held to a strict standard and must \nshow that no material issue of facts exists and that he is clearly entitled to judgment.”  \nRagsdale v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, 137, 209 S.E.2d 494, 499 (1974).  “[T] he court \ncannot select some of the alleged facts as a basis for granting the motion on the \npleadings if other allegations, together with the selected fac ts, establish material \nissues of fact.”  J. F. Wilkerson Contracting Co. v. Rowland , 29 N.C. App. 722, 725, \n225 S.E.2d 840, 842 (1976).   The Court must read the pleadings in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party, and \n[a]ll well pleaded factual allegations in the nonmoving party’s pleadings \nare taken as true and all contravening assertions in the movant’s \npleadings are taken as false.  All allegations in the nonmovant’s \n                                                 \n1 Materials that are not appropriate for the Court’s review on a Rule 12(c) motion have been \nattached to the briefing of this Motion .  However, when it is clear from the record and the \norder itself that the Court has not considered additional materials, a Rule 12(c) motion is not \nconverted to a Rule 56 motion.  Estate of Belk v. Boise Cascade Wood Prods., L.L.C. , 824 \nS.E.2d 180, 183 (N.C. Ct. App. Feb. 5, 2019).  For the purposes of ruling on the Motion, the \nCourt only considers the pertinent pleadings and attachments thereto  which are properly \nconsidered on the Motion.   \n \n \npleadings, except conclusions of law, legally impossible facts, and \nmatters not admissible in evidence at the trial, are deemed admitted by \nthe movant for purposes of the motion. \n \nRagsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499 (citations omitted). \n28. “Judgment on the pleadings is not favored by the law  . . . .”  Huss v. Huss, \n31 N.C. App. 463, 466, 230 S.E.2d 159, 162 (1976).  The function of Rule 12(c) “is to \ndispose of baseless claims . . . when the formal pleadings reveal their lack of merit.”  \nRagsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499.  “[J]udgment on the pleadings is not \nappropriate merely because the claimant’s case is weak and he is unlikely to prevail \non the merits.”  Huss, 31 N.C. App. at 469, 230 S.E.2d at 163.  “A motion for judgment \non the pleadings is allowable only where the pleading of the opposite party is so \nfatally deficient in substance as to present no material issue of fact  . . . .”  George \nShinn Sports, Inc. v. Bahakel Sports, Inc., 99 N.C. App. 481, 486, 393 S.E.2d 580, 583 \n(1990).  \nV. ANALYSIS \n29. Defendants contend that the pleadings reveal that  Plaintiff’s breach of \ncontract and quantum meruit  claims are barred as a matter of law; therefore, \nPlaintiff’s claims should be dis missed pursuant to Rule 12(c).  (Br. Supp. 6, 7 .)  \nHowever, as a preliminary matter, the Court must address Plaintiff’s argument that \nas a result of the filing by Defendants of their Rule 12(b)(6) Motion , “Judge Hall \nalready considered – and rejected–  Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss and Strike[,]” \ntherefore, this Court cannot consider this Motion based “entirely on the same legal \n \n \ntheories that were already rejected by Judge Hall.”  (Pl.’s Br. Opp. Mot. J. Ple adings \n2, ECF No. 43.) \nA. The Relation of the Rule 12(b)(6) and 12(c) Orders  \n30. “It is well established that, ordinarily, ‘no appeal lies from one Superior \nCourt judge to another; that one Superior Court judge may not correct another’s \nerrors of law; and that o rdinarily one judge may not modify, overrule, or change the \njudgment of another Superior Court judge previously made in the same action.’”  Fox \nv. Johnson, 243 N.C. App. 274, 282, 777 S.E.2d 314, 322 (2015) (quoting Calloway v. \nFord Motor Co., 281 N.C. 496, 501, 592 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1972)).  “The only exception \noccurs when three conditions are met: (1) the subsequent order ‘was rendered at a \ndifferent stage of the proceeding, (2) the materials considered by the second judge \nwere not the same, and (3) the first motion did not present the same question as that \nraised by the later motion[.]’”  Fox, 243 N.C. App. at 282, 777 S.E.2d at 322 (quoting \nSmithwick v. Crutchfield , 87 N.C. App. 374, 376, 361 S.E.2d 111, 113 (1987)) \n(brackets omitted).    \n31. The North Caroli na Court of Appeals has recognized that under certain \nfactual circumstances a party can move to dismiss the claims brought against it \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and subsequently move pursuant Rule 12(c).  Fox, 243 N.C. \nApp. at 282–83, 777 S.E.2d at 322.  Under such circumstances: \na complaint is subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) if no law exists \nto support the claim made, if sufficient facts to make out a good claim \nare absent, or if facts are disclosed which will necessarily defeat the \nclaim.  On th e other hand, a motion for judgment on the pleadings \npursuant to Rule 12(c) should only be granted when the movant clearly \nestablishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that \n \n \nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Ne ither rule \nemploys the same standard.  It is plainly eviden t under our Rules of \nCivil Procedure that because a plaintiff has survived a 12(b)(6) motion, \nand thus has alleged that a claim for which relief may be granted, his \nsurvival in the action is not eq uivalent of the court determining that \nconflicting issues of fact exist and no party is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law under Rule 12(c).  \n \nId. (quoting Cash, 137 N.C. App. at 201–02, 528 S.E.2d at 378).   \n32. However, “one judge may not reconsider the legal conclusions of another \njudge.”  Adkins v. Stanly Cty. Bd. of Edu c., 203 N.C. App. 642, 646, 692 S.E.2d 470, \n473 (2010) (citing State v. Woolridge, 357 N.C. 544, 549– 50, 592 S.E.2d 191, 194 \n(2003)).  Notwithstanding the differing legal standards appl icable to a Rule 12(b)(6) \nand a Rule 12(c) motion, one trial court judge may not “make a contrary ruling on an \nissue of law already resolved by a prior trial court judge’s ruling despite the [motion’s] \ndenomination[.]”  Robinson v. Duke Univ. Health S ys., 229 N.C. App. 215, 222 –23, \n747 S.E.2d 321, 327 –28 (2013) (holding that the trial court’s grant of summary \njudgment was improper after another judge previously denied a Rule 12(b)(6) motion \non the same legal issue); Adkins, 203 N.C. App. at 651–53, 692 S.E.2d at 476 (holding \nthe same). \n33. The Rule 12(b)(6) Motion asserted that Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim \nfails as a matter of law, specifically arguing:  \nThe first cause of action (for breach of contract) should be dismissed \nbecause it seeks recovery of a contingency fee on the basis of an alleged \ncontingency fee agreement that was not formed in the first place and \nwould not be enforceable as alleged anyway.  There was no such \ncontingency fee agreement as a matter of law, because neither client \nsigned and executed a written agreement to that effect, much less \nPlaintiff’s proffered draft contingency fee agreement, which remains \nunsigned as attached to the Complaint. \n \n \n \nPlaintiff’s second cause of action (quantum meruit) . . . fails in at least \ntwo respects.  First, it attempts to tie its recovery under quantum meruit \nto its alleged contingency fee, which legal ly was never formed and is \nunenforceable in any event for the foregoing reasons.  Second, the \nComplaint itself fails to allege any reasonable value of its services at all, \nmuch less beyond the substantial amount already paid as agreed. \n \n(Rule 12(b)(6) Mot. ¶ 3.) \n34. Now on the current Motion, brought pursuant to Rule 12(c), Defendants \nagain request that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on the same grounds: (1) that \nPlaintiff’s breach of contract claim fails because it is based on an unenforceable oral \ncontingency fee agreement pursuant to North Carolina Rule of Professional Conduct \n(“N.C.R.P.C.”) 1.5(c) ; and (2) that Plaintiff’s quantum meruit  claim must fail , \nprimarily because it is not based on the value of services provided by Plaintiff but \ninstead on the unenforceable contingency agreement .  (Br. Supp. 5 –13; Reply Br.  \nSupp. Defs.’ Mot. J. Upon Pleadings  5–8, ECF No. 46 [“Reply Br.”] .)  Defendants \ncontend in both Motions  that Plaintiff’s claims necessarily fail because Plaintiff \nadmits they are based on an alleged oral contingency fee agreement that is \nunenforceable as a matter of law.  (Br. Supp. 5–6, Reply Br. 5–6.) \n35. Defendants contend that Adkins does not control the outcome of the Motion \nor “ support Plaintiff’s conclusion that this Co urt lacks authority to rule upon \nDefendants’ Rule 12(c) [M]otion.”  (Reply Br. 2–3.)  However, Adkins “applies where \nthe legal issue to dismiss in both rulings is the same.”  Gasper v. Bd. of Trs. , 2012 \nN.C. App. LEXIS 168, at *10 (N.C. Ct. App. 2012).  While Defendants seek dismissal \npursuant to Rule 12(c) rather than Rule 12(b)(6) – thereby invoking a different legal \n \n \nstandard of analysis - and attempt to rely in part on a  document attached to the \nAnswer2, they fail to present a different legal issue than those they raised in their \nRule 12(b)(6) Motion.  Judge Hall denied the Rule 12(b)(6) Motion on the same legal \nissues, and substantially the same materials and arguments, that are now raised by \nthe Rule 12(c) Motion.  Therefore, this Court may not reconsider the legal conclusions \nof Judge Hall.  See Adkins, 203 N.C. App. at 646, 692 S.E.2d at 473.   \n36. Even if the Court ultimately concluded that it could consider the legal \nquestions raised by the  Rule 12(c) Motion, it would nonetheles s deny the Motion.   \nPlaintiff has sufficiently pled its claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit  \nand those claims do not fail as a matter of law under Rule 12(c).     \nB. Breach of Contract \n37. “An essential element of claim for breach of contract is the existence of a \nvalid contract between two or more parties.”  Kerry Bodenhamer Farms, LLC v. \nNature’s Pearl Corp., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *10 ( N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 27, 2017) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also NFH, Inc. v. Troutman, 2019 \nNCBC LEXIS 66, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 29, 2019) (quoting Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. \nApp. 19, 26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000) (“To properly plead a breach of contract claim, \n                                                 \n2 Defendants contend that the consideration of the e-mail from Rossabi to Scarfone attached \nas Exhibit A to the Answer (the “E-mail”) weighs in favor of giving this Court the authority \nto decide the Rule 12(c) Motion and establishes that the pleadings reveal that there was no \nsigned contingency fee agreement .  (Reply Br . 4 –5; see also  Compl. Ex. A, ECF No. 3.)  \nHowever, viewing the E -mail with all the other pleadings, the Court concludes “ that the \nmaterials and arguments considered by Judge [Hall] were substantially the same” as the \nmaterials and arguments before this Court.  See Smithwick, 87 N.C. App. at 377, 361 S.E.2d \nat 113.   \n \n \na plaintiff need o nly allege ‘(1) [the] existence of valid contract and (2) [a] breach of \nthe terms of that contract.’”)). \n38. Defendants contend that , because the Complaint admits the Contingent \nAgreement is unsigned  in violation of N.C.R.P.C. 1.5(c), there is no enforceable \ncontract and the breach of contract claim fails as a matter of law.  (Br. Supp. 5 –6; \nReply Br. 5–6.)  Defendants’ assertion as to the Complaint in this regard is incorrect. \n39. N.C.R.P.C. Rule 1.5(c) states that “[a] contingent fee agreement shall be in \nwriting signed by the client[.]”  N.C.R.  PROF’L CONDUCT r. 1.5(c).  Defendants’ \ncontention, if true, could render the contingent fee agreement unenforceable.   Dunn \nv. Dart, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *26 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 14, 2011) (concluding that \nany agreement between the parties was not enforceable absent compliance with \nN.C.R.P.C. Rule 1.5(e)); see also Law Office of Juliano, P.C. v. Jensen, 2015 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 190905, at *2–3 (M.D.N.C. 2015) (providing that “it would be highly unlikely \nfor the North Carolina courts to enforce” a contingent fee agreement unrelated to the \nactual work performed and not in compliance with the N.C.R.P.C.).  \n40.  But importantly, the Complaint does not admit that the Contingent \nAgreement was unsigned by Scarfone on behalf of Defendants.  Rather, the execution \nof the document remains a disputed issue of material fact , precluding dismissal at \nthis stage of the proceeding.  Groves v. Cmty. Hous. Corp., 144 N.C. App. 79, 87, 548 \nS.E.2d 535, 540 (2001) (“Judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 12(c) , is \nappropriate when all the material allegations of fact are admitted in the pleadings \nand only questions of law remain.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n \n \n41. Plaintiff alleges that Scarfone, on behalf of Defendants, requested that \nPlaintiff represent Defendants on a contingency fee basis, that Plaintiff agreed and \ndrafted the written Contingency Agreement to memorialize the oral agreement \nbetween the parties, and that Defendants received a nd signed the Contingency \nAgreement but failed to comply with its terms.  (Compl. ¶¶ 40–42, 48, 51, 55, 73–75.)   \n42. Defendants’ denials in their Answer that the C ontingency Agreement was \nnever agreed to by Scarfone,  provided to Scarfone, or signed by him, cannot nullify, \non a Rule 12(c) motion, Plaintiff’s allegations to the contrary.  See Ragsdale, 286 N.C. \nat 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499 (“All well pleaded factual allegations in the nonmoving \nparty’s pleadings are taken as true and all contravening assertions in the movant’s \npleadings are taken as false.”).  The allegations in the Complaint are sufficient at this \nstage of the proceeding to state a claim for breach of contract.  See Priest v. Coch, 2013 \nNCBC LEXIS 6 , at * 16–18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 25, 2013)  (declining to dismiss a \nbreach of contract claim on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion where the plaintiff alleged that \nthere was a writing made in compliance with N.C.R.P.C. Rule 1.5(c)) .  Based on the \npleadings, t he Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that there is not an \nenforceable contingency fee agreement.   Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to dismiss \nPlaintiff’s breach of contract claim should be DENIED. \nC. Quantum Meruit \n43. Plaintiff asserts an alternative claim for recovery based on quantum meruit.  \n(Compl. 11.)  “Quantum meruit is a measure of recovery for the reasonable value of \nservices rendered in order to prevent unjust enrichment.”  Paul L. Whitfield, P.A., v. \n \n \nGilchrist, 348 N.C. 39, 42, 497 S.E.2d 412, 414 (1998).  “To recover in quantum meruit, \nplaintiff must show: (1) services were rendered to defendants; (2) the services were \nknowingly and voluntarily accepted; and (3) the services were not given gratuitously.”  \nEnvtl. Landscape Design Specialist v. Shields, 75 N.C. App. 304, 306, 330 S.E.2d 627, \n628 (1985). \n44. Defendants make a three- part argument for dismissal of Plaintiff’s \nquantum meruit claim: (1) an  implied-in-fact contract between the parties arising \nfrom the  payments already received by Plaintiff bars Plaintiff’s quantum meruit  \nclaim; (2) the failed Contingency Agreement cannot serve as the basis for a quantum \nmeruit claim; and (3) Plaintiff’s quantum meruit  claim is not based upon the \nreasonable value of services provided by Plaintiff.  (Br. Supp. 6 –12; Reply Br. 6–8.)  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds Defendants’ argument unpersuasive.    \n45. Defendants’ first and third arguments are in large part based on \nDefendants’ contention that Plaintiff received payments in the amounts of $33,655  \nand $85,000 for services provided by Plaintiff  pursuant to an implied contract \ngoverning the parties’ relationship pertaining to  the resolution of the Cone Denim \nCase and that the total of those two payments ($118,655) is the reasonable value of \nthe legal services rendered to Defendants .  (Br. Supp.  8–13; Reply Br. 6–8; see also \nCompl. ¶¶ 62–63.)   \n46.   Based on the pleadings, the Cou rt cannot determine whether the \nContingency Agreement as alleged by Plaintiff  or some other implied contract as \ncontended by Defendants governs this dispute between the parties or determine the \n \n \nreasonable value of the services provided by Plaintiff to Defendants.  These are issues \nto be determined on a more fully developed record.  See Guess v. Parrott , 160 N.C. \nApp. 325, 335, 585 S.E.2d 464, 470–71 (2003) (providing that various factors should \nbe considered when determining the reasonable value of services rendered by an \nattorney for a quantum meruit  claim, including “the terms of the  percentage \nagreement, the nature of the litigation, difficulty of the case, time spent, the amount \nof money involved, results achieved [,] and amounts customarily charg ed for similar \nservices in the same locality.”).  \n47. Defendants’ final contention that Plaintiff cannot sustain a quantum \nmeruit claim based upon an unenforceable contingency fee agreement is similarly \nunavailing.   \n48. “Notwithstanding that an express contract precludes an implied contract \nconcerning the same matter, it is also well established under North Carolina law that \na party may plead claims in the alternative.”  Zagaroli v. Neill , 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n103, at *14 (N.C . Super. Ct. Nov. 7, 2017) (citing James River Equip., Inc. v. \nMecklenburg Utils., Inc. , 179 N.C. App. 414, 419, 634 S.E.2d 557, 560 (2006)) .  \nPlaintiff’s claim for quantum meruit is properly made in the alternative to its breach \nof contract claim.  See Clark v. Burnette, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 10, at *15 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Jan. 28, 2020) (providing that a quantum meruit  claim is an alternative to a \nbreach of contract claim); see also  Law Offices of Peter H. Priest, PLLC v. C och, 244 \nN.C. App. 53, 70, 780 S.E.2d 163, 173 (2015) ( “[A] party who seeks recovery in \n \n \nquantum meruit while also seeking to recover on an express contract should ideally \nplead these claims in the alternative in [the] complaint[.]”).   \n49. It cannot be determined at this stage of the proceeding whether or not the \nContingency Agreement is an enforceable contract between the parties; however, this \ninquiry is not determinative as to whether Plaintiff may bring a n alternative claim \nbased on a quantum meruit theory of recovery.  North Carolina courts have held that \nwhile a contingency fee agreement may ultimately be unenforceable, this fact alone \ndoes not bar a quantum meruit claim.  Robertson v. Steris Corp., 234 N.C. App. 525, \n537, 760 S.E.2d 313, 321 (2014) (“[T]he fact that an agreement for legal \nrepresentation was determined to be in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct \nand unenforceable is of no consequence where an attorney’s right of recovery arises \nin quantum meruit , because the t rial court’s award of fees is based upon the \nreasonable value of the attorney’s services and not upon the failed agreement.”) \n(quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted); In re Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, \nInc., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *23 –24 (N.C. Super Ct. June 20, 2018) (“North \nCarolina appellate courts have held that an underlying [N.C. R.P.C.] 1.5(c) violation \ndoes not necessarily bar any and all recovery of attorneys’ fees and expenses if there \n \n \nis a valid basis for recovery beyond the contract between the attorney and client, such \nas quantum meruit.”).       \n50. Accordingly, at this stage in the proceeding, the Court cannot conclude as a \nmatter of law that Plaintiff’s quantum mer uit claim fails and Defendants’ Motion to \ndismiss Plaintiff’s quantum meruit claim should be DENIED.  \nVI.      CONCLUSION \n51. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES the Motion. \nSO ORDERED, this the 8th day of May, 2020. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L.
