  "raw_text": "Justice v. Mission Hosp., Inc., 2019 NCBC 52. \n \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \nCOUNTY OF BUNCOMBE \n \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n18 CVS 1755 \nRANDY JUSTICE, Individually and on \nbehalf of all persons similarly situated; \nCATHY JUSTICE, Individually and on \nbehalf of all persons similarly situated; \nand CATHY JUSTICE, Guardian ad \nLitem for the minor child JULYETTE \nWILKERSON, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nMISSION HOSPITAL, INC. d/b/a \n“MISSION HOSPITALS” or “MISSION \nHOSPITAL”; NATIONAL GENERAL \nINSURANCE COMPANY; and \nREVCLAIMS, LLC,  \n \nDefendants. \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO  \nDISMISS SECOND APPEAL  \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nSecond Appeal, filed  July 15, 2019 (“Motion”).  For reasons discussed below, the \nMotion is GRANTED and Plaintiff’s Second Appeal is DISMISSED. \nLong, Parker, Payne, Anderson & McClellan P.A., by Robert B. Long, Jr., \nfor Plaintiffs. \n \nJones Walker LLP, by Joseph L.  Adams, for Defendant RevClaims, LLC. \n \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson P.A., by Robert W. Fuller and Mark A. \nHiller, and Roberts & Stevens P.A., by Phillip T. Jackson and Eric P. \nEdgerton, for Defendant Mission Hospital, Inc. \n \nShumaker, Loop & Kendrick LLP, by Christian H. Staples, J. Bennett \nCrites, III, and Laura Johnson Evans, for Defendant RevClaims, LLC. \n \n \n \n \nYoung Moore & Henderson P.A., by Glenn C. Raynor , Walter E. Brock, \nJr., and Angela Farag Craddock , for Defendant National General \nInsurance Company. \n \nGale, Judge. \n \n2.  On March 27, 2019, this Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  (Order \n& Opinion Mots. Dismiss, ECF No. 54.)  On April 10, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a timely \nNotice of Appeal seeking a review of the Court’s March 27 Order (“First Appeal”).  \n(Pls.’ Notice Appeal  Final J. , ECF No. 56 .)  On June 5, 2019, this Court  granted \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ First Appeal because the Notice of Appeal \nwas addressed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals rather than the North Carolina \nSupreme Court and was, therefore, jurisdictionally defective.  (Order & Opinion Mot. \nDismiss Appeal & Mot. Leave File Am. Notice Appeal, ECF No. 69.)  On July 3, 2019, \nPlaintiffs timely filed their Notice of Appeal seeking review of the Court’s  June 5 \nOrder (“Second Appeal”).  ( Pls.’ Notice Appeal, ECF No. 70.)   The Motion seeks to \ndismiss the Second Appeal. \n3. The Motion has been fully briefed.  The Court elects to decide the Motion \non the record and briefs without oral argument.  See BCR 7.4.  \n4. Plaintiffs oppose the Motion based on their argument that a trial court \nhas no authority under N.C. Rule of  Appellate Procedure 25 (“ App. Rule 25”) to \ndismiss a second appeal that seeks appellate review of its earlier order dismissing a \nfirst appeal.  The Court concludes that it has the authority under Rule 25 and that it \nmust dismiss the Second Appeal.   \n \n \n \n5.  In E. Brooks Wilkins Family Medicine, P.A. v. WakeMed, the trial court \nissued several orders adverse to the plaintiff, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal \nthirty-three days thereafter, and the trial court dismissed the appeal as untimely.  \n244 N.C. App. 567, 576–77, 784 S.E.2d 178, 18 4–85 (2016), disc. review denied, 369 \nN.C. 524, 797 S.E.2d 18 (2017) .  The WakeMed plaintiff then filed a notice of appeal \nfrom the court’s appeal dismissal order and filed an alternative motion seeking review \nby certiorari if the notice of appeal was untimely. \n6.  The Court of Appeals , having acknowledged a split in its opinions on \nwhether an appeal will lie from a trial court order dismissing an appeal because of an \nuntimely notice of appeal, elected to follow its earlier precedent holding the Court of \nAppeals has no jurisdiction and  that there is no proper appeal  before the Court of \nAppeals by reason of a notice of appeal from a trial court order dismissing an appeal.  \nId.  The Court of Appeals further held tha t if a writ of certiorari had been properly \nsought the writ should be denied because the trial court correctly dismissed the \nappeal as untimely.  Id.   \n7. The Court of Appeals later followed this holding in In re Estate of Cooke \nwhen dismissing an appeal initiated by a notice of appeal of the trial court’s order \ndismissing an appeal for untimely action.  No. COA17-948, 2018 N.C. App. LEXIS \n336, at *2–3 (N.C. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2018).  The Court of Appeals reiterated that it is \nnot vested with jurisdiction by reason of a notice of appeal from an order dismissing \nan appeal.  Id. at *3. \n \n \n \n8.  Plaintiffs argue, nevertheless, that this Court is without power to grant \nthe Motion because App. Rule 25 is limited to those instances where the appellant \nhas failed to take timely action, and, here, the notice of appeal to institute the Second \nAppeal was unquestionably timely .  Yet Plaintiffs’ argument is premised on its \ncontention that its notice of appeal  supports appellate jurisdiction.  There being no \ncontrary precedent from the North Carolina Supreme Court, t his Court is bound to \nfollow the  most recent precedent of the Court of Appeals which holds that such a  \nnotice of appeal does not vest appellate jurisdiction.   \n9. As to Plaintiffs’ argu ment that App. Rule 25 is limited to instances \nwhere a notice of appeal is untimely, the Court  follows its determination in Zloop, \nInc. v. Parker Poe Adams & Bernstein , LLP, that, where a record on appeal has not \nbeen filed, the trial court has power to dismiss a timely notice of appeal that is \njurisdictionally defective.  2018 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *4 –5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, \n2018). \n10. Accordingly, the Second Appeal is improper and should be and is \nDISMISSED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this the 21st day of August, 2019. \n \n \n \n /s/ James L. Gale \n James L. Gale \n Senior Business Court Judge \n "
