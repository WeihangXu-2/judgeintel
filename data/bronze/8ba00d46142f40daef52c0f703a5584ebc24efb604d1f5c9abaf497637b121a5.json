Barringer, for Defendant. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \nI. INTRODUCTION \n2. This litigation arises out of  a dispute between two developers of solar \nenergy projects over the parties’ obligations in connection with the purchase and sale \nof two solar energy projects in northeastern North Carolina and a tax equi ty \ntransaction involving a third solar energy project.   Plaintiff Recurrent Energy \nDevelopment Holdings, LLC (“Recurrent”) sought to purchase, and Defendant \n \n \nSunEnergy1, LLC (“SunEnergy”) sought to sell, two solar energy projects.  Recurrent \nand SunEnergy entered into a Confidential Letter of Intent (“LOI”) pursuant to which \nRecurrent paid SunEnergy for the exclusive rights to purchase the projects and \nmarket the projects’ power, and SunEnergy agreed to a timeline by which it was to \ndevelop the proje cts.  In addition, the parties expressly agreed to negotiate in good \nfaith for Recurrent to make a tax equity investment in a third solar energy project \nthat SunEnergy was developing , and SunEnergy agreed to reimburse Recurrent for \nits costs and expenses i ncurred in connection with the negotiation of the tax equity \ntransaction. \n3. Recurrent initiated this action alleging that SunEnergy failed to develop \nthe projects in accordance with the deadlines set forth in the LOI and failed to \nreimburse Recurrent for its  costs and expenses incurred in connection with the tax \nequity transaction.  SunEnergy filed a counterclaim alleging that Recurrent breached \nits obligation under the LOI to negotiate the tax equity transaction in good faith.        \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  E.g., In re Estate of Pope , 192 N.C. App. 321, 329, 666 S.E.2d \n140, 147 (2008).  The following factual background, taken from the undisputed \nevidence submitted in support of and in opposition to the Motions, is intended solely \nto provide context for the Court’s analysis and ruling. \n \n  \n \n \nA. The Parties \n5. Recurrent is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal office \nin San Francisco, California.  (SunEnergy, LLC’s First Am. Answer & Countercl. 10, \n¶ 2, ECF No. 28 [“Answer”]; Answer to Countercl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 39 [“Reply”].)   \nRecurrent develops solar energy projects and sells the solar power to third parties.   \n(Answer 10, ¶ 2; Reply ¶ 2; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Def.’s Mot. Partial Summ. J. [“Pl.’s Resp. \nOpp’n”] Ex. 2, at 56:3−6, ECF No. 82.1.)    \n6. SunEnergy is a North Carolina limited liability company with its principal \nplace of business in Mooresville, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 8; Answer \n2, ¶ 2.)  SunEnergy de velops and builds solar energy projects through out North \nCarolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 2; Answer 2, ¶ 2.)  \nB. LOI \n7. In or around December 2015, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“Amazon”) issued \na request for proposal (“RFP”) to Recurrent and others soliciting the sale of solar \npower from an area of the United States known as the “PJM” region, which includes \na small part of northeastern North Carolina.  (SunEnergy’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Partial \nSumm. J. [“Def.’s Mem. Supp.”] Tab 1, at 45:9−25, ECF No. 89; SunEnergy’s Mem. \nOpp’n Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. [“Def.’s Mem. Opp’n”] Tab 2, at 43:5−14, ECF No. 78; see \nDef.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 33, ECF No. 55.)  A response to the RFP needed to identify \nsolar project site(s) that the bidder sought to use in generating powe r and the price \nat which it would sell that power to Amazon.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Tab 1, at 52:1−12.)  \n \n \nAmazon would then shortlist a few of the  proposals from which it would ultimately \nmake its final decision.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Tab 1, at 53:19−25.)   \n8. Recurrent did not have its own solar energy sites in the PJM region that it \ncould submit in response to the Amazon RFP.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 2, at 46:14−18.)  \nAs a result, Recurrent sought to acquire sites in the PJM region from a third party \nthat it could include in its response to the Amazon RFP, which was due on February \n11, 2016.   (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Exs. 33, 50; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n  Tab 2, at \n44:25−45:8, 46:14−18 .)  On December 7, 2015, Cassidy Deline (“Deline” ), who le d \nRecurrent’s mergers and acquisi tions team, contacted SunEnergy and inquired \nwhether it had any projects available for acquisition.   (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. \n33.) \n9. Following negotiations, on February 11, 2016 (the same day as the deadline \nfor Recurrent’s submission to Amazon), Recurrent and SunEnergy executed the LOI.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 4; Answer 3, ¶ 4.)  The LOI set forth the parties’ agreement on certain \nmatters pending consummation of a proposed transaction whereby Recurrent would \nbuy, and SunEnergy would sell, all of the assets necessary for the development of one \nor two 80 megawatt (alternating current) (“MWac”) solar energy projects within the \nPJM region in North Carolina, one in Bertie County (“Earleys”) and one in Gates \nCounty (“Haslett”) (the “Project(s)”), and, if applicable, the replacement project(s) (the \n“Proposed Transaction”).  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1 [“LOI”], ¶ B, Sched. \n1.)  The LOI specifically identified three additional projects with the same MWac \ncapacity as the Projects  (the “Replacement Project( s)”): Moyock Solar, LLC \n \n \n(“Moyock”); Shawboro East Ridge Solar, LLC (“Shawboro”); and Hobbsville Solar, \nLLC (“Hobbsville”).  (LOI Annex C.)     \n10. Under the terms of the LOI, Recurrent could pay $2 million to SunEnergy \nin connection with each Project (the “Exclusivity Payment”) to secure a twelve-month \nexclusivity period during which SunEnergy agreed not to engage in any activity that \nwould effect a disposition of the Projects or the “Project Assets,” which is defined as \n“all assets necessary for the developmen t of one or both of the Projects and, as \napplicable, the Replacement Project(s)[.]”  (LOI ¶¶ B, 1.) \n11. For each Project, the LOI set forth target development milestone deadlines \nby which SunEnergy was to achieve certain objectives in developing the Projects (the \n“TDM”).  (LOI ¶ 3, Annex B.)   With respect to both Projects, the TDM required \nissuance of discretionary permits by August 30, 2016.  (LOI Annex B.)  The Earleys \nTDM required complete wetlands delineation by April 30, 2016.  (LOI Annex B.)  \n12. Paragraph 3 provided that  \n[i]n the event that [SunEnergy] fails to achieve the [TDM] for a \nProject . . . , [Recurrent] shall have the right, by written election to \n[SunEnergy], to purchase all of the assets necessary to develop, \nconstruct and operate [a Replacement Project].  [SunEnergy] shall \nprovide said Replacement Project, which shall be chosen at [Recurrent]’s \nsole discretion, to [Recurrent] within 5 business days of [Recurrent]’s \nwritten election. \n \n(LOI ¶ 3.)  SunEnergy was required to “make additional projects  available as \nReplacement Projects” once it identified such projects.  (LOI Annex C n.10.)  \nSunEnergy agreed that it “will not dispose, agree to dispose, or grant exclusivity for \nthe disposition of any Replacement Project set forth in Annex C  . . . as of t he date \n \n \nhereof to a third party until the [TDM] for wetlands delineation for each Project has \nbeen achieved.”  (LOI ¶ 3.)  \n13. Paragraph 3 of the LOI also provided that SunEnergy  \nagrees to (i) negotiate in good faith and use reasonable efforts to cause \nsuch d efinitive documents (the “Definitive Agreements”) as may be \nrequired to consummate the Proposed Transaction  . . . with a goal of \nexecuting such Definitive Agreements on or before the expiration of the \nExclusivity Period . . . ; (ii) cooperate with [Recurrent] in providing such \ninformation and supplying such assistance as may be reasonably \nrequested by [Recurrent] in connection with [Recurrent]’s development \nactivities relating to the Projects; (iii) preserve, protect, manage, develop \nand operate the Project s in a reasonable and prudent manner in \naccordance with all applicable laws and regulations and in accordance \nwith the [TDM]; (iv) consult with and cooperate in good faith with \n[Recurrent] on all material decisions relating to the Projects; and (v) use \ncommercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents or approvals \nrequired in connection with the Proposed Transaction in accordance \nwith the [TDM] . . . . \n \n(LOI ¶ 3.)   \n14. The Exclusivity Payment was non -refundable, except for several \nspecifically described circumstances set forth in paragraph 4.  (LOI ¶ 4a.)  Paragraph \n4b of the LOI provided that if SunEnergy “fails to achieve the [TDM] for a \nProject . . . due to a wetlands issue with such Project, then 100% of the Exclusivity \nPayment for the applicable Proje ct will be refunded to [Recurrent] within sixty (60) \ndays of the date of [Recurrent]’s written election.”  (LOI ¶ 4b.)  Paragraph 4c of the \nLOI stated that  \n[i]n the event [SunEnergy] fails to provide a Replacement Project as \nprovided in [paragraph] 3 with the same MWac capacity as the original \nProject, then 37.5% of the Exclusivity Payment for the applicable Project \nwill be refunded to [Recurrent] within sixty (60) days of the date of \n[Recurrent]’s written election. \n \n \n \n(LOI ¶ 4c.)     \n15. In addition to the prov isions concerning the Projects and the Proposed \nTransaction, the LOI contained a provision regarding a potential tax equity \ntransaction (the “Tax Equity Provision”).  (LOI ¶ 14.)  The Tax Equity Provision \nstated that Recurrent and SunEnergy “shall use best efforts to negotiate in good faith \nfor [R ecurrent] to provide a 2016 tax -equity investment in the Williamson [sic] \nSpeight solar photovoltaic project being developed and constructed by [SunEnergy] \nin Martin County” (the “Tax Equity Transaction”).  (LOI ¶ 14.)  \nC. Amazon and Nestlé Bids \n16. On February 11, 2016, Recurrent made a $2 million Exclusivity Payment \nto SunEnergy for Earleys (the “Earleys Exclusivity Payment”) and a $2 million \nExclusivity Payment to SunEnergy for Haslett (the “Haslett Exclusivity Payment” ).  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 10; Answer 3, ¶ 10.)  \n17. Also on February 11, 2016, Recurrent submitted its response to the Amazon \nRFP, bidding the Earleys and Haslett solar project sites  and the power those sites \nwere estimated to generate.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 52; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, \nat 54:21−24.)   In order to determine the pricing for Earleys and Haslett that \nRecurrent proposed in its bid to Amazon, Recurrent created financial models for both \nthe Earleys and Haslett sites using a variety of assumptions and site-specific inputs.  \n(Def.’s Mem. Supp. Tab 1, at 52:13−53:12; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 3, at 136:1−3; Def.’s \nMem. Opp’n Tab 12, at 59:13−60:1.)  Based on these financial models, the pricing of \n \n \npower generated at Earleys priced lower than the power generated at Haslett.  (Def.’s \nMem. Opp’n Tab 12, at 34:18−21; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 119:6−8.)   \n18. Recurrent, however, was concerned that SunEnergy would not be able to \ndevelop Earleys due to a wetlands issue on the site and, as a result, that Recurrent \nwould not be able to deliver power at the Earleys pricing to Amazon if Recurrent won \nthe bid.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 51, at REDH-00012350; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, \nat 119:8−21.)  Because of these concerns, Recurrent did not want Amazon to shortlist \nonly the Earleys project.   (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 51, at REDH -00012350; Pl.’s \nResp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 120:1−12.)   In order to avoid this outcome, Recurrent made \nEarleys less competitive by submitting a bid that set pricing for electricity produced \nat Earleys slightly higher than the pricing for electricity produced at Haslett.  (Def.’s \nMem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 51, at REDH -00012350; Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 52, at \nREDH-00013254; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 120:1−6; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 12, at \n34:18−35:2.)      \n19. On March 4, 2016, SunEnergy gave Recurrent access to data for the \nReplacement Projects , and Recurrent began conducting due diligence on the \nReplacement Projects.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 57; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. \nJ. [“Pl.’s Mem. Supp.”] Ex. 32, ECF No. 58.1.)   Early in its due diligence, Recurrent \nlearned that two of the Replacement Projects, Shawboro and Hobbsville,  also had \nwetlands issues.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 32−33;  Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 5, at \n166:23−167:12.)  As a result, Recurrent focused its due diligence efforts and analysis \n \n \non the remaining Replacement Project, Moyock.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 7, at 83:5−7; \nDef.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 10, at 254:2−9.)  \n20. On March 11, 2016, Recurrent submitted a bid in response to an RFP from \nNestlé that used the same pricing strategy for Earleys and Haslett that Recurrent \nused in its Amazon bid.   (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 58, at REDH -00013281; Pl.’s \nResp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 54:21−55:1.)  On that same date, Recurrent received notice that \nits Amazon bid was not shortlisted;  however, Amazon asked Recurrent to submit a \nrevised bid on or before March 22, 2016.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 39.)    \n21. On March 17, 2016, SunEnergy advised Recurrent that the preliminary \nwetlands report for Earleys showed that “the site will not be favorable for a project \nthis size” and “will most likely need immediate replacement with one of the back-up \nsites.”  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 25, ECF No. 61.) \n22. From March 18 to March 21, 2016, Recurrent analyzed Moyock in order to \nmake sure Moyock was a viable alternative that did not have a fatal flaw and to \ngenerate new pricing that it could include in its revised Amazon bid.   (Def.’s Mem. \nSupp. Dep. Exs. 62 −65, 232, 237; Def.’s Mem . Opp’n Tab 8, at 82:6−9, 86:11−16, \n89:12−17, 105:20− 106:9.)  Just as it had with Earleys and Haslett, Recurrent \ngenerated pricing for Moyock by creating a financial model based on  site-specific \ninputs, production data, and assumptions.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Exs. 62, 65, 232, \n237; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 8, at 105:20−106:3; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 12, at 57:3−5, \n58:9−11.)  Similar to the Earleys pricing, the Moyock model yielded lower pricing than \nHaslett.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Exs. 65, 237, at REDH-00013779.)    \n \n \n23. On March 21, 2016, the Recurrent team that modeled Moyock gave a \nwritten presentation to Recurrent’s Risk Review Committee to obtain approval to \nsubmit a lower bid to Amazon.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 237, Tab 2, at 80:18−23.)  \nThe proposal contained revised pricing for Haslett and pricing utilizing the modeling \ncompleted for Moyock, with Moyock’s pricing the lower of the two.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. \nDep. Ex. 237, at REDH-00013779.)  The proposal was approved by Recurrent’s Risk \nReview Committee that same day.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 8, at 124:4−11; Def.’s \nMem. Opp’n Tab 12, at 101:14−16.) \n24. After the risk review meeting, however, Recurrent decided that it would \nkeep the name “Earleys” in the revised bid and increase the pricing generated by the \nMoyock model to make it slightly less competitive than Haslett, just as it had done \nwith the Earleys pricing in its first bid.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep Ex. 239; Pl.’s Mem. \nSupp. Ex. 18, at 113:14−19; Pl.’s Mem Supp. Ex. 39; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab  12, at \n102:15−23, 106:14−22.)  The revised bid identified the Haslett and Earleys  project \nsites, with the power generated at Earleys priced slightly higher than the power \ngenerated at Haslett.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 39.)  Two days later, Recurrent submitted \na revised bid to Nestlé that contained the updated pricing strategy that it used in its \nrevised bid to Amazon.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Exs. 70−71; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 14, \nat 221:23−222:11.)   \nD. Recurrent’s Continued Due Diligence on Moyock \n25. After Recurrent submitted its revised bids to Amazon and Nestlé, \nRecurrent continued to evaluate and conduct due diligence on Moyock through at \n \n \nleast mid-April.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 11, at 168:11−14, 257:13−258:7; Pl.’s Mem. \nSupp. E x. 36 ; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 226:5− 12; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 3, at \n138:19−22; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 5, at 173:12−22, 217:17−19 .)  Recurrent provided \n“Q&A” logs to SunEnergy in which Recurrent posed questions about various aspects \nof Moyock, and SunEnergy updated the log with information in response to those \nquestions as it became available.   (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 57; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. \nExs. 35−36; Def.’ s Mem. Opp’n Tab 10, at 253: 24−254:1.)  Additionally, Recurrent \nreviewed the documentation that was available and continued to model production \ndata for Moyock.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 7, at 83:7−12; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 12, at \n56:17−22; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Dep. Ex. 243.)     \n26. On April 19, 2016, Recurrent learned that its revised Amazon bid was not \nshortlisted.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Ex. 79; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 2, at 240:16−20.) \n27. SunEnergy failed to meet the April 30, 2016 TDM for completion of the \nEarleys wetlands delineation report.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11−12; Answer 3−4, ¶¶ 11−12; \nPl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 33.)  \n28. On May 2, 2016, the next business day after the April 30, 2016 TDM, \nRecurrent gave written notice to SunEnergy that, due to SunEnergy’s failure to meet \nthe April 30, 2016 TDM due to a wetlands issue, Recurrent demanded a full refund \nof the $2 million Earleys Exclusivity Payment pursuant to paragraph 4b of the LOI.   \n(Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 6.)  Pursuant to the express terms of the LOI, the refund was \ndue within sixty days after Recurrent’s request (on or before July 1, 2016).  (LOI ¶ 4b.)   \n \n \n29. SunEnergy has not refunded the Earleys Exclusivity Payment.   (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 34; Answer 7, ¶ 34.)  \nE. Haslett \n30. The Haslett TDM required that SunEnergy obtain all discretionary \npermits, which includes a special use permit (“ SUP”), by August 30, 2016.   (LOI \nAnnex B.)  As of at least March 21, 2016, a moratorium was in place prohibiting the \nissuance of a SUP for a solar farm within Gates County, the county in which Haslett \nwas located.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 11, at 219:9−10; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 44.)   On \nAugust 15, 2016, the Gates County Board of Commissioners extended the moratorium \nthough November 13, 2016, thereby preventing SunEnergy from obtaining a SUP for \nHaslett by the August 30, 2016 TDM.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 43, 46.)  \n31. By letter dated August 22, 2016, SunEnergy notified Recurrent that it \nwould be unable to obtain a SUP for Haslett by August 30, 2016 and requested that \nRecurrent agree to an extension of the TDM.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 43.)   By letter \ndated August 29, 2016, Recurrent denied SunEnergy’s request for an extension.  (Pl.’s \nMem. Supp. Ex. 48.)  \n32. On August 31, 2016, Recurrent gave written notice to SunEnergy that, due \nto SunEnergy’s failure to meet the August 30, 2016  TDM for Haslett , Recurrent \nrequested that SunEnergy provide a Replacement Project  (which by definition \nrequired SunEnergy to offer a project with the same capacity for energy generation \nas Haslett).  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 8.)   Pursuant to the express term s of the LOI, \nSunEnergy was required to provide a Replacement Project by September 7, 2016.   \n \n \n(LOI ¶ 3.)  SunEnergy never responded to Recurrent’s August 31 letter.  (Pl.’s Mem. \nSupp. Ex. 9, at 150:11−18.) \n33. On September 8, 2016, Recurrent gave written notice  to SunEnergy that, \ndue to SunEnergy’s failure to provide a Replacement Project, Recurrent demanded a \n37.5% refund of the Haslett Exclusivity Payment pursuant to paragraph 4c of the \nLOI.  (Am. Compl. Ex. D.)   Under the LOI’s express terms, the refund was d ue by \nNovember 7, 2016.   (LOI ¶ 4d.)   SunEnergy never responded to Recurrent’s \nSeptember 8 letter.  (See Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 6, at 153:8−16.)  \nF. Tax Equity Transaction and Fee Letter \n34. As discussed above, Recurrent and SunEnergy agreed in the LOI to the Tax \nEquity Provision, which req uired Recurrent and SunEnergy to “use best efforts to \nnegotiate in good faith ” the Tax Equity Transaction.  (LOI ¶ 14.)   Tax credits and \naccelerated depreciation  can be claimed on new solar projects, but few solar \ndevelopers have sufficient taxable income to take full advantage of the tax credits and \naccelerated depreciation.  (Answer 10, ¶ 4; Reply ¶ 4; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 5, at \n57:24−58:3; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 9, at 14:14−18.)  As a result, solar developers often \ninvolve a tax equity investor as a co-owner of the solar project.   (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n \nTab 9, at 14:3−8.)  The tax equity investor provides a portion of the capital necessary \nto cover the cost of building the project in exchange for  receipt of the assignment of  \nthe tax  credits, some utilization of the accelerated depreciation,  and cash \ndistributions after the solar project goes into commercial operation .  (Def.’s Mem. \nOpp’n Tab 5, at 57:12−58:5; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 9, at 14:3−13.) \n \n \n35. On June 7, 2016, following four month s of negotiations, Recurrent and \nSunEnergy agreed to a term sheet (the “Term Sheet”) that outlined the high -level \noverview of the tax equity transaction.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 3, 26, 49, 52; Def.’s \nMem. Opp’n Dep . Exs. 136, 199 .)  The Term Sheet set fort h the parameters for a \n“partnership flip ” transaction whereby Recurrent would make a tax equity \ninvestment in the Williamston Speight solar project (“Williamston Speight”).   (See \nPl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 3 [“Term Sheet”].)  In exchange, Recurrent would be allo cated \ninvestment tax credits under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.   (Term \nSheet, at REDH-00000408−09, -00000412.)   \n36. The Term Sheet stated that certain matters were still under discussion and \nthat Recurrent’s “ability to sign definitive agreements and to proceed with funding is \ncontingent upon, among other things, [Recurrent]’s completion of a customary due \ndiligence process[.]”  (Term Sheet, at REDH -00000408 n.2.)  The Term Sheet also \nprovided that its “terms and economic indication are made based on the information \nprovided by [Kenny Habul  (‘Habul’), chief executive officer of SunEnergy] without \nregard to the accuracy of the information provided and remains [sic] subject to, among \nother things, appropria te documentation, due diligence  and the review of tax \ncounsel.”  (Term Sheet, at REDH-00000409.) \n37. The Term Sheet disclosed that Habul owns Williamston Speight Solar, LLC \n(the “Project Company”), which owns the rights to Williamston Speight.  (Term Sheet, \nat REDH-00000408−09.)  The parties agreed that Recurrent and SunEnergy would \nform a limited liability company (the “Holding Company”), which would be the sole \n \n \nmember and manager of the Project Company.   (Term Sheet, at REDH -00000409.)  \nRecurrent and Habul would be the members of the Holding Company.  (Term Sheet, \nat REDH -00000408−09.)  Recurrent would make its tax equity investment in \nWilliamston Speight by making capital contributions to the Holding Company.  (Term \nSheet, at REDH-00000408−09.)  The Term Sheet stated that Recurrent anticipated \ninvesting $1.25 for every $1.00 of investment tax credit.   (Term Sheet, at REDH -\n00000409 n.4.)  The Holding Company would then pay SunEnergy to develop and \nconstruct Williamston Speight, allowing the Holding Company to claim investment \ntax credits.  (See Term Sheet, at REDH-00000409 & n.4.)       \n38. A central issue in the parties’ negotiations was the amount that the Holding \nCompany would pay SunEnergy to develop Williamston Speight.  (See Answer 11, \n¶ 8; Reply ¶ 8; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Dep . Ex. 136, Tab 9, at 39:21−40:5.)  The Term \nSheet provided that the Holding Company would pay “the lesser of (a) [$]1.88 per \nwatt and (b) the fair market value of the eligible property as deter mined by \nappraisal.”1  (Term Sheet, at REDH -00000409 n.4.)   Under IRS regulations, a  \ntaxpayer may claim investment tax credits in an amount equal to 30% of its \ninvestment tax credit basis in a project.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 2, at 266:11−13; \nDef.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 3, at 37:15−16, 38:22−39:14.)  The taxpayer’s investment tax \ncredit basis is , approximately, equal to the total cost of the project.  (Def.’s Mem. \nOpp’n Tab 3, at 37:15−16, 38:1−9.)   Thus, here, the Holding Company’s investment \n                                                 \n1 The Term Sheet estimated that Williamston Speight would generate 15 MWac of \nelectricity.  Based on a $1.88 per watt construction price, the total amount paid to \nSunEnergy for construction of the project would be $28.2 million.     \n \n \ntax credit basis would be the price it paid SunEnergy, as the contracto r, to build \nWilliamston Speight, and its investment tax credits would be equal to 30% of that \nprice.  (See Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 3, at 38:22−39:14.)   In order to withstand IRS \nscrutiny, the fair market value of a solar project is often assessed by an independent \nthird-party appraiser, and a taxpayer who pays more than fair market value for \ndevelopment of a project is subject to significant audit risk.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 13, \nat 46:14−17, 54:12−16; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 15, at 60:13−20; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 17, \nat 61:25−62:11.)            \n39. The Term Sheet provided that SunEnergy “will be responsible and liable \nfor all reasonable and documented costs and expenses of [Recurrent] in connection \nwith the transaction on the terms set forth in a fee letter entered into between \nSunEnergy[] and [Recurrent]” and stated that SunEnergy was to make a legal \nexpense deposit of $50,000 to Recurrent.  (Term Sheet, at REDH-00000418−19.) \n40. On June 7, 2016, the same date that the parties agreed to the Term Sheet, \nRecurrent and SunEnergy executed a fee letter (the “Fee Letter”).  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. \nEx. 2; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Dep. Ex. 199.)  The Fee Letter stated, in relevant part, that \n[r]eference is made to the [LOI], dated as of February 11, 2016 . . . . \n \n In accordance with [the Tax Equity Provision]  of the LOI , \n[Recurrent] . . . and [SunEnergy] and Kenny Habul  . . . are negotiating \na potential Tax Equity Transaction.  In connection with the \nforegoing, . . . [SunEnergy] agrees as follows: \n \n (a) [SunEnergy] will cause its affiliate that is the managing \nmember of the tax equity partnership to reimburse [Recurrent] for all \nreasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by [Recurrent] \nin connection with the Tax Equity Transaction . . . , and \n \n \n \n(b) without limiting the foregoing, within two (2) business days of \nthe date hereof, [SunEnergy] will cause [Recurrent] to be provided a \nnon-refundable deposit of $50,000 to be applied by [Recurrent] to  legal \ncosts i ncurred by [Recurrent] in connection with the Tax Equity \nTransaction . . . . \n \n For the avoidance of doubt, if, for any reason, the managing \nmember of the tax equity partnership is unable to reimburse [Recurrent] \nfor the amounts described in (a) above, [Sun Energy] hereby agrees to \nreimburse [Recurrent] directly for all such amounts within the \ntimeframes set forth in this fee letter.  The amounts required to be paid \npursuant to clause (a) above will be payable . . . on the earlier of: \n \n (x) the date of the first funding under the Tax Equity Transaction; \nand \n \n (y) fifteen (15) business days following the date that (i) \n[Recurrent] or [SunEnergy] has provided notice to the other that it has \ndecided not to proceed with the Tax Equity Transaction and (ii) \n[Recurrent] has made a written demand for such amounts . . . . \n \n(Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 2.) \n41. SunEnergy wired Recurrent the $50,000 deposit that same day.   (Def.’s \nMem. Opp’n Dep. Ex. 199.) \n42. On or around June 9, 2016, SunEnergy and Recurrent began discussing the \nWilliamston Speight  model.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 57.)   Recurrent took the \ninformation from SunEnergy’s model, reworked it, and put it into a model that \nRecurrent had used previously.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 15, at 88:23−89:13.)   Both \nRecurrent’s and SunEnergy’s initial models included a separate revenue stream for \nthe sale of renewable energy credits (“RECs”) in addition to the revenue stream for \nthe sale of power.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 4, at 78:5−14.)  On June 16, 2016, \nRecurrent sent SunEnergy its rev ised model, dated June 15, 2016 , which projected \n \n \ntotal revenue for the project at $88,990,389.  (Pl.’s Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. J. [“Pl.’s \nReply”] Ex. 81, ECF No. 93.) \n43. Thereafter, SunEnergy provided Recurrent with a power purchase \nagreement (“PPA”) by which Dominion North Carolina Power (“Dominion”) agreed to \npurchase the power generated at Williamston Speight.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 15, at \n205:8−16.)  Recurrent reviewed the PPA and noticed that, according to its express \nterms, the RECs and power were bundled such that Dominion , as the purchaser of \nthe power, also received the rights to the RECs.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 15, at \n205:17−24, 212:4−10.)   Therefore, to be consistent with the PPA , the Williamston \nSpeight model s prepared by both Recurrent and Su nEnergy should not have \ncontained a separate revenue stream for the RECs.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 15, at \n212:14−23; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 6, at 222:2−223:16.)   \n44. On June 22, 2016, Recurrent e -mailed SunEnergy about this issue , and \nSunEnergy agreed that the R ECs needed to be taken out of the model.   (Pl.’s Reply \nEx. 83.)  That same day, Recurrent sent SunEnergy an updated projection reflecting \ntotal revenue of $80,777,893—a reduction of over $8 million dollars.  (Pl.’s Reply Ex. \n83.) \n45. Also on June 22, 2016, Kei th Martin  (“Martin”), SunEnergy’s outside \ncounsel, called Mitch Randall, Recurrent’s chief executive officer , and left him the \nfollowing message: \nHabul called me.  He’s had two projects fall through, one, recently, \nmeaning this morning, $173M project he wa s building for Dominion.  \nThe North Carolina bathroom law is causing problems with these \nprojects and he’s now in a position where he’s thinking he needs to sell \n \n \nWilliamston Speight. . . . And given how much work you guys have put \ninto this already he’s wo ndering, he wants to offer it to you first before \ngoing out anywhere else.  So could you give me a call?  I’ll explain more \nof the circumstances to you.  . . . I’m also going to mention to Jeff, your \nlawyer, and John Eliason that they should stop work on the tax equity \ndeal. \n \n(Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 60.) \n46. The timeline of events that occurred after this message is unclear.  Shortly \nafter Martin’s message, Recurrent offered to purchase Williamston Speight for \napproximately $1.00 p er watt, which SunEnergy rejected, and SunEnergy \napproached Recurrent to resume their tax equity negotiations.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. \n15, at 217:11−25; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 6, at 182:1−3; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 9, at \n111:21−23, 115:22−25.)  The record is unclear as to which happened first, and t here \nis a dispute of fact as to what occurred after the parties resumed their negotiations.   \n47. SunEnergy’s evidence tends to show that John Eliason (“Eliason”), \nRecurrent’s outside tax counsel,  advised Martin that Rec urrent would not agree to \nthe Holding Company paying more than $1.40 per watt for construction of \nWilliamston Speight (as compared to the $1.88 per watt estimated price contained in \nthe Term Sheet) , but that Recurrent did not have an independent appraisal to \nsupport that valuation.   (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 6, at 181:4−17, 189:11−16; Def.’s \nMem. Opp’n Tab 7, at 162:17−20; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 9, at 111:21−112:5, \n113:25−114:14, 115:22−116:4.)   \n48. Conversely, Recurrent’s evidence tends to show that Eliason, at Recurrent’s \ninstruction, advised Martin that an appraisal of Williamston Speight would likely \nvalue the project at around $1.40 per watt.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 15, at 252:18−253:4; \n \n \nPl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 17, at 61:5−19.)  Recurrent contends that it always intended to \nhave the fair market value of Williamston Speight assessed by an independent \nappraiser, but that, based on Recurrent’s internal modeling, it wanted to let \nSunEnergy know up front that a valuation was likely to come out significantly lower \nthan the $1.88 per watt value that SunEnergy expected.   (See Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. \n15, at 252:18−253:4.)   \n49. On July 5, 2016, Habul e -mailed David Fisher (“Fisher”) , Recurrent’s \nchartered financial analyst responsible for modeling Williamston Speight, and \ninformed h im that SunEnergy was referring matters to its attorneys in light of \nRecurrent’s recent price drop and unreasonable purchase offer.   (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n \nDep. Ex. 22.)   \n50. Recurrent incurred a total of $123,543.19 in costs and expenses in \nconnection with the Tax Equity Transaction.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 7.)  After applying \nSunEnergy’s $50,000 deposit, Recurrent demanded reimbursement from SunEnergy \nof $73,543.19 by letter dated July 19, 2016 .  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 7.)   Pursuant to \nthe express terms of the Fee Letter, SunEnergy was required to reimburse Recurrent \nby August 9, 2016.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 2.)   SunEnergy has not reimbursed \nRecurrent for its costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Tax Equity \nTransaction.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 34; Answer 7, ¶ 34.) \nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n51. Recurrent filed its complaint initiating this action on August 23, 2016 and \nan Amended C omplaint on September 8, 2016.   The Amended Complaint asserts \n \n \nclaims for a declaratory judgment2, breach of the LOI, and breach of the Fee Letter.  \n(Am. Compl. 8, 10, 12.)   In its claim for breach of the LOI, Recurrent alleges that \nSunEnergy breached the LOI by failing to refund the $2 million Earleys Exclusivity \nPayment, failing to provide a Replaceme nt Project for  Haslett, and failing to \ncooperate with Recurrent’s due diligence on the Proposed Transaction an d negotiate \nin good faith and use reasonable efforts to consummate the Proposed Transaction.   \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 40−47.)  In its claim for breach of t he Fee Letter, Recurrent alleges \nthat SunEnergy breached the Fee Letter by failing to reimburse Recurrent’s costs \nand expenses incurred in connection with the Tax Equity Transaction.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 52.)   \n52. This case was designated as a mandatory complex bus iness case by order \nof the Honorable Mark Martin, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, \ndated August 26, 2016, (ECF No. 4), and assigned to the undersigned by order of Chief \nBusiness Court Judge James L. Gale dated August 29, 2016, (ECF No. 5).   \n53. SunEnergy filed an answer on November 9, 2016 and an amended answer \nand counterclaim on December 9, 2016.  SunEnergy asserts a counterclaim for breach \nof the LOI, alleging that Recurrent breached the Tax Equity Provision by imposing \nan artificial ca p on the price that the Holding Company would pay SunEnergy to \ndevelop Williamston Speight.  (Answer 13.)  \n                                                 \n2 Recurrent’s declaratory  judgment claim is effectively identical to, and seeks the \nsame relief as, its claims for breach of the LOI and breach of the Fee Letter.  (See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 28−53.)  At the hearing on the Motions, Recurrent conceded that its \ndeclaratory judgment claim is redundant and that resolution of its second and third \nclaims would in effect resolve its declaratory judgment claim.     \n \n \n54. On March 7, 2017, the Court entered an order and opinion denying \nRecurrent’s motion for partial judgment on the pleadings and motion to strike or \ndismiss SunEnergy’s counterclaim.  (ECF No. 38.)   \n55. On March 24, 2017, Recurrent filed its reply to SunEnergy’s counterclaim.  \n56. Following discovery, o n March 16, 2018, the parties filed their respective \nmotions for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the  North Carolina Rules of \nCivil Procedure (“Rule(s)”).   (ECF Nos. 52, 58.)   Recurrent moves for  summary \njudgment on its second claim for breach of the LOI insofar as this claim pertains to a \nrefund of the Earleys and Haslett Exclusivity Payment s, and on its third claim for \nbreach of the Fee Letter.  (Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1.)   Recurrent’s motion further seeks \nentry of judgment in its favor dismissing SunEnergy’s counterclaim for breach of the \nLOI.  (Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1.)   SunEnergy moves for summary judgment  seeking \njudgment in its favor dismissing  Recurrent’s claims for a declaratory judgment and \nbreach of the LOI insofar as these  claims pertain to  a refund of the Earleys \nExclusivity Payment.  (SunEnergy’s Mot. Partial Summ. J. 1.) \n57. The Motions have been full y briefed, and the Court held a hearing  and \nheard oral arguments on the Motions on May 21 and May 22, 2018.  The Motions are \nnow ripe for resolution. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n58. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \n \n \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule 56(c).  “A ‘genuine \nissue’ is one that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 \nN.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 (2000). \n59. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \nHensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc. , 193 N.C. App. 561, 563, 668 S.E.2d 349, 351 \n(2008).  “If the movant successfully makes such a showing, the burden then shifts to \nthe non-movant to come forward with specific facts establishing the presence of a \ngenuine factual dispute for trial.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, \n579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002).  The Court must view the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83, 530 S.E.2d at 835.  However, \nthe nonmovant “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [its] pleading, \nbut [its] response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth \nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  If [the nonmovant] does \nnot so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against [the \nnonmovant].”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56(e). \nV. ANALYSIS \nA. Choice of Law \n60. As a preliminary matter, the Court must determine which state’s law \napplies to the parties’ claims.  The LOI and the Fee Letter contain a New York choice \nof law clause.  (LOI ¶ 9; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 2 .)  Our Court of Appeals has stated \nthat a contractual choice of law provision will be given effect unless the chosen state \n \n \nhas no substantial connection to the transaction and there is no other reasonable \nbasis for the parties’ choice, or the law of the c hosen state violates a fundamental \npublic policy of North Carolina.  Cable Tel Servs., Inc. v. Overland Contracting, Inc., \n154 N.C. App. 639, 642−43, 574 S.E.2d 31, 33−34 (2002).   \n61. Here, all parties agree that North Carolina law applies despite the New \nYork choice of law clauses because the LOI and the Fee Letter have no connection to \nNew York.  The Court agrees that, on the record before it, neither the LOI nor the \nFee Letter have any connection to New York.  The parties to the LOI and the Fee \nLetter are D elaware and North Carolina limited liability companies with their \nprincipal offices in California and North Carolina, respectively.  Both the LOI and \nthe Fee Letter concern solar projects under construction and development in North \nCarolina.  Further, the record before the Court does not provide any basis for the \nparties’ New York choice of law clauses.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that New \nYork law does not apply to the LOI or the Fee Letter.3 \n                                                 \n3 The Court notes that in an unrelated action, our Court of Appeals recently concluded \nthat, due to a Florida choice of law clause, Florida law governed the interpretation of \nthe parties’ contracts.  Press v. AGC Aviation, LLC , __ N.C. App. __, No. COA17 -9, \n2018 N.C. App. LEXIS 578, at *9 (N.C. Ct. App. June 5, 2018).  The Court of Appeals \nconcluded that, even though the parties did not mention Florida law, under N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 8 -4, the lower court was required to take judicial notice of Florida law and \napply Florida law to interpret the contracts.  Id. at *9−10.  Although the Court of \nAppeals did not address the issue, it appears that there was a substantial connection \nbetween Florida and the parties’ agreements so as to require the courts in Press to \ngive effect to the Florida choice of law clause.  See id. at *2−6.  The Court believes \nthat Press is distinguishable on its facts and is not controlling under the facts of this \ncase.   \n \n \n62. “[T]he interpretation of a contract is governed by the law of the place where \nthe contract was made.”  Id. at 642, 574 S.E.2d at 33 (quoting Land Co. v. Byrd, 299 \nN.C. 260, 262, 261 S.E.2d 655, 656 (1980)).  “[A] contract is made in the place where \nthe last act necessary to make it binding occurred.”   Schwarz v. St. Jude Med., Inc., \n802 S.E.2d 783, 790 (N.C. Ct. App. 2017) (quoting Tom Togs, Inc. v. Ben Elias Indus. \nCorp., 318 N.C. 361, 365, 348 S.E.2d 782, 785 (1986)). \n63. The record tends to show that the LOI and Fee Letter were made in North \nCarolina when SunEnergy  signed both agreements  and, therefore, the Court \nconcludes that North Carolina law applies to these contracts.  Szymczyk v. Signs Now \nCorp., 168 N.C. App. 182, 187, 606 S.E.2d 728, 733 (2005)  (“[T]he last act of signing \nthe contract was an essential element to formation.”); Cable Tel Servs., Inc., 154 N.C. \nApp. at 643, 574 S.E.2d at 34 (applying North Carolina law where plaintiff signed the \ncontract in North Carolina and returned it to defendant in Kansas). \nB. The LOI Is a Valid Contract \n64. “The elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) existence of a valid \ncontract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, \n26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000).  A valid contract requires assent, mutuality of \nobligation, and definite terms.  Charlotte Motor Speedway, LLC v. Cty. o f Cabarrus, \n230 N.C. App. 1, 7, 748 S.E.2d 171, 176 (2013).  “Generally, letters of intent are found \nto be unenforceable agreements to agree when relied upon to enforce the \ncontemplated transaction.”  Insight Health Corp. v. Marquis Diagnostic Imaging of \nN.C., LLC, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 77, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 7, 2016) (concluding a \n \n \nletter of intent was not a valid contract where its plain language made clear that it \nwas not a binding agreement); Remi Holdings, LLC v. IX WR 3023 HSBC Way L.P., \n2016 NCBC LEXIS 110, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 12, 2016) (same). \n65. Here, the plain language of the LOI makes clear that, while titled a “Letter \nof Intent” rather than a “Contract” or “Agreement,” the LOI was in fact a binding \nagreement, and the parties do not dispute this conclusion.  The LOI set forth the \nparties’ “agreement on certain matters pending consummation of the Proposed \nTransaction.”  (LOI ¶ C.)  The LOI obligated both parties and expressly provided that \n“[t]ermination of this LOI shall not relieve either Party from any liability for breach \nof the binding terms of this LOI occurring pr ior to such termination.”  (LOI ¶ 8.)  \nFurther, the terms of the LOI are sufficiently definite to be enforceable, and the \nparties’ assented to the LOI by signing it.   Therefore, the Court concludes that the \nLOI is a valid contract. \nC. Refund of the Earleys Exclusivity Payment \n66. Recurrent and SunEnergy cross -move for summary judgment on \nRecurrent’s second claim for breach of the LOI insofar as this claim seeks a full refund \nof the Earleys $2 million Exclusivity Payment under the LOI.4 \n \n  \n                                                 \n4 SunEnergy also moves for summary judgment on Recurrent’s declaratory judgment \nclaim to the extent that it seeks a full  refund of the Earleys Exclusivity Payment, \nwhich, as discussed above, is duplicative of and subsumed into Recurrent’s claim for \nbreach of the LOI. \n \n \n1. SunEnergy’s Motion  \n67. SunEnergy argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Recurrent’s \nclaim for a full refund of the Earleys Exclusivity Payment because Recurrent elected \nMoyock as a Replacement Project for Earleys in lieu of seeking a refund.  (Def.’s Mem. \nSupp. 17.)   \na. Recurrent did not exercise its right to purchase \nMoyock because it did not provide written election to \nSunEnergy. \n \n68. The LOI’s express terms state d that if SunEnergy fails to meet the  TDM \nfor a project, Recurrent “shall have the right, by written election to [SunEnergy], to \npurchase all of the assets necessary to develop, construct and operate [a Replacement \nProject].  [SunEnergy] shall provide said Replacement Project  . . . to [Recurrent] \nwithin 5 business days of [Recurrent]’s written election.”  (LOI ¶ 3 (emphasis added).)  \nIt is undisputed that Recurrent never elected Moyock in writing , (Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n \nEx. 2, at 343:4−7) ; rather, S unEnergy argues that Recurrent  elected Moyock by \nincluding Moyock in its revised bids to Amazon and Nestlé and by conduct ing due \ndiligence on Moyock.  The Court finds both of these arguments unpersuasive.  \n69. “Interpreting a contract requires the court to examine the language of the \ncontract itself for indications of the parties’ intent at the moment of execution.”  RME \nMgmt., LLC v. Chapel H.O.M. Assocs., LLC, 795 S.E.2d 641, 645 (N.C. Ct. App. 2017).  \n“[W]hen the terms of a contract are plain and unambiguous, there is no room for \nconstruction.  The contract is to be interpreted as written, and enforce[d]  . . . as the \nparties have made it.”  State v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 363 N.C. 623, 632, 685 S.E.2d \n \n \n85, 91 (2009) (omission and second alteration in original) (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  It is presumed that the parties intended what the chosen language \nin the contract clearly expresses, and the Court cannot rewrite the contract or impose \nterms for which the parties did not bargain.  See McIntyre v. McIntyre, 188 N.C. App. \n26, 31, 654 S.E.2d 798, 801 (2008) (“[I]t must be presumed the parties intended what \nthe language used clearly expresses, and the contract must be construed to mean \nwhat on its face it purports to mean.”); Duke Energy Corp. v. Malcolm, 178 N.C. App. \n62, 65, 630 S.E.2d 693, 695 (2006) (“[I]f the meaning of the [contract] is clear and only \none reasonable interpretation exists, the courts must enforce the contract as written; \nthey may not, under the guise of construing an ambiguous term, rewrite the contract \nor impose liabilities on the parties not bargained for and found therein.” (alterations \nin original)); Cater v. Barker, 172 N.C. App. 441, 445, 617 S.E.2d 113, 116−17 (2005) \n(“It is a well -settled principle of legal construction that it must be presumed the \nparties intended what the language used clearly expresses, and the contract must be \nconstrued to mean what on  its face it purports to mean.  . . . Presumably the words \nwhich the parties select were deliberately chosen and are to be given their ordinary \nsignificance.”), aff’d, 360 N.C. 357, 625 S.E.2d 778 (2006) ; Internet E., Inc. v. Duro \nCommc’ns, Inc., 146 N.C. App. 401, 405, 553 S.E.2d 84, 87 (2001) (“Where the terms \nof a contractual agreement are clear and unambiguous, the courts cannot rewrite the \nplain meaning of the contract.”). \n70. Here, the LOI clearly and unambiguously provided that Recurrent had the \nright to purchase a Replacement Project by written election to SunEnergy.  It is \n \n \nundisputed that Recurrent did not give such written election to SunEnergy.  \nTherefore, under the express terms of the LOI, Recurrent did not elect to purchase \nMoyock as a Replacement Project for Earleys. \nb. SunEnergy’s arguments that Recurrent ’s actions are \nsufficient to constitute an election , notwithstanding \nthe failure to give written notice, are unavailing.  \n \n71. SunEnergy contends that Recurrent obtained the benefit of using Moyock \nin its bids to third-party purchasers, but concealed its use thereof to retain the option \nof a refund.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. 18, 23.)   SunEnergy maintains that the doctrine of \nelection of remedies does not permit Recurrent’s tactics.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. 24.) \n72. The doctrine of election of remedies prevents a plaintiff from recovering \ninconsistent remedies and prevents double redress for a single wrong.  United Labs., \nInc. v. Kuykendall , 335 N.C. 183, 191, 437 S.E.2d 374, 379 (1992).   “The whole \ndoctrine of election [of remedies] is based on the theory that there are incon sistent \nrights or remedies of which a party may avail himself, and a choice of one is held to \nbe an election not to pursue the other.”  SRS Arlington Offices 1, LLC v. Arlington \nCondo. Owners Ass’n, Inc., 234 N.C. App. 541, 547, 760 S.E.2d 330, 335 (2014).   The \ndoctrine is applied to prevent a litigant from recovering inconsistent remedies, such \nas rescission of a contract and damages for breach of the same, and to prevent double \nrecovery for the same wrong, such as punitive damages for tortious conduct and treble \ndamages for a violation of section 75 -1.1 based on the same conduct.  United Labs., \nInc., 335 N.C. at 191, 437 S.E.2d at 379.   \n \n \n73. The Court agrees that Recurrent could not elect to purchase a Replacement \nProject for Earleys and also elect a full refund of the Earleys Exclusivity Payment.  \nRecurrent did not, however, elect or receive a Replacement Project.  Recurrent made \nthe $2 million Earleys Exclusivity Payment for the exc lusive rights to purchase \nEarleys and market the power generated at Earleys.  Recurrent did not have the  \nexclusive rights to the Replacement Projects or the power generated by them unless, \nupon SunEnergy’s failure to meet the TDM for a Project, Recurrent elected in writing \nto SunEnergy to purchase a Replacement Project.  Paragraph 3 of the LOI prevented \nSunEnergy from disposing, agreeing to dispose, or granting exclusivity for the \ndisposition of the Replacement Projects to a third party until SunEnergy achieved \nthe TDM for wetlands delineation for both Earleys and Haslett.  Thereafter, however, \nSunEnergy was free to ent er into transactions with third parties concerning the \nReplacement Projects.   \n74. The fact that Recurrent allegedly used Moyock in its revised bids to Amazon \nand Nestlé—unbeknownst to SunEnergy —does not change the fact that Recurrent \ndid not have the exclusive rights to market the power generated at Moyock.   \nMoreover, that Recurrent sought to take advantage of the express terms of the \ncontract—or to use SunEnergy’s words, to retain the option of a refund —does not \naffect the Court’s analysis.  “Liberty to contract carries with it the right to exercise \npoor judgment as well as good judgment.  It is the simple law of contract s that as a \nman consents to bind himself, so shall he be bound.”  Sylva Shops Ltd. P’ship v. \nHibbard, 175 N.C. App. 423, 427, 623 S.E.2d 785, 789 (2006).   The LOI, to which \n \n \nSunEnergy agreed, expressly provided  that Recurrent had the right to purchase a \nReplacement Project by  written election to SunEnergy.  As Recurrent did not have \nthe exclusive rights to market the power generated at Moyock, there was a risk in \nusing Moyock in Recurrent’s revised bids to Amazon and Nestl é if that project \nhappened to be shortlisted—but that is a risk that, at least under the LOI, Recurrent \ncould take, however ill-advised it might be.         \n75. SunEnergy additionally argues that Recurrent forfeited its right to a refund \nof the Earleys Exclusivity Payment once it performed due diligence on Moyock.   \n(SunEnergy’s Reply Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 3, ECF No. 88 [“Def.’s Reply”].)   \nSpecifically, SunEnergy argues that, in addition to the exclusive rights to market the \nProjects’ power, Recurrent made the Exclusivity Payments in exchange for the right \nto conduct due diligence on the Proposed Transaction as set forth in paragraph 2.  The \nLOI defines “Proposed Transaction” as Recurrent’s interest in buying, and \nSunEnergy’s interest in selling, “all assets necessary for the development of one or \nboth of the Projects and, as applicable, the Replacement Project(s)[.]”   (LOI ¶ B.)   \nSunEnergy contends that a Replacement Project was only “applicable” if Recurrent \nhad elected such Replacement Project and, accordingly, Recurrent could only perform \ndue diligence on a Replacement Project if it had elected that Replacement Project.  \n(Def.’s Reply 5.)   \n76. Although this is one reasonable interpretation of these two provisions of the \nLOI, another reasonable interpretation is that Recurrent’s right to conduct due \ndiligence on the Proposed Transaction —and whether the transaction would entail \n \n \nRecurrent purchasing one or two projects—included the right to conduct due diligence \non a Replacement Project in the event SunEnergy failed to meet the TDM for a \nProject.   \n77. The Court concludes that whether or not Recurrent had the right to conduct \ndue diligence on a Replacement Project before it elected such a project is immaterial.  \nAs discussed above, the LOI expressly provided that Recurrent could elect a \nReplacement Project by written election to SunEnergy —not by conducting due \ndiligence.  Further, the evidence is undisputed that S unEnergy provided Recurrent \nwith data on the three Replacement Projects on March 4, 2016 —before SunEnergy \ninformed Recurrent on March 17, 2016 that the Earleys preliminary wetlands report \nindicated that Earleys would  most likely need to be replaced.   (Def.’s Mem. Supp. \nDep. Ex. 57; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 25.)  It is also undisputed that Recurrent performed \ndue diligence on the other two Replacement Projects  as well as on Moyock .  (Pl.’s \nMem. Supp. Ex. 32; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 10, at 253:19−21; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 3, \nat 135:10−12, 136:4−6.)   \n78. Most importantly, the evidence is undisputed that, as of April 6, 2016 —\nmore than one month after Recurrent began conducting due diligence on Moyock —\nSunEnergy knew that Recurrent had not accepted Moyock as a Replacement Project \nfor Earleys.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 35.)  On April 6, 2016, Kara Price (“Price”), \nSunEnergy’s legal project manager and primary point of contact with Recurrent, \nstated in an internal e -mail that “Recurrent has yet to confirm they will accept \nMoyock as a viable substitute for [Earleys].”  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 35.)  Price further \n \n \nstated that “[t]o assist in this process, we have some remaining ‘to dos’ to make \n[Recurrent] more comfortable.”  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 35.)  Recurrent had discovered \nthat Moyock was located next to a golf course community and was concerned that \nSunEnergy would not be able to obtain the necessary permits for Moyock due to its \nlocation.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 33, 35−36; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 3, at 139:6−14.)  \nRecurrent requested from SunEnergy a timeline for obtaining a SUP.  (Pl.’s Mem. \nSupp. Ex. 35.)  Recurrent also requested information about a new 300 -foot setback \nrequirement that had been imposed in Currituck County, the county in which Moyock \nwas located, and whether additional land would need to be acquired by SunEnergy to \ncomply with this requirement.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 35−36.)  Additionally, \nRecurrent inquired about the expected completion date of the wetlands delineation \nreport.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 36.)  Price’s April 6 e-mail discussed these items about \nwhich Recurrent had inquired in conducting its due diligence  and, as of April 14, \n2016, SunEnergy had not addressed all of Recurrent’s concerns.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. \nEx. 11, at 257:13−258:7; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 35−36.) \n79. In short, the LOI’s express terms do not support an interpretation that \nRecurrent elected to purchase Moyock by conducting due diligence, and the evidence \ntends to show that , at least as of April 6, 2016,  SunEnergy did not understand \nRecurrent to have elected to purchase Moyock as a Replacement Project solely \nbecause it conducted due diligence thereon ; rather, it sought to assist Recurrent in \nits due diligence in an effort to  assure Recurrent that Moyock was a viable \n \n \nReplacement Project, presumably in hopes that Recurrent would exercise its right to \nelect Moyock as a replacement for Earleys.   \n80. This evidence also forecloses SunEnergy’s argument, in reliance on Kearney \nv. Hare , 265 N.C. 570, 144 S.E.2d 636 (1965) , that Recurrent’s actions  (in using \nMoyock in its calculated bids for Amazon and Nestlé and its conduct of due diligence) \ncould not have been understood by the parties other than as a definite declaration of \nRecurrent’s choice to exercise its right to elect Moyock.  In Kearney, plaintiff-lessee \nand defendant -lessor entered into a one -year lease in November 1962.   The lease \nprovided plaintiff-lessee with an option to extend the lease for an additional one-year \nterm by giving written notice to defendant-lessor of his intention to extend the lease \nno later than thirty days prior to termination.  Upon such renewal, all of the terms of \nthe lease were to cont inue in full force and effect, including the option to renew.  \nPlaintiff-lessee paid the rent for the first term ending November 1963.  At defendant-\nlessor’s request, plaintiff -lessee paid the rent for the second lease term ending \nNovember 1964, in part by delivering to defendant-lessor a check signed by plaintiff-\nlessee.  Defendant -lessor contended that plaintiff -lessee did not have the option to \nrenew the lease beyond the term ending November 1964 because plaintiff -lessee did \nnot give defendant-lessor written notice of his intent to extend the lease a second year \nand, therefore, the option to renew did not continue into the second lease term .  The \nSupreme Court concluded that the check delivered to defendant -lessor by plaintiff -\nlessee, at defendant-lessor’s request, “could not have been understood by the parties \notherwise than as a definite declaration by [plaintiff -lessee] of his intent to o ccupy \n \n \nthe land for the following year, which he had the right to do by extending the term of \nthe lease.”  265 N.C. at 575, 144 S.E.2d at 640.  \n81. Kearney is distinguishable on its facts and does not support SunEnergy’s \nposition.  First, the Supreme Court conc luded that plaintiff -lessee provided the \nrequisite written notice to defendant -lessor of plaintiff-lessee’s intention to extend \nthe lease.  The Court concluded that the check was a written instrument, thereby \nsatisfying the requirement that the notice be i n writing.  The Court then concluded \nthat the check for the next year’s rent could not have been understood by the parties \notherwise than as a definite declaration by plaintiff -lessee of his intention to extend \nthe lease, thereby satisfying the requirement that the writing notify defendant-lessor \nof plaintiff-lessee’s intention to extend the lease.  Here, unlike in Kearney, there is no \nwritten instrument by which Recurrent is alleged to have exercised its right to \npurchase Moyock as a Replacement Project.   \n82. Second, in Kearney, the actions by which plaintiff -lessor was said to have \nexercised his right to renew the lease were in his direct dealings with defendant -\nlessor.  Here, SunEnergy contends Recurrent exercised its right to purchase Moyock \nthrough its con duct in dealing s with third parties —by using Moyock in its revised \nbids to Amazon and Nestlé—and counsel for SunEnergy conceded during the hearing \non the Motions that SunEnergy was unaware of such use until after this litigation \nwas instituted.  Further, as discussed above, the evidence tends to show that, at least \nas of April 6, 2016, SunEnergy did not construe Recurrent’s due diligence on Moyock \nas an effective election to purchase Moyock.  Thus, unlike in Kearney, where the Court \n \n \ndetermined that plaintiff -lessor’s actions could not have been understood by the \nparties other than as a definite declaration of plaintiff -lessor’s intention to exercise \nhis right to renew, here, not only could the parties have understood Recurrent’s due \ndiligence other than as a definite declaration that it was electing to purchase Moyock \nas a Replacement Project, but also SunEnergy did understand it otherwise.     \n83. In sum, the Court concludes that, under the express terms of the LOI, the \nundisputed evidenc e shows that Recurrent did not exercise its right to purchase  \nMoyock as a Replacement Project for Earleys. \nc. Alternatively, Recurrent did not bid Moyock in its \nrevised bids to Amazon and Nestlé.  \n \n84. Alternatively, e ven assuming that Recurrent could elect to purchase \nMoyock as a Replacement Project by su bmitting Moyock in its bids to third -party \npurchasers, the Court further concludes that SunEnergy has failed to come forward \nwith sufficient evidence that Recurrent included Moyock in its revised bids to Amazon \nor Nestlé. \n85. For its evidence that Recurrent included Moyock in its revised bids, \nSunEnergy points to Recurrent’s analysis of Moyock prior to its bid submissions .  \nWhile the evidence demonstrates that Recurrent analyzed Moyock, generated pricing \nfor Moyock, and approved a proposed revised bid that contained pricing for Haslett \nand Moyock, the undisputed evidence show s that Recurrent did not submit the \napproved revised bid to Amazon or Nestlé.  Instead, on March 22, 2016—the day after \nRecurrent approved the proposal—Recurrent decided to keep the name “Earleys” in \nits revised bid and artificially inflate the Earleys/Moyock  pricing to make it less \n \n \ncompetitive than Haslett.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Exs. 66, 239; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. \n18, at 113:12−19; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 39; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 12, at 102:15−23, \n106:14−22.)  Although Recurrent had not uncovered any fatal flaws with Moyock at \nthat time, Recurrent discovered that Moyock was located next to a golf course \ncommunity.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 33; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 144:1−3; Pl.’s Resp. \nOpp’n Ex. 3, at 139:6−7.)  Due to its location, Recurrent was not confident that a solar \nsite could be built at Moyock.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 33; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at \n144:1−13, 149:4−11, 153:2−7; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 3, at 139:6−8.)  By making \n“Earleys” (utilizing the Moyock model) less competitive, Recurrent believed it had the \noption to substitute a generic project that could generate power at the “Earleys” \npricing that it submitted in its revised bid to Amazon on March 22, 2016.  (Pl.’s Mem. \nSupp. Ex. 14, at 152:17−25, 154:1−11, 171:18−22; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 19, at \n129:13−18; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 39; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 204:1−3.)  The \nundisputed evidence shows that Recurrent never submitted Moyock’s true pricing to \nAmazon or Nestlé nor did it inform either Amazon or Nestlé that the project for which \nit was submitting proposed pricing was Moyock.  (Def.’s Mem. Supp. Dep. Exs. 70−71; \nPl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 18, at 118:24−119:4; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex . 19, at 162:19−163:3; \nPl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 39; Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Ex. 2, at 202:18−21.)    \n86. The Court concludes that , because Recurrent did not identify Moyock by \nname or location and did not submit Moyock’s true pricing, SunEnergy has failed to \nshow that there is no t a  genuine issue of material fact concerning Recurrent’s \n \n \ninclusion of Moyock in its revised bids to Amazon and Nestlé.  Accordingly, \nSunEnergy’s Motion is denied.  \n2. Recurrent’s Motion \n87. Having concluded that Recurrent did not elect Moyock as a Replacement \nProject, the Court turns to whether Recurrent is entitled to summary judgment on \nits claim for a full refund of the $2 million Earleys Exclusivity Payment. \n88. Under the express terms of the  LOI, Recurrent is entitled to a full refund \nof the Earleys Exclusivity Payment if (1) SunEnergy failed to meet the TDM for the \nProject, (2) such failure was due to a wetlands issue, and (3) Recurrent made a written \nelection for a refund.  (LOI ¶ 4b.)  The evidence is undisputed that SunEnergy failed \nto meet the April 30, 2016 TDM for completion of the Earleys wetlands delineation \nreport due to a wetlands issue and, on May 2, 2016, Recurrent made a written election \nfor a full refund of the Earleys Exclusivity Payment in lieu of a Replacement Project.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11−12; Answer 3−4, ¶¶ 11−12; Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 6, 33.)   As such, \nthe Court concludes that Recurrent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its \nsecond claim for a full refund of the Ea rleys Exclusivity Payment  in the principal \namount of $2 million. \nD. Refund of the Haslett Exclusivity Payment \n89. Recurrent moves for summary judgment on its second claim , contending \nthat it is entitled to a 37.5% refund of the Haslett Exclusivity Payment pursuant to \nparagraph 4c of the LOI.  SunEnergy argues that Recurrent is not entitled to a refund \nof the Haslett Exclusivity Payment because Recurrent’s prior material breach of the \n \n \nTax Equity Provision excused SunEnergy’s obligations to further perform with \nrespect to Haslett.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n 34.) \n90. Under paragraph 4c, Recurrent is entitled to a 37.5% refund of the Haslett \nExclusivity Payment if (1) SunEnergy failed to meet the TDM  for Haslett, (2) \nRecurrent made a written election to SunEnergy to purchase a Replacement Project, \n(3) SunEnergy failed to provide a Replacement Project, and (4) Recurrent made a \nwritten election to SunEnergy for a refund.  (LOI ¶ 4c.) \n91. The evidence is und isputed that , due to the moratorium preventing the \nissuance of a SUP,  SunEnergy failed to meet the August 30, 2016 Haslett TDM for \ndiscretionary permits.   (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Exs. 43, 46.)   The next day, Recurrent \nrequested in writing that SunEnergy provide a Replacement Project.   (Pl.’s Mem. \nSupp. Ex. 8.)   SunEnergy was required to provide a Replacement Project by \nSeptember 7, 2016.   (LOI ¶ 3.)  SunEnergy never responded to Recurrent’s written \nrequest, and on September 8, 2016, Recurrent demanded in writing a 37.5% refund \nof the Haslett Exclusivity Payment.   (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 6, at 153:8−16 ; Am. \nCompl. Ex. D.)   Therefore, Recurrent is entitled to a 37.5% refund of the Haslett \nExclusivity Payment unless Recurrent’s alleged prior material breach of the Tax  \nEquity Provision excused SunEnergy’s performance obligations with respect to \nHaslett.     \n92. “The general rule governing bilateral contracts requires that if either party \nto the contract commits a material breach of the contract, the other party should be \nexcused from the obligation to perform further.”  Williams v. Habul, 219 N.C. App. \n \n \n281, 293, 724 S.E.2d 104, 112 (2012).  At the same time, however, “[f]ailure to perform \nan independent promise does not excuse nonperformance on the part  of the other \nparty.”  Lake Mary Ltd. P’ship v. Johnston, 145 N.C. App. 525, 537, 551 S.E.2d 546, \n555 (2001). \nWhether covenants are dependent or independent, and whether they are \nconcurrent on the one hand or precedent and subsequent on the other, \ndepends entirely upon the inte ntion of the parties shown by the entire \ncontract as construed in the light of the circumstances of the case, the \nnature of the contract, the relation of the parties thereto, and other \nevidence which is admissible to aid the court in determining the \nintention of the parties. \n  \nWilliams, 219 N.C. App. at 294, 724 S.E.2d at 112−13 (quoting Harris & Harris \nConstr. Co. v. Crain & Denbo, Inc., 256 N.C. 110, 117, 123 S.E.2d 590, 595 (1962)).   \n93. In Williams, plaintiff and defendants entered into a settlement agreem ent \nwhereby defendants agreed to purchase plaintiff’s membership interests in \ndefendant-companies for approximately $1 million.  In exchange, plaintiff agreed to \ndismiss the litigation within five business days of receiving payment.  Additionally, \nplaintiff bargained for a provision in the agreement concerning an electrician that \nplaintiff had recruited to work for one of the defendant-companies.  Plaintiff insisted \non including a provision in the agreement to compensate the electrician.  As a result, \nthe agreement required one of the defendant -companies to continue to employ the \nelectrician to a date certain and pay him $5,000 per month.  Defendants paid plaintiff \n$1 million in accordance with the agreement, but plaintiff contended that defendants \nbreached their obligation to employ and pay the electrician and, due to this breach, \nplaintiff did not dismiss the litigation as required by the agreement. \n \n \n94. The Court of Appeals concluded that defendants’ promise to employ and pay \nthe electrician was independent from plaintiff’s promise to dismiss the litigation.  Id. \nat 294, 724 S.E.2d at 113.  The Court reasoned that the plain language of paragraph \n5 of the agreement expressly linked plaintiff’s obligation to dismiss the litigation to \nreceiving defendants’ payment by stating that plaintiff shall dismiss the litigation \nwithin five business days of receiving payment.  Id.  Conversely, the Court noted that \nparagraph 8, the paragraph in which defendants promised to employ and pay the \nelectrician, did not reference plaintiff’s obligation to dismiss the litigation, explaining \nthat “[t]he parties opte d not to include language expressly linking Plaintiff’s \ndismissal to Defendants’ employment of [the electrician].  There is simply no nexus \nbetween the promises recited in Paragraph 5 and those recited in Paragraph 8 to \npermit construction of the promises in these separate prov isions as mutually \ndependent.”  Id. at 294−95, 724 S.E.2d at 113. \n95. Here, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the LOI make clear that Recurrent paid $2 \nmillion per Project in exchange for the exclusive rights to purchase the Projects and \nmarket the P rojects’ power.   (LOI ¶¶ 1, 3.)   In furtherance of the Proposed \nTransaction, SunEnergy agreed in paragraph 3 to develop the Projects in accordance \nwith the TDM and, if it failed to do so, agreed to provide Recurrent with a \nReplacement Project if Recurrent exercised its right to purchase a Replacement \nProject by written election to SunEnergy.   (LOI ¶ 3.)   The parties expressly linked \nparagraph 4c —in which SunEnergy promised a 37.5% refund —to SunEnergy’s \nobligation in paragraph 3 to provide a Replacement Proj ect by stating that if \n \n \nSunEnergy “fails to provide a Replacement Project as provided in [paragraph] 3 . . . , \nthen 37.5% of the Exclusivity Payment for the applicable Project will be refunded to \n[Recurrent] within sixty (60) days of the date of [Recurrent]’s written election.”  (LOI \n¶ 4c.)   \n96. On the other hand, the parties did not include such language in paragraph \n14, the Tax Equity Provision.  The Tax Equity Provision, which  obligated Recurrent \nand SunEnergy to “use best efforts to negotiate in good faith for [Recurrent] to provide \na 2016 tax -equity investment in” Williamston Speight —makes no reference to the \nExclusivity P ayments, the Projects, the Replacement Projects, or the Proposed \nTransaction.  (LOI ¶ 14.)  Just as in Williams, where there was no nexus between the \npromises at issue, there is no nexus between the promises recited in paragraphs 3 \nand 4 and those recited in the Tax Equity Provision.   \n97. Although SunEnergy’s promises to develop the Project in accordance with \nthe TDM, provide a Repla cement Project, and refund the Exclusivity P ayment may \nhave been in exchange for all of the consideration under the LOI —including \nRecurrent’s promise in the Tax Equity Provision to use its best efforts to negotiate \nthe Tax Equity Transaction in good faith —that does not transform the promises in \nparagraphs 3 and 4 and those in the Tax Equity Provision into dependent promises.  \nSee Williams, 219 N.C. App. at 295, 724 S.E.2d at 113  (“While Plaintiff is correct in \nasserting that ‘[t]he dismissal was in exchange for all of the settlement consideration,’ \nthe distinction between independent and dependent promises and the effect of a \nbreach thereof remains.” (alteration in original)).  \n \n \n98. Therefore, the Court concludes that the alleged breach of Recurrent’s \npromise under the Tax  Equity Provision did not suspend or discharge SunEnergy’s \nduty to perform under the remaining provisions of the LOI with respect to Haslett.  \nAs a result, Recurrent is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its claim against \nSunEnergy for a 37.5% refund of the Haslett Exclusivity Payment  in the principal \namount of $750,000. \nE. Reimbursement Under the Fee Letter \n99. Recurrent moves for summary judgment on its third claim for breach of the \nFee Letter, contending that it is entitled to reimbursement for its costs and expenses \nincurred in connection with the Tax Equity Transaction.  SunEnergy argues, just as \nit did with respect to a refund of the Haslett Exclusivity Payment, that Recurrent is \nnot entitled to reimbursement under the Fee Letter because Recurrent ’s prior \nmaterial breach of the Tax Equity Provision excused SunEnergy’s performance \nobligations under the Fee Letter.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n 20−21.)   \n100. The promises in the Fee Letter, however, unlike the promises in Williams \nand the promises in the LOI with r espect to Haslett and the Tax Equity Provision, \nexpressly referenced the Tax Equity Provision and the parties’ obligations \nthereunder: “In accordance with [paragraph] 14 of the LOI, [Recurrent]  . . . and \n[SunEnergy] and Kenny Habul  . . . are negotiating a potential Tax Equity \nTransaction.”  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 2.)  The Fee Letter then stated “[i]n connection \nwith the foregoing,  . . . [SunEnergy] agrees  . . . to reimburse [Recurrent] for all \nreasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by [Recurrent] in connection \n \n \nwith the Tax Equity Transaction”—thereby supplying a nexus between SunEnergy’s \npromise in the Fee Letter to reimburse Recurrent’s costs and expenses incurred in \nconnection with the Tax Equity Transaction and Recurrent’s promise in the Tax  \nEquity Provision to negotiate the Tax Equity Transaction in good faith.   (Pl.’s Mem. \nSupp. Ex. 2.) \n101. Therefore, the Court concludes that SunEnergy’s promise in the Fee Letter \nand Recurrent’s promise in the Tax Equity Provision are dependent and that a prior \nmaterial breach of Recurrent’s promise in the Tax Equity Provision would suspend \nSunEnergy’s performance obligations under the Fee Letter.  As discussed below, the \nCourt concludes that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment in \nfavor of Recurrent on SunEnergy’s counterclaim for breach of the Tax Equity \nProvision.  As a result, Recurrent is not entitled to summary judgment on its third \nclaim for breach of the Fee Letter, and its motion is denied as to this claim. \nF. SunEnergy’s Counterclaim \n102. SunEnergy asserts a counterclaim against Recurrent seeking to recover for \nRecurrent’s alleged breach of the Tax Equity Provision . SunEnergy alleges that \nRecurrent breached its obligation to use best efforts to negotiate the Tax Equity \nTransaction in good faith by imposing an artificial cap on the price that would be paid \nto SunEnergy for construction of Williamston Speight.   (Answer 13, ¶¶ 15−16.)   \nRecurrent moves for summary judgment on SunEnergy’s counterclaim, contending \nthat there is no genuine issue of material fact that Recurrent negotiated the Tax \nEquity Transaction in good faith. \n \n \n103. As discussed previously, there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether \nEliason, Recurrent’s outside tax counsel,  told Martin, SunEnergy’s outside counsel,  \nthat Recurrent would not agree to a price higher than $1.40 per watt, or whether \nEliason told Martin that an appraisal was not likely to value Williamston Speight \nhigher than $1.40 per watt.  The Court must view th is evidence in the light most \nfavorable to SunEnergy, as the non-movant.  Accordingly, in considering Recurrent’s \nMotion, the Court takes as true the evidence that Eliason , as an agent of Recurrent, \ntold Martin, an agent of SunEnergy, that Recurrent would not agree to a price higher \nthan $1.40 per watt.  \n104. SunEnergy rightly concedes that Recurrent is not bound by the Term Sheet \nand the $1.88 per watt  price therein ; instead, SunEnergy argues that there is \nsufficient evidence to support a finding that Recurrent capped the price to be paid to \nSunEnergy for construction of Williamston Speight at $1.40 per watt, an \nunreasonable value, in order to deliberately sabotage the tax equity negotiations, and \nthereby negotiated in bad faith.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n 24−26.) \n105. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to SunEnergy, the Court \nconcludes that there are genuine issue s of material fact as to whether Recurrent \nfailed to negotiate in good faith by capping the price f or construction of Williamston \nSpeight at $1.40 per watt.  First, there is evidence in the record that tends to show a \nprice of $1.40 per watt was unreasonably low.  After the initiation of this litigation, \nan independent third-party appraised the fair market value of Williamston Speight \nat approximately $1.57 per watt.  (Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Ex. 62.)  A reduction in the price \n \n \npaid to SunEnergy from $1.57 to $1.40 per watt ($0.17 less per watt) would lower the \ntotal price of t he project by approximately $3.5  million, a substantial amount .5  \nMartin testified that Duke Energy had just paid $1.88 per watt for construction of a \nsimilar project.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 9, at 39:6−12, 46:20−24.)   Eliason testified \nthat, in 2016, the market price for a solar project  tended to be b etween $1.60 and \n$2.00 per watt, (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 3, at 47:9−19), and  Fisher, Recurrent’s \nchartered financial analyst, testified that $1.40 per watt was low compared to other \ncomparable projects at that time, (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 5, at 250:1−9).  Additionally, \nHabul and Lauren LaGrua, the head of SunEnergy’s legal department, testified that \n$1.40 per watt was below SunEnergy’s construction cost.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 6, \nat 181:7−8; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 7, at 162:17−20.)   \n106. Second, there is sufficient evidence in the record from which a reasonable \njury could conclude that Recurrent’s price cap constitutes a failure to negotiate in \ngood faith.  Black’s Law Dictionary defines “good faith” as \n[a] state of mind consisting in (1) honesty i n belief or purpose, (2) \nfaithfulness to one’s duty or obligation, (3) observance of reasonable \ncommercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business, or (4) \nabsence of intent to defraud or to seek unconscionable advantage. \n \nBlack’s Law Dictionary (10 ed. 2014); see also Merriam-Webster (defining “good faith” \nas “honesty or lawfulness of purpose”; “honesty in dealing with other people”; and \n                                                 \n5 The appraisal noted that the system installed at Williamston Speight was estimated \nto generate 20,841,000 watts (DC) of electricity, as opposed to the 15 MWac estimated \nin the Term Sheet.  At $1.40 per watt, the total cost for Williamston Speight would \nbe $29,177,400.  The appraisal valued Williamston Speight at $32.8 million. \n \n \n“honesty, fairness, and lawfulness of purpose: absence of any intent to defraud, act \nmaliciously, or take unfair advantage”).      \n107. Recurrent argues that the price of $1.40 per watt was a result of the \nimproper inclusion of the RECs in the Williamston Speight model, and that it had \nevery right to make a downward adjustment after learning material information that \nnegatively affected the project’s value.   (Pl.’s Reply 6−7.)   The Court agrees that \nRecurrent was not bound to a certain price term and that there may be circumstances \nunder which Recurrent could, in good faith, make a downward adjust ment in the \nprice.  Nevertheless, the Court must take as true the evidence offered by SunEnergy \nthat Recurrent, without having an appraisal, informed SunEnergy that it would not \nagree to a price higher than $1.40 per watt—not that an appraisal was likely to value \nthe project at $1.40 per watt due to the REC issue.   \n108. Further, there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could \nconclude Recurrent imposed the $1.40 per watt price cap for reasons other than its \nvaluation of the project once it remov ed the RECs.  A  price of $1.40 per watt would \nsignificantly reduce the amount of Recurrent’s investment in the Holding Company—\nthe amount of  Recurrent’s investment at a price of $1.40 per watt would be \napproximately $1.25 million less than it would be at a  price of $1.57 per watt  and \n$3.75 million less than it would be at a price of $1.88 per watt .6  Moreover, around \n                                                 \n6 This value is based on Recurrent’s anticipated investment amount of $1.25 for every \n$1.00 of investment tax credit.  As noted above, the investment tax credits are equal \nto 30% of the investment tax credit basis, which is approximately equal to the cost of \nthe project.  ( Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 2, at 266:11−13; Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Tab 3, at \n37:15−16, 38:22−39:14 .)  At $1.57 per watt, the amount of investment tax credits \n \n \nthe same time that Recurrent imposed the price cap, the evidence tends to show that \nRecurrent learned that SunEnergy was in financial difficul ty.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n \nDep. Ex. 22.)      \n109. “Summary judgment is rarely proper when a state of mind such as intent \nor knowledge is at issue.”  Craddock v. Craddock, 188 N.C. App. 806, 812, 656 S.E.2d \n716, 720 (2008).   Whether Recurrent acted in good faith “is precisely the type of \nquestion that depends for its resolution on a consideration of the subjective intentions \nand motivation of” Recurrent.  Smith v. Currie, 40 N.C. App. 739, 743, 253 S.E.2d \n645, 647 (1979).   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to SunEnergy, a \nreasonable jury could conclude that Recurrent imposed the price cap for the purpose \nof sabotaging its negotiations with SunEnergy  or significantly lowering its \ninvestment amount, rather than because it believed that the true  cost of the project \nwas $1.40 per watt.  The Court believes that, at least on the record before the Court, \nRecurrent’s motivation for imposing the price cap, and whether such a motivation \nconstitutes a failure to negotiate in good faith in breach of the Tax Equity Provision, \nis not properly decided on a motion for summary judgment and is a question of fact \nfor the jury.  Accordingly, Recurrent is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on \nSunEnergy’s counterclaim, and Recurrent’s Motion as to this claim is denied. \n  \n                                                 \nwould be approximately $9,816,111, yielding a total investment of approximately \n$12,270,138.80.  Applying these sam e calculations to a price of $1.40 and $1.88 per \nwatt, Recurrent’s total investment would be approximately $10,941,525 and \n$14,692,905, respectively.  \n \n \nVI. CONCLUSION \n110. For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES SunEnergy’s Motion and \nGRANTS in part and DENIES in part Recurrent’s Motion as follows: \nA. The Court GRANTS summary judgment in favor of Recurrent and \nagainst SunEnergy on Recurrent’s second claim for breach of the LOI \nto the extent this claim pertains to a refund of 100% of the Earleys \nExclusivity Payment and 37.5% of the Haslett Exclusivity Payment.  \nThis grant of partial summary judgment in Recurrent’s favor is not \na final judgment and may be subject to credit or offset depending \nupon the outcome of other claims to be tried to a jury.  \nB. The Court DENIES summary judgment on Recurrent’s third claim \nfor breach of the Fee Letter, and this claim shall proceed to trial.  \nC. The Court DENIES summary judgment on  SunEnergy’s \ncounterclaim for breach of the LOI, and this claim shall proceed to \ntrial.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of June, 2018. \n \n \n /s/ Michael L.
