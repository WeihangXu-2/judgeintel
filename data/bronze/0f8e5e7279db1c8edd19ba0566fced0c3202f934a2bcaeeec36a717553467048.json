  "raw_text": "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n24CV001348-590 \n \nTHAO PHUONG BUI, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nKHANH NGOC PHAN and GOLDEN \nROOSTER, LLC, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANT PHAN’S MOTION TO \nDISMISS AMENDED COMPLAINT \n \nVillmer Caudill, PLLC, by Bo Caudill and Megan Cobb, for Plaintiff \nThao Phuong Bui. \n \nNorman Legal PLLC, by Jason G. Norman, for Defendant Khanh Ngoc \nPhan.  \n \nConrad, Judge.  \n1. This case arises out of a dispute between Golden Rooster, LLC’s members—\nPlaintiff Thao Phuong Bui and Defendant Khanh Ngoc Phan.   Pending is  Phan’s \nmotion to dismiss the amended complaint.  (ECF No. 54.)  The motion is fully briefed, \nand the Court held a hearing on 18 October 2024.  For the following reasons, the \nCourt DENIES the motion.  \n2. The key allegations are these.   Golden Rooster is a two- person real estate \ncompany.  I ts only members and managers are Bui and Phan, with each  holding a \nfifty-percent interest.  As coequal managers, neither can act alone.  In February 2023, \nthe pair became estranged (Bui says that Phan’s infidelity ended their seventeen-year \nromantic relationship) and agreed to part ways.  Although they decided that it would \nbe best for Phan to buy Bui’s interest in Golden Rooster, their negotiations stalled .  \nBui v. Phan, 2024 NCBC 70. \nIn the interim and without Bui’s consent, Phan distributed company cash to herself, \nhired a lawyer to represent not only herself but also Golden Rooster in  the buyout \nnegotiations, and transferred $250,000 from a company bank account to a new \naccount that Bui could not access.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 12, 15–21, 25, 29, 30, 39, ECF \nNo. 51; Op. Agrmt. ¶ 17, ECF No. 51.2.) \n3. Bui’s amended complaint includes two claims.  One is for breach of Golden \nRooster’s operating agreement  based on allegations that Phan made managerial \ndecisions without Bui’s consent.  The other is for  a declaratory judgment that Phan \n“is subject to expulsion from membership” because of  these acts, leaving Bui as “the \nsole member-manager of Golden Rooster.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 42, 45.) \n4. In her motion to dismiss, Phan contends that Bui lacks standing  to assert \nthese claims.  (See ECF No. 54.)  This is so, according to Phan, because  both claims \nare claims accruing to Golden Rooster .  She argues that Bui ought to have asserted \nthem derivatively on the company’s behalf  and that Bui has not alleged any special \ncircumstances that might support an individual claim, such as a personal injury \ndistinct from the company’s injury. \n5. The Court disagrees.  Members of an LLC have standing to sue individually \nto enforce contractual rights granted to them by the LLC’s operating agreement.  See, \ne.g., Emrich Enters., LLC, v. Hornwood, Inc. , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *27 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Apr. 8, 2020).  This includes  the right “to participate in management  \ndecisions.”  Gruber v. Wright, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 15, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 17, \n2022); see also 759 Ventures, LLC v. GCP Apt. Investors, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 82, \nat * 9–11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 13, 2018) ( concluding that a claim to enforce a \ncontractual right to “exert management authority” is a direct claim). \n6. Enforcing a personal right  is exactly what Bui aims to do  here.  Golden \nRooster’s operating agreement names  Bui and Phan as managers, ( see Op. Agrmt. \n¶¶ 17, 23), subject to the default rule that “[e]ach manager has  equal right s to \nparticipate in the management of the LLC and its business,” N.C.G.S. § 57D-3-20(b).  \nAs alleged, Phan deprived Bui of that  right by making a distribution without Bui’s \nconsent, unilaterally hiring an attorney  to represent Golden Rooster , and moving  \ncompany funds to a new  account that Bui could not access .  Thus, i n claiming that \nPhan breached the operating agreement, Bui seeks to enforce her rights and remedy \nher injuries, not those of Golden Rooster .  See 759 Ventures, 2018 NCBC LEXIS  82, \nat *9.   \n7. Phan suggests that Bui cannot show any monetary damages from any  \nalleged breach and that, as a result, her injury is n’t real.  That’s incorrect.  Phan’s \none-way distribution to herself may well have caused monetary harm to Bui, who did \nnot receive a matching distribution.  (See Op. Agrmt. ¶ 8 (“Each Member will receive \nan equal share of any Distribution.”).)  And, in any event, not all injuries are financial: \nthe loss of managerial rights is itself an injury recognized by law.  Proving that Phan \nbreached the operating agreement “would entitle [Bui] to nominal damages at least,” \neven without evidence of compensatory damages .  Bowen v. Fidelity Bank, 209 N.C. \n140, 144 (1936).  In sum, Bui has alleged a breach of her contractual rights, and she \nhas standing to sue directly to remedy that alleged breach.  See Emrich Enters., 2020 \nNCBC LEXIS 45, at *27; 759 Ventures, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *9. \n8. Bui also has standing to seek declaratory relief.  Golden Rooster’s operating \nagreement permits the “[ e]xpulsion of a M ember . . . on application by .  . . another \nMember” in a few circumstances, including “where it has been judicially determined \nthat the Member” has materially breached the agreement or a duty owed to the other \nmembers.  (Op. Agrmt. ¶  29.)  Bui claims that Phan crossed that line, and became  \nsubject to expulsion , when she began managing Golden Rooster without Bui’s \nconsent.  Phan denies having done anything worthy of expulsion.  Plus, Phan disputes \nBui’s interpretation of the operating agreement, arguing that  one member may not \nseek another’s involuntary withdrawal  by judicial decree but must instead do so  by \nway of an internal vote of all the members.  \n9. This dispute between contracting parties about the meaning and effect of \ntheir contract  is just the sort of actual, genuine controversy that is suited to a \ndeclaratory-judgment action.  See, e.g., Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Roberts, 261 N.C. \n285, 287 (1964).  By statute, a contracting party may seek to “have determined any \nquestion of construction or validity arising under” the contract.   N.C.G.S. § 1-254.  \nThis does not necessarily mean that Bui will prevail.  She  may not.  But she  surely \nhas standing to ask the Court to end the uncertainty and resolve disagreements about \nthe correct construction of the operating agreement, the existence or nonexistence of \nher perceived contractual right to expel Phan, and any resulting effect on the makeup \nof Golden Rooster’s membership.  See Epic Chophouse, LLC v. Morasso, 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 55, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2019)  (concluding that LLC member had \nstanding to seek declaration as to company’s membership and meaning of its \noperating agreement).   \n10. Finally, Phan’s motion includes one additional ground for dismissal: that the \noperating agreement shields members from liability for anything less than  \n“intentional wrongdoing .”  ( Op. Agrmt. ¶  62.)  Because Phan did not address this \nargument in her brief, the Court declines to consider it.  See BCR 7.2 (“A party should \n. . . brief each issue and argument that the party desires the Court to rule upon and \nthat the party intends to raise at a hearing.”). \n11. The Court DENIES Phan’s motion. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of October, 2024. \n \n \n      /s/ Adam M. Conrad   \n     Adam M.
