Terpening for Plaintiffs. \n \nBrown Law LLP by Gregory W. Brown and Joshua M. Hiller for Defendants. \n \nDiaz, Judge. \n{1} Before the Court is the Motion of Defendants Ken Condra (“Condra”), \nDaniel Prevost (“Prevost”), Marc Miller (“Miller”), Peter Fontaine (“Fontaine”), Tim \nLongbine (“Longbine”), and David Phillips (“Phillips”), collectively “Defendants,” to \nDismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Rules 9(b) and 12(b)(6) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“the Motion to Dismiss”). \n{2} After considering the Court file, the Motion to Dismiss, the briefs,1 and the \narguments of counsel, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants’ \nMotion. \n \nI. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n{3} On 16 December 2008, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this case.   \n{4} On 16 January 2009, Defendants designated this case as mandatory \ncomplex business, and it was assigned to me on 21 January 2009. \n{5} On 27 February 2009, Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss and \nsupporting brief. \n{6} Plaintiffs filed a response brief on 27 March 2009. \n{7} Defendants filed their reply brief on 17 April 2009. \n{8} The Court heard oral argument on the Motion on 22 April 2009. \n \nII. \nTHE FACTS2\nA. \nTHE PARTIES \n{9} Plaintiff W. Greg Green (“Green”) is a shareholder of MedOasis, Inc. \n(“MedOasis” or “the Company”) who has continually held MedOasis stock since \n2002.  (Compl. ¶ 2.) \n{10} Green previously served on the board of MedOasis (the “Board”) and as \nMedOasis’ CEO.  (Compl. ¶ 2.) \n{11} Plaintiff Kenneth Ellington, M.D. (“Ellington”) is a shareholder of \nMedOasis who has continually held MedOasis stock since 2002.  (Compl. ¶ 3.) \n                                                 \n1 Attached to Defendants’ brief in support of the Motion to Dismiss are three (3) exhibits:  Plaintiffs’ \n10 September 2008 pre-suit demand letter and two (2) sets of Company Board meeting minutes.  At \nthe hearing of this matter, Plaintiffs agreed that the Court could consider these materials without \nconverting the Motion to Dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.  \n2 The facts are taken from Plaintiffs’ Complaint, which the Court accepts as true for purposes of \nresolving the Motion. \n{12} Ellington previously served on the Board.  (Compl. ¶ 3.) \n{13} Nominal Defendant MedOasis is a North Carolina corporation with its \nprincipal place of business in Asheville, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶ 4.) \n{14} MedOasis provides billing and collection services to anesthesiologist \npractices.  (Compl. ¶ 12.) \n{15} Defendant Condra is the Company’s CEO, and he also serves on the Board.  \n(Compl. ¶ 5.) \n{16} Defendant Prevost is a Company officer and a member of the Board.  \n(Compl. ¶ 6.) \n{17} Defendant Miller is the former CEO of the Company and a former Board \nmember.  (Compl ¶ 7.) \n{18} Defendant Fontaine serves as the current chairman of the Board.  (Compl. \n¶ 8.) \n{19} Defendant Longbine has served on the Board since 5 August 2008.  \n(Compl. ¶ 9.) \n{20} Defendant Phillips also serves on the Board.  (Compl. ¶ 10.) \nB. \nTHE CLAIMS \n{21} In 2000, Plaintiff Green was a consultant for Asheville Anesthesia \nAssociates (“AAA”).  (Compl. ¶ 13.)  Green later became AAA’s CEO.  (Compl. ¶ 13.) \n{22} MedOasis was incorporated on or about 11 December 2001 as Medical \nSpecialty Services, Inc.  (Compl. ¶ 14.) \n{23} Green created the Company to manage the billing and collection services of \nAAA, as well as other anesthesiology practices.  (Compl. ¶¶ 12–13.) \n{24} The Company’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”) authorized \nMedOasis to issue up to one million (1,000,000) shares of common stock.  (Compl. \n¶ 14; Compl., Ex. A, at 1.) \n{25} There was no provision in the Articles for any other class of stock, nor were \nthere any provisions addressing the redemption of shares.  (Compl. ¶ 14; Compl., \nEx. A, at 1.) \n{26} The Company’s original Bylaws, however, did contain a provision \ngoverning redemption of shares that would be triggered by certain events, \n“including the termination of a Management Services Agreement between [the \nCompany] and a client medical practice in which the shareholder holds [an] \nownership interest or is an employee.”  (Compl. ¶ 19.)  \n{27} On or about 19 November 2002, MedOasis issued 26,000 shares to Green. \n(Compl. ¶ 16.)  \n{28} The Company issued an additional 174,000 shares to Green in or around \n2004.  (Compl. ¶ 16.)  \n{29} As part of the Company’s business model, the physicians in the anesthesia \ngroups serviced by the Company participated as shareholders in the Company.  \n(Compl. ¶ 17.)  Accordingly, MedOasis issued 26,000 shares to Ellington, who was a \nphysician at AAA, on or about 19 November 2002.  (Compl. ¶¶ 15, 17.)   \n{30} Green and Ellington also served on the Board.  (Compl. ¶ 14.) \n{31} In November 2005, the Board removed Green as CEO of MedOasis at a \nspecial meeting of the Board.  (Compl. ¶ 20.)  Additionally, Green and Ellington \nwere removed from the Company’s Board.  (Compl. ¶ 20.) \n{32} Green and Ellington, however, retained their shares after being voted off \nthe Board.  (Compl. ¶ 20.) \n{33} In February 2006, the Board offered to purchase Green’s 200,000 shares \nfor $0.898 per share.  (Compl. ¶ 22.) \n{34} At the time of the offer, Defendant Miller—MedOasis’ CEO at the time \n(Compl. ¶ 22; Pls’. Mem. Law Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 3–4 & n.5)—valued the \nshares at $0.99 per share.  (Compl. ¶ 22.) \n{35} Green refused the Board’s offer to purchase his shares.  (Compl. ¶ 22.) \n{36} On 13 August 2006, Ellington ceased to be a AAA physician, but he \nretained his shares in MedOasis.  (Compl. ¶ 23.) \n{37} MedOasis has not held an annual shareholders’ meeting since October \n2006.  (Compl. ¶ 24.)  As such, there have been no elections for directors as provided \nfor in the Company’s Bylaws, and only one current Board member was elected at an \nannual meeting of its shareholders.  (Compl. ¶ 24.) \n{38} Since Green and Ellington were removed from the Board, the Company \nhas failed to provide any financial information to its shareholders.  (Compl. ¶ 24.) \n{39} In October 2006, MedOasis amended its Articles to increase the number of \nauthorized shares from 1 million to 1.5 million.  (Compl. ¶ 26; Compl., Ex. B.) \n{40} On or about 3 July 2007, the Board adopted new Bylaws.  (Compl. ¶ 27; \nCompl., Ex. C.) \n{41} On or about 31 March 2008, MedOasis named Ken Condra as its CEO and \nawarded him 60,000 shares, which shares (according to Plaintiffs) did not become \nfully vested until 31 December 2008.  (Compl. ¶ 29.) \n{42} On 31 May 2008, MedOasis terminated AAA’s Management Services \nAgreement.  (Compl. ¶ 30.) \n{43} AAA was the oldest and most profitable client of the Company.  (Compl. \n¶ 30.) \n{44} On 23 June 2008, MedOasis wrote to Ellington to advise him that a \nprovision in the amended Bylaws made it necessary for the Company to redeem \nEllington’s shares in light of the Company’s termination of AAA’s Management \nServices Agreement.  (Compl. ¶¶ 31–32.)3 \n{45} The Company retained Dixon Hughes CPAs (“Dixon Hughes”) to render a \nvaluation opinion for the shares to be redeemed.  (Compl. ¶ 33.) \n{46} Dixon Hughes told MedOasis management that the shares were valued \nbetween $0.00 and $0.40 per share.  (Compl. ¶ 33.) \n{47} The Company thereafter set the redemption share price at $0.17 per share.  \n(Compl. ¶ 33.) \n{48} The Company’s 23 June 2008 letter to Ellington advised him that he would \nreceive a check in the amount of $4,420.00 for his shares if Ellington complied with \ncertain conditions, which included signing an agreement to indemnify the Company \nand release it (and its officers and directors) from all claims.  (Compl. ¶¶ 34–35.) \n                                                 \n3 The Company sent similar redemption letters to other shareholders.  (Compl. ¶¶ 31–32.)  \n{49} Ellington did not agree to the redemption.  (Compl. ¶ 35.) \n{50} In July 2008, twenty (20) shareholders, each of whom received similar \nredemption notices from the Company, granted Ellington “irrevocable proxies to act, \nvote and execute consents with respect to all of their shares of MedOasis as fully \nand to the same extent and effect as those shareholders would be entitled to act, \nvote and execute consents themselves.”  (Compl. ¶ 38.) \n{51} The proxies granted to Ellington totaled 481,000 shares (the “AAA \nShares”).  (Compl. ¶ 38.) \n{52} On 4 August 2008, Green sent MedOasis a demand for a special meeting of \nthe Company’s shareholders, to be held 16 August 2008, for the following purposes:  \n“(a) deletion from the amended Bylaws of the last two sentences of Article V, \nSection 2, first paragraph;4 (b) removal of one or more members of [the Board]; and \n(c) election of a new Board of Directors.”  (Compl. ¶ 37.) \n{53} In response to Green’s demand, the Board called an emergency meeting for \n5 August 2008 at 7:55 p.m.  (Compl. ¶ 39.) \n{54} Condra, Prevost, Phillips, Evans, Fontaine, and Longbine were present at \nthe 5 August 2008 meeting.  (Compl. ¶ 39.) \n{55} At this meeting, the Board discussed the voting power of Green and \nEllington at the upcoming shareholder meeting, who, combined, would control and \nvote 707,000 of the Company’s shares.  (Compl. ¶ 40) \n{56} At the time, the Board controlled the remaining 440,109 of the 1,147,109 \nshares that were issued and outstanding.  (Compl. ¶ 40.) \n{57} The Board determined at the 5 August 2008 meeting that neither \nEllington nor the AAA Shares, as a group, would have any voting rights at the \nupcoming shareholder meeting.  (Compl. ¶ 41.) \n{58} The Board also decided that it would not give notice of the shareholder \nmeeting to Ellington or any of the shareholders who had granted Ellington a proxy.  \n(Compl. ¶ 41.) \n                                                 \n4 These provisions in the amended Bylaws required that at least two (2) members of the Board be \nmembers of the Company’s management team.  (Compl., Ex. C, at 4.) \n{59} Furthermore, the Board voted to issue 140,000 shares each to Condra and \nPrevost at a price well below their market value or fair value.  (Compl. ¶ 42.)5  As a \nresult, the Board controlled a majority of the issued and outstanding shares.  \n(Compl. ¶ 42.)   \n{60} On 7 August 2008, the Company sent notice of the special shareholder \nmeeting set for 18 August 2008. (Compl. ¶ 48.) \n{61} Neither Ellington nor the shareholders who granted him proxies received \nnotice of the shareholder meeting.  (Compl. ¶ 48.) \n{62} The Board also failed to set a record date for shares entitled to vote at the \nspecial shareholder meeting.  (Compl. ¶ 46.) \n{63} At the 18 August 2008 shareholder meeting, Ellington tendered the \noriginal proxies to the Board, but the Company refused to allow Ellington to vote \nhis shares or those granted to him by proxy.  (Compl. ¶ 49.) \n{64} Over the objections of Green and Ellington, the Board allowed Condra and \nPrevost to vote the 280,000 shares that were issued to them at the 5 August 2008 \nemergency Board meeting, and also allowed Condra to vote the 60,000 shares issued \nto him in March 2008.  (Compl. ¶ 50.) \n{65} After tallying the votes allowed to be cast, the Company determined that \nGreen’s first two (2) motions—deleting the portion of the Bylaws requiring two (2) \nBoard members to be members of the Company’s management team and removing \nmembers of the Board—failed.  (Compl. ¶ 51. )  The Company refused to allow a vote \non Green’s third motion to elect a new Board.  (Compl. ¶ 51.) \n{66} On 10 September 2008, Plaintiffs made written demand on the Company \nto take suitable action with respect to the actions taken by the Board immediately \nbefore and during the shareholder meeting.  (Compl. ¶ 52.) \n{67} The Company did not respond to Plaintiffs’ written demand.  (Compl. \n¶ 52.) \n \n \n                                                 \n5 Condra and Prevost executed promissory notes for the newly issued shares.  (Compl. ¶ 43.) \nIII. \nCONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES \nA. \nDEFENDANTS’ CONTENTIONS \n{68} Defendant Miller contends that the Complaint should be dismissed as \nagainst him because he was not a director, officer, or employee of the Company \nduring the relevant time periods.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 5, 19.) \n{69} All Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ derivative claims (Counts I–VIII of \nthe Complaint) fail to state a claim on which relief may be granted.  (Mem. Law \nSupp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 4.) \n{70} Specifically, Defendants contend that, while these claims are crafted as a \ndemand for damages inflicted upon MedOasis, they are, in fact, based on Plaintiffs’ \nallegations that they themselves were treated unfairly.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs.’ \nMot. Dismiss 4, 6–9.) \n{71} In their reply, Defendants also contend that the derivative claims should \nbe dismissed because Plaintiffs did not make an adequate pre-suit demand on the \nBoard.  (Reply Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 2–4.) \n{72} Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs fail to allege that Defendants acted \nin bad faith, were uninformed, or did not believe they were acting in the best \ninterests of MedOasis and, therefore, have failed to overcome Defendants’ immunity \nunder the business judgment rule.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 4, 9–13.) \n{73} Defendants argue separately that Counts III, IV, and VI—abuse of control, \ngross mismanagement, and corporate waste, respectively—should be dismissed \nbecause North Carolina law does not recognize such assertions as distinct claims.  \n(Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 5, 13.)6 \n{74} Defendants contend further that Count VII should be dismissed because \nPlaintiffs have failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment, in that Plaintiffs fail to \nallege which particular Defendant was unjustly enriched and fail to identify the \n                                                 \n6 On page 5 of their opening brief, Defendants erroneously refer to “Counts II, IV, and VI” instead of \nCounts III, IV, and VI. \nbenefit such Defendant purportedly obtained from MedOasis.  (Mem. Law Supp. \nDefs’. Mot. Dismiss 5, 13–15.) \n{75} Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ derivative claim for rescission should \nbe dismissed because such a claim sounds in fraud, which Plaintiffs have failed to \nallege with the particularity required by Rule 9(b) of the North Carolina Rules of \nCivil Procedure.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 5, 15–16.) \n{76} Defendants also contend the Court should dismiss all claims alleged \nagainst the Defendants in their individual capacities because Plaintiffs fail to allege \nfacts that would overcome the immunity they possess pursuant to North Carolina \nlaw and the Company’s Articles.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 5, 16–19.) \n{77} Defendants further contend the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs’ direct \nclaim for breach of fiduciary duty (Count IX) because Plaintiffs have not alleged the \nexistence of a recognizable fiduciary duty the director-Defendants owe to Plaintiffs \nas shareholders of MedOasis.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 5, 19–21.) \n{78} Finally, Defendants urge the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs’ direct claim for \nconstructive fraud because Plaintiffs have failed to allege the facts and \ncircumstances that would create a relationship of trust and confidence between \nPlaintiffs and Defendants and have failed to allege the circumstances of the alleged \nfraud and deceit with the required particularity.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. \nDismiss 5, 21–23.)  \nB. \nPLAINTIFFS’ CONTENTIONS  \n{79} Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that their Complaint sufficiently \nalleges an injury to MedOasis and, therefore, alleges proper derivative claims.  (Pls’. \nMem. Law. Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 9–11.) \n{80} Plaintiffs argue that the business judgment rule is not implicated because \nthey have alleged that Defendants’ actions were self-interested and that their \nactions served no legitimate business purpose.  (Pls’. Mem. Law. Opp’n Defs’. Mot. \nDismiss 13.)  They also allege that the Board’s actions to protect itself from being \nremoved by shareholders are not protected by the business judgment rule.  (Pls’. \nMem. Law. Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 13–14.) \n{81} With respect to Plaintiff’s claims for abuse of control, gross \nmismanagement, and corporate waste (Counts III, IV, and VI), Plaintiffs contend \nNorth Carolina courts have recognized these claims and, alternatively, that they are \n“varieties of breach of fiduciary duty.”  (Pls’. Mem. Law. Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss \n21–22.) \n{82} Plaintiffs contend they have stated valid claims for constructive fraud and \nrescission in that they have alleged a breach of Defendants’ fiduciary duties and \nresulting damage to the Company, and that Rule 9(b) imposes no heightened \npleading requirements for constructive fraud.  (Pls’. Mem. Law. Opp’n Defs’. Mot. \nDismiss 23–24.) \n{83} Plaintiffs further contend Defendants are not immune from liability \nbecause an exculpation clause cannot save a director from the following types of \nallegations, all of which are alleged in the Complaint:  self-dealing; self-interested \ntransactions; participation in a transaction from which he derived an improper \npersonal benefit; or conspiracy to violate fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, candor \nand/or independence.  (Pls’. Mem. Law. Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 19–21.) \n{84} Finally, Plaintiffs contend their direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty \nand constructive fraud are valid because majority shareholders owe a fiduciary duty \nto minority shareholders and that minority shareholders in a closely held \ncorporation may bring individual actions against directors in certain circumstances, \nsuch as those at issue in this case.  (Pls’. Mem. Law. Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 24–\n26.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIV. \nPRINCIPLES OF LAW \nA. \nRULE 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS \n{85} The essential question on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of \nthe North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure is “‘whether, as a matter of law, the \nallegations of the complaint, treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted under some legal theory.’”  Craven v. Cope, 188 N.C. \nApp. 814, 816, 656 S.E.2d 729, 731–32 (2008) (quoting Hunter v. Guardian Life Ins. \nCo. of Am., 162 N.C. App. 477, 480, 593 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004)). \n{86} To that end, “‘[t]he complaint must be liberally construed, and the court \nshould not dismiss the complaint unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff \ncould not prove any set of facts to support his claim which would entitle him to \nrelief.’”  Id. at 86, 656 S.E.2d at 731–32 (italicized in original) (quoting Hunter, 162 \nN.C. App. at 480, 593 S.E.2d at 598).  Nevertheless, \n[d]ismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when one or more of the \nfollowing three conditions is satisf ied:  (1) when on its face the \ncomplaint reveals no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when on its face \nthe complaint reveals the absence of fact sufficient to make a good \nclaim; and (3) when some fact disc losed in the complaint necessarily \ndefeats plaintiff’s claim. \n \nJohnson v. Bollinger, 86 N.C. App. 1, 4, 356 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1987) (citing Oates v. \nJAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985)). \n{87} Further, “when the allegations in the complaint give sufficient notice of the \nwrong complained of, an incorrect choice of legal theory should not result in \ndismissal of the claim if the allegations are sufficient to state a claim under some \nlegal theory.”  Stanback v. Stanback, 297 N.C. 181, 202, 254 S.E.2d 611, 625 (1979). \n \n \n \n \nB. \nNORTH CAROLINA’S DEMAND REQUIREMENT \n{88} Pursuant to North Carolina’s demand requirement: \nNo shareholder may commence a derivative proceeding until:  (1) [a] \nwritten demand has been made upon the corporation to take suitable \naction; and (2) 90 days have expire d from the date the demand was \nmade unless, prior to the expiration of the 90 days, the shareholder \nwas notified that the corporation rejected the demand, or unless \nirreparable injury to the corporation would result by waiting for the \nexpiration of the 90-day period. \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-7-42 (2007).  \n{89} A plaintiff’s failure to satisfy this demand requirement constitutes an \n“insurmountable bar” to recovery.  See Allen v. Ferrera, 141 N.C. App. 284, 287, 540 \nS.E.2d 761, 764 (2000) (citing Roney v. Joyner, 86 N.C. App. 81, 356 S.E.2d 401 \n(1987)). \nC. \nFIDUCIARY DUTIES OF A DIRECTOR  \n{90} “Under North Carolina law, directors of a corporation generally owe a \nfiduciary duty to the corporation, and where it is alleged that directors have \nbreached this duty, the action is properly maintained by the corporation rather than \nany individual creditor or stockholder.”  Keener Lumber Co., Inc. v. Perry, 149 N.C. \nApp. 19, 26, 560 S.E.2d 817, 822 (2002) (citing Underwood v. Stafford, 270 N.C. 700, \n703, 155 S.E.2d 211, 213 (1967)).7   \n{91} Specifically, a director is required to discharge his duties as a director “(1) \n[i]n good faith; (2) [w]ith the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \n                                                 \n7 As the leading commentator on North Carolina corporation law has noted, the drafters of the North \nCarolina Business Corporation Act of 1990  \n \nrecognized that directors have a duty to ac t for the benefit of all shareholders of the \ncorporation, but they intended to avoid stating a duty owed directly by the directors \nto the shareholders that might be construe d to give shareholders a direct right of \naction on claims that should be asserted derivatively.   \n \nRussell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law § 14.01[2], at 14-4 (7th ed. \n2008) (citing N.C. Commentary § 55-8-30 (1989) (second paragraph)).      \nwould exercise under similar circumstances; and (3) [i]n a manner he reasonably \nbelieves to be in the best interests of the corporation.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-8-30(a) \n(2007).  \n{92} In North Carolina, corporations may adopt provisions in their Articles of \nIncorporation that limit or eliminate personal liability of the corporation’s directors \nfor monetary damages for a breach of any duty, with certain exceptions.  See N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 55-2-02(b)(3) (2007).  An exculpatory provision, however,  \ncannot limit or eliminate liability with respect to (1) acts or omissions \nthat the director at the time of such breach knew or believed were \nclearly in conflict with the best interests of the corporation; (2) any \nliability under [section 55-8-33 of the North Carolina General Statutes] \nfor unlawful distributions; (3) any tr ansaction from which the director \nderived an improper personal benefit; or (4) acts or omissions occurring \nprior to the date that the provision in the articles of incorporation \nbecame effective. \n \nRussell M. Robinson, II, supra, at § 18.12 (footnote omitted); see N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 55-2-02(b)(3).  \n{93} Essentially, section 55-2-02(b)(3) permits the shareholders of a corporation \nto limit or eliminate a breach of the duty of care as the basis of a claim for money \ndamages.  Robinson, supra, at § 18.12.  It does not allow shareholders to limit or \neliminate injunctive relief against directors, nor does it allow shareholders to limit \nor eliminate liability for breaches of the directors’ duties of loyalty or good faith.  Id. \nD. \nTHE BUSINESS JUDGMENT RULE \n{94} North Carolina recognizes the business judgment rule.  This rule \n“operates primarily as a rule of evidence or judicial review and creates, \nfirst, an initial evidentiary presumption that in making a decision the \ndirectors acted with due care (i.e., on an informed basis) and in good \nfaith in the honest belief that their action was in the best interest of \nthe corporation, and second, absent rebuttal of the initial presumption, \na powerful substantive presumption that a decision by a loyal and \ninformed board will not be overturned by a court unless it cannot be \nattributed to any rational business purpose.” \n \nHammonds v. Lumbee River Elec. Mbrshp. Corp., 178 N.C. App. 1, 20–21, 631 \nS.E.2d 1, 13 (2006) (quoting Russell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina \nCorporation Law, § 14.06, at 14-16 to 14-17 (2005)). \n{95} This presumption “‘can be rebutted by a showing that the board violated \none of its fiduciary duties in connection with the challenged transaction.’”  Wachovia \nCapital Partners, LLC v. Frank Harvey Inv. Family Ltd. P’ship, 2007 NCBC 7 ¶ 22 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 5, 2007), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2007%20NCBC%207.pdf (quoting Emerald \nPartners v. Berlin, 787 A.2d 85, 91 (Del. 2001)). \n{96} To rebut this presumption, a plaintiff must present “more than bare \nallegations of breaches of fiduciary duties on the part of directors.”  Id. at ¶ 23.  \nSpecifically, in order to survive a motion to dismiss, the Complaint “‘must allege, in \nother than conclusory terms, that the board was inattentive or uninformed, acted in \nbad faith, or that the board’s decision was unreasonable.’”  Id. (quoting Winters v. \nFirst Union Corp., 2001 NCBC 8 ¶ 17 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 13, 2001), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2001%20NCBC%2008.htm).  \n{97} Additionally, “if a board acts for the ‘sole purpose of thwarting a \nshareholder vote,’ the business judgment rule does not apply, and the board must \nprove it had a ‘compelling justification for such action.’”  First Union Corp. v. \nSunTrust Banks, Inc., 2001 NCBC 9A ¶ 47 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2001), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2001%20NCBC%2009A.pdf (quoting \nBlasius Indus., Inc. v. Atlas Corp., 564 A.2d 651, 661–62 (Del. Ch. 1988)). \nE. \nCONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD \n{98} Constructive fraud arises in circumstances in which a confidential \nrelationship exists.  Terry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 83, 273 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1981).  A \npresumption of fraud “arises upon a breach of a confidential or fiduciary \nrelationship.”  Id. (quoting Rhodes v. Jones, 232 N.C. 547, 548–49, 61 S.E.2d 725, \n726 (1950)). \n \n{99} Specifically, \n[a] constructive fraud claim requires proof of circumstances:  “(1) which \ncreated the relation of trust and confidence [the ‘fiduciary’ \nrelationship], and (2) [which] led up to and surrounded the \nconsummation of the transaction in which defendant is alleged to have \ntaken advantage of his position of trust to the hurt of plaintiff.”\n  Terry \nv. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 83, 273 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1981) (citation omitted).  \nPut simply, a plaintiff must show (1 ) the existence of a fiduciary duty, \nand (2) a breach of that duty. \n \nGovernor’s Club, Inc. v. Governors Club Ltd. P’ship, 152 N.C. App. 240, 249–50, 567 \nS.E.2d 781, 787–88 (2002) (quoting Keener Lumber, 149 N.C. App. at 28, 560 S.E.2d \nat 824). \n{100} Thus, if Plaintiffs have stated a claim for breach of fiduciary duty vis-à-vis \nthe Company, they have also stated a claim for constructive fraud. \nF. \nEQUITABLE REMEDIES \n1. \nUNJUST ENRICHMENT \n{101} In North Carolina, a claim for unjust enrichment lies “‘wherever one man \nhas been enriched or his estate enhanced at another’s expense under circumstances \nthat, in equity and good conscience, call for an accounting by the wrongdoer.’”  Ellis \nJones, Inc. v. W. Waterproofing Co., 66 N.C. App. 641, 646, 312 S.E.2d 215, 218 \n(1984) (quoting Thormer v. Lexington Mail Order Co., 241 N.C. 249, 252, 85 S.E.2d \n140, 143 (1954)).   \n{102} Unjust enrichment is “‘a general principle, underlying various legal \ndoctrines and remedies, that one person should not be permitted unjustly to enrich \nhimself [or herself] at the expense of another.’”  Ivey v. Williams, 74 N.C. App. 532, \n534, 328 S.E.2d 837, 839 (1985) (quoting 66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution and Implied \nContracts § 3, at 945 (1973)). \n \n \n \n2. \nRESCISSION & DECLARATORY JUDGMENT REMEDIES \n{103} A court may order the rescission of an agreement that was induced by \nfraud or mistake.  See Mills v. Dunk, 263 N.C. 742, 746, 140 S.E.2d 358, 361 (1965).  \n{104} As for the right to a declaratory judgment in North Carolina, pursuant to \nstatute, any person with a legal interest in a “written contract or other writings \nconstituting a contract, or whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected \nby a statute, municipal ordinance, contract or franchise, may have determined any \nquestion of construction or validity arising [thereunder] and obtain a declaration of \nrights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-254 (2007). \n \nV. \nANALYSIS \nA. \nEXCULPATION CLAUSE \n{105} Defendants contend the Court should dismiss all claims alleged against \nthem because of the exculpation clause included in the Company’s Articles. \n{106} Pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Company’s Articles: \nA director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the \ncorporation or otherwise for monetary damages for breach of any duty \nas a director, except for liability with respect to (i) acts or omissions \nthat the director at the time of such breach knew or believed were \nclearly in conflict with the best inte rests of the corporation; (ii) any \nliability under [N.C. Gen. Stat.] § 55-8-33 [pertaining to unlawful \ndistributions]; or (iii) any transaction from which the director derived \nan improper personal benefit. . . .  [T]he liability of a director of the \ncorporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent \npermitted by the North Carolina Business Corporation Act [in the \nevent it is amended to allow further limitations on liabilities]. \n \n(Compl., Ex. A.) \n{107} In this case, however, Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants engaged in \ntransactions “from which [they] derived an improper personal benefit” (Compl., Ex. \nA), and in which self-dealing was involved.  For example, Plaintiffs allege the Board \nissued 140,000 shares each to Condra and Prevost “at a stated price well below its \nmarket value or fair value” in order to “ensur[e] that the board could protect itself \nfrom being unseated.”  (Compl. ¶ 42.) \n{108} Accepting these allegations as true, neither the exculpation clause in the \nCompany’s Articles nor North Carolina law insulate Defendants from liability in \nthis instance.  As such, the Court declines to dismiss the claims alleged against \nDefendants on this ground. \nB. \nDERIVATIVE CLAIMS \n{109} In their reply brief, Defendants contend that “Plaintiffs did not make an \nadequate demand on the MedOasis Board because [their] Demand Letter does not \nreference what is now claimed in Plaintiffs’ derivative causes of action.”  (Reply \nSupp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 3.) \n{110} According to Defendants, Plaintiffs’ purported demand letter focused on \nthe alleged violations by the Board of Green and Ellington’s individual rights as \nshareholders and not on the derivative claims that are the gravamen of the \nComplaint.  (Reply Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 3.) \n{111} For that reason, Defendants insist that the demand letter “lacks the \n‘clarity and particularity’ necessary to allow the MedOasis Board an opportunity to \n‘assess its rights and obligations and determine what action is in the best interest of \nthe company.’”  (Reply Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 4 (\nquoting Greene v. Shoemaker, \n1998 NCBC 4 ¶ 18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 24, 1998), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/1998%20NCBC%204.htm).) \n{112} Defendants did not state as a basis for dismissal the inadequacy of \nPlaintiffs’ demand letter in their written Motion, but rather only addressed this \nground as an afterthought in their reply brief.  North Carolina law generally \nrequires that all “application[s] to the court for an order shall be by motion which . . \n. shall be made in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, and \nshall set forth the relief or order sought.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1) (2007) (emphasis \nadded). \n{113} Nevertheless, “because standing is a ‘necessary prerequisite to a court’s \nproper exercise of subject matter jurisdiction,’ a challenge to standing may be made \nat any time.”  Crouse v. Mineo, 189 N.C. App. 232, 236, 658 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2008) \n(quoting Aubin v. Susi, 149 N.C. App. 320, 324, 560 S.E.2d 875, 878–79 (2002)).   \n{114} After reviewing carefully the demand letter attached as Exhibit A to \nDefendants’ opening brief, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs’ pre-suit demand \nwas sufficient to permit the Board to assess the claims asserted in the Complaint.  \n{115} The demand letter summarizes the purportedly unlawful acts undertaken \nby the Board in (1) forcing a redemption of Ellington’s shares, (2) refusing to allow \nEllington to vote his shares and those of his proxies at the 18 August 2008 \nshareholder meeting, (3) issuing 280,000 shares of stock to Condra and Prevost \nwithout adequate consideration and with the express intent of solidifying the \nBoard’s control of the Company, and (4) refusing to allow a vote on Ellington’s third \nmotion to elect a new Board. \n{116} These same allegations form the basis of Plaintiffs’ derivative claims.  \nAccordingly, because Plaintiffs’ pre-suit demand was adequate as a matter of law, \nthe Court DENIES the Motion to Dismiss on this ground and turns to an analysis of \nthe legal sufficiency of the claims pled in the Complaint.   \n1. \nCOUNT I—ACCOUNTING \n{117} Plaintiffs seek an accounting of  \nall stock issues or grants made to Defendants, including, without \nlimitation, the dates of the issuance grants [sic], the amounts of the \nissuance/grants, the value of the issu ance/grants, the recipients of the \nissued stock/grants, as well as the disposition of any proceeds received \nby the Defendants and any loans to said Defendants as well as \nrepayments of such loans. \n \n(Compl. ¶ 66.) \n{118} The Court holds that it may order an accounting as an equitable remedy if \nPlaintiffs are able to make out their claims for breach of fiduciary duty or \nconstructive fraud. \n{119} Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED as to Count I of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint. \n2. \nCOUNT II—BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY \n{120} Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the \nCompany (acting in their individual capacities and/or via a conspiracy) by \nformulating a plan to allow Defendants to remain entrenched on the Board.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 68–69.)  \n{121} As part of this plan, Plaintiffs allege Defendants terminated the AAA \nManagement Services Agreement and issued 280,000 shares to Condra and Prevost \nat a price well below market value, all of which was done to allow them to remain in \ncontrol of MedOasis.  (Compl. ¶¶ 30, 42.) \n{122} If Plaintiffs can prove these allegations, Defendants will, in fact, be liable \nfor a breach of their fiduciary duty to discharge their duties in “good faith,” which \nincludes a responsibility to act with undivided loyalty to the Company.  See \ngenerally Madvig v. Gaither, 461 F. Supp. 2d 398, 408 (W.D.N.C. 2006). \n{123} Furthermore, because Plaintiffs assert that Defendants’ sole purpose in \ntaking these actions was to thwart a shareholder vote, the normal presumptions of \nthe business judgment rule do not apply.  See First Union, 2001 NCBC 9A ¶ 47 \n(quoting Blasius Indus., 564 A.2d at 661–62). \n{124} Put another way, Plaintiffs have alleged, “‘in other than conclusory terms, \nthat the board . . . acted in bad faith,’” thus sufficiently rebutting the deference \nnormally afforded a Board by the business judgment rule.  Wachovia Capital \nPartners, 2007 NCBC 7 ¶ 23 (quoting Winters, 2001 NCBC 8 ¶ 17). \n{125} Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED as to Count II of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint. \n \n \n \n \n3. \nCOUNTS III & VI—ABUSE OF CONTROL & CORPORATE WASTE \n{126} In Counts III and VI of the Complaint, Plaintiffs purport to state causes of \naction for two (2) derivative claims against all Defendants:  (1) abuse of control; and \n(2) corporate waste. \n{127} Defendants contend, however, that claims for abuse of control and \ncorporate waste are not recognized as independent torts in North Carolina.  (Mem. \nLaw Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 13.)   \n{128} The Court agrees. \n{129} Plaintiffs actually admit as much in their opposition brief when they state, \n“[e]ven assuming, arguendo, that [abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and \ncorporate waste] are not often pled, they are all varieties of breach of fiduciary \nduty.”  (Pls’. Mem. Law Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 21 (second emphasis added).)  \nNevertheless, Plaintiffs request leave to restate these claims as general breaches of \nfiduciary duty.  (Pls’. Mem. Law Opp’n Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 21 n.14.) \n{130} The Court concludes that the claims are fully encompassed in Plaintiffs’ \nderivative claims for breach of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, and \nconstructive fraud (Counts II, IV, and V).  As a result, it would serve no purpose to \nallow Plaintiffs leave to restate the claims. \n{131} Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED as to Counts III \nand VI, and Plaintiffs’ request for leave to restate these claims is DENIED. \n4. \nCOUNT IV—GROSS MISMANAGEMENT \n{132} As with Plaintiffs’ claims for abuse of control and corporate waste, \nDefendants contend that North Carolina does not recognize gross mismanagement \nas an independent tort.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 13.) \n{133} This claim, however, essentially alleges that Defendants violated their \nstatutory duty of care with respect to the transactions at issue.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 55-8-30(a)(2) (2007) (requiring a corporate director to discharge his duties “[w]ith \nthe care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under \nsimilar circumstances”).  Furthermore, our courts have recognized that a claim for \ngross mismanagement against a director is a proper derivative claim.  See Corp. \nComm’n of N.C. v. Merchants’ Bank & Trust Co., 193 N.C. 113, 115, 136 S.E. 362, \n363 (1927). \n{134} Plaintiffs allege Defendants abdicated their duties to the Company by \nterminating a lucrative management contract with AAA, a principal shareholder, \nand by issuing shares to Condra and Prevost at a discounted price, all in an attempt \nto avoid being unseated as Board members.  (Compl. ¶¶ 30, 42.) \n{135} Plaintiffs also allege Defendants failed to (1) provide “even the most basic \nfinancial information to its shareholders” and (2) hold required shareholder \nmeetings, at which the Company’s shareholders should have been given an \nopportunity to vote for new Board members.  (Compl. ¶ 24.) \n{136} If true, these facts would make out a claim for gross mismanagement. \n{137} Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count IV \nof Plaintiffs’ Complaint. \n5. \nCOUNT V—CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD \n{138} In Count V, Plaintiffs allege Defendants committed constructive fraud by, \namong other things, making and/or concealing “material facts from MedOasis \nshareholders despite their duties to . . . disclose the true facts regarding their \nstewardship of MedOasis.”  (Compl. ¶ 83.) \n{139} In order to adequately allege a claim for constructive fraud, “a plaintiff \nmust show (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty, and (2) a breach of that duty.”  \nGovernor’s Club, 152 N.C. App. at 249–50, 567 S.E.2d at 788 (quoting Keener \nLumber, 149 N.C. App. at 28, 560 S.E.2d at 824).   \n{140} Because the Court has already determined that Plaintiffs have alleged a \nproper derivative claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the Court holds that they may \nalso proceed on their derivative claim alleging constructive fraud. \n{141} Furthermore, the Court holds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the \noperative facts surrounding the alleged constructive fraud, so as to put Defendants \non notice of the claim. \n{142} Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count V of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint. \n6. \nCOUNT VII—UNJUST ENRICHMENT \n{143} In Count VII, Plaintiffs allege that, as a result of Defendants’ actions, \nwhich served to entrench them on the Board, “Defendants will be and have been \nunjustly enriched at the expense of MedOasis, in the form of unjustified salaries, \nbenefits, bonuses, stock issues or grants and other emoluments of office.”  (Compl. \n¶ 89.) \n{144} The Court holds that Plaintiffs have stated a claim for unjust enrichment. \n{145} In sum, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants unlawfully circumvented \nPlaintiffs’ voting rights so as to retain their seats on the Board, and, as a result, \nDefendants will continue to receive salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock issues, etc., at \nthe Company’s expense and “under circumstances where it would be unfair for \n[Defendants] to retain [these benefits] without [the Company] being repaid or \ncompensated.”  Collins v. Davis, 68 N.C. App. 588, 591, 315 S.E.2d 759, 761 (1984).  \n{146} These allegations are sufficient to make out a claim for unjust enrichment.  \nAccordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count VII of \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint. \n7. \nCOUNT VIII—RESCISSION \n{147} In Count VIII, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants committed fraud when \nthey issued shares to Condra and Prevost and seek to have “[a]ll contracts which \nprovide for issuance of stock to the Officer Defendants . . . rescinded, with all sums \npaid under such contracts returned to the Company, and all such executory \ncontracts cancelled and declared void.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 93–94.) \n{148} The Court may order rescission of these contracts if they were, in fact, \ninduced by fraud.  See Mills, 263 N.C. at 746, 140 S.E.2d at 361. \n{149} Moreover, because the Court has already determined that Plaintiffs have \nstated a valid cause of action for constructive fraud, Plaintiffs may be entitled to \nrescission of the contracts relating to the issuance of these shares. \n{150} Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count VIII \nof Plaintiffs’ Complaint. \nC. \nINDIVIDUAL CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND \nCONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD \n \n{151} In Counts IX and X, Plaintiffs purport to state direct claims for breach of \nfiduciary duty and constructive fraud against Defendants. \n{152} In Count IX, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged “in a deliberate \ncourse of action designed to dilute the ownership interest of the Plaintiffs, squeeze \nout the interests of the Plaintiffs and allow Defendants to maintain their control of \nthe Company in pursuit of their own self-interest, in breach of fiduciary duties the \nDefendants owed to the Plaintiffs.”  (Compl. ¶ 96.)  \n{153} In Count X, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, as corporate fiduciaries, \n“owed to Plaintiffs a duty of candor and full and accurate disclosure regarding the \ntrue state of MedOasis’ business and assets” and that, by failing to uphold these \nduties, “they have committed constructive fraud and violated their duty of candor.”  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 101–02.) \n{154} As noted earlier, however, in North Carolina, directors generally owe a \nfiduciary duty to the corporation and not to any individual shareholders.  Thus, \nwhere a plaintiff in North Carolina alleges that the defendant-directors have \nbreached a fiduciary duty, the claim generally is a derivative claim.  Perry, 149 N.C. \nApp. at 26, 560 S.E.2d at 822.  \n{155} Nevertheless, a claim should not be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of \nthe North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure merely because it is mislabeled so long \nas the factual allegations give rise to a claim under some valid legal theory.  \nStanback, 297 N.C. at 202, 254 S.E.2d at 625.   \n{156} At the heart of the Complaint in this case is the contention that the Board \nthwarted Plaintiffs’ right to participate in control of the Company by refusing to \nallow Plaintiffs to vote their shares (and those granted to them by proxy) at the 18 \nAugust 2008 special shareholders’ meeting, and that the Board took other steps to \nentrench itself in office. \n{157} The Court notes that Plaintiffs’ right to vote their shares is specifically \nrecognized by statute.  See N. C. Gen. Stat. § 55-7-21(a) (2007) (stating that “unless \nthe articles of incorporation provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless \nof class, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders’ meeting”). \n{158} Moreover, where (as here) a plaintiff shareholder alleges that Company \nstock was issued for grossly inadequate consideration and primarily for \nentrenchment purposes, the claim “may state either an individual or derivative \nclaim.”  Avacus Partners, L.P. v. Briani Civil Action No. 11001, 1990 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 178, at *22 (Del. Ch. Oct. 24, 1990) (stating that claims of entrenchment \nmay be either individual or derivative or both and that “a claim that the board \nimproperly acted to entrench itself by issuing stock that impacts the shareholders’ \nvoting power may state either an individual or a derivative claim”). \n{159}   The Court construes Counts IX and X of the Complaint as asserting \nstatutory violations of Plaintiffs’ right to vote their shares at the 18 August 2008 \nshareholders’ meeting, which the Court holds are properly pled as individual \nclaims.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Motion to Dismiss these claims.   \nD. \nCOUNT XI—DECLARATORY JUDGMENT 8\n{160} Defendants next seek dismissal of Plaintiffs’ request for a declaratory \njudgment as to issues raised by the Complaint.   \n{161} Plaintiffs, however, have stated a justiciable controversy in that they \nallege their statutory rights as shareholders were purportedly violated by the \n                                                 \n8 This Count is incorrectly labeled as “Count IX” in the Complaint. \nfollowing actions of the Defendant Board members:  (1) diluting Plaintiffs’ voting \nrights by improperly issuing shares to Condra and Prevost (Compl. ¶¶ 41–43); (2) \nprohibiting Ellington’s right to vote his shares at the shareholder meeting (Compl. \n¶ 49); (3) failing to provide any financial information about the Company to the \nshareholders (Compl. ¶ 24); and (4) unlawfully attempting to exercise redemption \nrights in violation of North Carolina law (Compl. ¶¶ 30–36). \n{162} Based on the allegations of the Complaint, the Court has the authority to \ndeclare Plaintiffs rights, status, and legal relations, as they are affected by North \nCarolina corporation law and/or any contracts involving the allegedly improperly \nissued shares.  \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-254 (2007).  \n{163} Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Count XI \nof Plaintiffs’ Complaint. \nE. \nDEFENDANT MILLER \n{164} Defendant Miller seeks dismissal of all claims asserted against him \nbecause he contends he was not a director or officer at the time of the actions taken \nby the Board in or around August 2008.  (Mem. Law Supp. Defs’. Mot. Dismiss 19.)   \n{165} In this case, however, the Complaint alleges, among other things, that all \nDefendants “have pursued or joined in the pursuit of a common course of conduct \nand acted in concert with one another in furtherance of their common plan . . . [to] \nmaintain Defendants’ executive and directorial positions at MedOasis and the \nprofits, power and prestige which Defendants enjoyed as a result of these positions.”  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 59, 60.) \n{166} In essence, and although not expressly styled as such, Plaintiffs here \nallege a civil conspiracy among the Defendants, including Miller.9   \n                                                 \n9 Because Miller contends he was not a director or officer at the time of the alleged conspiracy, the \ndoctrine of intracorporate immunity does not apply.  See generally State ex. rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway \nBrands Mfg., LLC, 184 N.C. App. 613, 625, 646 S.E.2d 790, 799 (2007) (stating that a corporation \ncannot conspire with itself and that an allegation that a corporation is conspiring with its agents, \nofficer, or employees is tantamount to alleging that a corporation is conspiring with itself), aff’d in \npart, rev’d in part, and remanded by State ex. Rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands, Mfg., LLC, 362 \nN.C.431, 666 S.E.2d 107 (2008).  \n{167} In that regard, North Carolina law provides that where a party seeks  \nrecovery for injury caused by acts committed pursuant to a conspiracy, \n. . . the combination or conspiracy ch arged does no more than associate \nthe defendants together and perhaps liberalize the rules of evidence to \nthe extent that under the proper ci rcumstances the acts of one may be \nadmissible against all. \n \nHenry v. Deen, 310 N.C. 75, 86–87, 310 S.E.2d 326, 334 (1984) (citing Shope v. \nBoyer, 268 N.C. 401, 150 S.E.2d 771 (1966); Muse v. Morrison, 234 N.C. 195, 66 \nS.E.2d 783 (1951)).  The gravamen of the action, however, is the resultant injury, \nand not the conspiracy itself.  Muse, 234 N.C. at 198, 66 S.E.2d at 785 (quoting Holt \nv. Holt, 232 N.C. 497, 500, 61 S.E.2d 448, 451 (1950)). \n{168} Thus, Miller is not entitled to dismissal at this stage of the proceedings \nbecause, if the evidence supports Plaintiffs’ contentions, Plaintiffs would be entitled \nto an instruction at trial on the law of conspiracy in order to associate together \nMiller and the other individual Defendants for the purpose of establishing joint and \nseveral liability.  See N.C. Pattern Jury Instructions—Civil 103.31 (2009). \n{169} Accordingly, the Court DENIES Miller’s Motion to Dismiss him as a party-\ndefendant.      \n \nVI. \nCONCLUSION \n{170} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Counts III and VI of \nthe Complaint, as the Court holds that these claims are not recognized in North \nCarolina, and, in any event, the facts alleged therein are subsumed within \nPlaintiffs’ claims alleging a breach of fiduciary duty. \n{171} The Court DENIES the Motion to Dismiss as to all other claims.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 14th day of August, 2009. \n "
