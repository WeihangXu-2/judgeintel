Barger, 2019 NCBC 33. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nDAVIE COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n19 CVS 182 \n \nCHARLES WILLARD and TRACY \nBARNES BLIMP WORKS, LLC, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nWILLIAM BARGER, individually; \nWILLIAM BARGER AS EXECUTOR \nOF THE ESTATE OF TRACY \nBARNES; and BLIMP WORKS, INC., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nPLAINTIFF CHARLES WILLARD’S \nMOTION TO DISMISS CONVERSION \nCOUNTERCLAIM \n \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court upon Plaintiff Charles Willard’s \n(“Willard”) Motion to Dismiss Conversion Counterclaim  (the “Motion”) in the above-\ncaptioned case.   \n2. The Court, having considered the Motion, the briefs in support of and in \nopposition to the Motion, and the arguments of counsel at the hearing on the Motion, \nhereby GRANTS the Motion.  \nBennett Guthrie Latham, PLLC, by Jasmine M. Pitt, for Plaintiff Tracy \nBarnes Blimp Works, LLC. \n \nFitzgerald Litigation, by Andrew L. Fitzgerald , D. Stuart Punger, and \nLee D. Denton, for Plaintiff Charles Willard. \n \nEisele Ashburn Green & Chapman, PA, by Douglas G. Eis ele, for \nDefendants William Barger, individually and as Execu tor of the Estate \nof Tracy Barnes, and Blimp Works, Inc. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6).  See, e.g., Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs Grp., Inc. , 79 N.C. App. \n678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).  Rather, the Court recites the relevant \nallegations in the pleading asserting the challenged claim—here, Defendants William \nBarger (“Barger”), individually and as Executor of the Estate of Tracy Barnes (the \n“Estate of Barnes” or the “Estate”), and Blimp Works, Inc.’s (“BW”) (together, \n“Defendants”) Answer and Counterclaims.  (See Answer and Countercls. [hereinafter \n“Countercls.”], ECF No. 6.) \n4. Willard and Plaintiff Tracy Barnes Blimp Works, LLC (“TBBW”) initiated \nthis action against Defendants on April 1, 2019, alleging claims for fraudulent \nconveyance, declaratory judgment, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust \nenrichment, breach of contract, unfair and deceptive trade practices, attorneys’ fees, \nand tortious interference with contract arising out of various dealings among and \nbetween Tracy Barnes, Willard, Barger, TBBW, and BW. \n5. On April 16, 2019, Defendants filed their Answer and Counterclaims.  The \nfirst counterclaim is asserted by the Estate of Barnes against Willard and is titled \n“Conversion of 2014 Subaru” (the “Conversion Counterclaim”).  On April 30, 2019, \nWillard filed the Motion pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(b)(1) of the North Carolina \nRules of Civil Procedure, arguing that the Conversion Counterclaim should be \ndismissed because the Estate has pleaded that it does not own the 2014 Subaru.  On \nthat basis, Willard asserts that the Estate lacks standing to bring the Conversion \nCounterclaim against him.   \n6. After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motion on May 24, 2019 \n(the “May 24 Hearing”), at which all parties were represented by counsel.  The Motion \nis now ripe for resolution.  \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n7. In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), th e Court’s inquiry is \n“whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as true, are \nsufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal \ntheory[.]”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank of N.C., 85 N.C. App. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, \n840 (1987) (citing Stanback v. Stanback,  297 N.C. 181, 185, 254 S.E.2d 611, 615 \n(1979)).  The Court will not grant a motion to dismiss “unless it appears to a certainty \nthat plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in \nsupport of the claim.”  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) \n(emphasis omitted).  Therefore, dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is only \nproper “(1) when the complaint on its face reveals that no law supp orts [the] claim; \n(2) when the complaint reveals on its face the absence of fact sufficient to make a good \nclaim; [or] (3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the \nplaintiff’s claim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985).   \n8. The Court construes the allegations in the pleading “in the light most \nfavorable to the non-moving party.”  Christenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, Inc., 370 \nN.C. 1, 5, 802 S.E.2d 888, 891 (2017).  The Court is not, however, required “to accept \nas true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005); see also McCrann v. \nPinehurst, LLC, 225 N.C. App. 368, 377, 737 S.E.2d 771, 777 (2013).   \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n9. Willard argues that the Conversion Counterclaim should be dismissed \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) because the party asserting the claim, the Estate of Barnes, does \nnot own the 2014 Subaru.  The Court agrees. \n10. Under North Carolina law, “[t]he tort of conversion is well defined as ‘an \nunauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or \npersonal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of their condition or the \nexclusion of an owner’s rights.’”  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic \nServs., LLC , 365 N.C. 520, 523, 723 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2012) (quoting Peed v. \nBurleson’s, Inc., 244 N.C. 437, 439, 94 S.E.2d 351, 353 (1956)).  Thus, “[t]here are, in \neffect, two essential elements of a conversion claim: ownership in the plaintiff and \nwrongful possession or conversion by the defendant.”  Id. \n11. Our courts have  emphasized that “[t]he essence of conversion is not the \nacquisition of property by the wrongdoer, but a wrongful deprivation of it to the \nowner[.]”  Bartlett Milling Co. v. Walnut Grove Auction & Realty Co. , 192 N.C. App. \n74, 86, 665 S.E.2d 478, 488 (2008 ) (quoting Lake Mary Ltd. P’ship v. Johnston, 145 \nN.C. App. 525, 532, 551 S.E.2d 546, 552 (2001)).  In short, “there is no conversion \nuntil some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or \nrights in the property.”  Mace v. Pyatt, 203 N.C. App. 245, 256, 691 S.E.2d 81, 90 \n(2010) (quoting Lake Mary Ltd. P’ship, 145 N.C. App. at 532, 551 S.E.2d at 552). \n12. In pleading the Conversion Counterclaim here, the Estate alleges first that \nthe “2014 Subaru automobile [is] owned by [BW] ,” and then (i) that the “Estate of \nTracy Barnes has made demand on Willard for return of the 2014 Subaru to the \nEstate of Barnes;” (ii)  that Willard’s failure “to return the Subaru to the Estate of \nBarnes constitutes a conversion by Willard of the property owned by the Estate of \nBarnes;” and (i ii) that the Estate of Barnes is entitled to a Court order requiring \nWillard to either “return the Subaru to the Estate of Barnes, or “pay to the Estate of \nBarnes for the purchase of said Subaru the .  . . fair market v alue of the Subaru.”  \n(Countercls. ¶¶ 1–5.) \n13. Although it does not own the 2014 Subaru, the Estate contends, without \ncitation to legal authority, that because it owns all of the outstanding shares of BW—\nthe entity that actually owns the 2014 Subaru—the Estate may properly recover the \n2014 Subaru for the Estate.  According to the Estate, “[i]t is fundamental that the \nright of an executor to sue for and acquire corporate stock in the administration of an \nestate includes the right of the executor to demand the p ossession of an asset \nrepresented by the corporate stock that is an asset of the estate. ”  (Br. of Barnes \nEstate Replying to Pl. Willard’s Mot. Dismiss 4, ECF No. 17.) \n14. The Estate’s argument is without legal support.  Under longstanding \nprinciples of North Carolina law, a “corporation is treated as an entity separate from \nits stockholder or stockholders under all ordinary circumstances.”  Dep’t of Transp. v. \nAirlie Park, Inc. , 156 N.C. App. 63, 67, 576 S.E.2d 341, 344 (2003) (citing Glenn v. \nWagner, 313 N.C. 450, 454, 329 S.E.2d 326, 330 (1985)).  The Estate pleads that BW \nis an entity separate and distinct from the Estate.  The Estate’s ownership of BW’s \nshares may give the Estate the practical ability to control BW’s affairs, including the \ndisposition of BW’s assets, but ownership in BW’s shares does not equate to direct \nownership in BW’s assets.  Thus, the Estate has no direct ownership interest in the \n2014 Subaru, and without ownership in the Estate, the Estate ha s no legal right to \nrecover the 2014 Subaru for the Estate.   \n15. Accordingly, the Court concludes that  the Estate lacks standing to assert \nthe Conversion Counterclaim against Willard to seek recovery of the 2014 Subaru for \nthe Estate, requiring dismissal of the counterclaim as pleaded .  The Court’s ruling, \nhowever, is without prejudice to any right the Estate may have to cause BW, as the \nowner of the 2014 Subaru, to assert a conversion claim seeking the recovery of the \n2014 Subaru for BW.1 \n \n                                                           \n1  After the Court forecast it would grant the Motion during the May 24 Hearing, Defendants’ \ncounsel made an oral motion seeking leave to amend the Answer and Counterclaims to permit \nthe Conversion Counterclaim to be asserted by BW rather than the Estate.  With Plaintiffs’ \nconsent, the Court granted the oral motion for leave to amend at the May 24 Hearing.  The \nCourt will memorialize its ruling on the oral motion for leave to amend by separate order. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n16. WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS \nPlaintiff Charles Willard’s Motion to Dismiss Conversion Counterclaim  and \nDISMISSES the Estate of Barnes’ Conversion Counterclaim against Willard  with \nprejudice.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 29th day of May, 2019.  \n \n/s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III  \nLouis A. Bledsoe, III  \nChief Business Court Judge "
