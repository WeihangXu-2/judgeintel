Collins, Esq. for Plaintiff.  \n \nWard & Smith, P.A., by Alexander C. Dale, Esq. and Allen N. Trask, III, Esq. for \nDefendant. \n \nJolly, Judge. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n[1] On October 14, 2010, Pl aintiff Jane N. Sutton filed suit against Defendant \nCarl L. Sutton, Jr.  Plaintiff derivatively alleges damages for conversion, breach of \nfiduciary duties and improper filing of income tax returns on behalf of Sutton's Tree \nService, Inc. (the \"Corporation\"), of which the Complaint alleges she was a shareholder. \n[2] On January 14, 2011, Defendant filed the Motion and a brief in support of \nthe Motion.  The Motion seeks dismissal of the Plaintiff's action pursuant to Rules \n12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), 12(b)(7) and 12(c), on the grounds that Plaintiff lacks standing, has \nimproperly brought a derivative action by failing to satisfy statutory demand \nrequirements and her claims are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. \n[3] On June 8, 2011, Defendant filed the Motion for Costs and brief in support \nof the Motion for Costs, pursuant to G.S. 55-7-46. \n[4] The Motions are ripe for determination. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nIn substance, the Complaint alleges: \n[5] The Corporation was founded by  Defendant, with Defendant being the \nsole shareholder, on June 27, 1989.1 \n[6] Plaintiff and Defendant were marri ed on August 5, 1991, and separated on \nJanuary 3, 2007.2   \n[7] On March 1, 1992, Plaintiff ac quired 500 shares of stock in the \nCorporation.3 \n                                                 \n1 Compl. ¶ 4. \n2 Def. Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Mot. J. Pleadings (\"Memo\") 2.     \n \n[8] As part of the settlement of a domestic matter between the Plaintiff and \nDefendant, the parties entered into a Consent Judgment (the \"Consent Judgment\") \nwhereby Plaintiff was to surrender to Defendant any interest she had in the \nCorporation.4 \nDISCUSSION \nMotion to Dismiss – Rule 12(b)(1) \nStanding \n[9] A motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) seeks dismissal of an action on the \nbasis of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  Subject matter jurisdiction, which enables \na court to hear a case, is a prerequisite for a court to exercise judicial authority over a \ncase and controversy.  Harris v. Pembaur, 84 N.C. App. 666, 667 (1987). \n[10] A court lacks subject matter jurisdic tion if the party before the court does \nnot have standing to pursue the cause of action.  Estate of Apple v. Commercial Courier \nExpress, Inc., 168 N.C. App. 175, 177 (2005).  In order to have standing to commence \nand maintain a derivative action on behalf of a corporate entity, an individual must meet \nthe requirements of G.S. 55-7-41, which provides that a shareholder must own shares \nof the entity at the time of injury and \"fairly and adequately represent[] the interests of \nthe corporation in enforcing the right of the corporation.\"  Further, G.S. 55-7-42 requires \nthat before a shareholder can commence a derivative action, the shareholder must wait \nninety (90) days after the making of a written demand upon the corporation to take \naction. \n                                                                                                                                                             \n3 Compl. ¶ 5. \n4 Memo 2-3. \n \n[11] A dispute regarding ownership of t he Corporation as between Plaintiff and \nDefendant previously was litigated in a domestic proceeding entitled Sutton v. Sutton, \nOnslow County No. 07 CVD 1225 (N.C. Dist. Ct.).  In that matter, the parties entered \ninto the Consent Judgment, under which Plaintiff surrendered to Defendant any and all \ninterest she had in the Corporation.5 \n[12] The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel serve to prevent \nissues from being relitigated and to maintain consistency in the courts.  State, ex rel. \nTucker  v. Frinzi, 344 N.C. 411, 414 (1996).  If an issue previously has been decided by \na final judgment, the parties to that judgment are prevented from litigating the issue in \nanother proceeding.  Id.  In the instant action, res judicata and collateral estoppel \nprevent the parties from relitigating in this civil action issues regarding ownership of the \nCorporation. \n[13] The Consent Judgment constitutes a valid, final judgment determining the \nrespective rights of Plaintiff and Defendant regarding ownership of the Corporation.  \nAccordingly, at the time of filing of this civil action, Plaintiff was not, and currently is not, \na shareholder of the Corporation.  Since Plaintiff is not a shareholder, Plaintiff cannot \nrepresent the shareholders of the Corporation, and she fails to meet the requirements to \nbring the derivative actions alleged in this civil action.  Consequently, Plaintiff has no \nstanding to bring this civil action.  The court therefore has no subject matter jurisdiction \nto hear this civil action.  Defendant's Motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) should be \nGRANTED, and this action should be DISMISSED. \n[14] The court's determination that subject matter jurisdiction over this civil \naction does not exist is dispositive of this action.  Accordingly, it is neither necessary nor \n                                                 \n5 Id. \n \nproper for the court to consider Defendant's other contended Rule 12 grounds \nsupporting his Motion. \nMotion for Costs \n[15] In his Motion for Costs, Defendant seeks the taxing against Plaintiff of \nreasonable costs incurred in this matter, including attorneys' fees and expenses.  Such \nan award is statutorily authorized by G.S. 55-7-46(2) upon a determination that a \nplaintiff filed a derivative action without reasonable cause or for an improper purpose; \nand by G.S. 55-7-46(3) upon a determination that a pleading filed in a derivative action \nwas not well-grounded in fact, not warranted by existing law or a good faith argument \nfor extending, modifying, or reversing existing law,6 and that it was filed for an improper \npurpose.  The award of such expenses and attorneys' fees is within the court's \ndiscretion.  Aubin v. Susi, 149 N.C. App. 320, 326 (2002). \n[16] Defendant's counsel filed an Affida vit of Attorneys' Fees and Expenses on \nJune 8, 2011 (the \"Fee Affidavit\"), which reflects that Defendant has incurred fees for \nlegal services, plus expenses, in the amount of $22,751.08.  Plaintiff did not file a \nresponse to Defendant's Motion for Costs.  Pursuant to BCR 15.11, the Motion for Costs \nwill be considered and decided as an uncontested motion. \n[17] Defendant contends r easonable costs and attorneys' fees and expenses \nare justified because Plaintiff's Complaint lacks reasonable cause and was filed for an \nimproper purpose – a \"personal vendetta against her ex-husband.\"7 \n[18] Plaintiff's Complaint, on its face, is seriously deficient and subject to \ndismissal on several grounds.  As a threshold matter, and as determined above, Plaintiff \n                                                 \n6 Def. Mem. Supp. Mot. Costs 2-5.  \n7 Id. 10.  \n \nclearly lacked standing to file this civil action.  Therefore, the court FINDS and \nCONCLUDES that Plaintiff commenced and maintained this action without reasonable \ncause.8  Therefore, the court further CONCLUDES, in the exercise of its discretion, that \nDefendant is entitled to an award of reasonable costs, including attorneys' fees and \nexpenses, incurred in defense of this matter, pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 55-7-\n46(2).  Defendant's Motion for Costs should be GRANTED. \n[19] The court has examined the Fee Affidavit propounded by Defendant.  It \nFINDS that the fees and expenses reflected in the Fee Affidavit are fair, reasonable and \nbased upon usual and ordinarily prevailing rates for attorneys and staff of similar \nexperience and expertise; and that said fees and expenses were necessarily incurred \nby Defendant in the defense of this action. \n[20] Accordingly, the court CONCLUDES,  in the further exercise of its \ndiscretion, that in addition to taxable costs, Defendant is entitled to recover from Plaintiff \nin the additional amount of $22,751.08 for attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in \ndefense of this matter. \nNOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing FINDINGS and CONCLUSIONS, \nit is ORDERED that: \n[21] Defendant Carl Sutton's Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) is \nGRANTED, and this civil action is DISMISSED. \n                                                 \n8 Plaintiff has not contested Defendant's allegation that this action was commenced as a personal \nvendetta by Plaintiff against her ex-husband, which would amount to an \"improper purpose\" under G.S. \n55-4-46(2). However, in view of the court's finding in paragraph 18 above, a finding of improper purpose \nis not necessary to an award of costs and attorneys fees.  Accordingly, the court makes no findings with \nregard to this contention.  \n \n \n[22] Defendant Carl Sutton's Motion fo r Costs is GRANTED, and the taxable \ncosts of this civil action, plus attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by Defendant in \ndefense of this matter in the amount of $22,751.08, shall be TAXED to Plaintiff. \nSO ORDERED, this the 28th day of November, 2011. \n \n "
