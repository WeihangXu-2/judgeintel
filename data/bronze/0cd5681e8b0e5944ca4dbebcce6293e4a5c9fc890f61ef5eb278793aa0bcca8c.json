James B. Upchurch, Jr. is a shareholder of WTG Burlington, Inc.  He was \nalso its sole director and officer until his fellow shareholders recently removed him.  \nDescribing his removal as a coup, Upchurch has sued the other shareholders.  They \nin turn have moved to dismiss all claims u nder Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina \nRules of Civil Procedure.  (ECF No. 8.)  For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS \nthe motion. \nEdmisten & Webb Law, by William Woodward Webb, for Plaintiff James \nB. Upchurch, Jr.  \n \nBrooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard , L.L.P., by Eric M. \nDavid and Katarina K. Wong , for Defendant s Corbin Sapp, Luann \nManer, Brett Devries, Arthur “Duke” Thomas, Michael Glick, and Kelly \nGlick. \n  \nOertel, Koonts & Oertel, PLLC, by Franklin Paul Koonts and Geoffrey K. \nOertel, for Third-Party Plaintiff WTG Burlington, Inc. \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n2. Formed in 2015, WTG Burlington is a small business that operates a \nrestaurant named Wings to Go.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 3, 19, ECF No. 3.)  The company has \nsix shareholders: Upchurch, Brett Devries,  Michael Glick, Luann Maner, Corbin \nSapp, and Arthur Thomas.  (See Compl. ¶ 4.)  Upchurch holds the largest interest at \naround forty percent and, until January 2020, served as WTG Burlington’s general \nmanager and its only director and officer.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 3, 4.) \n3. Shortly after forming WTG Burlington , the shareholders executed a \nStockholders’ Agreement to govern share transfers and related issues.  ( See Compl. \n¶ 3; Compl. Ex. A [“Stockholders’ Agrmt.”].)  Of note here, Upchurch obtained an \noption to buy  shares held by Sapp, Thomas, Glick, and Maner (abbreviated as the \nSTGM Shareholders in the agreement): \nAs and when the STGM Loans shall have been paid and satisfied in full, \nUpchurch shall have the option, but not the obligation, at any time \nfollowing the date of such payment . . . to purchase any part or all of the \nSTGM Shares by giving a written notice . . . to the STGM Shareholders \nof the exercise of the option and the extent thereof.   \n(Stockholders’ Agrmt. § 7A; see also Stockholders’ Agrmt. § 2(n).)  The STGM Loans \nare loans totaling over $300,000 made by these four individuals.  (Stockholders’ \nAgrmt. § 2(l).) \n4. This case arises from events beginning in late 2019, when Devries allegedly \n“engineered” a “coup” to oust  Upchurch.  (Compl. ¶  7.)  The coup began with the  \nremoval of Upchurch as general manager for alleged misconduct and the retention of \none of Devries’s business partners  to replace him .  ( See Compl. ¶¶  7, 11.)   Then \nDevries and the other sharehol ders began holding meetings without notice to \nUpchurch.  (See Compl. ¶ 8.)  Around the same time, Devries and Sapp claimed to be \nofficers and filed official documents with the Secretary of State on WTG Burlington’s \nbehalf.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 9, 10.)  The coup culminated in the  election of new officers \nand directors—and, thus, the removal of Upchurch from his positions—at a properly \nnoticed shareholder meeting in January 2020.  ( See Compl. ¶  10.)  At some point \nduring these events, WTG Burlington stopped paying some of its debts , resulting in \ndamage to Upchurch as guarantor.  (See Compl. ¶ 12.) \n5. Upchurch remains the largest shareholder of WTG Burlington.  He  alleges \nthat he is “ready, willing and able” to exercise his option to buy the shares of Sapp \nand Maner, which would give hi m a majority interest.  (Compl. ¶  14.)  Sapp and \nManer have refused.  According to Upchurch, Sapp and Maner “have rejected such \nacquisition in the absence of Plaintiff satisfying other terms and conditions not in” \nthe Stockholders’ Agreement.  (Compl. ¶ 14.) \n6. Upchurch filed this suit against all five of his fellow shareholders and Glick’s \nwife (“Defendants”).  He claims that Sapp and Maner have breached the Stockholders’ \nAgreement.  In addition , he claims that  all Defendants have committed unfair or \ndeceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 and breached fiduciary duties owed \nto WTG Burlington and to Upchurch.   Defendants have responded with \ncounterclaims, and WTG Burlington has intervened to assert its own claims against \nUpchurch. \n7. Defendants have also moved to dismiss each of Upchurch’s claims.  After full \nbriefing, t he Court held a hearing on October 5, 2020.  The motion is ripe for \nresolution. \nII. \nANALYSIS \n8. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency of the \ncomplaint.”  Isenhour v. Hutto, 350 N.C. 601, 604, 517 S.E.2d 121, 124 (1999) (citation \nand quotation marks omitted).  The motion should be granted only when “(1)  the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2)  the \ncomplaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or \n(3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  \nCorwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615, 821 S.E.2d 729, 736 –37 (2018) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted).  In deciding the motion, the Court must treat \nthe well -pleaded allegations of the complaint as true and view the facts and \npermissible inferences “in the light most favorable to” the nonmoving party.  Sykes v. \nHealth Network Sols., Inc. , 372 N.C. 326, 332, 828 S.E.2d 467, 471 (2019) (citation \nand quotation marks omitted).  The Court also may consider documents “attached to \nand incorporated within [the] complaint.”  Weaver v. St. Joseph of the Pines, Inc., 187 \nN.C. App. 198, 204, 652 S.E.2d 701, 707 (2007). \nA. Breach of Contract \n9. Upchurch claims that he has an option to buy the shares held by  Sapp and \nManer and that they breached the Stockholders’ Agreement by refusing to sell.  Sapp \nand Maner argue that  the option isn’t ripe .  The Stockholders’ Agreement, they \ncontend, requires  Upchurch to repay over $300,000 in loans  before exercising his \noption, yet he has not pleaded that he did so.  (See Br. in Supp. 4–5, ECF No. 9.) \n10. To state a claim for breach of contract , a plaintiff must  allege that a valid \ncontract exists and was breached.  See Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26, 530 S.E.2d \n838, 843 (2000).   If the contract “contains some condition precedent to defendant’s \nliability,” the plaintiff must also allege that the condition has been met.  Beachboard \nv. S. Ry. Co., 16 N.C. App. 671, 681, 193 S.E.2d 577, 584 (1972) (citation omitted); see \nalso N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(c).  “A condition precedent is a fact or event that must exist or \noccur before there is a right to immediate performance, before there is a breach of \ncontract duty.”  Mosely v. WAM, Inc. , 167 N.C. App. 594, 600, 606 S.E.2d 140, 144  \n(2004) (citation omitted). \n11. Section 7A of the Stockholders’ Agreement states that Upchurch “shall have \nthe option” to buy the shares of Sapp and Maner  “[a]s and when the  STGM Loans \nshall have been paid and satisfied in full”  and “following the date” of repayment.  \n(Stockholders’ Agrmt. §  7A.)  Plainly , the loan repayment  is a condition precedent \nthat must occur before Upchurch’s option ripens.  See Craftique, Inc. v. Stevens & Co., \n321 N.C. 564, 567, 364 S.E.2d 129, 131 (1988) (“The use of language such as ‘when,’ \n‘after,’ and ‘as soon as’ clearly indicates that a promise will not be performed except \nupon the happening of a stated event, i.e., a condition precedent.”).  But the complaint \ndoes not allege, even generally, that this condition has been met.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 13, \n14, 16.)  At most, the complaint alleges that Upchurch is “ready, willing and able” to \nbuy the shares.  (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 16.) \n12. Upchurch doesn’t deny any of this.  Rather, he argues that Sapp and Maner \nhave tried to impose even more conditions on the option right, beyond those stated in \nsection 7A.  ( See Opp’n 2–3, ECF No. 18.)  Even if that is true, it does not set aside \nUpchurch’s obligation to allege sa tisfaction of the condition precedent that actually \nappears in section 7A.  He has not done so and, as a result, has not stated a claim for \nbreach of the Stockholders’ Agreement. \n13. The Court grants the motion to dismiss the claim for breach of contract. \nB. Section 75-1.1 \n14. Upchurch asserts a claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices against all \nDefendants.  Seeking to dismiss the claim, Defendants contend that  section 75-1.1 \ndoes not apply to shareholder disputes of the sort alleged in the complaint .  (See Br. \nin Supp. 5–8.) \n15. The General As sembly has declared that  “unfair or deceptive acts or \npractices in or affecting commerce” are “unlawful.”  N.C.G.S. §  75-1.1(a).  “ As \nconstrued by our Supreme Court, this language is broad enough ‘ to regulate a \nbusiness’s regular interactions with other market participants’ but not so broad as to \ncapture conduct ‘solely related to the internal operations’ of a business.”  Brewster v. \nPowell Bail Bonding, Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 76, at *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 26, \n2018) (quoting White v. Thompson, 364 N.C. 47, 51–52, 691 S.E.2d 676, 679 (2010)).  \nThus, “any unfair or deceptive conduct contained solely within a single business is \nnot covered by” section 75-1.1.  White, 364 N.C. at 53, 691 S.E.2d at 680. \n16. All the alleged wrongdoing here was internal to WTG Burlington.  Liberally \nconstrued, the complaint alleges that one or more Defendants held shareholder \nmeetings without proper notice, removed Upchurch  as general manager without \ncause, appointed a new general manager affiliated with Devries,  acted as officers \nwithout authority, and failed to pay the company’s  debts.  (See Compl. ¶ 19.)  These \nare internal disputes about management and corporate governance “having nothing \nto do with the type of unfair market conduct section 75-1.1 was designed to address.”  \nBrewster, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 76, at *16– 17 (collecting cases) ; see also Morgan v. \nTurn-Pro Maint. Servs., LLC, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 5, at *33 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 15, \n2020) (dismissing claim relating to “purely internal dispute” about authority to act \non company’s behalf ); Comput. Design & Integration, LLC v. Brown , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 216, at *82–83 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 10, 2018) (dismissing claim based on “acts \nrelated to one member’s buyout of another member’s interest in an LLC”);  Kane v. \nMoore, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 184, at *13–15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 4, 2018) (dismissing \nclaim involving diversion of corporate opportunities to “third- party businesses” \ncontrolled by LLC member) ; LLG-NRMH, LLC v. N. Riverfront Marina & Hotel, \nLLLP, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 105, at  *10–11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, 2018) (dismissing \nclaim based in part on  dispute between LLC members about  “alleged interference \nwith restaurant management”). \n17. Upchurch points to the fact that his replacement as general manager came \nfrom outside the compan y.  ( See Opp’n 5.)  Even so, a dispute about the hiring of a \ngeneral manager is an internal dispute about company management.  The tangential \ninvolvement of outsiders “does not change the fundamental character of the dispute.”  \nJS Real Est. Invs. LLC v. Gee Real Est ., LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 104, at *21 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Nov. 9, 2017); see also  Kane, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 184, at *13– 15; \nLLG-NRMH, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 105, at *11– 13; Potts v. KEL, LLC, 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 24, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 27, 2018). \n18. At bottom, this is a dispute  among shareholders.  The alleged wrongdoing \nconcerns the internal operations of a single market participant, is not in or affecting \ncommerce, and therefore does not support  a claim under section 75 -1.1.  The Court \ngrants the motion to dismiss the claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices. \nC. Breach of Fiduciary Duty \n19. Upchurch also asserts his claim for breach of fiduciary duty against all \nDefendants.  This claim is alleged in highly general terms.  ( See Compl. ¶  22.)  \nAlthough the complaint doesn’ t clearly say so,  Upchurch has clarified his intent to \nassert the claim directly, not derivatively on behalf of WTG Burlington.  ( See Opp’n \n7.)  As elucidated in his brief,  Upchurch’s theory is that Defendants are majority or \ncontrolling shareholders and, in that capacity, breached fiduciary duties  owed to \nminority shareholders (meaning Upchurch).  (See Opp’n 10–12.)  Defendants move to \ndismiss the claim on several grounds, including that the complaint fails to allege facts \nto support the existence of a fiduciary relationship.  (See Br. in Supp. 13–15.) \n20. “As a general rule, shareholders do not owe a fiduciary duty to each other or \nto the corporation.”  Freese v. Smith, 110 N.C. App. 28, 37, 428 S.E.2d 841, 847 (1993).  \nMajority shareholders, however, have a duty to protect the interests of the minority.  \nSee Gaines v. Long Mfg. Co., 234 N.C. 340, 344, 67 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1951). \n21. Here, no single Defendant is a majority shareholder.  Upchurch argues that \nDefendants, as a group, should be treated as majority shareholders because their \naggregate interest is nearly sixty percent.  (See Opp’n 10.)  In support, he cites Loy v. \nLorm Corp., 52 N.C. App. 428, 278 S.E.2d 897 (1981).  There, the Court of Appeals \nallowed a minority shareholder to pursue relief against three fellow shareholders who \ntogether held a majority interest, served as corporate “directors and officers,” were \n“firmly in control” of the corporation, and had common interests stemming from their \nrelated, jointly owned business.  Id. at 431, 278 S.E.2d at 900.  But the defendants in \nthat case conceded that they were collectively majority shareholders, so the Court of \nAppeals did not address the circumstances in which a group of minority shareholders \neffectively becomes a controlling majority.  See id. at 432, 278 S.E.2d at 901. \n22. In any event, t he allegations in the complaint bear no resemblance to Loy.  \nUpchurch claims, for example, that he w as the sole director and officer  during the \nrelevant period.  (See Compl. ¶ 3.)  Although Upchurch’s brief argues that Defendants \n“acted in concert,” (Opp’n 10), his complaint says nothing of the sort.   There are no \nallegations that Defendants  acted in concert, had a common plan , or even held  \ncommon interests.  At most, the complaint pins the supposed coup on Devries and \nalleges that the others “ratif[ied]” his actions.  (Compl. ¶  11.)  Indeed, the complaint \ndoes not identify  any actions t aken by  Maner, Thomas, or the Glicks, apart from \nshareholder votes.  These allegations, taken as true, do not show that Defendants \nformed a majority bloc  from their minority interests .  See United Leasing Corp. v. \nGuthrie, 192 N.C. App. 623, 634, 666 S.E.2d 504, 511 (2008) (holding that complaint \ndid not adequately allege that defendant “acted in concert with others” to convert \nproperty); cf. Vanguard Pai Lung, LLC v. Moody , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 39, at * 19–21 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. June 19, 2019) (noting “the obvious difference between backing a \nmajority coalition and exercising majority control as of right” when assessing whether \nLLC members owed fiduciary duties to each other). \n23. As an alternative, Upchurch argues that Defendants , individually,  are \ncontrolling minority shareholders.  (See Opp’n 10–12.)  “[O]ur Supreme Court has not \ndecided whether a minority shareholder exercising actual control over a corporation \nowes a duty to other shareholders.”  Panzino v. 5Church, Inc., 2020 NCBC LEXIS 17, \nat *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 12, 2020) (citing Corwin , 371 N.C. at 616, 821 S.E.2d at \n737).  Regardless, Upchurch has not alleged that any individual Defendant exercised \nactual control over WTG Burlington.  As noted, Upchurch alleges that he was the sole \ndirector and officer.  (See Compl. ¶ 3.)\n* \n24. In short, Upchurch has n ot adequately alleged the existence of a fiduciary \nrelationship, which is an essential element of the claim .  See Dalton v. Camp, 353 \n \n* Upchurch relies heavily on Brewster, which denied a motion to dismiss a claim for breach \nof fiduciary duty against minority shareholders.  The reasoning in Brewster offers no support \nfor Upchurch.  There, the Court followed an appellate decision that was later reversed by the \nSupreme Court in Corwin.  See Brewster, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 76, at *10 .  In addition, the \ncomplaint in Brewster alleged that the minority shareholders acted in concert and exercised \ncontrol over the corporation—allegations that are absent here. \nN.C. 647, 651, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001); Bennett v. Bennett, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 19, \nat *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 15, 2019) .  The Court therefore grants the motion to \ndismiss his claim for breach of fiduciary duty. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n25. For these reasons, the Court GRANT S the motion.  In its discretion, the \nCourt dismisses the claims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty without \nprejudice.  The section 75-1.1 claim is dismissed with prejudice. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 8th day of October, 2020. \n /s/ Adam M. Conrad   \nAdam M.
