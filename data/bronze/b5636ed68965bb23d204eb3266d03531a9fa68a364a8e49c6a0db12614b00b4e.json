The Court earlier approved the settlement of a class action brought to \nchallenge a merger .  The settlement consisted solely of Defendants’ submission of \nsupplemental merger -related disclosures in exchange for a release of Plaintiff’s \nmerger-related claims.  The Court reserved its further consideration of the Motion , \nwhich seeks an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses.   The Court now awards \nattorneys’ fees, but in a lesser amount than requested, and denies the recovery of \nexpenses. \nII. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3. A detailed summary of the procedural and factual background of this \nlitigation is in the Court’s  Order & Opinion Approving Settlement, Moss v. Towell , \nNo. 16 CVS 11038, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *2–6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 6, 2018).  \n4. John E. Moss (“ Plaintiff”) is a former owner of Yadkin Financial \nCorporation (“Yadkin”) stock.   \n \n \n5. On July 20, 2016, Yadkin entered into a merger agreement with F.N.B. \nCorporation (“FNB”), whereby Yadkin shareholders would receive 2.16 shares of FNB \nstock for each Yadkin share they owned. \n6. On August 9, 2016, pursuant to a written agreement (“Fee Agreement”), \nPlaintiff retained the law firm of Rigrodsky & Long, P.A. (“ Lead Counsel”), who \nassociated with The Law Offices of James Scott Farrin (“Local Counsel ” and \ncollectively w ith Lead Counsel, “Plaintiff’s Counsel”).  Rigrodsky & Long’s  Fee \nAgreement states that  \n[t]he Firm will represent You  on a fully contingent basis.  If the action \ncreates a benefit for [Yadkin] or its shareholders (monetary or \notherwise), the Firm will seek an award of fees.  In the event of a \nsettlement, the Firm will seek to have their attorneys’ fees paid by \nagreement with the defendants, subject to Court approval, or otherwise \nby application to the Court.  Alternatively, defendants may agree to \nallocate additional monies to cover our attorneys’ fees and expenses, \nsubject to Court approval.  . . . The Firm agrees to pay all costs and \nexpenses that they deem necessary to prosecute this case. \n \n(Aff. Brian D. Long, Esquire Supp. Mot. Pl’s. Counsel Seeking Award \nAttorneys’ Fees Expenses (“Long Aff.”), ECF No. 37, Ex. C, at 2.)   \n7. In September 2016, Plaintiff filed a putative class action against Yadkin, \nYadkin directors, and FNB (collectively, “Defendants”) asserting  direct and \nderivative claims that the Yadkin directors breached their fiduciary duties and \nfurther that FNB aided and abetted those breaches.   \n8. On November 22, 20 16, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction, seeking to enjoin the merger until Yadkin provided supplemental merger-\nrelated disclosures.   \n \n \n9. On November 29, 2016, the parties entered into a memorandum of \nunderstanding (“MOU”), which memorialized the parties’ agreement to resolve the \nlitigation.   \n10. On November 29, 2016, Yadkin filed supplemental disclosures with the \nSEC.   \n11. On December 9, 2016, Yadkin’s shareholders approved the merger. \n12. On October 20, 2017, the parties executed a Stipulation and Agreement \nof Compromise, Settlement, and Release (“Stipulation”), whereby Defendants  \nacknowledged Plaintiff’s Counsel’s entitlement to reasonab le attorneys’ fees and \nexpenses.  The Stipulation also provided that  the parties would negotiate in good \nfaith to a gree on a reasonable amount of attorneys’ fees and expenses, which \nDefendants would pay if the Court approved.  If the parties could not reach an \nagreement, the issue would be submitted to the Court for resolution, and Defendants \nwould pay whatever amount of fees, costs,  and expenses the Court approved .  \n(Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement, and Release 14–15 \n(“Stipulation”), ECF No. 35.1.)   \n13. On February 7, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Final Approval of \nSettlement and the Motion.   Plaintiff’s Counsel  reported that the parties had not \nreached an agreement on an award and requested expenses of $4,737.86 and a fee of \n$295,262.14, for a total award of $300,000.  Plaintiff’s Counsel reported that a total \nof 421.45 hours had been spent on the litigation, which, if the Court calculated the \nfee at their normal billing rates, would equate to a lodestar of $226,842.50, or \n \n \n$68,419.64 less than the fee Plaintiff’s Counsel requested.  (Pl’s. Mem. L. Supp. Mot. \nApproval Attorneys’ Fees Expenses 7, ECF No. 41.)  Plaintiff’s Counsel’s fee request \nwould yield an implied rate of $700.58 per hour ($295,262.14 divided by 421.45 \nhours). \n14. On February 14, 2018, FNB responded to the Motion, agreeing that \nPlaintiff’s Counsel was entitled to reasonable fees and expenses, but arguing that the \nrequested amount was unreasonable.  (FNB Corporation’s Resp. Pl’s. Mot. Attorney’s \nFees Expenses 2 –3, ECF No. 44 .)  FNB suggested that a reasonable fee might be  \n$134,085.00 plus $4,737.86 in expens es.  (FNB Corporation’s Res p. Pl’s. Mot. \nAttorney’s Fees Expenses 5.) \n15. On February 28, 2018, the Court conducted the Settlement hearing.  No \nobjection had been filed and no  objector appeared .  At the Settlement hearing , \nPlaintiff’s Counsel orally reduced their request for fees and ex penses to a total of \n$200,000.  The amended request yields an implied hourly rate of $463.31 per hour \n($200,000 less $4,737.86 in expenses divided by 421.45 hours). \n16. The Court orally indicated that it would enter a written order approving \nthe Settlement, but reserved consideration of the request for fees and expenses.  The \nCourt raised the question whether the Fee Agreement complies with Rules 1.5 and \n1.8 of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar \n(“RPC”).  At that time, the  Court had under consideration a request for fees and \nexpenses in another class settlement in which Lead Counsel are also counsel of \nrecord.  In re Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. S’holder Litig. , No. 16 CVS 3669, 2018 \n \n \nNCBC LEXIS 61, at *1 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 20, 2018) (“Krispy Kreme II”).  The Court \nthen allowed supplemental briefing on the RPC issues in both cases. \n17. On April 9, 2018, Lead Counsel submitted a supplemental brief  \naddressing the RPC issues.  \n18. The Motion is ripe for resolution. \nIII. ANALYSIS \nA. The Court May Award Attorneys’ Fees and Expenses Pursuant to a \nFee-Shifting Provision in a Class-Action Settlement Agreement.   \n \n19. As this Court recently recognized in Krispy Kreme II, attorneys’ fees are \ngenerally not recoverable absent statutory authority, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *10  \n(citing Stillwell Enters., Inc. v. Interstate Equip. Co. , 300 N.C. 286, 289, 266 S.E.2d \n812, 814–15 (1980)), but “parties to a class action may agree to a fee-shifting provision \nin a negotiated settlement that is . . . subject to the trial court’s approval.”  Ehrenhaus \nv. Baker, 243 N.C. App. 17, 30, 776 S.E.2d 699, 708 (2015); see also Krispy Kreme II, \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *11 –13 (citing prior orders of this Court allowing fees on \nthis basis). \n20.  The Court must limit any award to an amou nt that is “fair and \nreasonable,” Ehrenhaus, 234 N.C. App. at 30, 776 S.E.2d at 708, assess “the \nmateriality and value of the disclosures obtained against the amount of attorneys’ \nfees requested ,” and determine whether the award comports with the factors \nenumerated in RPC 1.5(a).  In re Newbridge S’holder Litig. , No. 15 CVS 9251, 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 91, at *37 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 22, 2016).  \n \n \n21. The Court will conduct a “searching inquiry” to determine whether and \nin what amount to award attorneys’ fees where a settlement includes a class release \nin exchange for supplemental disclosures without a monetary award.  Krispy Kreme \nII, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *12.  That inquiry is necessarily case-specific. \nB. RPC 1.5(a) Favors an Award of Reasonable Attorneys’ Fees.  \n22. RPC 1.5(a) states that \n[a] lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal \nor clearly excessive fee or charge or collect a clearly excessive amount \nfor expenses. The factors to be considered in determining whether a fee \nis clearly excessive include the following: (1) the time and labor required, \nthe novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill \nrequisite to perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood, if \napparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment \nwill preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3) the fee customarily \ncharged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount involved \nand the results obtained; (5) the time lim itations imposed by the client \nor by the circumstances; (6) the nature and length of the professional \nrelationship with the client; (7) the experience, reputation, and ability \nof the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8) whether the fee \nis fixed or contingent.  \n \nN.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a). \n23. In Krispy Kreme II, the Court recently concluded that it should consider \nthe time spent up to an d including the filing of a motion for settle ment approval.  \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *13–14.  The Court reaches the same conclusion here.  The \ntime spent up to and including the filing of the Motion is 421.45 hours.  (Pl’s. Mem. \nL. Supp. Mot. Approval Attorneys’ Fees Expenses 7.)   \n24. The Court must eliminate any unnecessary or excessive time spent that \nis included within that total.  Krispy Kreme II, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *14–16.  The \nreported hours were for efforts that the  Court finds necessary and appropriate, \n \n \nincluding: researching and drafting a complaint, drafting a motion for expedited \ndiscovery, drafting a motion for a preliminary injunction, conducting two depositions, \nand effectuating the Settlement.  Each of these efforts was appropriate in light of the \nnature of litigation.  See N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5( a)(1).  However, a fter \nthoroughly examining the record and the underlying time records submitted in \ncamera, the Court concludes that some inefficient and duplicative time should be \nexcluded.  As examples: \n Nearly a quarter of the total time spent in the ent ire litigation (101.24 \nof 421.45 hours, or 24%) concerned the taking of two depositions.  (Long \nAff. Ex. B.)  This includes a total of 67.5 hours by one associate preparing \nfor a single deposition.  (Long Aff. Ex. B.)   \n Four attorneys spent at least 34.2 hours drafting and preparing a single, \nseventeen-page complaint.  (Long. Aff. Ex. B; Aff. Gary W. Jackson, \nEsquire Supp. Mot. Pl’s. Counsel Seeking Award Attorneys’ Fees \nExpenses (“Jackson Aff.”), ECF No. 38, Ex. A.) \n One partner spent 18.5 hours on work described only as “review[ing] and \nfinaliz[ing] settlement papers.”  (Long Aff. Ex. B.)   \n25. Based on this review, and exercising its discretion, the Court concludes \nthat any award should be limited to total time spent of 350 hours.  The Court made \na higher percentage reduction in Krispy Kreme, but did so to account for duplicate \nefforts among multiple firms that brought multiple class action suits arising from the \n \n \nsame merger.  Krispy Kreme II, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *14–16.  In contrast, \nPlaintiff’s suit here was the sole lawsuit, avoiding similar duplication of effort. \n26. The Court now examines the fee request pursuant to the RPC 1.5(a) \nfactors.  The Court finds that neither RPC 1.5(a)(2), 1.5(a)(5), nor 1.5(a)(6) weigh \nheavily in favor of or against a fee award, as there is nothing in the record to suggest  \nthat “the nature of thi s engagement precluded [Plainti ff’s Counsel] from taking on \nother work during the brief period of this engagement. ”  Newbridge, 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 91, at *41. \n27. The Court considers the fee request against a lodestar calculation based \non the fee customarily charged in North Carolina for similar services, N.C. Rev. R. \nProf. Conduct 1.5(a)(3), even if those rates may be substantially less than fees that \nmay be regularly quoted by out-of-state counsel.  Krispy Kreme II, 2018 NCBC LEXIS \n61, at *16.  The Court finds nothing in this record to suggest that the claims could \nnot have been adequately and effectively prosecuted by North Carolina counsel  \nexperienced in complex litigation of this type.   \n28. In their brief supporting the Motion, Plaintiff’s Counsel assert that their \nrequest is based on a lodestar that is a “substantial discount” from their normal \nbilling rates.  (Pl’s. Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Approva l Attorneys’ Fees Expenses 7.)  To \nthe contrary, the Motion seeks an implied rate about 30% above their normal billing \nrates as reflected in the affidavits submitted in support of the Motion.  (Pl’s. Mem. L. \nSupp. Mot. Approval Attorneys’ Fees Expenses 7 (requesting $295,262.14 in fees \nwhen Plaintiff’s Counsel’s “normal billing rates” would generate a lodestar of \n \n \n$226,842.50).)  Even the reduced revised request of $200,000 yields a “discount” from \nPlaintiff’s Counsel’s normal billing rates of only about 12% ($200,000 request \ncompared to $226,842.50 if calculated using “normal rates”).  And the revised request \nof $200,000 yields an implied rate of $463.31 per hour before accounting for the hours \nthe Court has excluded as excessive ($200,000 less $4,737.86 in expenses divided by \n421.45 hours).  When taking into account this reduction in hours, Plaintiff Counsel’s \nreduced request equates to an implied hourly rate of $557.89  ($200,000 less $4,737.86 \nin expenses divided by 350 hours). \n29. This Court has in similar litigation previously recognized a range of \n$250 to $550 per hour  for services of highly qualified North Carolina counsel . In re \nPike S’holder Litig., No. 14 CVS 1202, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *22–23 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Oct. 5, 2015) (recognizing a range from $250 to $550); see also In re Harris Teeter \nMerger Litig., No. 13 CVS 12579, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 47, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. \n24, 2014) ( recognizing a range from $250 to $450); Krispy Kreme II , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 61, at *21  (finding that $300 per hour was a reasonable rate) .  The Court \nrecognizes the same range here.  To the extent that North Carolina Court of Appeals’ \ndecisions are in conflict regarding whether a trial court may judicially notice a range \nof prevailing hourly rates, compare Simpson v. Simpson, 209 N.C. App. 320, 328, 703 \nS.E.2d 890, 895 (2011) (holding that a trial court “is permitted  . . . to take judicial \nnotice of the customary hourly rates of local attorneys performing the same services \nand having the same experience”) with WFC Lynnwood I LLC v. Lee of Raleigh, Inc., \nNo. COA17-562, N.C. App. LEXIS 564, at *18 (June 5, 2018) (holding that “ the trial \n \n \ncourt erred by making a finding with respect to t he ‘customary fee for like work’’’  \nabsent an affidavit describing comparable local rates), the Court in this case follows \nthe line of cases that allow judicial notice of local prevailing rates.  This is particularly \nappropriate because the Court is taking judicial notice of its own cases in which it \nhas received affidavit testimony regarding prevailing local rates , and in light of  the \nCourt’s regular monitoring of fee applications in similar cases in North Carolina and \nDelaware. \n30. As it determines an award within the range identified above, the Court \nmust “assess the reasonableness of the requested fees in light of the amount involved \nand the results obtained.”  Krispy Kreme II, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *18 ; see also \nN.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a)(4).   \n31. The supplemental disclosures here included “ (1) disclosures relating to \nthe background of the [m] erger and (2)  disclosures relating to Yadkin’ s financial \nprojections.”  Moss v. Towell , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *14 .  More specifically, the \nsupplemental disclosures revealed  an additional party not dis closed in the original \nproxy that had  expressed interest, that all  potentially interested parties, not just \nFNB, had executed non -disclosure agreements, and that three of  these agreements \nalso included “don’t ask, don ’t waive” provisions.  (Pl’s. Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Final \nApproval Settlement 13–14, ECF No. 43; Stipulation Ex. A, at 3–4.)  Although a court \nmust be careful not to t ake disclosures out of context and consider the total body of \ninformation available to shareholders, the Delaware Court of Chancery has \nrecognized supplemental dis closures of this type as particularly significant .  In re \n \n \nAncestry.com Inc. S’holder Litig., C.A. No. 7988-CS, 2012 Del. Ch. LEXIS 294 (Del. \nCh. Dec. 17, 2012) (transcript).  Further, the supplemental disclosures provided \nadditional information that a shareholder may have considered material in assessing \nthe Company’s fairness opinion.  In re NPS Pharmaceuticals Stockholders Litig., C.A. \nNo. 10553-VCN (Del. Ch. Feb. 18, 2016) (transcript).   \n32. When approving the Settlement, the Court concluded that the \nsupplemental disclosures constituted reasonable consideration for the release such \nthat they were not “‘plainly disproportionate’ to the scope of the [r]elease.”  Moss, \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *18 (quoting In re Krispy Kreme Doughnuts S’holder Litig., \nNo. 16 CVS 3669, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 1, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 2, 2018).  In now \nconsidering the fee request, the “relevant inquiry  . . . is whether the supplemental \ndisclosures, even if sufficiently  material to constitute consideration for the \nSettlement, are of such obvious value to justify a fee resulting in an implied rate at \nthe high end of the range for legal services for class actions in North Carolina.”  Krispy \nKreme II, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *19–20.   \n33. In Krispy Kreme  II, the Court concluded that the value of the \nsupplemental disclosures did not warrant an hourly rate at the higher end of the \nappropriate range and issued an award based on $300 per hour.  Id. at *21.  The \nCourt finds that the  materiality of the  supplemental disclosures in this case is \nsomewhat more apparent than those in Krispy Kreme II, but not so obvious to justify \nan award at the highest end of the range.   \n \n \n34. The Court has further considered whether the contingent nature of the \nfee warrants an award toward the upper end of the range, N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct \n1.5(a)(8), but concludes that no further upward adjustment because of this factor is \nappropriate in this case.  Further, while the litigation required skilled counsel \nexperienced in shareholder class actions, the Court similarly concludes that neither \nfactor 1.5(a)(1) nor 1.5(a)(7) strongly support a further upward adjustment toward \nthe high end of the range.  N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a)(1) and 1.5(a)(7). \n35. Accordingly, after considering each of the RPC 1.5(a) factors, the Court, \nin its discretion, concludes that a fee award of $ 140,000 is appropriate, yielding an \nimplied rate of $400 per hour ($140,000 fee award divided by 350 hours).  The Court \nfinds, “base d on its experience, its prior conclusions, and the conclusions of many \nother North Carolina courts,” that $ 400 per hour is “well within the standard range \nfor similar legal services in North Carolina.”  Krispy Kreme II, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, \nat *21.   \n36.   After examining supporting materials, the Court concludes that \nPlaintiff’s Counsel reasonably incurred $4,737.86 in expenses.   \n37. The Court now considers whether the Fee Agreement complies with the \nRPC, and, if not, what effect non-compliance must have on Plaintiff’s Counsel’s ability \nto recover fees and expenses. \nC. The Fee Agreement’s RPC Violations Preclude an Award of Expenses, \nbut not Attorneys’ Fees. \n \n38. The Court recently examined one of Lead Counsel’s fee agreements in \nKrispy Kreme II.  2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *22–32.  Lead Counsel’s fee agreement \n \n \nhere is identical to their agreement in Krispy Kreme II.  The Court adopts its holding \nand reasoning in Krispy Kreme II and concludes that, although that the Fee \nAgreement may have violated RPC 1.5(c)’s requirement to state a percentage of \nrecovery to accrue to Plaintiff’s Counsel in the event of a monetary fund, N.C. Rev. R. \nProf. Conduct 1.5(c), under Robertson v. Steris Corp. , 234 N.C. App. 525, 537, 760 \nS.E.2d 313, 321 (2014), any such RPC 1.5(c) violation concerns the form, not content, \nof the RPC and does not justify a forfeiture of fees.  Krispy Kreme II , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 61, at *25.   \n39. The Court further adopts its holding and reasoning in Krispy Kreme II \nand concludes that t he Fee Agreement violates RPC 1.8(e)’s requirement that \nrepayment of advanced costs be contingent upon a matter because the agreement \nabsolves Plaintiff of all financial responsibility at the outset of litigation, id. at *25, \n*28–30, and that this violation “offends the public policy on which the rule is based.”  \nId. at *31 . Accordingly , Plaintiff’s C ounsel is barred from recovering its litigation \nexpenses. \nD. The Court Need not Address Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Alternative Request \nfor an Award Based on Quantum Meruit.   \n \n40. Plaintiff’s Counsel assert that, beyond the Stipulation, the Court may \nalternatively award fees and expenses pursuant to quantum meruit via N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 55 -7-46.  (Pl’s. Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Approval Attorneys’ Fees Expenses 5.)  \n“Because the Court finds the Stipulation to be a valid contract and accepts it as the \nbasis for the award, it need not determine whether, if the Stipulation was invalid, \nrecovery based on quantum meruit would be appropriate.”  Krispy Kreme II , 2018 \n \n \nNCBC LEXIS 61, at *32 (citing Robinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. v. Smith , 129 \nN.C. App. 305, 315, 498 S.E.2d 841, 849 (1998)). \nIV. CONCLUSION \n41. For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANT S in part and DENIES in \npart the Motion.  Defendants shall pay Plaintiff’s Counsel a total of $ 140,000.00 as \nattorneys’ fees.  Plaintiff’s Counsel shall not recover their expenses in the litigation.   \nThis the 3rd day of July, 2018. \n \n \n /s/ James L. Gale \n James L. Gale \n Senior Business Court Judge \n "
