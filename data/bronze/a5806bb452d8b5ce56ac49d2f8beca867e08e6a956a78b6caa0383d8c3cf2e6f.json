Harris, Esq. for Plaintiff.  \n \nWomble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, PLLC, by Christopher W. Jones, Esq. and \nRobert T. Numbers, II, Esq. for Defendant.   \n \nJolly, Judge.  \n \n \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY  \n[1] On August 13, 2010, Plaintiff filed its Complai nt in Wake County.  In the \nComplaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action (\"Claim(s)\"): (a) First Claim \n(Declaratory Judgment); (b) Second Claim (Breach of Contract); (c) Third Claim (Unjust \nEnrichment); (d) Fourth Claim (Fraud/Fraudulent Inducement); (e) Fifth Claim (Negligent \nMisrepresentation); (f) Sixth Claim (Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices) and (g) \nSeventh Claim (Preliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief). \n[2] On October 20, 2010, Defendant filed its Answer  and Counterclaim, \nalleging the following counterclaims (\"Counterclaim(s)\")1: (a) First Counterclaim (Breach \nof Contract); (b) Second Counterclaim (Breach of Fiduciary Duty) and (c) Third \nCounterclaim (Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices). \n[3] Also on October 20, 2010, Defendant filed its M otion to Dismiss \n(\"Defendant's Motion\"), which seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's First, Third, Fourth, Fifth and \nSixth Claims.  \n[4] On November 4, 2010, Defendant filed its First Amended Answer and \nCounterclaim as a matter of right, pursuant to Rule 15.  This pleading did not add any \nsubstantive Counterclaims.  \n[5] On December 10, 2010, Plaintiff filed its Motio n to Dismiss (\"Plaintiff's \nMotion\"), which seeks dismissal of Defendant's Second and Third Counterclaims.2 \n                                                 \n1 The Counterclaims are not stated as separate claim s for relief under clearly defined separate \nsubheadings.  For the sake of clarity, the court has elected to label and number the respective \nCounterclaims as reflected in this Opinion and Order. \n2 Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss seeks dismissal of Defendant's \"Counterclaim.\" It does not specify whether \nPlaintiff contends all, or only some, of Defendant's Counterclaims are subject to dismissal.  However, \nPlaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim addresses only Defendant's \nSecond and Third Counterclaims.  Accordingly, the court addresses only those two Counterclaims. \n[6] On December 10, 2010, Plaintiff also filed a Mo tion for Leave to Amend its \nComplaint.  This proposed pleading did not add any substantive Claims. \n[7] On January 10, 2011, Defendant similarly filed a Motion for Leave to \nAmend its First Amended Answer and Counterclaim. \n[8] On September 28, 2011, the court entered an Ord er granting the parties' \nrespective Motions for Leave to Amend. \n[9] In its Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim, deemed filed on \nSeptember 28, 2011, Defendant alleged the following additional Counterclaims: (a) \nFourth Counterclaim (Negligent Misrepresentation), (b) Fifth Counterclaim (Breach of \nDuty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing) and (c) Sixth Counterclaim (Fraud).3 \n[10] Plaintiff’s Motion does not address Defendant’ s Fourth, Fifth and Sixth \nCounterclaims. \n[11] On April 2, 2012, Plaintiff filed its Second M otion for Leave to Amend \n(\"Plaintiff's Second Motion\"), whereby it seeks to add an Eighth Claim (Rescission).  \nThe time for Defendant to respond to Plaintiff's Second Motion has not expired.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff's Second Motion is not before the court for consideration at this \ntime. \n[12] The Motions have been briefed, argued and are ripe for adjudication. 4  \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n3 See  note 1. \n4 It appears that the parties intend for their respective previously-filed Motions to apply to the Amended \nComplaint and Second Amended Answer and Counterclai m.  Accordingly, the court deems the parties' \nMotions to apply to said amended pleadings.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n Among other things, the Complaint and Counterclaim s allege as follows:  \n[13] Plaintiff Emergys Corporation (\"Emergys\") is a  corporation duly organized \nand existing pursuant to the laws of the State of North Carolina.  Emergys provides \nbusiness technology solutions across a variety of industries. \n[14] Defendant Consert, Inc. (\"Consert\") is a corpo ration duly organized and \nexisting under the laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal place of business \nlocated in Raleigh, North Carolina. 5  Consert specializes in the development and \nimplementation of load management systems designed to conserve energy and lower \ncosts for utility companies. \n[15] In June 2009, Consert began looking for a new software developer to aid \nin the development and completion of its energy management software, referred to as \nthe Kermit Application (the \"Software\").6 \n[16] Emergys had a working relationship with Conser t and decided to prepare \na bid for work on the Software.  At the time and while Emergys was preparing its bid, \nEmergys alleges that Joe Forbes (\"Forbes\"), a principal of Consert, repeatedly \nrepresented to Emergys that Consert would direct future business to Emergys and grant \nEmergys \"preferred vendor\" status. 7 \n[17] Emergys prepared a bid that provided an estima te of $1,300,000 for \ndevelopment of the first version of the Software for Consert by December 31, 2009.  \nEmergys alleges that this estimate constituted a forty-percent (40%) discount off its \n                                                 \n5 Consert was headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the commencement of this civil action, but \nrecently moved its headquarters to San Antonio, Tex as. \n6 Am. Compl. ¶ 7. \n7 Id. ¶ 14. \nregular rates and was offered because of Forbes' representations to Emergys about \nfuture business prospects and preferred vendor status. 8 \n[18] After the submission of Emergys’ bid, the part ies entered contract \nnegotiations.  During the negotiations, Consert explained its financial situation and told \nEmergys that it was trying to raise venture capital. 9  The parties discussed various \nfinancing options.  Ultimately, Emergys offered to defer billing of the first $300,000 for \nwork on the Software until October 2009 and to defer billing for the remainder of the \nbalance until March 2010. 10   Emergys told Forbes and Consert that these were firm \npayment deadlines.11  \n[19] On July 21, 2009, after extensive arms length negotiations,12  the parties \nexecuted a Consulting Agreement and an accompanying Statement of Work \n(collectively, the \"Agreement\").13  \n[20] After the execution of the Agreement, Emergys began performing software \ndevelopment services.  \n[21] In October 2009, Consert offered to pay Emergy s with 3,500 shares of \nstock in lieu of the first $300,000 payment that was due under the Agreement.  Emergys \nultimately accepted this offer.14  \n[22] Subsequently, Emergys completed the work on th e first version of the \nSoftware.  The total price to Consert for this work, completed during the period ending \n                                                 \n8 Id. ¶ 14. \n9 Id. ¶ 16. \n10  Id. ¶ 19. \n11  Id.  \n12  Id. ¶ 21. \n13  Compl., Ex.

In deciding a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint are taken as true and \nadmitted, but conclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of facts are not admitted. \nSutton v. Duke , 277 N.C. 94, 98 (1970).  \n[34] A complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when \neither (a) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff's claim, (b) \nthe complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim or  \n(c) some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff's claim.  \nJackson v. Bumgardner , 318 N.C. 172, 175 (1986).  However, a complaint should not \nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted unless it (a) \ndoes not give sufficient notice to the defendant of the nature and basis of the plaintiff’s \n                                                 \n32  Second Am.

Sutton , 277 N.C. at 102.  \nPlaintiff's Claims  \nPlaintiff’s First Claim (Declaratory Judgment) \n \n[35] Plaintiff alleges that it is entitled to a dec laratory judgment with regard to \nthe validity of the Agreement 34  and ownership of various intellectual property rights.  \nDefendant contends that Plaintiff has failed to establish an actual controversy with \nregard to these Claims.  Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has not alleged any facts \nsupporting the Claim that there is an existing disagreement over the validity and \nenforceability of the Agreement.  Additionally, Defendant argues that the parties’ \nrespective intellectual property rights are not in dispute, but that this Claim merely \nrestates Plaintiff’s Claim for breach of contract.35   Indeed, \"when a litigant seeks relief \nunder the declaratory judgment statute, he must set forth in his pleading all facts \nnecessary to disclose the existence of an actual controversy between the parties to the \naction with regard to their respective rights and duties.\"  Lide v. Mears , 231 N.C. \n111,118 (1949).  Defendant acknowledges that the Agreement is a valid contract \nbetween the parties. 36   Therefore, the court CONCLUDES that there exists no \ncontroversy as to the validity of the Agreement between the parties.  Defendant’s \nMotion, as to Plaintiff's Claim for declaratory judgment with respect to the validity of the \nAgreement, should be GRANTED.  \n[36] With respect to the parties' intellectual prop erty rights, however, the court \nCONCLUDES that Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to establish that an actual \n                                                 \n34  Including the subsequent addenda. \n35  Def. Reply Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 2. \n36  Id.  1. \ncontroversy exists between the parties.  As such, Plaintiff’s Claim meets the pleading \nrequirements under the standard articulated by Rule 12(b)(6) and Sutton , 277 N.C. at \n102.  Therefore, Defendant’s Motion, as to Plaintiff's Claim for declaratory judgment with \nrespect to the parties’ intellectual property rights, should be DENIED. \nPlaintiff’s Third Claim (Unjust Enrichment) \n[37] Plaintiff alleges that Defendant benefited fro m the work performed by \nPlaintiff and that Defendant has not paid for that work, resulting in unjust enrichment.37   \nUnder North Carolina law, a claim for unjust enrichment is precluded by the existence of \na written contract.  Paul L.  Whitfield, P.A. v. Gilchrist , 348 N.C. 39, 42 (1998); Maxwell \nv. Michael P. Doyle, Inc. , 164 N.C. App. 319, 328 (2004); Horack v. S. Real Estate Co. \nof Charlotte, Inc., 150 N.C. App. 305, 311 (2002).  Plaintiff concedes that if the \nAgreement is controlling, then it will be unable to recover under its unjust enrichment \nClaim.38   As discussed above, the court CONCLUDES that there is no controversy as to \nthe validity of the Agreement.  Therefore, Defendant’s Motion as to Plaintiff’s Claim for \nunjust enrichment should be GRANTED. \nPlaintiff’s Tort-Based Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claims  \n[38] Defendant contends that Plaintiff's Complaint attempts the \"tortification\" of a \nsimple breach of contract action.39   Defendant argues that as such, Plaintiff's Fourth, Fifth \nand Sixth Claims, for fraud, negligent misrepresentation and unfair and deceptive trade \npractices, should be dismissed without further analysis.  Indeed, \"an independent tort action \nin a breach of contract action . . . [must involve] some other aggravating element outside \nthe breach of contractual duties.\"  Garlock v. Hilliard , 2000 NCBC 11, ¶ 33 (N.C. Super. Ct. \n                                                 \n37  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 68-69. \n38  Pl. Mem. Opp'n Def. Mot. Dismiss 16. \n39  Def. Mem. Supp. Mot.

Fry Roofing Co. , 294 N.C. 73, \n81 (1978) (citations omitted) (\"Ordinarily, a breach of contract does not give rise to a tort \naction by the promisee against the promisor.\").  An independent tort may arise out of a \nbreach of contract only in \"carefully circumscribed\" instances where the tort is \"identifiable\" \nand distinct from the primary breach of contract claim.  Newton v. Standard Fire Ins. Co ., \n291 N.C. 105, 111-12 (1976).  \"The mere failure to carry out a promise in contract . . . does \nnot support a tort action for fraud.\"  Strum v. Exxon Co., USA , 15 F.3d 327, 331 (4th Cir. \n1994) (citing Hoyle v. Bagby , 253 N.C. 778, 781 (1961)). \n[39] Here, contrary to Defendant's contention, Plai ntiff's tort claims are identifiable \nand distinct from the primary breach of contract claim, which is based upon Defendant's \npromise to pay for services rendered.  Among other things, Plaintiff's tort claims focus on \nalleged misrepresentations made during the parties' contract negotiations that induced \nPlaintiff to enter into the Agreement, when it otherwise would not have done so.  Such \nallegations are distinct from a breach of contract action and, if properly alleged, are \nsufficient to withstand Defendant's Motion.  See Media Network, Inc. v. Mullen Adver., Inc ., \n2007 NCBC 1, ¶¶ 113-14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 19, 2007) (rejecting the defendant's \nargument that the plaintiff merely alleged breach of contract, where the complaint contained \nallegations of misrepresentations made during the parties' contract negotiations, giving rise \nto separate tort-based claims).   The court will address each of the three Claims in turn. \nPlaintiff’s Fourth Claim (Fraud/Fraudulent Inducement)  \n[40] Plaintiff alleges that Defendant fraudulently induced Plaintiff to enter into the \nAgreement with promises of payment, preferred vendor status and future business \nopportunities.  Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s fraud Claim fails because (a) it lacks the \nnecessary particularity, (b) it did not provide any factual allegations that demonstrate \nDefendant knew its representations were false at the time they were made and (c) \nPlaintiff’s reliance on these allegedly false statements was unreasonable. 40  \n[41] With regard to this Fourth Claim, Plaintiff's initial Complaint failed to plead \nsufficient particular facts to support a fraud claim under the standard of Rule 9(b).  Rather, \nthe Complaint contained only general allegations of wrongdoing by Consert and failed to \nspecify a particular person who allegedly made fraudulent misrepresentations.  However, in \nits Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that specific false representations were made to \nEmergys by Forbes, on behalf of Consert. \n[42] Although this Claim presents a close Rule 12(b )(6) question, our system is \none of notice pleading, and in light of the additional factual allegations in the Amended \nComplaint, the court is forced to CONCLUDE that Plaintiff has pleaded sufficiently its fraud \nClaim under the standard articulated by Rule 12(b)(6), Rule 9(b) and Sutton , 277 N.C. at \n102.  Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion as to said Claim should be DENIED. 41   \nPlaintiff’s Fifth Claim (Negligent Misrepresentation) \n[43] To state a claim for negligent misrepresentati on under North Carolina law, a \nclaimant must allege that (a) the claimant justifiably relied (b) to his detriment (c) on \ninformation prepared without reasonable care (d) by one who owed the relying party a duty \nof care.  Brinkman v. Barrett Kays & Assocs. , 155 N.C. App. 738, 742 (2003) (internal \nquotation omitted). \n                                                 \n40  Def. Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 12. \n41  Defendant can test this Fourth Claim at a later stage of this matter pursuant to Rule 56.   \n[44] A breach of the duty owed in negligent misrepr esentation occurs when \"[o]ne \nwho, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in \nwhich he has a pecuniary interest , supplies false information for the guidance of others in \ntheir business transactions . . . .\"  Marcus Bros. Textiles, Inc.  v. Price Waterhouse, LLP , \n350 N.C. 214, 218 (1999).  Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant negligently made \nmaterially false or misleading statements and representations concerning Defendant’s \nability and/or willingness to pay for the software development services and its intention to \ngive Plaintiff preferred vendor status and future business.  Defendant contends that this \nclaim should be dismissed because the Complaint does not contain the necessary factual \nallegations for a claim of negligent misrepresentation.  However, the court CONCLUDES \nthat Plaintiff has pleaded sufficiently its negligent misrepresentation Claim under the \nstandard articulated by Rule 12(b)(6) and Sutton , 277 N.C. at 102.  Accordingly, \nDefendant’s Motion as to said Claim should be DENIED .  \nPlaintiff’s Sixth Claim (Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices) \n[45] Plaintiff alleges unfair and deceptive trade p ractices, arising from many of the \nsame allegations of its other claims.  Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s unfair and \ndeceptive trade practices Claim fails to allege the necessary aggravating factors to elevate \nthis matter beyond a breach of contract claim.  However, \"proof of fraud would necessarily \nconstitute a violation of the prohibition against unfair and deceptive acts.\"  Bhatti v. \nBuckland, 328 N.C. 240, 243 (1991) (citing  Hardy v. Toler , 288 N.C. 303, 309 (1975)); Allen \nv. Roberts Constr. Co., Inc. , 138 N.C. App. 557, 569 (2000).  As previously indicated, \nPlaintiff has pleaded sufficiently its Claim for fraud; and as such, the court CONCLUDES \nPlaintiff has pleaded sufficiently its claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices under the \nstandard articulated by Rule 12(b)(6) and Sutton , 277 N.C. at 102.  Therefore, Defendant’s \nMotion as to this Claim should be DENIED.  \nDefendant’s Counterclaims  \nDefendant’s Second Counterclaim (Breach of Fiduciary Duty) \n[46] Defendant contends that Plaintiff breached its  fiduciary duty to Defendant \nby creating a fiduciary relationship in which Defendant was dependent on Plaintiff and \nthen suddenly abandoning the project, leaving Defendant in a \"dire business position.\"42  \n\"[F]or a fiduciary duty to exist, there must first be a fiduciary relationship between the \nparties.\"  Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., LLC , 196 N.C. App. 469, 472 (2009) (citing  Dalton v. \nCamp , 353 N.C. 647, 651 (2001)).  A fiduciary relationship has been defined broadly as \na relationship in which \"there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in \nequity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the \ninterests of the one reposing confidence.\"  Dalton , 353 at 651.  Domination and \ninfluence are essential components in a fiduciary relationship.  Id.  \"Only when one party \nfiguratively holds all the cards – all the financia l power, or technical information, for \nexample – have North Carolina courts found that the  special circumstance of a fiduciary \nrelationship exists.\"  S.N.R. Mgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC , 189 N.C. App. \n601, 613 ( citing Broussard , 155 F.3d at 348).  Additionally, parties to a contract do not \nbecome each other’s fiduciaries, but only owe each other the duties specified by the \nterms of the contract and the UCC.  Branch Banking and Trust Co. v. Thompson , 107 \nN.C. App. 53, 61 (1992). \n[47] Defendant alleges that Plaintiff assumed the r ole of fiduciary and \n\"accepted that higher duty of care\" to Defendant by \"undertaking the project and \n                                                 \n42  Am.

It is \nwell established under North Carolina law that the element of control is what gives rise \nto a fiduciary duty between the controlling shareholder and the minority.  Hill v. Erwin \nMills, Inc. , 239 N.C. 437, 443 (1954) (\"The rights and powers vested in those holding a \nmajority of the capital stock in a corporation imposes on them a fiduciary relationship as \nbetween them and the minority stockholders.\"); Norman v. Nash Johnson & Sons' \nFarms, Inc ., 140 N.C. App. 390, 407 (2000) (quoting Gaines v. Long Mfg. Co. , 243 N.C. \n340, 344-45 (1951)) (\"It is the fact of control of the common property held and \nexercised, and not the particular means by which or manner in which the control is \nexercised, that creates the fiduciary obligation on the part of the majority stockholders in \na corporation for the minority holders.\"). \n[48] Therefore, the court CONCLUDES that Defendant has not alleged facts \nsufficient to show that Plaintiff exerted the requisite domination or influence over \nDefendant giving rise to the existence of a fiduciary relationship.  The duties the parties \nowed one another were merely contractual in nature.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion \nshould be GRANTED as to Defendant’s Counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n                                                \n \n43  Id . ¶ 21, \n44  Am. Compl. ¶ 21; Def. Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 2. \nDefendant’s Third Counterclaim (Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices) \n[49] Defendant alleges unfair and deceptive trade p ractices arising from \nallegations that Plaintiff included proprietary information in the Software 2.0 it developed for \nDefendant without Defendant’s knowledge and against Defendant’s requests.  Plaintiff \ncontends that Defendant does not provide sufficient factual allegations to support a claim \nfor unfair and deceptive trade practices. \n[50] However, as previously stated in this Opinion and Order, \"proof of fraud would \nnecessarily constitute a violation of the prohibition against unfair and deceptive acts.\"  \nBhatti, 328 N.C. at 243 (citing  Hardy , 288 N.C. at 309); Allen , 138 N.C. App. at 569.  Here, \nby way of its Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim, Defendant has stated a fraud \nCounterclaim against Plaintiff, which Counterclaim is not a subject of Plaintiff's Motion.  \nConsequently, the court CONCLUDES Plaintiff has pleaded sufficiently its Counterclaim for \nunfair and deceptive trade practices under the standard articulated by Rule 12(b)(6) and \nSutton , 277 N.C. at 102.  Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion as to this Counterclaim should be \nDENIED.  \nNOW THEREFORE, based on the foregoing, it hereby is ORDERED that:  \n[51] To the extent Plaintiff's First Claim (Declara tory Judgment) seeks a \ndeclaration with respect to the validity of the Agreement, Defendant's Motion is \nGRANTED, and said Claim is DISMISSED. \n[52] To the extent Plaintiff's First Claim (Declara tory Judgment) seeks a \ndeclaration with respect to the parties' respective intellectual property rights arising from \nthe Agreement, Defendant's Motion is DENIED. \n[53] Defendant's Motion with regard to Plaintiff's Third Claim (Unjust \nEnrichment) is GRANTED, and said Claim is DISMISSED. \n[54] Defendant's Motion with regard to Plaintiff's Fourth Claim \n(Fraud/Fraudulent Inducement), Fifth Claim (Negligent Misrepresentation) and Sixth \nClaim (Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices) is DENIED. \n[55] Plaintiff’s Motion with regard to Defendant's Second Counterclaim (Breach \nof Fiduciary Duty) is GRANTED, and said Counterclaim is DISMISSED. \n[56] Plaintiff’s Motion with regard to Defendant's Third Counterclaim (Unfair \nand Deceptive Trade Practices) is DENIED. \n[57] Except as specifically granted above, the part ies' respective Motions are \nDENIED. \n[58] On or before Monday, April 23, 2012, the parti es shall submit to the court a \nCase Management Report pursuant to the provisions of Rule 17, General Rules of Practice \nand Procedure for the North Carolina Business Court. \n[59] On Monday, April 30, 2012, at 12:00 noon, at t he North Carolina Business \nCourt, 225 Hillsborough Street, Suite 303, Raleigh, North Carolina, the court will conduct a \nCase Management Conference with counsel for all parties to this action.  \nThis the 5th day of April, 2012. \n \n      "
