On June 7, 2013, Plaintiff Cape Hatte ras Electric Membership Corporation \n(\"Plaintiff\" or \"CHEMC\") filed its Amen ded Complaint against Gina L. Stevenson \n(\"Stevenson\"), Joseph F. Noce (\"Noce\"), and other Defendants.  The other Defendants \nsubsequently were dismissed and Stevenson and Noce are the only Defendants remaining in \nthe action.  The Amended Complaint contains two claims against Stevenson for Declaratory \nJudgment (First and Second Claims for Relief),  a claim for intentional  interference with \ncontractual relations against Noce (Third Cl aim for Relief), and a claim against Stevenson \nand Noce for civil conspiracy (Fourth Claim for Relief). \n2. On September 13, 2013, Noce filed a Motion to Dismiss.1 \n3. On March 10, 2014, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as \nto its First and Second Claims for Relief.  In the First and Second Claims for Relief, Plaintiff \nseeks, as against Stevenson, \"a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties \npursuant to\" sections 1.08 and 2.10 of the CHEMC By-laws under G.S. § 1-254.  Plaintiff has \nnot moved for summary judgment on its claims fo r intentional interference with contract or \nfor civil conspiracy. \n4. On April 30, 2014, Noce filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking \nsummary judgment in his favor on Plaintiff's intentional interference with contract and civil \nconspiracy claims alleged against him. \n                                                 \n1 Noce's Motion to Dismiss is coextensive with his Motion for Summary Judgment. Accordingly, the \nCourt considers Noce's Motion to Dismiss as subsumed in his Motion for Summary Judgment. \n \n5. On May 1, 2014, Stevenson filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking \nsummary judgment in her favor on all claims asserted against her. \n6. The Motions for Summary Judgment have been fully briefed and argued, and \nare ripe for determination. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Court considers the following facts in deciding the Motions for Summary \nJudgment.2 \n5. CHEMC is an electric membership corporation duly chartered and \nincorporated under G.S. Chapter 117, with its pr incipal office and place of business in Dare \nCounty, North Carolina.  CHEMC is a public agency of the State of North Carolina.  \nCHEMC's business is the transmission and re distribution of electric power, and the \nconstruction and maintenance of facilities related thereto.   \n6. CHEMC supplies electricity to its member s residing within its service area. \nCHEMC is the exclusive provider of electric power to residents of Hatteras Island.  CHEMC \nhas the power of eminent domain as a private condemner pursuant to G.S. § 40-3(a), and it \nmay acquire by purchase or condemnation property for, \ninter alia, the construction of power \ngenerating facilities, substations, and electrical transmission lines. \n7. CHEMC is empowered to adopt By-laws.  G.S. § 117-14(1).  Members who join \nCHEMC \"shall have complied with the terms and  conditions in respect to membership \ncontained in the By-laws . . . [p]rovided, that such terms and conditions of membership shall \nbe reasonable.\" G.S. § 117-16.   \n                                                 \n2 A court does not make findings of fact in ruling upon a motion for summary judgment. However, the \ncourt may summarize material facts that do not appear to be at issue and which justify the judgment. \nHyde Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142 (1975). \n \n8. CHEMC has adopted By-laws (hereinafter the “CHEMC By-laws” or the “By-\nlaws”).  Since at least 1989, the CHEMC By-laws have contained, inter alia, the following \nsections: \nSECTION 1.08. Member to Grant Easements to Cooperative and to Participate \nin Required Cooperative Load Management Programs.  Each member shall, \nupon being requested to do so by the Cooperative, execute and deliver to the \nCooperative grants of easement or right-of-way over, on and under such lands \nowned or leased by or mortgaged to th e member, and in accordance with such \nreasonable terms and conditions, as th e Cooperative shall require for the \nfurnishing of electric service to him or  other members or for the construction, \noperation, maintenance or relocation of  the Cooperative's electric facilities. \nEach member shall participate in any  required program and comply with \nrelated rates and service rules and regulations that may be established by the \nCooperative to enhance load managemen t, to more efficiently utilize or \nconserve electric energy or to conduct load research. \n… \nSECTION 2.01. Suspension; Reinstatement . Upon his failure, after the \nexpiration of the initial time limit prescribed either in a specific notice to him \nor in the Cooperative's generally public ized applicable rules and regulations, \nto pay any amounts due the Cooperative or to cease any other noncompliance \nwith his membership obligations, a person's membership shall automatically \nbe suspended; and he shall not during su ch suspension be entitled to receive \nelectric service from the Cooperative or to cast a vote. Payment of all amounts \ndue the Cooperative, including any additional charges required for \nreinstatement, and/or cessation of any other noncompliance with his \nmembership obligations within the final time limit provided in the specific \nnotice to him or the Cooperative's ge nerally publicized applicable rules and \nregulations shall automatically reinstate the membership. After \nreinstatement, the member shall be entitled to receive electric service from the \nCooperative and to vote. \n \n9. On July 21, 2009, Stevenson signed an \"Application for Membership\" in \nCHEMC by which she agreed to purchase electricity for her properties on Hatteras Island.  \nIn the Application for Membership, Stevenson agreed as follows: \nto be bound by and to comply with all of the other provisions of the \nCooperative's certificate of incorpor ation and By-laws, and all rules, \nregulations and rate schedules established thereto, as all the same now exist \nor may hereby be adopted or amended, and with the provisions of any \nsupplemental contract that may, coincident herewith, be executed by me with \nthe Cooperative. \n \n \n10. Stevenson has been a member of CHEMC since July 21, 2009.  As of December \n2012, Stevenson was the owner of two separate lots on Hatteras Island in the Mirlo Beach \nsubdivision designated Lot 9 and Lot 10.\n3  Lot 9 consists of unimproved property, while Lot \n10 has a residential house and other improvements on it. \n11. For many years prior to the events involved in this lawsuit, Stevenson has \nlived with Noce, and they essentially have treated each other as husband and wife.  Noce was \ninvolved in Stevenson's purchases of the prop erties on Hatteras Island, but Stevenson paid \nfor them.  Over the years, Noce has perf ormed maintenance and upkeep work on the \nproperties.  Stevenson and Noce are also memb ers of various limited liability corporations \nthat exist for the purpose of renting Stevenson's properties.  Noce has never been a member \nof CHEMC, and has not agreed to its By-laws. \n12. During 2012, CHEMC determined that it  would be necessary to relocate an \nexisting 115kV electric transmission line that was used to transmit electricity to the residents \nof Hatteras Island.  The relocation of the tra nsmission line was made necessary by severe \nerosion caused by storms that resulted in encroachment on the transmission line right-of-\nway. \n13. On December 21, 2012, Susan Flythe, Executive Vice President and General \nManager of CHEMC, sent Stevenson a letter notifying her that she would be required, \npursuant to the CHEMC By-laws, to grant CHEMC an easement or right-of-way across Lots \n9 and 10 for purposes of relocating the transmission line.4   The letter also advised Stevenson \nthat CHEMC's attorney, Norm Shearin (\"Sheari n\"), would be contacting her regarding the \nrequired easement. \n                                                 \n3 Stevenson apparently owns a third lot on Hatteras Island that is not involved in this lawsuit. \n4 CHEMC sought easements from a number of other property owners for the relocation of the \ntransmission line, including the now dismissed Defendants originally in this lawsuit.  Stevenson is \napparently the only CHEMC member from whom it is still seeking the easement. \n \n14. On February 13, 2013, Shearin sent a le tter to Stevenson enclosing a written \ncopy of a \"Right-Of-Way Agreement.\"  The lette r stated that \"you ar e obligated by the By-\nlaws to grant the easement.\"5  The right-of-way easement (\"easement\") was 44 feet wide and \nprovided CHEMC with \"a permanent and perpet ual right and easement of right-of-way\" to \nconstruct, maintain, and repair any equipmen t or power lines CHEMC deemed necessary. 6  \nThe easement placed restrictions on Stevenson's rights to use the property that was within \nthe easement, and provided CHEMC with the righ t to relocate the 44 foot easement on the \nproperties at any time if CHEMC deemed it necessary.  The easement recited as \nconsideration for its transfer \"the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) and other valuable \nconsideration.\"7  Neither the letter nor the easement stated that Stevenson had a right to \nnegotiate the easement or to seek additional compensation in exchange for the easement. \n15. On February 20, 2013, Stevenson spoke to Shearin by telephone and advised \nShearin that she did not intend to provide th e easement.  Plaintiff does not allege that \nShearin told Stevenson that CHEMC would nego tiate the easement or consider paying her \nadditional compensation for the easement. \n16. On March 26, 2013, Stevenson conveyed Lot 9 to Noce, and on April 2, 2013, \nStevenson filed the conveyance with the register of deeds.  It is undisputed that Stevenson \nand Noce discussed which of them would take  ownership of Lot 9 at the time Stevenson \npurchased it, and had discussed the transfer of Lot 9 to Noce prior to CHEMC requesting the \neasement. Stevenson and Noce testified that  Stevenson conveyed Lot 9 to Noce as \nconsideration for household bills, furniture, and  vacations Noce had paid for on the couple's \nbehalf over the years and that Stevenson believed she owed Noce.  Stevenson and Noce valued \n                                                 \n5 Stevenson Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 3. \n6 Id.  \n7 Id. \n \nthe consideration for Lot 9 at $60,000, the origi nal amount Stevenson had paid for the lot.  \nPlaintiff has not presented any evidence to contradict Stevenson's and Noce's explanation \nregarding the conveyance. \n17. During April and May of 2013, Shearin sent correspondence to Stevenson's \nattorney seeking to obtain the easement.  Sh earin also corresponded with Noce regarding \nCHEMC's intent to file eminent domain proceedings and its need to enter Lot 9. On April 15, \n2013, CHEMC filed petitions for condemnation of property pursuant to G.S. § 40A-19 in Dare \nCounty Superior Court against Stevenson, Noce, and other property owners. \n18. On April 18, 2013, Shearin sent a letter Stevenson's attorney informing \nStevenson that she had failed to comply with the obligation to grant the easement and \n\"breached [her] obligation as c ooperative-member by deliberately conveying one of your lots \nto [Noce] after receiving a written request to  grant an easement.\"  The letter also warned \nStevenson that CHEMC could suspend her membership pursuant to section 2.01 of the By-\nlaws for failing to grant the easement. \n19. On May 15, 2013, Shearin sent Stevenson's attorney a letter notifying \nStevenson that the CHEMC Board would vote on her suspension from membership on May \n16, 2013, and that she should expect her electricity to be cut off by CHEMC by Memorial Day \nweekend.  The letter stated \"[w]e encourage you and your client to communicate with us as \nsoon as possible about the powerline easement sought from her.\" \n20. When Stevenson received the May 15 letter threatening to cut off her \nelectricity, she realized she realized the issue was \"on fire,\" and she immediately agreed to \nprovide access to Lot 10 \"out of duress.\"\n8  On May 17, 2013, the Dare County Clerk of Superior \nCourt issued a Consent Order agreed to between CHEMC and Stevenson (\"Consent Order\").  \n                                                 \n8 Stevenson Dep. 47. \n \nIn pertinent part, the Consent Order provided  that: (1) CHEMC had the right to condemn \nthe property; (2) any objections to the condem nation by Stevenson were resolved; (3) three \ncommissioners were appointed to appraise th e value of the easement; (4) CHEMC had the \nright to enter Lot 10 and begin use of the ea sement pending the determination of \"just \ncompensation;\" and (5) the only remaining issue to be determined in the condemnation action \nis the amount of just compensation to be paid to Stevenson for the easement. \n21. There has been no determination reache d regarding the compensation to be \npaid to Stevenson for the easement on Lot 10, and Stevenson has not conveyed an easement \nto CHEMC. \n22. On May 20, 2013, Shearin sent a letter to Stevenson along with an appraisal \nreport for Lot 10.  The letter contained an o ffer from CHEMC to pay Stevenson $18,500 for \nan easement on Lot 10.  Shearin sent Noce an appraisal on Lot 9 and offer from CHEMC of \n$5,425 in exchange for an easement on Lot 9.  On May 28, 2013, CHEMC withdrew the offers \nof compensation to Stevenson and Noce and has not made any subsequent offers. \nDISCUSSION \n23. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment seeks, as against Stevenson, \"a \ndeclaration of the rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to\" sections 1.08 and 2.10 of \nthe CHEMC By-laws under G.S. §1-254. Stevenson also has moved for summary judgment \non Plaintiff's claims for declaratory judgment  regarding the interpretation of CHEMC's By-\nlaws.  Accordingly, the Court will address Plai ntiff's and Stevenson's motions regarding the \ndeclaratory judgments together. Noce moves for summary judgment on the intentional \ninterference with contract and civil conspiracy  claims alleged against him.  Stevenson also \n \nhas moved for summary judgment on the claim for civil conspiracy. The Court will address \nthe civil conspiracy claims against Noce and Stevenson together.9 \nA.  Declaratory Judgment Claims \n24. As noted above, in its first and seco nd claims, CHEMC seeks a declaration \nregarding the \"rights and obligation of the parties\" pursuant to sections 1.08 and 2.01 of the \nCHEMC By-laws.  Under North Carolina law, a declaratory judgment is a statutory remedy \nthat grants a court the authority to “declare ri ghts, status, and other legal relations” when \nan “actual controversy” exists between parties to a lawsuit. G.S. § 1-253; \nPine Knoll Shores \nv. Carolina Water Serv., Inc. , 128 N.C. App. 321, 321 (1998). Summary judgment may be \ngranted on a claim for declaratory judgment if there remain no issues of material fact and \neither party is entitled to relief as a matter of law. Smith v. Marez, 217 N.C. App. 267, 270 \n(2011) (internal citation omitted).  Here, there exists an actual controversy between CHEMC \nand Stevenson regarding their re spective rights under the By-l aws, and the facts necessary \nto a determination of those rights are not in dispute. \n25. The parties dispute whether the By-l aws constitute a contract between \nCHEMC and Stevenson.  North Carolina, unlike some other jurisdictions, has not addressed \nthe specific issue of whether an electrical memb ership corporation’s By-laws create contract \nrights between the corporation and its members. See e.g. Granbois v. Big Horn Elec. Coop. , \n986 P.2d 1097, 1011 (Mont. 1999); First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. E.End Mut. Elec. Co., 735 \nP.2d 1073, 1075-77 (Idaho Ct. App. 1987).  North Carolina has recognized, however, that By-\nlaws can, in some circumstances, constitute a binding contract if the parties agree to be bound \nby them. Virmani v. Presbyterian Health Services Corp. , 127 N.C. App. 71, 76-77 (1997) \n(Physician contractually bound by the defend ant’s By-laws when agreement granting him \n                                                 \n9 Plaintiff has conceded that it has no cognizab le claim for interference  with contract against \nStevenson. \n \nprivileges at hospital was conditioned on his agreement to be bound); Roberts v. Madison \nCnty. Realtors Ass’n, Inc., 121 N.C. App. 233, 238 (1996) (Nonprofit corporation’s By-laws \nwere a contract between corporation and its me mbers).  The Court can see no reason that \nCHEMC’s By-laws would not be a contract be tween CHEMC and Stevenson.  Stevenson \nvoluntarily agreed to be bound by the By-laws in exchange for becoming a member of CHEMC \nwith its attendant benefits, including being provided with electrical power for her properties. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the By -laws at issue here constituted a contract \nbetween CHEMC and Stevenson. \n26. Under North Carolina law, electric me mbership corporations, such as \nCHEMC, have the corporate purpose of supplying electric service to their members, provided \nthat the members have complied with the ter ms and conditions in the By-laws of the \ncorporation. G.S. § 117-16. The By-laws of an electric membership corporation may contain \nany term or condition \"not inconsistent with la w or its certificate of incorporation.\" G.S. § \n117-14. Such terms and conditions provided in the corporation's By-laws, however, \"shall be \nreasonable.\" G.S. § 117-16. \"Whether a by-law  is reasonable is a question of law for the \nCourt.\" Duffy v. Ins. Co., 142 N.C. 103, 107 (1906). \n27. North Carolina also has granted ele ctric membership corporations the \nauthority to exercise the power of eminent domain consistent with the provisions of Chapter \n40A of the General Statutes. G.S. §117-18(6). When the power of eminent domain is exercised, \n\"a duty is imposed on [the] condemnor to pa y just compensation for the property taken.\" \nVirginia Elec. & Power Co. v. King, 259 N.C. 219, 220 (1963). This duty is enumerated in the \nFifth Amendment to the United  States Constitution, and, although North Carolina has no \nexpress constitutional provision requiring paymen t, it is regarded as an integral part of the \n\"law of the land\" within the meaning of N.C. Const. art. I, § [19]. Eller v. Bd. of Educ. , 242 \nN.C. 584, 586 (1955).  \n \n28. With these principles in mind, the Court turns to section 1.08 of CHEMC's By-\nlaws. Section 1.08 provides that a member of  CHEMC \"shall, upon being requested to do \nso . . . execute and deliver to [CHEMC] grants of easement or right-of-way over, on and under \nsuch lands owned . . . , and in accordance wi th such reasonable terms and conditions, as \n[CHEMC] shall require.\" Stevenson contends that  this provision is unreasonable because it \narguably entitles Plaintiff to require a member to convey an easement or property interest \non whatever terms Plaintiff specifies, includin g doing so without compensation in violation \nof the United States and North Carolina constitutions.10 The Court disagrees. \n29. Significantly, CHEMC does not contend that  section 1.08 provides it with an \nabsolute right to require members to grant requested easements without compensation. \nInstead, CHEMC concedes that “the issue of co mpensation goes to reasonableness” of the \nterms and conditions under which it acquires the easement.  Susan Flythe, Executive Vice \nPresident and General Manager of CHEMC, testified that CHEMC recognizes that \ncompensation will be required in some cases.11 According to CHEMC, whether compensation \nis offered under section 1.08 depends on the \"amount of damage to [the member's] property\" \nthat would be caused by the proposed easement.12   \n30. Section 1.08 does not state, by its ex press terms, that CHEMC can require \nmembers to provide any easement demanded  by CHEMC without compensation, and the \nCourt does not believe the language of the by-law supports such an interpretation.13 Instead, \nthe clause \"in accordance with such reasonable terms and conditions\" supports the conclusion \nthat there could be circumstances in which payment for an interest in land is necessary, but \n                                                 \n10 See Stevenson Memo. Opp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 6-7. \n11 Flythe Dep. 78-80. \n12 Id. 78. \n13 In Smith v. Pickwick Elec. Coop ., 367 S.W.2d 775, 779 (Tenn. 1963), the primary authority relied \nupon by Plaintiff, the by-law at issue expressly  provided that the defendant’s members were required \nto provide requested easements “without charges to the cooperative.\" \n \nalso allows CHEMC to address situations where the impact of a proposed easement would be \nde minimis or would provide other benefits to the property owner and, therefore, not warrant \ncompensation.14 Moreover, because the provision requires terms and conditions of the \ntransfer to be \"reasonable,\" members are afford ed some ability of to negotiate those terms \nwith CHEMC. The provision simply does not require a member to grant an easement on any \nterms presented by CHEMC. Instead, section 1.08 provides a mechanism for CHEMC to \nengage its members as to the terms of the easement required, including the scope of the \neasement and whether compensation will be paid.  Nothing in the express language of section \n1.08 of the By-laws renders it unreasonable or invalid on its face. \n31. Stevenson argues, however, that because CHEMC has been granted the power \nof eminent domain, section 1.08 is unnecessary because, if compensation is to be paid for the \neasement, \"the appropriate methodology . . . would be through eminent domain.\"\n15 However, \nsimply because CHEMC has the power of eminent domain does not render the by-law \nunnecessary or unreasonable. Instead, section 1.08 provides an alternate path to obtaining \nan easement from CHEMC members. Assuming CHEMC and a member can come to an \nagreement as to the reasonable terms of the easement, there is no reason for CHEMC to \ncondemn the property through a potentially expensive and time-consuming eminent domain \nproceeding.  Alternatively, if CHEMC and a member cannot come to an agreement and \nCHEMC still needs the easement, CHEMC can invoke its power of eminent domain and \ncondemn the property. This procedure ultimately will allow CHEMC to obtain the easement, \nbut also provides the member statutory pr otection and an established procedure for \ndetermining the ultimate reasonableness of the easement's terms, including compensation.  \n                                                 \n14 See Flythe Dep. 78-80. \n15 Stevenson Memo. Opp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 7. \n \n32.  CHEMC also seeks a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties \npursuant to section 2.01 of the By-laws. Section 2.01 provides that, in the event of, inter alia, \na member's \"failure to cease noncompliance with his membership obligations\" following \nproper notice, CHEMC will automatically su spend the member's membership and the \nmember will not be entitled to receive power from CHEMC during the suspension.  \n33. On its face, section 2.01, like section 1.08, appears to be a reasonable by-law.\n16 \nThis provision allows CHEMC to enforce its By-laws, including the obligation of members to \npay amounts due to CHEMC. Additionally, the notice requirement in section 2.01 provides \nprotection against a member losing electric power without warning or an opportunity to cure \nthe breach at issue. \n34. As applied in this case to enforce or  compel compliance with section 1.08, \nhowever, the Court reaches a different conclusi on regarding section 2.01. Using, or even \nthreatening to use, section 2.01 to compel a member to provide CHEMC an easement severely \nrestricts the ability of the member to negotiat e as to the terms and scope of the easement. \nTaking these two provisions together, CHEMC has the ability to request an easement from \na member and then effectively compel the member to grant the easement on CHEMC’s terms \nunder threat of expulsion and termination of the member’s electric power. Once faced with \nthe threat of losing electricity, the member undoubtedly will capitulate to whatever CHEMC \ndemands regarding the easement. In fact, that is exactly what happened in this case; CHEMC \nwas unhappy with Stevenson’s response to its re quest for an easement, so it threatened to \nturn off her power on the eve of Memorial Day weekend.  Not surprisingly, Stevenson \nimmediately agreed to a Consent Order gran ting CHEMC the rights it sought.  While \n                                                 \n16 Stevenson does not appear to argue that section 2.01 is unreasonable on its face. Stevenson only \ncontends that, as applied to the facts at bar, the \"dispositive issue regarding [s]ection 2.01 of [t]he \nBylaws is not whether the policy is reasonable, but whether its implementation was reasonable under \nthe facts and circumstances.\" Stevenson Memo. Opp. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 8. \n \nrequiring a member to provide CHEMC an interest  in property on terms that are subject to \nnegotiation is not unreasonable, the ability of CHEMC to threaten to terminate that \nmember's electricity in the event the parties do not agree on the terms of the easement is \nunreasonable. \n35. To be sure, CHEMC is not left powerless if a member refuses to provide an \neasement, or if negotiations over the ter ms of an easement break down. As noted above, \nCHEMC has the power of eminent domain. Accordingly, if CHEMC and a member cannot \nagree on an easement transfer pursuant to section 1.08, CHEMC can ultimately obtain the \neasement through that statutory process. This process guarantees CHEMC the ability to \nobtain any easement needed to continue to provide electric power to its members. \n36. Plaintiff relies on \nKing v. Farmers Electric Cooperative, Inc. , 246 P.2d 1041 \n(N.M. 1952) in support of its argument that section 2.01 is reasonable when used to terminate \na member’s electricity because of their refu sal to grant an easement requested by the \ncooperative.17 Given the facts in this case, however, the finds King distinguishable and, \ntherefore, not persuasive. In King, the by-law at issue both required the member to provide \na requested easement and explic itly provided for expulsion and termination of electrical \nservice if a member refused to provide the easement. Id. at 1044. In addition, the by-law in \nKing did not require that the easement be prov ided on “reasonable terms and conditions”.  \nFinally, the court’s opinion in King makes no mention of the defendant cooperative having \neminent domain authority to obtain easements.   \n37. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, as applied to enforce compliance with \nsection 1.08, section 2.01 is an unreasonable,  and therefore unenforceable, by-law. Nothing \nin this Opinion and Order, however, shall be construed to limit the ability of CHEMC to use \n                                                 \n17 Pl.’s Memo. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 9-10. \n \nsection 2.01 to enforce any other by-law or the requirement that members pay for electric \nservice.  \nB. Tortious Interference with Contract. \n38. Plaintiff alleges that Noce interfered with its contract with Stevenson by \nencouraging her not to grant the easements requested by Plaintiff and by participating in the \nconveyance of Lot 9 from Stevenson to Noce.  Pl aintiff alleges and argues that Noce knew of \nStevenson's obligation under th e CHEMC By-laws to grant th e easement, knew that the \neasement was critical to CHEMC's ability to transmit electricity, and intentionally attempted \nto delay the process and increase Stevenson's bar gaining power by his conduct.  Plaintiff's \nonly support for this claim, admittedly, is speculation regarding Noce's and Stevenson's \nmotivations derived from the timing of the conveyance of the property.18 \n39. Noce and Stevenson, on the other hand, testified without contradiction that a \ndesire to breach the By-laws or interfere with  Plaintiff's attempts to secure the easements \ndid not play any part in Stevenson's decision to convey Lot 9 to Noce.19  Stevenson and Noce \nhad discussed the potential transfer of Lot 9 to Noce long before CHEMC sought the \neasement.20  Stevenson transferred Lot 9 to Noce as  repayment of a debt she believed she \nowed Noce for expenses he paid on their behalves. 21  Noce testified that he and Stevenson \nnever discussed the CHEMC By-laws prior to the conveyance of Lot 9. 22  These facts are \nundisputed in this record. \n40. The tort of interference with contract has  five elements: (1) a valid contract \nbetween the plaintiff and a third person which confers upon the plaintiff a contractual right \n                                                 \n18 Flythe Dep. 13-14. \n19 Noce Dep. 18-19, 20, 21-22, 24, 26; Stevenson Dep. 37-43. \n20 Stevenson Dep. 37-38; Noce Dep. 18-19. \n21 Stevenson Dep. 39-43; Noce Dep. 18-19, 21-22. \n22 Noce Dep. 24. \n \nagainst a third person; (2) the defendant knows of the contract; (3) the defendant \nintentionally induces the third person not to pe rform the contract; (4) and in doing so acts \nwithout justification; (5) resulting in actual damage to plaintiff. United Labs., Inc. v. \nKuykendall, 322 N.C. 643, 661, (1988) (citing Childress v. Abeles, 240 N.C. 67, 84 S.E. 2d 176 \n(1954)).  \n41. Even assuming that Plaintiff has shown the first, second and fifth elements, \nthe undisputed facts establish that Noce did not intentionally induce Stevenson not to comply \nwith the By-laws and that he acted with just ification in accepting the conveyance of Lot 9 \nfrom Stevenson.  Accordingly, Noce's motion for summary judgment on the claim for tortious \ninterference with contract should be GRANTED. \nC. Civil Conspiracy. \n42. In its Fourth Claim for Relief, Plaint iff alleges that Stevenson and Noce \nconspired to \"breach the contractual obligations  of Stevenson under Section 1.08 of the By-\nlaws.\"\n23  Plaintiff additionally alleges that \"in furtherance of the said conspiracy, on or about \nMarch 26, 2013, Stevenson executed a deed to Noce\" for Lot 9. 24 In other words, Plaintiff \nalleges that Stevenson and Noce unlawfully conspired to convey Lot 9. \n43. In North Carolina, the elements of civil conspiracy are: (1) an agreement \nbetween two or more individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act in an unlawful \nway; (3) resulting in injury to the plaintiff; (4) pursuant to a common scheme. Privett v. Univ. \nof N. Carolina, 96 N.C. App. 124, 139 (1989). To establish a claim, the plaintiff must show an \n\"overt act\" committed by at least one conspi rator in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Dove v. \nHarvey, 168 N.C. App. 687, 690 (2006).  \n                                                 \n23 Amend. Compl. ¶ 42. \n24 Id. ¶ 44. \n \n44. Plaintiff's claim for civil conspiracy ag ainst Stevenson and Noce also fails. To \nbegin, there is no allegation or any evidence in the record to suggest that Stevenson or Noce \ncommitted any unlawful act. Instead, Plainti ff's claim rests on the contention that the \ntransfer of Lot 9, a lawful act which Stevenson had an absolute right to do, was done in an \nunlawful manner. See Snyder v. Duke Power Co. , 15 N.C. App. 211 (1972) (declining to \nimpose tortious liability for undertaking an act Defendant had an absolute right to \nundertake). Even setting aside Stevenson's absolu te right to dispose of  her property as she \nsees fit, there is no evidence in the record  to support the existence of a \"common scheme\" \nbetween Stevenson and Noce to breach Steven son's obligations under section 1.08. Rather, \nStevenson and Noce both testified, as describe d above, that a desire to avoid the obligations \nunder section 1.08 played no role in the conveyance of Lot 9 and that the conveyance of Lot 9 \nhad been the subject of numerous discussions prior to Plaintiff's attempt to obtain an \neasement.  As noted above, this testimony is not contradicted in the record. Plaintiff has only \npresented testimony consisting of speculation as to the purpose of the transfer.  Such \nspeculation, in the face of otherwise uncon troverted testimony, does not create a genuine \nissue of material fact. See Ramey Kemp & Assocs. v. Richmond Hills Residential Partners, \nLLC, __ N.C. App. __, __, 737 S.E.2d 420, 425 (2013) (requiring party opposing summary \njudgment to present \"admissible evidence, as compared to mere speculation or conclusory \nallegations, demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact\" once movant \nprovided evidence tending to show a lack of genuine issue of material fact). Accordingly, \nStevenson's and Noce's Motions for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED as to Claim \nFour. \n  \n \nCONCLUSION \nNOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n45. As to Claims Three and Four, Defend ant Gina L. Stevenson's Motion for \nSummary Judgment is GRANTED.  \n46. Defendant Joseph F. Noce's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. \n47. As to Claims One and Two, the Cou rt enters the following DECLARATORY \nJUDGMENT pursuant to G.S. § 1-254 regarding the rights, status, and other legal relations \nof the parties to this action pursuant to sections 1.08 and 2.01 of the CHEMC By-laws: \na. Section 1.08 of the CHEMC By-laws creates a binding contractual \nobligation for members of CHEMC to grant to CHEMC easements or rights-of-way \n(hereinafter collectively referred to as “easements”) over, on, and under such lands owned or \nleased by or mortgaged to the member for the furnishing of electric service to the member or \nother members or for the construction, operation, maintenance or relocation of CHEMC’s \nelectric facilities.  This right, however, is qua lified by the requirement that the grant of the \neasement be on \"reasonable terms and conditions,\" which may include, based on the \ncircumstances, payment of compensation in exchange for the easement. Section 1.08 does not \ngrant CHEMC an absolute right to require me mbers to grant any easement required by \nCHEMC on terms unilaterally established by  CHEMC, but rather requires CHEMC to \nnegotiate in good faith with the member from whom it is seeking the easement of right-of-\nway. On its face, section 1.08 is a reasonable By-law. \nb. Section 2.01 of the CHEMC By-laws is reasonable on its face.  It is \nunreasonable, however, as applied to a member as means to enforce the member’s obligation \nto grant an easement under Section 1.08 becaus e it is impermissibly coercive and deprives \nthe member of the opportunity to negoti ate the terms of the easement, including \ncompensation.  Accordingly, section 2.01 cannot be used by CHEMC as a means of requiring \n \na member to grant an easement on terms that  have not been agreed to by the member.  \nCHEMC retains the right and authority to obtain required easements by eminent domain. \nThis the 9th day of April, 2015.
