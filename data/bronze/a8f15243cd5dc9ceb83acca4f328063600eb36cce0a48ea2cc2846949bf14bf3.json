Bell, III (“R. Bell”), Virginia Bell (“V. \nBell”), Nissan Joseph (“Joseph”), and Hickory Brands, Inc. (“HBI”) filed their \nMotion to Dismiss and Answer. \n {3}  Plaintiffs filed a document request on March 29, 2011 to which \nDefendants had not responded when Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel on \nNovember 7, 2011, which led to the November 28, 2011 entry by the presiding \nCatawba County Superior Court Judge of a stipulation requiring Defendants to \nproduce certain documents on or before January 3, 2012.  Defendants have \nproduced two hard drives pursuant to that stipulation, which production leads to \nthe present Motion. \n {4}  On March 9, 2012, Defendants filed their Motion for Leave to Amend  \nAnswer and Assert Counterclaims (“Motion to Amend”) and their Motion to Appoint  \nReceiver.  Based on issues raised in the March 9, 2012 filings, Plaintiffs sought \ndesignation of the action as a mandatory complex business case pursuant to N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 7A-45.4 and Business Court Rule 3.1(b).  The matter was designated by \nChief Justice Sarah Parker subject to the amendment.  Chief Business Court Judge \nJohn R. Jolly, Jr. granted the Motion to Amend on April 23, 2012 and assigned the \ncase to the undersigned.  Defendants filed the present Motion on April 24, 2012.     \n {5}  The Motion has been fully briefed, the court heard oral arguments, and \nthe matter is ripe for disposition.   \n \nII.  FACTS \n {6}  The court makes the following findings solely to resolve the present \nMotion and reserves reconsideration of those same facts as may be necessary or \nappropriate later to resolve the merits of the various claims in subsequent \nproceedings. \n {7}  Drymax is a North Carolina limited liability company with a principal \nplace of business in Catawba County, North Carolina.  Drymax designs and sells an \nextensive line of athletic, casual, and business socks and insoles. \n {8}  Blythe is a citizen and resident of the State of California who has been a \nDrymax member since its creation on November 6, 2003.  Blythe is Drymax’s \nPresident and sole duly elected Managing Member. \n {9}  HBI is a North Carolina corporation with a principal place of business in \nCatawba County, North Carolina.  HBI is a manufacturer, wholesaler, and supplier \nof foot care and footwear accessories, including laces, insoles, cording, and lanyards.  \nHBI has a number of affiliate and subsidiary companies which produce, market, \nand supply similar foot care and footwear accessories.   \n {10}  R. Bell is a citizen and resident of the State of North Carolina, a Drymax \nmember, an HBI controlling owner and officer, and a controlling owner and officer \nof Strabell, LLC, a Drymax affiliate.  \n{11}  V. Bell is a citizen and resident of the State of South Carolina, an HBI \nowner and officer, and a Strabell, LLC officer. \n{12}  Joseph is a citizen and resident of the State of North Carolina, and was \na Drymax member until January 2008, and HBI’s President and Chief Executive \nOfficer from May 2003 until January 2008.  \n{13}  Plaintiffs served Defendants with their First Requests for Production of \nDocuments (“Document Requests”) on March 29, 2011,\n1 and filed a motion to compel \nin Catawba County Superior Court on November 7, 2011. 2  On November 28, 2011, \nthe court entered a Stipulation and Order (“Stipulation”) requiring Defendants on \nor before January 3, 2012 to produce “[e]mail between and among HBI’s officers and \n                                                 \n1 Defendants assert that they “have responded to 212 document requests, have produced \napproximately 2,000 pages of documents directly responsive to those requests, have produced over \n10,000 pages of e-mails with attachments, and have given Plaintiffs access to their stored documents \nconsisting of approximately 300 boxes of documents.”  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiffs do not now \ncomplain that Defendants have produced too little.  To the contrary, while they contend that \nDefendants made no production until several months after they were required to because of \nPlaintiffs’ motion to compel, Plaintiffs accuse Defendants of a “document dump,” combining \nirrelevant documents along with those requested. \n \n2 Plaintiffs assert that the November 7, 2011 motion to compel followed Defendants’ admitted failure \nto conduct a comprehensive search of HBI’s e-mail database and what Plaintiffs characterize as \nDefendants’ persistent failure during the preceding seven (7) month period to respond adequately to \ndiscovery requests.  (Pls.’ Resp. Opposing Defs.’ Mot. for Order Compelling Return of Privileged \nDocuments (“Pls.’ Resp. Br.”) 2.) \nemployees, Drymax product sales representatives, Drymax product manufacturers, \nretailers and others that are responsive to document requests.”  (Defs.’ Mot. for \nOrder Compelling Return of Privileged Docs. (“Defs.’ Mot.”) Ex. A.)  There was at \nthat time no case scheduling order and no protective order or other agreement \nproviding for procedures to be followed in the event of an inadvertent production of \nprivileged information. \n {14}  HBI contracted with Computer Ants, based in Hickory, North Carolina, \nowned and operated by Thomas D. Scott (“Scott”), to obtain, process, and search \nHBI’s e-mails for responsive documents.  Computer Ants was to locate PST files and \nconvert them into readable PDF format.  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 7.)   \n{15}  Plaintiffs, in part, question whether Computer Ants was sufficiently \nqualified as an expert in electronic discovery to reasonably justify Defendants’ \nreliance on it to protect against the production of privileged information.  Scott \ntestified that prior to being engaged by HBI, he had never provided any forensic \ncomputer services in the context of a lawsuit (Dep. of Thomas D. Scott (“Scott Dep.”) \n13:24−14:3), had never been engaged as a computer expert or provided an opinion in \nany legal proceeding (Scott Dep. 67:10−12; 68:17−21), and had litigation-related \nexperience limited to domestic cases where he had been asked to examine computer \nand phone records to support domestic claims.  (Scott Dep. 68:6−9.)  Scott had \nvaried employment experience outside the computer field prior to establishing \nComputer Ants, including work as a truck driver, a Bass Pro Shop Security \nManager, a respiratory therapist, and a financial auditor for a retail seller.  (Scott \nDep. 14:23−15:18.) \n {16}  By letter dated November 17, 2011, Plaintiffs’ counsel provided Defense \ncounsel with a list of more than thirty-five potential search terms to be used in \nsearching Defendants’ computer files.  Plaintiffs’ letter also stated that “providing \nthis list of search terms is in no way intended to transfer the defendants’ discovery \nobligation to the plaintiffs.  This list may be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive \nin that it may yield non-responsive documents and may not yield otherwise \nresponsive documents.”  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 3.)  The record suggests that Defendants \ndirected Computer Ants to use Plaintiffs’ search terms without modification.  \n {17}  Computer Ants obtained copies of HBI e-mail files stored on thirty-five  \ncomputers, six servers, and three hard drives, yielding approximately 286 gigabytes \nof information which consisted of 547 PST files and contained 307,816,673 \nindividual files of e-mails and attachments.  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 7.)       \n{18}  After acquiring the data, Scott prepared a document set using the \nsearch terms provided by Plaintiffs.  The record indicates that Defendants did not \nreview this document set for responsiveness, duplication, or privilege except for a \nlimited effort to segregate communications with Defense counsel.  Scott was \ninstructed by Defense counsel to segregate all e-mails containing the extension \n“hickorylaw.com.”  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 8.)  The intent was to filter out any \ncommunications between HBI and members of the law firm of Young, Morphis, \nBach & Taylor, LLP (“YMBT”) in which defense litigation counsel Paul E. \nCulpepper (“Culpepper”) and Kevin C. McIntosh practice.  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 8.) \n {19}  On January 3, 2012, Defendants produced a computer hard drive to \nPlaintiffs.  Defendants did not index or keep a copy of the hard drive.  Their \nindication in briefing and oral argument on the Motion of what was produced on \nJanuary 3, 2012 is based on a later reconstruction of the document set gathered by \nComputer Ants.  Defendants believe this initial hard drive contained more than 3.8 \nmillion documents and contained at least two libraries, one of which was the \ndocument set intended to segregate communications with YMBT.  While the record \nremains somewhat unclear as to what the hard drive actually contained, Plaintiffs’ \npresentation in connection with the Motion suggests that all communications from \nDefense counsel were, in fact, not altogether segregated into a separate distinct \nlibrary by whatever procedure Computer Ants followed. \n{20}  Culpepper wrote a letter accompanying the January 3, 2012 production, \nwhich indicated his understanding that Computer Ants excluded “emails to or from \nthe hickorylaw.com  address[.]”  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. B at 3 (emphasis in original).)  \nDefendants contend that this letter then put Plaintiffs on notice that Defendants \ndid not intend to produce attorney-client communications, and that any such \nproduction was inadvertent.  The same letter also admits that the contents of the \nhard drive were not reviewed prior to its production.  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. B at 3.)  \n {21}  Plaintiffs characterize the January 3, 2012 production as follows: \n[t]he attachments were separated from their parent emails with no \nway to connect other than to search for matching date and time \nstamps.  The emails and attachments were also produced in a manner \nthat did not provide any indication of the sender or receiver of the \nemails, or what portions of the production were responsive to which \nrequests.  In short, without a review of each email individually, it was \nnot possible for Plaintiffs to glean any information from the \nproduction.   \n \n(Pls.’ Resp. Br. 4.)  Plaintiffs further indicate that the production was of limited use \nbecause, “Plaintiffs were able to search for words only if they appeared in the name \nof the file.  The contents of the files were searchable only upon opening a file and \nrunning all search terms individually within the one file.  This would have to be \nrepeated for every file.”  (Aff. of Benjamin P. Fryer ¶¶ 5−9.)  \n{22}  Plaintiffs demanded a further production, in part because Computer \nAnts had apparently failed to obtain e-mails from one HBI computer. \n {23}  Defendants on March 1, 2012 produced a second hard drive.  As before, \nthe hard drive was not indexed, no copy was retained by Defense counsel, and the \nhard drive was provided without any prior review by Defense counsel. The March 1, \n2012 production apparently contained the same documents as the January 3, 2012 \nhard drive, plus new documents generated by using two additional search terms \nand searching the additional laptop. \n{24}  Plaintiffs first attempted to load the March 1, 2012 hard drive for \nindexing using a Microsoft X1 program.  When this effort failed, Plaintiffs then \nseparated the production into nineteen parts to be run on five separate computers.  \nPlaintiffs indicate the process took four days, and that in the process, various copies \nof the original document production were made and may now reside on multiple \ncomputers, making it impossible as a practical matter for Plaintiffs to “return” the \nentire initial production as the Motion requests. \n {25}  On March 5, 2012, Plaintiffs served Defendants with a Rule 30(b)(6) \ndeposition notice, which included as one topic Defendants’ efforts to respond to \ndiscovery requests.  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. C. at 4.)  While Defendants complain that \nPlaintiffs’ counsel learned of the possible inadvertent production of privileged \ninformation before the deposition was held and did not advise Defendants of this \nbefore the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition was taken, the record does not establish that \nPlaintiffs had any such suspicion when preparing the Rule 30(b)(6) notice of \ndeposition. \n {26}  The law firm of Ellis & Winters, LLP was associated in or around early \nMarch 2012 to share representation with YMBT and represented HBI at the Rule \n30(b)(6) deposition. \n   {27}  Plaintiff’s indexing efforts progressed such that Plaintiffs were able to \nbegin their review of the production documents on March 14, 2012.  During their \ninitial review, Plaintiffs noted that the production included a large number of e-\nmails which had the caption of the lawsuit in the subject line.  Plaintiffs indicate \nthat they would have been required to open each e-mail individually to ascertain \nthe sender or recipient of the e-mails, or to know the contents of any e-mail.  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel did not at that time undertake to advise Defense counsel of any \nissue as to the potential production of privileged communications.  Plaintiffs also \nelected not review those documents.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 5−6.)   \n {28}  Plaintiffs proceeded with HBI’s 30(b)(6) deposition on March 16, 2012.  \nDefense counsel were apparently not aware at this time of what had been produced \non the January and March 2012 hard drives or that they may have included \nprivileged communications.  Plaintiffs’ counsel conducted questioning on the noticed \ntopic of the company’s efforts to respond to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests.  HBI’s \nPresident Joshua D. Higgins (“Higgins”) testified as follows: \nMr. Nebrig: Is the company aware of anyone reviewing the \nmaterial that was placed on that hard drive before \nit was produced to Plaintiffs’ counsel? \n \nMr. Higgins:  No. \nMr. Nebrig: Did the company instruct anyone to review what \nwas on that hard drive before it was produced to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel? \n \nMr. Higgins:  No. \n. . . . \n \nMr. Nebrig: So as far as the company is concerned, it would \nmake sense not to review that information for \nrelevancy; is that right? \n \nMr. Meyers:  Objection to form.  \n \nMr. Higgins: It would not make sense for the company to spend \ntime going through the e-mails or any information \nthat you’ve asked for.  I mean, we’ve been -- it’s \nmore of an open book.  I mean, you asked for \nsomething, and we’re giving you the information \nyou asked for. \n. . . . \n \nMr. Nebrig: The company made the decision not to review that \nmaterial on the hard drive that was produced to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel for privileged information; is that \nyour testimony? \n \nMr. Meyers:  Objection to form.  \n \nMr. Higgins: It was the company’s decision not to review it \nperiod.  \n \n(Dep. of Joshua D. Higgins (“Higgins Dep.”) 56:5−12; 58:8−17; 59:14−20.) \n {29}  At the conclusion of the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, Plaintiffs’ counsel \ninformed Defense counsel that there were questions whether Defendants had \nproduced attorney-client communications on the hard drives.  The exact details of \nthe conversation are unclear.  During the conversation, Plaintiffs also complained \nabout the breadth and content of the production.    \n{30}  The Parties disagree as to what request, if any, Defense counsel made \nduring this conference regarding Plaintiffs’ continued review of the production.  \nDefense counsel contends that Plaintiffs’ counsel was requested to cease reviewing \nthe documents while the matter was investigated further.  Plaintiffs’ counsel \ncontend that Defense counsel only committed to “look into” the issues with the \nproduction and made no specific request of Plaintiffs’ counsel.  \n{31}  It is clear that Defendants did not at that time identify specific \nprivileged communications and did not itemize specific documents for return or \nsegregation.  It rather appears that Defendants would not at that time have been \nable to identify specific documents that had been produced for which any privilege \nshould be claimed.   \n {32}  Counsel discussed production issues in a telephone call on March 19, \n2012.  Both Parties admit the telephone call occurred, but they differ in their \nrecollections of the conversation.   \n {33}  Defense counsel contend that they explained that the document \nproduction “appeared to have included an inadvertent disclosure of privileged \ncommunications” and that Defendants were undertaking efforts “to correct all of the \nissues with the production at Defendants’ expense.”  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 22.)  Defendants \ncontend they requested in this conversation that Plaintiffs cease any review of the \nproduction pending those efforts.   \n {34}  Plaintiffs’ counsel recall that during the call, Defense counsel admitted \nthat the March 1, 2012 production was an unacceptable discovery response, and \nthat Defendants would then make a proper production.  However, Plaintiffs contend \nthat Defense counsel did not identify specific potentially privileged communications \nand did not request the return of the entire production.  Plaintiffs’ counsel deny that \nthey agreed to cease reviewing the production; they contend to the contrary that \nthey explicitly reserved the right to assert waiver and to move for sanctions.  (Pls.’ \nResp. Br. 8.)   \n {35}  Defense counsel as promised promptly undertook efforts to prepare a \nsubsequent proper production.  Several weeks later, Defendants made a production \nwhich they contend properly removed duplicate documents, made e-mails \nsearchable along with their associated attachments, and limited the production to \nresponsive material.  Defendants later also produced a specific privilege log for the \ndocuments withheld from the revised production and which they contend would \ninclude the privileged communications inadvertently produced in the prior \nproductions. \n{36}  After these communications, Plaintiffs continued to review the initial \nproduction but implemented procedures intended to segregate the potentially \nprivileged communications to prevent any review of them until the privilege issue \nwas resolved.  Plaintiffs’ counsel represented at oral argument on the Motion that \nPlaintiffs had not as of that time opened or reviewed any attorney-client \ncommunications produced by Defendants.   \n {37}  Defense counsel updated Plaintiffs’ counsel as Defendants continued \ntheir efforts to make the subsequent production, including writing letters dated \nMarch 30, 2012 and April 4, 2012.  The April 4, 2012 letter acknowledged problems \nwith the prior production and characterized the prior effort by Computer Ants as \n“not very sophisticated” and having included no efforts to remove duplicates or limit \nproduction to only the designated search terms.  In contrast, Defendants indicated \nthat their revised approach “resulted in 1,410,838 total records, comprised of \n1,145,147 e-mails and 342,516 e-mail attachments.  The processing identified and \nremoved nearly 2.3 million duplicate records.”  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. D at 2.)  Defendants \ncommitted to review the revised production for privilege and to produce non-\nprivileged documents in a searchable PDF format.  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. D at 3.) \n{38}  The April 4, 2012 letter did not include a request that Plaintiffs return \nthe original production or confirm any earlier request.     \n {39}  Plaintiffs wrote Defendants on April 17, 2012, detailing continued \ndiscontent with the production and explaining that they “intended to continue [the \nreview] process[ ].”  The letter expressed the position that, “Defendants irrevocably \nwaived any privilege that may have applied to [the produced documents] when they \nproduced them without so much as a cursory review,” and that, “[i]n light of \nDefendants’ voluntary disclosure as well as their subsequent failure to assert \nprivilege over any specific documents, [Plaintiffs] will treat all documents that \nDefendants have produced as non-privileged and conduct [their] document review \naccordingly.”  (Defs.’ Mot. Ex. E at 2.)   \n {40}  Defendants responded by letter dated April 19, 2012, expressing the \nview that Plaintiffs “handling of the allegedly inadvertently produced privileged \ndocuments was improper and again request[ing] that [Plaintiffs] cease their review \nimmediately and return the privileged documents immediately.”  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 29.)  \nPlaintiffs contend that the April 19, 2012 letter was Defendants’ first request for \nthe return of the production or of potentially privileged documents. \n{41}  Defendants advised Plaintiffs that Defendants would seek a court order \nrequiring a return of the original productions if Plaintiffs did not voluntarily agree \nto their return by April 20, 2012.  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 29.)  Defendants filed their Motion \non April 23, 2012.  \n {42}  The final revised production consisted of approximately 300,000 \ndocuments, in comparison to the 3.5 million documents on the January and March \n2012 hard drives.   \n {43}  Defendants’ privilege log lists 511 documents, many of which are \ncommunications with counsel after the lawsuit was begun and which would appear \nto be subject to an attorney-client privilege if such privilege has not been waived. \n {44}  Defendants’ Motion requests the return of the January 3, 2012 and \nMarch 1, 2012 hard drives and any copies made from them.  The Motion asserts \ninter alia  that: (1) Defendants employed reasonable measures to guard against the \npossible inadvertent disclosure of attorney-client privileged information; (2) upon \ndiscovering that privileged documents may have been inadvertently produced, \nPlaintiffs had an obligation under Rule 4.4 of the North Carolina Rules of \nProfessional Conduct (“N.C. RPC”) to promptly notify Defendants (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 20); \n(3) upon being informed by Defendants that the production of privileged information \nwas inadvertent, Plaintiffs had an obligation under Rule 26(b)(7) to return, \nsequester, or destroy the inadvertently produced privileged documents (Defs.’ Mot. \n¶ 21); and (4) Plaintiffs’ unilateral decision to treat the production as an intentional \nwaiver rather than an inadvertent disclosure is reprehensible conduct that should \nnot be condoned or rewarded by the court.   \n {45}  Plaintiffs respond that any waiver should be considered intentional \nrather than inadvertent because Defendants had purposely made a “document \ndump,” and that it is the Defendants’ conduct that the court should not condone.  \nAlternatively, Plaintiffs contend that even if the production was inadvertent, any \nprivilege has been waived. \n \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Attorney-Client Privilege and Waiver \n {46}  Generally, discovery matters fall within the trial court’s discretion.  \nHudson v. Hudson , 34 N.C. App. 144, 145, 237 S.E.2d 479, 280, disc. review denied , \n293 N.C. 589, 238 S.E.2d 264 (1977).  The court approaches the exercise of \ndiscretion with caution when dealing with matters of privilege. \n{47}  A document may be protected from disclosure on the basis of attorney-\nclient privilege upon a showing that: (1) the attorney-client relationship existed at \nthe time the communication was made; (2) the communication was made in \nconfidence; (3) the communication related to a matter about which the attorney is \nbeing professionally consulted; (4) the communication was made in the course of \ngiving or seeking legal advice for a proper purpose although litigation need not be \ncontemplated; and (5) the client has not waived privilege.  State v. Murvin , 304 N.C. \n523, 531, 284 S.E.2d 289, 294 (1981).  Based on a review of the privilege log, without \nundertaking review of specific documents and making specific findings as to \nparticular documents, the court assumes that the Defendants’ production contained \nattorney-client privileged documents, so that the issue is one of waiver and not of \nwhether the communications were privileged in the first instance.   \n{48}  The attorney-client privilege can be waived by either intentional \ndisclosure, Industrotech Constructors, Inc. v. Duke Univ. , 67 N.C. App. 741, 743, \n314 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1984), or inadvertent disclosure.  See, e.g., Morris v. Scenera \nResearch, LLC , 2011 NCBC 33 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 26, 2011), http://www. \nncbusinesscourt. net/opinions/2011_NCBC_33.pdf.  In either case, a finding of \nwaiver depends on the particular circumstances surrounding the disclosure. \n {49}  The record, including Mr. Higgins’s testimony and the conscious choice \nto make the production without any advance review, might support a finding of an \nintentional waiver, although Defendants also contend that the effort to segregate \ncommunications with counsel, even if unsuccessful, demonstrate that any \nproduction of privileged communications was inadvertent.  The court need not \nresolve these contested positions because it believes there has been a privilege \nwaiver whether the production was intentional or inadvertent.  \n \nB.  Inadvertent Disclosure \n {50}  North Carolina case law addressing problems inherent in electronic \ndiscovery, including waiver arising from inadvertent disclosure of privileged \ninformation, is not yet well developed.  Federal opinions are more extensive. \n {51}  This court recently examined the issue of inadvertent disclosure in \nMorris v. Scenera Research, LLC.  There the court resolved the issues under federal \nlaw because they arose during the course of discovery while the case was pending in \nfederal court prior to remand and discovery was governed by a discovery plan \ndeveloped by federal discovery rules.  The court’s inquiry was aided by the fact that \nthe parties there had entered a “claw-back” agreement.  See Morris , 2011 NCBC 33 \nat ¶ 41.   \n{52}  In Morris , this court followed a five-factor balancing test followed within \nthe Fourth Circuit, which considers: (1) the reasonableness of the precautions taken \nto prevent inadvertent disclosure; (2) the number of inadvertent disclosures; (3) the \nextent of the disclosures; (4) any delay in measures taken to rectify the disclosures; \nand (5) the overriding interests of justice.  See Morris , 2011 NCBC 33 at ¶ 45 \n(citing Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, Inc. , 250 F.R.D. 251, 259 (D. Md. 2008)).  \n{53}  The court believes that this balancing test developed by the federal \ncourts provides an appropriate vehicle for the North Carolina state courts.  \nHowever, on this record, the court also finds that the balancing test is controlled by \nthe first factor, and that the absence of reasonable precautions undertaken before \nthe production of privileged communications prevents the court from using the \nother factors to protect against waiver.  \n \n1.  Nature of Precautions Employed to Prevent Inadvertent Disclosure \n {54}  One federal district court characterizes the need for advance efforts to \nprotect against waiver as “paramount.”  \nMartin v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , \nNo. 3:10-CV-0144, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36058 at *12 (S.D. W.Va. Apr. 1, 2011).  \nStated differently, to avoid finding a waiver, a court should be satisfied that \nreasonable efforts necessary to protect against potential inadvertent disclosure were \nundertaken.  Whether efforts were “reasonable” obviously depends on the particular \ncircumstances that may vary from case to case.  Another federal district court \nexpressed its view that generally the degree of those efforts should increase as the \npotential volume of documents to be produced increases.  New Bank of New \nEngland v. Marine Midland Realty Corp. , 138 F.R.D. 479, 483 (E.D. Va. 1991).  This \ncourt agrees.  Under this standard, the sheer volume of documents on the two hard \ndrives produced by Defendants would suggest the need for more than minimal \nefforts to be taken prior to production to protect against the production of privileged \ncommunications. \n {55}  The court acknowledges that the degree of efforts which could or should \nbe undertaken to review for privilege prior to a production may vary based either on \ntime exigencies or extraordinary expense.  Such issues can, for example, arise where \nexpedited discovery demands the quick production of a large volume of information.  \nAgreements such as “claw-back” and “quick peek” agreements often accompany \nsuch procedures.  Counsel suggests that the court should weigh the exigencies \nattendant to production required by the Stipulation immediately after the year-end \nholidays.  However, following that suggestion would require the court to ignore that \nthe Stipulation resolved a motion to compel that was filed because the document \nrequests had been outstanding and not responded to for several months.  By \ncomparison, the court notes a complete review of responsiveness, duplication and \nprivilege was much more quickly completed after the issues arose in March 2012. \n{56}  Counsel also suggests that the court should approach the waiver issue \nwith caution and recognizing that the general state court trial practice may not yet \nbe as experienced in the particular problems attendant to electronic discovery as to \njustify a strict application of the waiver principles now developed in the federal \ncourts.  The court has exercised that caution, but that caution does not lead to \nprotecting against a waiver on the facts of this case. \n {57}  The court also acknowledges that electronic discovery and the associated \nneed to review for privilege can include extraordinary expense, such that a litigant \nmay make a considered choice to relax efforts to avoid that expense.  While such \nchoices may be informed and reasonable ones, those choices must at the same time \nabsorb the risk of a privilege waiver.  Protections to guard against privilege cannot \nbe deferred by first addressing the risk of waiver only after a production has been \nmade.   \n{58}  Defendants’ efforts prior to production to guard against disclosure of \nprivileged communication were limited, and included: (1) hiring Computer Ants as \nan outside consultant to copy, search, and produce relevant non-privileged e-mails \nand attachments; (2) instructing Computer Ants to identify documents responsive to \na list of search terms; (3) instructing Computer Ants to remove all e-mails \ncontaining the extension “hickorylaw.com” from the documents produced; and (4) \nthen producing the hard drives prepared by Computer Ants without any review or \nsampling or other quality assurance effort to assess whether the consultant’s efforts \nhad been successful in eliminating privileged communications.  Defendants admit \nthat they relied exclusively on “this contractor and this procedure” to filter out \ndocuments potentially subject to the attorney-client privilege.  (Defs.’ Mot. ¶ 8.)   \n{59}  While Defendants assert that these limited procedures were reasonable \n“[g]iven the size of the production” at issue (Defs.’ Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Order \nCompelling Return of Privileged Documents Supp. Br. (“Defs.’ Supp. Br.”) 4), the \ncourt concludes that the extent of Defendants’ efforts to guard against potential \nproduction of privileged communications  prior to producing the hard drives in \nJanuary and March 2012 were not commensurate with the value of the privilege \nwhich Defendants now urge in their effort to protect against waiver. \n {60}  Even though this court has earlier noted a clear caution that special \ncare is required in approaching discovery of this type, see Analog Devices, Inc. v. \nMichalski , 2006 NCBC 14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 1, 2006), http://www.ncbusiness \ncourt.net/opinions/ 2006%20NCBC%2014.htm; see also Bank of Am. Corp. v. SR \nInt’l Bus. Ins. Co., Ltd. , 2006 NCBC 15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 1, 2006), http://www. \nncbusinesscourt.net/ opinions/2006%20NCBC%2015.pdf., the court has not applied \na bright-line rule which can be argued to now be the rule in the federal courts.  \nSome federal district court decisions may stand for a simple and strict rule that a \nfailure by Defense counsel to conduct any privilege review prior to production would \npreclude any argument that privileges had not been waived.  E.g.,  In re \nFountainebleau Las Vegas Contract Litig., No. 09-02106-MD-GOLD/GOODMAN, \n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4105, at *37 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 7, 2011) (citing Ciba-Geigy Corp. \nv. Sandoz Ltd. , 916 F. Supp. 404, 412 (D.N.J. 1995); United States Fid. & Guar. Co. \nv. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. , 630 F. Supp 2d 1332 (M.D. Fla. 2007); SEC v. \nCassano , 189 F.R.D. 83, 86 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).   \n {61}  The court has instead carefully considered whether waiver should not \nfollow where Defense counsel sought the assistance of an outside consultant.  But, \nthe court also concludes that efforts by a consultant demand a degree of oversight \nthat is absent here.  In Victor Stanley , the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Maryland explained that parties must take special precautions when \nusing an electronic search and retrieval methodology, like that employed by \nDefendants, to identify and withhold privileged materials, indicating that: (1) the \n“[s]election of the appropriate search and information retrieval technique requires \ncareful advance planning by persons qualified to design effective search \nmethodology”; (2) “[t]he implementation of the methodology selected should be \ntested for quality assurance”; and (3) “the party selecting the methodology must be \nprepared to explain the rationale for the method chosen to the court, demonstrate \nthat it is appropriate for the task, and show that it was properly implemented.”  \nVictor Stanley , 250 F.R.D. at 262.  Defendants are not able to make such a showing \non this record. \n {62}  Because the Defendants did not maintain copies of the hard drives \nproduced to Plaintiffs, the record remains somewhat unclear as to how the \ndocuments on the two hard drives were organized.  But it appears that whatever \nefforts Computer Ants followed did not isolate all privileged communications and \nthe issue is not a simple one of just returning one library from the disks produced.  \nAgain, this court finds some guidance from the federal courts.  In \n Harmony Gold \nU.S.A. v. FASA Corp. , 169 F.R.D. 113, 117 (N.D. Ill. 1996), the court indicated that \nit is “axiomatic that a screening procedure that fails to detect confidential \ndocuments that are actually listed as privileged is patently inadequate.”  Whether \nthis court were to adopt such an axiom, here the Defendants’ argument is \ncompromised by a failure prior to production to undertake some minimal review of \nwhat was on the hard drive or to employ some minimal sampling of the libraries \nbeing produced to determine the effectiveness of procedures implemented to \nsegregate privileged communications.   \n {63}  The court also does not believe that counsel can altogether delegate the \nneed to guard against production of privileged communications to an outside \nconsultant.  In \nThorncreek Apts. III, LLC v. Vill. of Park Forest , 2011 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 88281, at *25−26 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 9, 2011), the court found reliance on a \nsubstantially more experienced electronic document consultant to be inadequate to \nprotect against waiver where the party failed to conduct any testing of the \nconsultant’s work before production.  The court explained that:  \nit would have been a simple matter for the [producing party] to check \nthe database . . . before it went live online and became available to the \n[receiving party] to verify that privileged documents were not \ndisclosed. . . . Given the importance that parties typically attach to \nprotecting even arguably privileged communications, one would have \nexpected the [producing party] to perform such a verification check.  \nThe failure to do so is strong evidence of the inadequacy of [the \nproducing party’s] precautions. \n \nId.  at *25−*26.      \n {64}  Defendants’ arguments are also compromised by Scott’s testimony that \nhe was given no guidance that would provide him any basis on which to determine \nwhether or how documents on the production hard drive related to the case.  (Scott \nDep. 29:23−30:7.)  Under those circumstances, it is more difficult to establish \nreliance on the expert as a reasonable advance precaution to guard against privilege \nwaiver. \n {65}  This court takes no pleasure in finding the waiver of attorney-client \nprivilege.  But, regrettably, the court cannot on this record conclude that reasonable \nefforts adequate to protect against a waiver were undertaken in advance of \nproduction to insulate against a subsequent waiver by applying the remaining \nfactors of the five-factor balancing test. \n \n2. \n Other Factors of the Balancing Test \n{66}  As indicated above, the court concludes that the multi-factor balancing \ntest applied by the federal courts on this record is controlled by the first factor \nwhich requires that reasonable advance efforts to guard against inadvertent \nproduction must have been taken. \n {67}  The second factor looks at the number of privileged communications \nthat were inadvertently disclosed.  The record indicates that the January 3, 2012 \nand March 1, 2012 hard drives contained approximately 1,700 documents to or from \nthe “hickorylaw.com” domain name, some of which may have been removed as \nduplicates in the subsequent production and privilege log. \n {68}  Defendants cite \nSun River Energy, Inc. v. Nelson , which included a \ncomparison of “the number of inadvertent disclosures made in relation to the total \nnumber of documents produced.”  2011 WL 3648600, at *4 (D. Colo. Aug. 18, 2011).  \nDefendants calculate that there was an inadvertent production rate of \napproximately 0.0045% calculated by an equation with a number of 1,700 \npotentially privileged documents and a denominator of a total production of \n307,816,673 documents. \n {69}  Plaintiffs first argue that the failure to conduct any privilege review \ncompels a finding of waiver without regard to any numerical inquiry.  \nSee Ciba-\nGeigy Corp. , 916 F. Supp. at 412.  But, if any comparison is made, Plaintiffs contend \nthe court should compare the number of privileged communications withheld from \nproduction to the number of inadvertent disclosures, and that such an equation does \nnot aid Defendants who withheld no documents at all on the basis of privilege.   \n {70}  The third factor examines the extent to which the privilege has been \nwaived.  Defendants conclude that “the extent of the disclosure, and any supposed \nprejudice to Plaintiffs, is insignificant.”  (Defendants’ Reply Br. in Supp. of Mot. for \nOrder Compelling Return of Privileged Documents 6.)  Plaintiffs assert that the \nprivilege issues pervade the entire production, asserting that the unsearchable \nformat of the January 3, 2012 and March 1, 2012 productions forced Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel to index the documents, convert them into a searchable format, and load the \ndocuments again into a document review platform, with the result that, “hundreds \nof potentially privileged documents exist in multiple places that cannot be easily \nreturned or destroyed,” so that “Plaintiffs cannot effectively and comprehensively \nreview Defendants’ production without coming across potentially privileged \ndocuments.”  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 20.) \n {71}  If this third factor were controlling, the court would attempt to resolve \nthe issues by fashioning a procedure that would guard against the use of privileged \ncommunications while not imposing an undue burden on Plaintiffs to search and \nreturn all copies made during the indexing process.  But, again, the court concludes \nthat the controlling factor is the absence of efforts on the front end.  Here, the court \ncannot conclude that the inadvertent production has been “insignificant.”   \n {72}  The fourth factor inquires as to the reasonableness of the producing \nparty’s response when learning of inadvertent production.  Defendants cite \nCeglia v. \nZuckerberg  for the notion that “with regard to reasonableness of steps to rectify the \ninadvertent disclosure, the delay in seeking to remedy the inadvertent disclosure of \nprivileged material is measured from the date the holder of the privilege discovers \nthe . . . disclosure[,]”  No. 10-CV-00569A(F), 2012 WL 1392965, at *9 (W.D.N.Y. Apr. \n19, 2012), and assert that Defendants acted “immediately upon the learning of the \ninadvertent disclosures [on March 16, 2012] to rectify the situation.”  (Defs.’ Supp. \nBr. 5.)  Plaintiffs, in turn, suggest that the delays in a written demand for the \nreturn of privilege documents militates against excusing a waiver, and particularly \nso where the ultimate request was not for the return of only specific privileged \ndocuments but rather for the return of  the entire production.   \n {73}  The court need not accept any invitation to criticize the timeliness of \nDefendants’ response once learning that privileged communications had been \nproduced, and the court in no way bases its finding of waiver on acts or omissions in \nand after March 2012.   \n{74}  The final factor is an imprecise one which inquires into “the overriding \ninterests of justice.”  The court leaves for another day exactly what may be captured \nby this factor, but notes that the term “overriding” suggests that something \nextraordinary is required to insulate against a finding of waiver when the first four \nfactors suggest the contrary.  \n{75}  Defendants urge that here the court should rely on that factor because a \nfailure to do so would improperly condone Plaintiffs’ failure to satisfy their \nobligations under Rule 26(b)(7)(b) and N.C. RPC 4.4(b).  Plaintiffs counter that the \ncourt should rather be careful not to condone Defendants’ “document dump” and \ntheir effort to “shift the cost of reviewing this document dump to Plaintiffs.”  (Pls.’ \nResp. Br. 21.)   \n {76}  Certainly, the court does not intend to condone one party “sandbagging” \nthe other by taking advantage of surprise and using privileged information to take \nunfair advantage in a witness examination.  But, here the court does not find that \nthe record quite as clearly raises the ethical concerns Defendants urge.  This is not \na case of where Plaintiffs surprised a defense witness by producing a privileged \ncommunication or using a privileged communication to formulate substantive \ninquiries.  The record instead suggests that Plaintiffs segregated and did not read \ncommunications which they identified as potentially privileged.  The witness \nexamination at issue was limited to the topic, specifically identified in a prior Rule \n30(b)(6) deposition notice, of what efforts Defendants had undertaken in producing \nthe documents.      \n{77}  Rule 26(b)(7)(b) provides that an attorney who inadvertently receives \nprivileged documents: \n(i) must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified \ninformation and any copies it has, (ii) must not use or disclose the \ninformation until the claim is resolved, (iii) must take reasonable steps \nto retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being \nnotified, and (iv) may promptly present the information to the court \nunder seal for determination of the claim.   \n \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(7)(b) (2011).  Here, while Plaintiffs asserted the right to \ncontinue review because of their conclusion that the waiver was intentional, the \nrecord also indicates that Plaintiffs segregated the communications and avoided \ntheir review.  In its ruling, the court does not and does not intend to encourage a \nreceiving party to believe that it has the unilateral right to determine whether the \nproducing party had intentionally waived privileges when producing attorney client \ncommunications. \n {78}  Defendants separately invoke the provisions of N.C. RPC 4.4(b) which \nprovides that, “[a] lawyer who receives a writing relating to the representation of \nthe lawyer’s client and knows or reasonably should know that the writing was \ninadvertently sent shall promptly notify the sender.”  N.C. RPC 4.4(b) (2005).  \n {79}  Defendants’ argument raises at least two questions.  First, the court \nmust inquire whether it, rather than the State Bar, is the proper entity to police a \nviolation of the ethical rule.  The court need not resolve that issue here, but its clear \ninclination would be that in the proper case, a violation of an ethical duty may be \ncaptured in the exercise of the fifth factor of the balancing test.  The second \nquestion is whether the record clearly demonstrates that Plaintiff’s notice of the \nissue of potential waiver was “prompt” within the meaning of the rule.  This is an \nimprecise question for which there is no bright-line for determination.  Again, the \ncourt here notes the contrast between the facts of this case and an instance in which \na party attempts by surprise to use the contents of a privileged communication.  \nHere, Plaintiffs examined Defendants’ witness on a topic notice in the Rule 30(b)(6) \nnotice of deposition and did so without using the contents of any privileged \ncommunication.  The court concludes that those facts are not adequate to insulate \nagainst the waiver that results from the failure to take reasonable protections in \nadvance of producing the privileged communications.  \n{80}  Again, the court does not by its ruling intend to encourage any party \nreceiving what may appear to be privileged communications to elect to provide no \nnotice to opposing counsel because the receiving counsel unilaterally concludes that \nthe waiver was intentional rather than inadvertent.     \n \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n{81}  The court believes that the facts of this case are unusual, and that the \ncourt’s ruling must be considered in light of this particular record.  The court \nrecognizes that “[t]he public’s interest in protecting the attorney-client privilege is \nno trivial consideration[.]”  In re Miller , 357 N.C. at 328, 584 S.E.2d at 782.  But, \nthose considerations also require some minimal level of effort to guard against \nwaiver prior to document production.  Here, considering all factors, the court must \nconclude that any attorney-client privilege attendant to the produced documents \nhas been waived. \n{82}  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion is DENIED.   \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED, this 26th day of July, 2012. \n \n \n \n "
