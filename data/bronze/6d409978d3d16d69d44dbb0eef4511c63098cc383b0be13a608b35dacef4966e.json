Accordingly, to the extent the Petition for Judicial Review seeks to \nchallenge the Order Denying Reconsideration, it is DENIED. \n \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nA. The Dispute and Issues to be Decided \n1. This matter arises out of a dispute between Petitioner Railroad Friction \nProducts Corporation  (“Railroad Friction”)  and Respondent North Carolina \nDepartment of Revenue (the “Department”) regarding Railroad Friction’s claims for \nrefunds of North Carolina corporate income and f ranchise taxes for tax years 2011, \n2012, and 2013.  On October 15, 2015, Railroad Friction filed amended tax returns \nfor the 2011, 2012, and 2013 tax years  (hereinafter individually referred to  as the \n“2011 Amended Return”, “2012 Amended Return”, and “2013 Amended Return”, and \ncollectively as the “Amended R eturns”) requesting refunds of alleged overpayments \nof taxes  based on Railroad Friction’s reclassification of its business from brake \nmanufacturer to “public utility,” and its claim that it was entitled to use single-factor \napportionment to determine its North Carolina income and franchise taxes.  Railroad \nFriction also later claimed to be entitled to a refund of its franchise tax payments for \nthe 2011, 2012, and 2013 tax years  based on a re calculation of the affiliated \nindebtedness component of its Capital  Stock Base for franchise tax purposes (the \n“affiliated indebtedness”  claim).  The Department denied the refunds , Railroad \nFriction filed a contested case proceeding, and the OAH subsequently issued a Final \nDecision upholding the Department’s denial  of the refunds , and an Order Denying \nReconsideration.  Railroad Friction now petitions this Court to reverse the Final \nDecision and Order Denying Reconsideration, and conclude that Railroad Friction is \nowed refunds of the taxes it paid for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2013. \n \n \n2. The issues to be decided in this action are (a) is Railroad Friction a \n“public utility” corporation within the meaning of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6) and therefore \nentitled to calculate its North Carolina income and franchise taxes  using a sing le-\nfactor apportionment formula, as opposed to the standard three-factor apportionment \nformula provided in G.S. § 105-130.4(i), and (b) whether the OAH erred in concluding \nthat Railroad Friction’s claim for refund based on adjustments to its calculations o f \naffiliated indebtedness should be dismissed for failure to properly give the \nDepartment and OAH notice of the claim. \nB. North Carolina’s Corporate Income and Franchise Tax System \n3. The North Carolina Revenue Act (“Revenue Act”), G.S. § 105 -1, et. seq., \nimposes a State corporate income tax and franchise tax on corporations doing \nbusiness in North Carolina.  The corporate income tax is levied on the North Carolina \nnet income of a C-corporation.  G.S. § 105-130.3.  The franchise tax, on the other hand, \nis measured by “the total amount of [a corporation ’s] issued and outstanding capital \nstock, surplus, and undivided profits” (collectively “Capital Stock Base”).  G.S. § 105-\n122(b).  “[A] corporation that does business both inside and outside North Carolina \nmust use the allocation and appo rtionment process delineated in [G.S.] §§ 105 -\n122(c1)(1) and 105-130.4 in order to determine its liability for the payment of North \nCarolina franchise and income taxes.”  Midrex Techs. v. N.C. Dep’ t of Revenue , 369 \nN.C. 250, 257, 794 S.E.2d 785, 791 (2016). \n4. For most corporations doing business in and outside of North Carolina, \ntheir income is apportioned so as to determine what portion of it is subject to North \n \n \nCarolina taxes using a formula consisting of three factors: property, payroll, and sales \n(“standard apportionment formula”).  G.S. §105 -130.4(i).  Additionally, their capital \nstock, surplus, and undivided profits are apportioned using the same formula.  G.S. \n§ 105-122(c1)(1).  North Carolina , however, has enacted statutes provid ing special, \nmore favorable, methods of apportionment for corporations in certain industries.  One \nsuch statute is G.S.  § 105-130.4(r), which authorizes sin gle-factor apporti onment \nbased exclusively on sales  (“single-factor apportionment”) for certain corporations, \nincluding “public utility” corporations.  During the tax years at issue in this matter, \nthe North Carolina Revenue Act defined a “public utility” corporation as: \nany corporation that is subject to control of one or more of \nthe follow ing entities: the North Carolina Utilities \nCommission, the Federal Communications Commission, \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, or the Federal Aviation Agency; \nand that owns or operates for public use any plant, \nequipment, property, franchise, or license for the \ntransmission of communications, the transportation of \ngoods or persons, or the production, storage, transmission, \nsale, delivery or furnishing of electricity, water, steam, oil, \noil products, or gas. The term also includes a motor carrier \nof property whose principal business activity is \ntransporting property by motor vehicle for hire over the \npublic highways of this State. \n \nG.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6) (2012).2   \n \n                                                 \n2 The language of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6) quoted above is the language in the versions of the \nstatute applicable to Railroad Friction’s 2011, 2012, and 2013 amended tax returns.  The \nstatutory language was amended in 2016 to eliminate “the Interstate Commerce \nCommission,” effective for calendar quarters beginning on or after January 1, 2017.  2015 \nN.C. SB 803 (201 6).  Ultimately t his section was repealed, effective for ta xable years \nbeginning on or after January 1, 2018.  2015 N.C. HB 97 (2015). \n \n \n5. Also r elevant to Railroad Friction’s claims in this matter  is the \ncalculation of Capital Stock Base  for North Carolina franchise  tax purposes.  In \nmaking this calculation,  a corporation must include “all indebtedness owed to a \nparent . . . corporation as a part of its capital used in its business” (“af filiated \nindebtedness”).  G.S. § 105 -122(b)(8).  To compute affiliated indebtedness, “a \ncorporation that owes indebtedness to a parent [or] subsidiary . . . and at the same \ntime is owed indebtedness by the same parent [or] subsidiary . . . shall net the \npayable[s] and receivable[s] . . . .”  17 N.C.A.C. 5B.1110.   \nC. Railroad Friction’s Refund Theories \n6. Based on the above, Railroad Friction presents two alternate theories to \nthis Court in support of its argument that it is due a tax refund from the Department \nfor the 2011, 2012, and 2013 tax years.  First, Railroad Friction contends that it is a \npublic utility  and was  permitted to use the single-factor apportionment formula \nunder G.S. §§ 105-130.4(a)(6) and 105-130.4(r) to calculate its State tax liability.  (Br. \nin Supp. of  Petition, ECF No. 26, at pp. 13 –14.)  By applying single-factor \napportionment, Railroad Friction claims it is due a n aggregate refund of $2,983,003 \ndollars for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 tax years.  (Record on Judicial Review, ECF Nos. \n12–16, at p. 1458.)3  \n7. Alternatively, Railroad Friction contends it is entitled to refunds for the \n2011, 2012, and 2013 tax years on its franchise taxes based on a recalculation of the \n                                                 \n3 The Record on Judicial Review is contained in the electronic docket at ECF Nos. 12 –16.  \nECF No. 12 contains pages 1–503, ECF No. 13 contains pages 504–665, ECF No. 14 contains \npages 666–888, ECF No. 15 contains pages 889–1286, and ECF No. 16 contains pages 1287–\n1886 of the record.  Hereinafter, ECF Nos. 12–16 are referred to as the “Rec.”. \n \n \naffiliated indebtedness component of its Capital Stock Base.  (ECF No. 26, at pp. 7–\n14.)  According to Railroad Friction, it failed to net payables and receivables between \nit and its parent corporation in reporting affiliated indebtedness in its original 2011, \n2012, and 2013 tax returns.  (Id. at pp. 11–13.)  Instead, it reported only the payables \nit owed to its parent corporation.  (Id.)  By properly netting payables and receivables, \nRailroad Friction argues that it is e ntitled to refunds for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 \ntax years in the amount of $101,095; $112,199; and $115,959 respec tively.  (Rec., at \np. 91). \nIII. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n8. Railroad Fri ction is a Delaware corporation headquartered in \nWilmerding, Pennsylvania.  (Id. at p. 6.)  It is a subsidiary of Westinghouse Air Brake \nTechnologies Corporation (“Wabtec”).  ( Id. at p. 42; ECF No. 3, at  ¶ 43.)  Railroad \nFriction operates a manufacturing facility in Laurinburg, North Carolina where it \nproduces brake shoes and disc pads for locomotives, freight cars, and mass transit \ncars.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 20, 21, 23 ; Rec., at p. 822.)  It sells its products to railroad s \nand transit authorities throughout the United States , including in North Carolina.  \n(ECF No. 3, at p. 4 n. 2. )  Specifically, Railroad Friction sells its product to Class I \nrailroads, including Union Pacific, CSX Tr ansportation, Amtrak, Norfolk Southern, \nand New Jersey Transit.  ( ECF No. 3, at p. 4; Rec., at pp. 1262, 1268).  Railroad \nFriction has not sold its product to individuals.  (R ec., at p. 1268).  After the brake \nshoes are sold to railroad companies, the shoes are affixed to a locomotive owned by \n \n \na railroad company.  ( Id. at pp. 1262, 1267 –68).  It is undisputed that Railroad \nFriction is subject to North Carolina corporate income and franchise taxes.  \n9. Railroad Friction adheres to manufacturing and safety guidelines \nestablished by the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), with oversight from \nthe Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”).  (Id. at pp. 1273–74).  Railroad Friction \nis not subject to any control by the I nterstate Commerce Commission (“ICC”), which \nwas abolished by the United States Congress in 1995.  (Id. at pp. 849–54.)  Railroad \nFriction’s products undergo testing at its plant to ensure that the product s function \nfor the purposes for which they were designed; that is, to brake (i.e., slow down and \nstop) a locomotive and hold a load in place.  (Id. at pp. 1145, 1279).  Neither the AAR \nor FAR regulate Railroad Friction’s pricing, market regions, production levels, \nresearch and development, or its customers.  (Id. at pp. 1141–42, 1279–82). \n10. On October 15, 2015, Railroad Friction filed the Amended Returns with \nthe Department.  (Rec., at pp. 1492 –1594, 1618 –69, 1694 –1748.) In each of the  \nAmended Returns, Railroad Friction , for the first time, applied the single-factor \napportionment formula applicable to public utility corporations  under G.S. § § 105-\n130.4(a)(6) and 105-130.4(r).  (Id.)  The Amended Returns each included the following \nexplanation for amendment: “[t]his return is amended in order to utilize the required \npublic utility single sales factor apportionment formula.”  (Id.)  In the letter submitted \nto the Department with the Amended Returns, Railroad Friction identified one issue \nfor review: “[w]hether Railroad Friction [ ] qualifies as a ‘public utility’ as defined by \n[G.S.] § 105 -130.4(a)(6), and thus would be required to utilize the single[-] factor \n \n \napportionment formula for North Carolina  corporate income and  franchise tax \npurposes[.]”  (Id. at pp. 1459–65.) \n11. Additionally, Railroad Friction’s 2011 A mended Return included a \nrecalculation of its affiliated indebtedness for franchise tax purposes.  (ECF No. 3, at \n¶ 45; Response to Petition for Judicial Review, ECF No. 8, at ¶ 45.)  Neither the 2011 \nAmended Return , nor the letter accompanying the return , explain ed that the \nrecalculation of affiliated indebtedness was a basis for the 2011 Amended Return.   \n(Rec., at pp. 1459 –65.)  The 2012 and 201 3 Amended Returns did not recalculate \nRailroad Friction’s affiliated indebtedness for tax years 2012 and 2013. \n12. On February 2, 2016, the Department requested additional information \nfrom Railroad Friction regarding the basis upon which it was seeking treatment as a \n“public utility” under North Carolina law.  (Id. at p. 877.)  Railroad Friction responded \nto the request on March 3, 2016. \n13. On April 4, 2016, after reviewing the Amended Returns and the \nsupplemental information provided by Railroad Friction, the Department issued its \nNotice of Proposed Denial of Refund (“Notice of Proposed Denial”), denying Railroad \nFriction’s refund requests for the 2011 , 2012, and  2013 tax years  because Railroad \nFriction did not meet the statutory definition of “public utility” and did not qualify to \nuse the single -factor a pportionment formula.  (Id. at pp.  877–78.)  The Notice of  \nProposed Denial did not address Railroad Friction’s claim for refund for the 2011 tax \nyear based on recalculation of its affiliated indebtedness. \n \n \n14. Railroad Friction timely requested a departmental review of the Notice \nof Proposed Denial.  (Id. at p. 809.)  In its request for review, Railroad Friction raised \nonly one objection to the Department’s  Notice of Proposed Denial: that the \nDepartment incorrec tly concluded it was not a public utility under  G.S. § 105 -\n130.4(a)(6).  ( Id.)  Railroad Friction did not object to, or seek review of, the \nDepartment’s failure to address the recalculation of Railroad Friction’s  affiliated \nindebtedness for the 2011 tax year.  (Id.) \n15. The Department engaged in a review of its Notice of Proposed Denial.  \nOn February 9, 2017 , the  Department issued its Notice of Final D etermination \n(“Final Determination”), again finding that Railroad Friction was not a public utility \nand that they could not claim the benefit of single-factor apportionment.  (Id. at pp. \n6–9.)  The Final Determination did not address Railroad Friction’s claim for refund \nfor the 2011 tax year based on recalculation of its affiliated indebtedness. \n16. On April 10, 2017, Railroad Friction  timely appealed the F inal \nDetermination by filing  a Petition for a Contested Case Hearing with OAH \n(“Petition”).  (Rec., at p. 12.)  On May 8, 2017, Railroad Friction filed an Amended \nPetition for a Co ntested Case Hearing (“Amended Petition”) .  (Id. at pp. 20–25.)  In \nthe Amended Petition , Railroad Friction  asked OAH to reverse the F inal \nDetermination on the grounds that the Department “improperly concluded [Railroad \nFriction] does not meet the statutory definition of public utility.”  (Id. at pp. 24–25.)  \nIn neither the Petition nor the Amended Petition did Railroad Friction object to, or \n \n \nseek review of, the D epartment’s failure to address a  claim for refund for the 2011 \ntax year based on recalculation of its affiliated indebtedness. \n17. On May 12, 2017, Railroad Friction filed its Prehearing Statement with \nOAH.  (Id. at p p. 28 –34.)  The Prehearing S tatement identified one issue to be \nresolved: “[w]hether the Department erroneously concluded [Railroad Friction] does \nnot meet the statutory definition of public utility for North Carolina corporate income \nand franchise tax apportionment purposes[.]”  (Id. at p. 28.)  Railroad Friction’s \nPrehearing Statement did not object to, or seek review of, the Department’s failure to \naddress it s claim for refund for the 2011 tax year based on recalculation of its \naffiliated indebtedness.   On May 15,  2017, the Department filed its Prehearing \nStatement, which addressed only the issue of whether Railroad Friction was a public \nutility entitled to use of the single-factor apportionment formula.  (Id. at pp. 35–40.) \n18. In early October of 2017, while engaging in discovery  during the \ncontested case proceeding, Railroad Friction  first expressly raised the issue of \n“affiliated indebtedness” as an alternative basis for its tax refund claims  to the \nDepartment.  On October 3, 2017, Railroad Friction responded to the Department ’s \nrequest for production of documents by submitting documents which amend ed \nRailroad Friction’s affiliated indebtedness for the 2012 and 2013 tax years.  (Rec., at \npp. 103–114.)  On October 4, 2017, Railroad Friction  filed responses to the \nDepartment’s interrogatories, which identified the recalculation of affil iated \nindebtedness for the 2011 through 2013 tax years as a basis for a refund.  (Id. at pp. \n94–102.)  Additionally,  on October 5, 2017,  during the Department’s deposition of \n \n \nRailroad Friction’s corporate designee , the deponent  identified affiliated \nindebtedness as an alternative basis for Railroad Friction’s position that it was due a \nrefund of excess tax payments.  (Id. at pp. 1385–1400.)  Despite raising the affiliated \nindebtedness issue during discovery, Railroad Friction never further amended its \nAmended Petition or amended its Prehearing Statement to include the recalculation \nof affiliated indebtedness as an additional claim for refund to the 2011, 2012, or 2013 \ntax years. \n19.  On January 29, 2018,  following the close of discovery  in the contested \ncase hearing , Railroad Friction  and the D epartment filed motions for summary \njudgment on Railroad Friction’s Amended Petition and submitted briefs supporting \ntheir motions.  (Id. at pp. 68–86, 820–39.)  In its brief, Railroad Friction argued it was \na public utility entitled to use the single-factor apportionment formula and, \nalternatively, that it was entitled to net payables and receivable s in its affiliated \nindebtedness calculation, thereby reducing its tax liability for the 2011 through 2013 \ntax years.  (Id. at pp. 71–86.)  This was the first time Railroad Friction presented the \nissue of affiliated indebtedness to OAH.  In response, the Department argued that \nRailroad Friction did not qualify as a public utility under North Carolina law and \nthat Railroad Friction failed to state a claim for affiliated indebtedness because it did \nnot raise  the claim in its request for de partmental review, its Petition,  Amended \nPetition, or Prehearing Statement.  (Id. at pp. 906–911.)    \n20.   On February 23, 2018, Administrative Law Judge J. Randolph Ward \n(hereinafter “ALJ”) issued the  Final Decision, which granted the Department ’s \n \n \nmotion for summary judgment , denied Railroad Friction’s motion for summary \njudgment, and upheld the Department’s Final Determination.  (Rec., at pp. 913–18.)  \nIn the Final Decision, the ALJ concluded Railroad Friction was not a public utility  \nwithin the meaning of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6), and that, because Railroad Friction “did \nnot give [the Department] or OAH notice of [its affiliated indebtedness] claim in its \nPetition or Prehearing Statement, the issue concerning the calculation of affiliated \nindebtedness cannot be considered for the fir st time, over the objection of the \n[Department], after the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment.”  (Id. \nat p. 917.)   \n21. On March 9, 2018, Railroad Fiction filed a motion for reconsideration on \nthe issue of affiliated indebtedness with OAH.  (Id. at pp. 920–24.)  Railroad Friction \nargued that OAH had the authority to consider th e affiliated indebtedness issue by \neither amending the pleadings under G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 15(b) of the North Carolina \nRules of Civil Procedure (hereinafter the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure are \nreferred to as “Rule(s)”) or reopening the case to hear the issue under Rule 60(b)(6).  \n(Id., at p. 933.)  On March 26, 2018, the ALJ  issued the Order Denying \nReconsideration on the basis that  the Department did not expressly or implicitly \nconsent to trying the issue of affiliated indebtedness, and because the extraordinary \ncircumstances necessary to set aside a judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) did not exist.  \n(Id.)  That same day, Railroad Friction submitted its Petition for Judicial Review, \nwhich is now before this Court.  (ECF No. 3.) \n \n \n22. Railroad Fiction filed a brief in support of its Petition for Judicial Review \non September 21, 2018.  ( ECF No. 26.)  The Department  filed its response brief on \nNovember 7, 2018, and Railroad Friction filed a reply brief on November 20, 2018.   \n(Br. in Opposition, ECF No. 27; Reply Br., ECF No. 28.)  The Petition came before the \nCourt for a hearing on November 29, 2018, and is now ripe for determination.   \nII. ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review \n23. The task before this Court is to “determine whether the petitioner is \nentitled to the relief sought in the petition based upon [a] review of the final decision \nand the official record.”  G.S. § 150B-51(c).  The appeal of a final decision of OAH in \na contested case “arising from [a] summary judgment order[ ] [is] decided using a de \nnovo standard of review.”  Midrex Techs. , 369 N.C. at 257, 794 S.E.2d at 791 .  \nAccordingly, the Court will “make a de novo d etermination of whether [ the ALJ ] \ncorrectly granted summary judgment in favor of the [ Department] and against \n[Railroad Friction] .”  Id.  “Under the  de novo  standard of review, the [Court] \nconsider[s] the matter anew and freely substitute[s] its own judgment for [that of the \nlower court .]”  Id. (alterations in original) (citations and quotations omitted).  \nSummary judgment i s appropriate where there is no  factual dispute and only \nquestions of law remain.  Wal-Mart Stores East v. Hinton, 197 N.C. App. 30, 37, 676 \nS.E.2d 634, 638 (2009). \n24. The facts of this case are not in dispute.  Instead, Railroad Friction  \ncontends that the ALJ erred in his interpretation of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6) as applied \n \n \nto the undisputed facts of this case.  Railroad Friction  contends that the ALJ \nimproperly concluded that Railroad Friction was not a public utility.  This raises an \nissue of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law for the Court.  Parkdale \nAm., LLC v. Hinton , 200 N.C. App. 275, 278, 684 S.E.2d 458, 461 (2009).  Railroad \nFriction contends that, if the proper interpretation of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6) is applied \nto the undisputed facts, it falls within the  definition of a “public utility” for the tax \nyears at issue. \nB. Railroad Friction Has Failed to Establish That It Is a Public Utility under G.S. \n§ 105-130.4(a)(6). \n \n25. The Court first addresses whether Railroad Friction  is a public utility  \ncorporation entitled to use single-factor apportionment in calculating its franchise \nand corporate income tax.  To qualify as a public utility under G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6), \na corporation must satisfy two requirements.  First, the corporation must be subject \nto the control of: “the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Federal \nCommunications Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, or the Federal Aviation Agency  . . . . ”  G.S. §105-\n130.4(a)(6).  Second, the Corporation must “own[ ] or operate[ ] for public use any \nplant, equipment, property, franchise, or license for the transmission of \ncommunications, the transportation of goods or persons, or the production, storage, \ntransmission, sale, delivery or furnishing of electricity, water, steam, oil, oil products, \nor gas.”  Id.   \n26. Railroad Friction argues that it satisfies the above statutory \nrequirements because (1) it is subject to the control of the Federal Railroad \n \n \nAdministration (“FRA”), the alleged successor for the ICC; and (2) it owns for public \nuse property —brake pads and shoes —for the transportation of goods or persons.  \n(ECF No. 26, at pp. 14 –23.)  Railroad Friction  claims that the FRA maintains \nsignificant regulatory oversight o ver the brake system co mponents that it \nmanufactures.   \n27. In response, the Department argues that Railroad Friction does not \nqualify as a public utility under G.S. § 105 -130.4(a)(6) because (1) Railroad Friction \nis not subject to the control of any government a gency listed in the statute;  (2) the \nFRA is not the successor to the ICC under the statute4;  and (3) Railroad Friction does \nnot conduct any activity of a public utility as defined by the statute.  (ECF No. 27, at \npp. 5–6.)   \n28.  “[T]he first principle of sta tutory interpretation is to ascertain the \nintent of the legislature and to carry out such intention to the fullest extent. ” \nParkdale Am., LLC , 200 N.C.

As the North Carolina Supreme Court has noted, \n[t]he intent of the General Assembly may be found first \nfrom the plain language of the statute, then  from the \nlegislative history, ‘ the spirit of the act and wh at the act \nseeks to accomplish.’  If the language of a statute is clear, \nthe court must impl ement the statute according to the \nplain meaning of its terms so long as it is reasonable to do \nso. \n \nLenox, Inc. v.

If construing the statute is necessary, however, the primary focus is to \nensure that the purpose of the legislature, as ascertained from the plain words of the \nstatute, is accomplished.  Elec. Supply Co. v. Swain Electrical Co., 328 N.C. 651, 656, \n403 S.E.2d 291, 294  (1991).  In ascertaining legislative intent “regard must be had \n[for] the subject matter of the statute, as well as its language, i.e., the language of the \nstatute must be read . . . contextually, and with refe rence to the matters dealt \nwith . . . .”  Tar Landing Villas Owners’  Assoc. v. Atlantic Beach , 64 N.C. App. 239, \n246, 307 S.E.2d 181, 186 (1983) (quoting Victory Cab Co. v. Charlotte, 234 N.C. 572, \n576, 68 S.E.2d 433, 436  (1951) (quotations omitted)).  Furthermore, “[c]ourts should \ngive effect to the words actually used . . . and should neither delete words used nor \ninsert words not used in the relevant statutory language . . . .”  Wilkie v. City of Boiling \nSpring Lakes , 370 N.C. 540, 551, 809 S.E.2d 853, 861  (2018) (first alteration in \noriginal) (citations and quotations and omitted). \n30. In addition, “[a]  construction which operates to defeat or impair the \nobject of the statute must be avoided if that can reasonably be done without violence \nto the legislative language .”  A court should also “avoid interpretations that create \nabsurd or illogical results.”  Ayers v. Bd. of Adjustment, 113 N.C. App. 528, 531, 439 \n \n \nS.E.2d 199, 201 (1994).  Rather, courts are directed to construe a statute “in a manner \nwhich harmonizes with t he underlying reason and purpose of the statute. ”  Elec. \nSupply Co., 238 N.C. at 656, 403 S.E.2d at 294.   \n31. Finally, in Midrex, the Supreme Court held that “ any claim that a \ntaxpayer has the right to utilize the single -factor formula set out in  [G.S.] § 105 -\n130.4(r) should be strictly construed against, rather than in favor of, the taxpayer's \ncontention . . . .”  369 N.C. 250, 262–63, 794 S.E.2d at 795 (emphasis added). \ni. Railroad Friction is not a public utility because it is not \nsubject to the control of any  agency listed in G.S. § 105 -\n130.4(a)(6). \n \n32. In deciding whether Railroad Friction is a public utility  entitled to \nutilize the single-factor apportionment formula, the Court must determine whether \nit is subject to control of one of the agencies enumerated in  the statute.  Railroad \nFriction admits it is not subject to control of the North Carolina Utilities Commission, \nthe Federal Communications Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the Federal Aviation Agency as required \nby statute.  (Rec., at pp. 1273–76.)  Railroad Friction claims instead to be subject to \nthe control of the FRA.  The FRA is not one of the listed agencies in the statute.  \nTherefore, as an initial matter, the plain language of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6) supports \nthe conclusion that Railroad Friction is not a public utility. \n33. Railroad Friction, however, contends that the FRA is the successor to \nthe ICC and “Railroad Friction is ‘subject to control’ of the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, the agency now vested with the Interstate Commerce Commission’s \n \n \nbroad authority to regulate railroad safety.”  (ECF No. 26, at pp. 14–21.)  In response, \nthe Department argues : (a) the FRA is not listed in statute, and the Co urt cannot \nread the FRA into it;  (b) the General Assembly amended the statute to remove  the \nICC in 2016, and did not substitute or includ e any other agency in its place;  (c) the \nGeneral Assembly did not choose to add the FRA during the 20 years following the \nICC being abolished; 5 (d) the Sur face Transportation Board was created as the \nsuccessor to the responsibilities of the ICC, not the FRA ; and (e) the plain language \nof statute doe s not contain any indication  that the General Assembly intended to \ninclude “successor” agencies.  (ECF No. 27, at pp. 14–18.) \n34. The C ourt has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments and \nconcludes that the plain language of the statute provides that only corporations \nsubject to the control of one or more of the five agencies expressly named are eligible \nfor the e xemption permitting use of the single -factor apportionment formula for \ndetermining income and franchise tax liability.   Railroad Friction fails to cite any \nNorth Carolina authority for the proposition that a statute, let alone a tax statute, \ncan be interpreted so as to imply that a successor agency should be substituted for an \nabolished agency.  To the extent Railroad Friction has cited federal and state court \ndecisions from other jurisdictions holding that a successor agency can be substituted \nfor an abolished agency, the Court finds those  cases distinguishable from the facts \ninvolved here and does not find them persuasive under the circumstances of this case. \n                                                 \n5 The ICC was abolished in 1995.  (ICC Term. Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-88; Rec., at pp. 849–\n54.) \n \n \nii. Railroad Friction is not a public utility because it does not \nown or operate its brake pads  and linings for the \ntransportation of goods or persons, or for the public use. \n \n35. Railroad Friction next argues that it is a public utility because it “owns \nfor ‘public use’ property for the transportation of goods or persons.”  (ECF No. 26, at \npp. 22–23.)  The Court concludes that the ALJ  correctly concluded that Railroad \nFriction does not meet this prong of the definition of public utility either. \n36.  In relevant part, the statute requires that a corporation claiming to be \na public utility “ owns or operate s for public use  any plant, equipment, property, \nfranchise, or license for the transmission of communications, the transportation of \ngoods or persons, or the production, storage, transmission, sale, delivery or furnishing \nof electricity, water, steam, oil, oil products, or gas.”  G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6).  The plain \nmeaning of the operative language “owns . . . for public use any . . . property” is that \nthe property at issue  must be owned by the corporation at the time it is used to \ntransport the goods or persons.  Accordingly, Railroad Friction must prove that (a) it \nowns property for public use , and (b) it uses the property to transport  goods or \npersons.  \n37. Railroad Friction argues that it “owns” the brake pads and linings that \nit produces for public use becau se it is willing to sell them no t only to its railway \ncustomers but to any member of the “public.”  (ECF No. 26, at pp. 22–23.)  It further \nargues that it satisfies the “use” requirement because the brake pads, once purchased \nby a customer, “can be used in the transportation of goods or persons . . . .”  (Id.)  The \nCourt disagrees. \n \n \n38. First, Railroad Friction  does not  own its brake pads and linings for \n“public use ” as required  by the statute.  According to R ailroad Friction, if a \ncorporation owns property and is willing to sell the property to anyone, then it owns \nthe property for “public use.”  ( Id. at p. 22.)   However, the word “use” cannot be \nstretched to mean “sale to” in this context.  To the contrary, “ use” is defined as “to \nemploy for some purpose ; to put into service; to make use of.”  Dictionary.com, Use, \nhttp://www.Dictionary.com/browse/use (last viewed February 18, 2019).  The \nundisputed facts show that at the time Railroad Friction owns the brake p ads and \nlinings it is not using them in the transportation of goods or persons.  Railroad \nFriction owns the brake pads and linings for sale to rail companies.  It is those rail \ncompanies, once they have purchased and installed the brake pads in a rail vehi cle, \nthat own and use the pads and linings to transport goods and persons.   \n39. The Court declines Railroad Friction’s invitation to adopt a broad \ninterpretation of “public use” as it would render the term meaningless  and allow \nevery manufacturing company or retailer that owned property it was willing to sell \nto anyone to claim it owns its property for a public use .  See HCA Crossroads \nResidential Ctrs. v. N.C. Dep’t of Human Res., 327 N.C. 573, 578, 398 S.E.2d 466, 470 \n(1990) (“[A] statute must be construed, if possible, to give meaning and effect to all of \nits provisions.”)  The Court also notes that Railroad Friction has not presented any \nfacts or authority that shows that other manufactures who make and sell products or \nequipment to customers that use the products to provide public services ( e.g., \nmanufactures of telephone equipment or manufactures of parts used in generating \n \n \nelectricity, etc. ) claim to be or are  treated as “public utilities” under G.S. § 105 -\n130.4(a)(6). \n40. Finally, p ublic utilities are broadly defined as companies which offer \ncertain fundamental services to the general public, hence the name “public” utility.  \nSee e.g. , Public Utility , Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (“A company that \nprovides necessary services to the public, such as telephone lines and service, \nelectricity, and water.”); Public Utility, Ballentine’s Law Dictionary (3rd ed. 2010) (“A \ncorporation or business rend ering, and devoting its property to, a public use or \nservice. . . . Including every common carrier, gas, electric, telephone, telegraph, water, \nand heat corporation, and warehousemen, where the service is performed for, or the \ncommodity delivered to, the p ublic generally.”). 6  The plain language of the statute \nleaves little doubt that the General Assembly intended for the public utility \nexemption in G.S. § 105 -130(r)(6) to apply to those corporations that provide public \nservices and not corporations that s ell parts and equipment used by corporations  in \nproviding public services.  Lenox, Inc., 353 N.C. at 664, 548 S.E.2d at 517 (“The intent \nof the General Assembly may be found first from the plain language of the statute.”).  \nIndeed, if the Court were to interpret the statute as proposed by Railroad Friction, it \nwould produce the  absurd result of permitting any private corporation that \nmanufactures and sells component parts and equipment used by a public utility that \ntransmits communications, transports goods  or persons, or produces, stores, \n                                                 \n6 North Carolina courts may also rely on  legal dictionaries when construing the plain \nmeaning of words.  State v. Webb , 358 N.C. 92, 97, 591 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2004) (consulting \nBlack’s Law Dictionary to construe the plain meaning of words in a statute); Hieb v. Lowery, \n344 N.C. 403, 410, 474 S.E.2d 323, 327 (1996) (same). \n \n \ntransmits, sells, delivers or furnishes electricity, water, steam, oil products, or gas”  \nto claim exemption for the three factor apportionment of its income and franchise \ntaxes.  Ayers, 113 N.C. App. at 531, 439 S.E.2d at 201 (Courts should “avoid \ninterpretations that create absurd or illogical results” ).  This cannot be what the \nGeneral Assembly intended in enacting G.S. § 105-130(r)(6). \niii. The last antecedent rule  should not be applied  to the \nstatute. \n \n41. In the Petition for Judicial Review, Railroad Friction contends that the \nALJ erred in concluding that the “last antecedent rule” did not apply to the \ninterpretation of G.S. § 105 -130.4(a)(6). (ECF No. 3, at p. 10.)  However, Railroad \nFriction made no argument in support of this contention in its brief in support of the \nPetition or in its reply brief.  (ECF Nos. 26, 28.)  In response to the Court’s questioning \nat the hearing, Railroad Friction claimed it did not intend to abandon the contention.  \nTherefore, the Court will consider the argument that the last antecedent rule should \nbe applied to its interpretation of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6). \n42. The last antecedent rule is a rule governing grammar that Courts use \nat times to aid in interpreting statutes and contracts.  See Novant Health,  Inc. v. \nAetna U. S. Healthcare of the Carolinas, Inc. , 2001 NCBC LEXIS 1, at *12 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Mar. 8, 2001).   Under the last antecedent rule, “relative and qualifying \nwords, phrases, and clauses ordinarily are to be applied to the word or phrase \nimmediately preceding and, unless the context indicates a contrary intent , are not to \nbe construed as extending to or i ncluding others more remote.”  HCA Crossroads \nResidential Ctrs., 327 N.C. at 578, 398 S.E.2d at 469 (emphasis added).  The rule “is \n \n \nnot an absolute rule, however, but merely one aid to the discovery of legislative \nintent.”  Id.  Thus, the rule “will yield to the evident sense and meaning of the statute” \nand will not be applied if it produces illogical results.  Hagood v. Doughton, 195 N.C. \n811, 819, 143 S.E. 841, 845 (1928); Novant Health, Inc., 2001 NCBC LEXIS 1, at *13 \n(“In essence, the [rule] of the last antecedent only applies if it is logical to apply it.”) \n43. Petitioner argues that, pursuant to the last antecedent rule, the words \nfollowing “license” in G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6) should be read as modifying only the word \n“license.”  Thus, under Petitioner’s desired reading of the statute, a corporation would \nbe considered a “public utility” if it was subject to control of one of the listed agencies \nand “owns or operates for public use any plant, equipment, property [or] franchise.”  \nIt would not be required to show that it owned or operated the plant, equipment, \nproperty or franchise for “the transmission of communications, the transportation of \ngoods or persons, or the production, storage, transmission, sale, delivery or furnishing \nof electricity, water, steam, oil, oil products, or gas .”  Only a corporation claiming to \nbe a public utility solely on the basis that it owned a “license” would need to establish \nthat the license was used for “the transmission of communications, the transportation \nof goods or persons, or the production, storage, transmission, sale, delivery or \nfurnishing of electricity, water, steam, oil, oil products, or gas.” \n44. The Court concludes that because the context and the subject matter of \nthe statute clearly indic ate a contrary intent, the application of the last antecedent \nrule to this provision of the statute  is inappropriate.  The language which Railroad \nFriction would have the Court read as not applying to owners or operators of “plant[s], \n \n \nequipment, property, or franchise[s]” describes the very type of services that are \ngenerally understood to define a public utility.  See e.g., Public Utility, Black’s Law \nDictionary (10th ed. 2014); Public Utility, Ballentine’s Law Dictionary (3rd ed. 2010).  \nIt is evident that the legislature included the list of services in the statute to further \nnarrow the definition of public utility for all corporations, not just those who own a \nlicense.  Only by ignoring the logical and plain meaning of the statute could the Court \napply the last antecedent rule as requested by Railroad Friction.  Therefore, the Court \ndeclines to do so. \n45.  In conclusion, the only way the Court could reach the result proposed \nby Railroad Friction is by interpreting the legislature’s definition of public utilit y in \na manner entirely perverse from the evident intent of the General Assembly based \nupon a plain reading of the statute. \n46. The undisputed facts establish that Railroad Friction does not own for \npublic use property for the transportation of goods or persons, and the Department is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on Railroad Friction’s claim that it is a public \nutility within the meaning of G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6).7  Therefore, the Court concludes \nthat the Final D ecision of OAH granting the Department’s  motion for summary \njudgment on the issue of whether Railroad Friction is a public utility , and denying \nRailroad Friction’s motion for summary judgment  on this issue,  should be \nAFFIRMED, and Railroad Friction’s Petition for Judicial Review should be DENIED.    \n                                                 \n7 To the extent Railroad Friction argues that ignoring the inclusion of the ICC in the statute \nafter it was abolished creates an unacceptable hole in the statute for which another agency \nor agencies must be substituted, (ECF No. 26, at pp. 17–18), the Court notes that there is no \nevidence, nor does Railroad Friction claim, that it was ever subject to the control of the ICC. \n \n \nC. Railroad Friction  Did Not Properly Plead Its Claim for Refund Based on \nRecalculation of Its Affiliated Indebtedness. \n \n47. Railroad Friction next contends that the ALJ erred in holding that he \ncould not consider the claim for refund based on affiliated indebtedness because \nRailroad Friction failed to properly plead the claim for affiliated indebtedness and \nthe Department and OAH  did not have proper notice of the affiliated indebtedness \nclaim.  (ECF No. 26, at pp. 7 –13.)  Railroad Friction claims that the ALJ could \nproperly consider the affiliated indebtedness claim because of the equitable nature of \na tax refund claim which requires an assessment of the taxpayer’s entire tax liability \nfor the years at issue.  Railroad Friction also argues that it was permitted, by statute, \nto change the basis for its refund claim at any time during the refund proceedings. \nFinally, Railroad Friction contends that it provided adequate notice of its claim to the \nDepartment by recalculating affiliated indebtedness in the 2011 Amended Return \nfiled with the Department in October 2015; by providing 2012 and 2013 Amended \nReturns to the Department as part  of discovery responses it served on the \nDepartment in October 2017 during the contested case proceeding; and because the \nDepartment’s attorney questioned Railroad Friction’s representative about affiliated \nindebtedness during a deposition in the contested case proceeding.  (ECF No. 26, at \npp. 10–11.)  The Department argues that the ALJ correctly decided Railroad Friction \ndid not provide notice of the affiliated indebtedness issue because it did not raise the \nclaim in its Petition, A mended Petition, or Prehearing Statement, and, therefore, \nfailed to state a claim based on affiliated indebtedness and failed to comply with Rule \n \n \n8(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (hereinafter, “Rules”).  (ECF No. \n27, at pp. 20–23.) \n48. Railroad Friction first argues that  “a tax refund action, although an \naction at law, is equitable in its function .”  (ECF No. 26, at p. 7.)  Railroad Friction \ncontends that because of this,  a taxpayer seeking a refund may raise ever-shifting \nnew and alternative grounds at any time during the procee dings considering such \naction whether or not it has provided prior notice of the theory. (Id. at pp. 8 –9.)  In \neffect, Railroad Friction contends that because of the nature of a tax refund claim, no \nprocedural rules or deadlines for raising grounds for the refund may be applied to the \nproceedings adjudicating the refund claim.  ( Id.)  In support of this contention, \nRailroad Friction relies primarily on decisions of the federal courts deciding federal \ntax claims, and decisions of various other state jurisdictions.  (Id. at pp. 7–10.) \n49. The Court has thoroughly reviewed the cited decisions, and finds them \nto be  factually dissimilar from the case sub judice , particularly since they do not \naddress the statutory and regulatory framework applicable in North Carolina.  Wake \nCounty v. Hotels , 2012 NC BC LEXIS 63, at * 34–35 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 19, 2012) \n(finding cases from other jurisdictions unpersuasive “because they do not interpret \nthe statutes, ordinances, and resolutions at issue in this action.”).  In fact, none of the \ncase decisions cited by Railroad Friction involve interpretation of any state’s statutes \nand regulations governing an administrative proceeding seeking a tax refund.  \n50. Railroad Friction also argues that there is statutory authority allowing \nit to change the basis for its tax refund claim at any time during the review of an \n \n \namended tax return, eliminating the need to provide OAH or the Department of the \nbasis of its claims for refunds.  (ECF No. 26, at pp. 2, 9–10.)  In support of this position, \nRailroad Friction relies on G.S. § 105-241.7(b), which provides as follows: \nInitiated by Taxpayer. – A taxpayer may request a refund \nof an overpayment made by the taxpayer by taking one of \nthe actions listed in this subsecti on within the statute of \nlimitations for obtaining a refund. A taxpayer may not \nrequest a refund of an overpayment based on a contingent \nevent as defined in G.S. 105 -241.6(b)(5) until the event is \nfinalized and an accurate and definite request for refund of \nan overpayment may be determined. The actions are: \n \n(1) Filing an amended return reflecting an overpayment \ndue the taxpayer. \n \n(2) Filing a claim for refund. The claim must identify \nthe taxpayer, the type and amount of tax overpaid, the \nfiling period to which the  overpayment applies, and the \nbasis for the claim. The taxpayer’s statement of the basis of \nthe claim does not limit the taxpayer from changing the \nbasis. \n \nId. (emphasis added).  Railroad Friction contends that the language providing that \n“[t]he taxpayer’s statement of the basis of the claim does not limit the taxpayer from \nchanging the basis” permits a taxpayer seeking a refund to raise new bases for their \nclaim for refund at any time in the administrative process of seeking a refund.   The \nDepartment’s argument in response is that even “[a]ssuming [G.S. § 105-241.7(b)(2)] \ndoes permit a taxpayer to change the basis of its refund claim [ ], the statute does not \nobviate the notice pleading requirements under Civil Rule 8(a).”  (ECF No. 27, at p. \n22.)  In other words, the Department argues that Railroad Friction’s ability to change \nthe basis for its refund claim, at least once a contested case hearing is commenced, is \nsubject to the Rules.  (Id. at pp. 20–23.) \n \n \n51. Railroad Friction also argues that the Department ha s taken the \nposition that it is not bound to the requirements of the Rules  in changing the basis \nfor assessing a claim for a refund of a tax payment under the mirror-image provision \nof the Revenue Act .  (ECF No. 28, at pp. 2 –4; citing N.C. Dep’t of Revenue  v. First \nPetroleum Servs., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 19 (N.C. Super Ct. Feb. 23, 2018).)  In First \nPetroleum Servs., the Department relied on the language in G.S. § 105-241.9(c), which \nprovides that the Department is not prohibited “from changing the basis” upon which \nit is assessing a tax payment, to claim it was statutorily entitled to raise a new basis \nfor its tax assessment at the summary judgment stage of a contested case .  2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 19, at * 5–10.  Railroad Friction argues that “ the Department should \nnot be permitted to advance two profoundly opposed views of the very same statutory \nlanguage depending on whether it is the Department or the taxpayer who seeks to \nassert an alternative basis during the course of a tax appeal.”  (ECF No. 28, at p. 3.)   \n52. The Co urt in First Petroleum , however, did not address whether the \nDepartment had statutory authority to change the basis for its assessment at the \nsummary judgment stage of a contested case, because it decided  the case on other \ngrounds.  2018 NCBC LEXIS 19, at *9–10.  Thus, the doctrine of judicial estoppel is \nnot applicable here because the Department did not succeed in its argument in First \nPetroleum.  See Estate of Hurst v. Jones, 230 N.C. App. 162, 167, 750 S.E.2d 14, 18 –\n19 (2013) (judicial estoppel applies “[w]here a party assumes a certain position in a \nlegal proceeding, [ ] succeeds in maintaining that position , [and] thereafter, simply \nbecause his interests have changed, assume [s] a contrary position ” (citation and \n \n \nquotations omitted)).   While the Court i s not enamored by a party taking \ncontradictory positions in different cases, the Department is not prevented from doing \nso under the circumstances here. \n53. Thus, the question before the Court is whether Railroad Friction should \nbe permitted to state a new basis for its claim for refund in a summary judgment brief \nto the ALJ at the contested case stage of the proceedings.  The Court concludes that \nRailroad Friction is not be permitted to do so. \n54. The statutory provisions governing a claim for refund by a taxpayer are \ncontained in G.S. §§ 105-241.6–16.  To seek a refund, a taxpayer must file an amended \nreturn or a “claim for refund.”  G.S. § 105 -241.7(b).  The statute does not define the \nterm “claim for refund,” and neither party has provided any authority clarifying the \ndifference, if any, between an amended return and a claim for refund. 8  The \nDepartment is then required to take certain actions with regard to the claim for \nrefund within six months after receipt of the claim.  G.S. § 105-241.7(c).  The actions \ninclude denying the claim and issuing a notice of propose d denial.  G.S. § 105 -\n241.7(c)(3).  The statute further provides that “[t]he statement o f the basis of the \ndenial does not limit the Department from changing the basis .”  G.S. § 105 -\n241.7(d)(1).   \n55. A taxpayer may request a review of a proposed denial pursuant to G.S. \n§ 105-241.11.  The request for review must be filed with the Department and “ must \n                                                 \n8 In this case, Railroad Friction filed the Amended Returns accompanied by a lengthy letter \nto the Department containing a detailed argument of Railroad Friction’s contention that it is \na public utility under G.S. § 105-130.4(a)(6).  The letter did not addr ess the affiliated \nindebtedness claim. \n \n \nbe in the form prescribed by the Secretary and include an explanation for the request \nfor review.”  G. S. § 105 -241.11(a).  Upon a request for review of a proposed denial, \n“the Department must conduct a review” and take action subject to the provisions of \nG.S. § 105-241.13.  “If . . . the Department and the taxpayer are unable to resolve the \ntaxpayer’s objection to the proposed denial, the Department must send the taxpayer \na notice of final determination concerning the refund.”  G.S. § 105 -241.14(a).  \nAdditionally, the statute provides that “[t] he statement of the basis for the \ndetermination does not limit the Department from changing the basis.”  Id. \n56. A taxpayer who wishes to have a final determination by the Department \nreviewed must “fil[e] a petition for a contested case hearing at [OAH] in accordance \nwith Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes. ”   G.S. § 105-241.15(a).  The \nfiling of a contested case petition initiates a distinct part of the administrative review \nprocess and is subject to certain statutory and procedural requirements under Article \n3 of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the North Carolina Rules of Civil \nProcedure that are not applicable at the Departmental review stage. \n57. First, a taxpayer filing a petition for contested case must comply with \nG.S. § 150B-23.  Under G.S. § 150B-23(a), a petition for contested case filed by a non-\nagency petitioner must “state facts tending to establish that the agency named as the \nrespondent has deprived the petitioner of property, has ordered the petitioner to pay \na fine or civil penalty, or has otherwise substantially prejudiced the petitioner’s rights \n. . . .”  The p etitioner also must state that the agency either: “(1) [e]xceeded its \nauthority or jurisdiction; (2) acted erroneously; (3) failed to use proper procedure; (4) \n \n \nacted arbitrarily or capriciously; or (5) failed to act as required  by law or rule.”  G.S. \n§ 150B-23(a).  In other words, to state a proper claim for relief under G.S. § 150B-23 \na non -agency petitioner must allege facts establishing that the agency acted \nimproperly.  Overcash v. N.C. Dep’t of Env’t & Natural Res., 179 N.C. App. 697, 704, \n635 S.E.2d 442, 447 (2006) ; Town of Wallace v. N.C. Dep’t of Env’t & Natural Res., \nDiv. of Water Quality, 160 N.C. App. 49, 56, 584 S.E.2d 809, 814–15 (2003). \n58. The ALJ assigned to a contested case may require the parties to file \nprehearing statements.  G.S. § 150B -23(a2).  The regulations regarding contested  \ncase proceedings provide, in relevant part, that  \n[t]he administrative law judge may serve all parties with \nan Order for Prehearing Statements together with, or after \nservice of, the Notice of Contested Case Filing and \nAssignment. The parties thus served shall, within 30 days \nof service, file the requested s tatements setting out the \nparty’s present position on the following:  \n \n(1) The nature of the proceeding and the issues to be \nresolved;  \n \n(2) A brief statement of the facts and reasons supporting \nthe party's position on each matter in dispute; \n \n . . . .   \n \n26 N.C.A.C. 3.0104.   Nowhere in Article 3 of the APA does it provide a taxpayer a \nright to unilaterally change the grounds, or assert new grounds, for its refund claim. \n59. Second, in a contested case proceeding, a  petitioner must comply with \nthe Rules of Civil Procedure .  26 N.C.A.C. 3.0101 (“The Rules of Civil Procedure as \ncontained in G.S. 1A-1 and the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District \nCourts as authorized by  G.S. 7A -34 and found in the Rules Volume of the North \n \n \nCarolina General Statutes shall apply in co ntested cases in the Office of \nAdministrative Hearings (OAH)”).  Under Rule 8(a), any pleading “which sets forth a \nclaim for relief” must contain “[a] short and plain statement of the claim sufficiently \nparticular to give the court and the parties notice of the transactions, occurrences, or \nseries of transactions or occurrences, intended to be proved showing that the pleader \nis entitled to relief . . . .”  In a contested case before OAH, the “pleadings” include the \npetition for contested case and the prehearing statement.  See Lee v. N.C. DOT, 175 \nN.C. App. 698, 703, 625 S.E.2d 567, 571 (2006) (construing whether the petitioner \nalleged a discrimination claim in a contested case before OAH and treating the \npetition and the prehearing statement as the relevant  pleadings).  A petitioner \nsufficiently states a claim pursuant to Rule 8(a) if it “gives the other party notice of \nthe nature and basis of the claim sufficient to enable the party to answer and prepare \nfor trial.”  Keys v. Duke Univ. , 112 N.C. App. 518, 5 20, 435 S.E.2d 820, 821 (1993)  \n(citation and quotations omitted).  Again, it is undisputed that Railroad Friction did \nnot state its claim for refund based on affiliated indebtedness in its Petition, Amended \nPetition, or Prehearing Statement. \n60. Additionally, Rule 15 applies to  the amendment of pleadings  in a \ncontested case proceeding, and provides the procedure by which a petitioner may add \nclaims or advance new, alternative theories.  Under Rule 15, amendments can be \naccomplished by right, by leave of court, or via an amendment to conform to the \nevidence.  Railroad Friction appears to argue that the Court should amend its petition \nto conform to the evidence it introduced to the Department during discovery.   (ECF \n \n \nNo. 28, at p. 4.)  Rule 15(b) amendments to conform to the evidence are generally \nmade during trial, “[w]hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by the express \nor implied consent of the parties . . . .”   A trial judge can allow amendments to conform \nto the evidence  (1) where the parties consent to trying issues not raised by the \npleadings, or (2) when the presentation of the merits is served by consideration of the \nevidence and the non -movant fails to convince the court that the admission of the \nevidence will prejudice the non -movant in maintaining his action or defense on the \nmerits.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(b).   But, where a party fails to  seek leave to add claims \nearlier in a proceeding and the non -movant does not expressly or impliedly consent \nto try the claim, a court may exercise its discretion to deny the amendment.   See \nFaucette v. 6303 Carmel Rd ., LLC , 242 N.C. App. 267, 277, 775 S.E .2d 316, 325 \n(2015).  Here, it is undisputed that the Department expressly objected to and refused \nto consent to Railroad Friction raising the claim for refund based on affiliated \nindebtedness when Railroad Friction raised it in its brief in support of its motion for \nsummary judgment submitted to the ALJ.  There was no consent to try the claim. \n61.   A thorough review of the statutory and regulatory requirements \napplicable to a claim for refund leads the Court to conclude that Railroad Friction’s \nright to “chang[e] the basis” of its refund claim as provided in G.S. § 105-241.7 applies \nonly during the d epartmental review of its claim for refund.  Once a final \ndetermination is issued by the Department and a contested case proceeding is \ncommenced with OAH pursuant to G.S. § 241.15 and G.S. § 150B -23, Railroad \nFriction’s right to change or raise additional bases for its refund claim is limited by  \n \n \nthe statutory provisions of Article 3 of the APA and the Rules of Civil Procedure.  Any \nother reading of the statutes would render meaningless the requirements that the \nparties file certain pleadings with the OAH in a contested case proceeding and that \nthe Rules of Civil Procedure be applied during the proceedings.  The contested case \nprocedure is structure d very much like a civil lawsuit filed in the General Court of \nJustice.  The contested case process marks the end of the investigative review process \nand the beginning of an adversarial proceeding in front of a fact finder, and provides \nfor discovery, moti ons practice, and a final adjudicatory decision at the \nadministrative level.  It is reasonable that the  completion of the  less formal \ninvestigative phase of the administrative review process within the Department, and \nthe initiation of the adversarial admi nistrative lawsuit phase of the process, would \nmark the end of the parties’ ability to unilaterally change their positions without a \nmore formal, proper notice of the claims at issue  permitted by the hearing officer in \nher discretion. \n62. The statutory structu re of the administrative review process support s \nsuch a conclusion.  All references to a taxpayer’s ability to change the basis for its \nclaim, and the Department’s ability to change the basis for the grounds for an \nassessment against a taxpayer, are contai ned in the statutory provisions applicable \nto the d epartmental review process .  See G.S. §§ 1 05-241.7(b)(2), 241.7(d)(1), \n241.9(c)(1), 241.14(a), and 241.14(b)(1).  The statutes providing for a contested case \nhearing contain no reference to a taxpayer being permitted to change the basis for its \nrefund claim.  Rather, the Rules of Civil Procedure apply and control, and any change \n \n \nof the basis for a taxpayer’s refund claim must be accomplished through amendment \nof the pleadings.   \n63. A review of the record reveals that Railroad Friction did not raise the \nclaim for affiliated indebtedness at any time in the departmental review or contested \ncase phases of this case.  Railroad Friction’s 2011 Amended Return, and the letter \nwhich accompanied it, failed to give adequate notice to the Department that it sought \nreview of the affiliated indebtedness issue.  The only explanation Railroad Friction \nprovided for the Amended Ret urns was that it sought use of the single-factor \napportionment formula applicable to public utilities.  ( Rec., at pp. 1459–65, 1549, \n1620, 1696.)  The Department’s Notice of D enial denied Railroad Friction’s refund \nrequest and relied solely on the Department’s conclusion that Railroad Friction did \nnot qualify as a public utility.  (Id. at pp. 807–08.) \n64. Railroad Friction requested a d epartmental review of  the Notice of \nDenial, but  only objected to the Department’s conclusion that it was not a public \nutility.  (Id. at p. 809.)  Railroad Friction never asked the Department to consider the \nissue of affiliated indebtedness.  Therefore, the Department’s Final Determination  \nagain addressed only the public utility issue.  (Id. at pp. 42–45.) \n65. After receiving the Final Determination from the Department, Railroad \nFriction filed with OAH its Petition, Amended Petition, and Prehearing Statement.  \nThe only issue Railroad Friction asked OAH to review in each of the pleadings was \nwhether the Department erred in concluding it was not a public utility for corporate \nand franchise tax purposes.  (Id. at pp. 1–5, 20–34.)  None of the pleadings alleged an \n \n \nalternative theory for refund based on affiliated inde btedness.  Railroad Friction  \nnever moved to amend the Petition, Amended Petition, or P rehearing Statement to \ninclude the claim for affiliated indebtedness at any time during the contested case \nproceeding.  The first time Railroad Friction raised the issue of affiliated \nindebtedness was in its brief in support of its motion for summary judgment at OAH.  \n(Id. at pp. 68 –86.)  The Department objected to OAH’s consideration of the issue \nbecause Railroad Friction failed to raise it in its pleadings and did not provide notice \nthat the alternative basis was before OAH for consideration.  (Id. at p. 910.)   \n66. Railroad Friction contends that the ALJ should have found that it \nproperly raised the affiliated indebtedness claim by providing discovery responses to \nthe Department during the contested case proceeding that raised the issue, including, \nfor the first time, producing new, amended returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 \nrecalculating Railroad Friction’s affiliated indebtedness for those two years.   (ECF \nNo. 26, at p. 10.)  The Court disagrees.  First, the fact that Railroad Friction provided \nthe new amended returns and discovery responses regarding the affiliated \nindebtedness claim raises the substantial question as to why Railroad Friction did \nnot properly attempt to amend its Amended Petition or Prehearing Statement to raise \nthe claim.9  Second, providing information during discovery is not a substitute for \n                                                 \n9 It also raises the question of whether Railroad Friction’s claims for refund based on \naffiliated indebtedness for tax year 2012 and 2013 could ever be considered at the contested \ncase stage when they were not presen ted to the Department at any time during the \nDepartmental review phase.  Review by contested case under G.S. § 150B-23(a) is predicated \non the taxpayer claiming that the Department “(1) [e]xceeded its authority or jurisdiction; (2) \n[a]cted erroneously; (3) [f]ailed to use proper procedure; (4) [a]cted arbitrarily or capriciously; \nor (5) [f]ailed to act as required by law or rule.”  To satisfy this prerequisite to relief regarding \nthe 2012 and 2013 tax years,  Railroad Friction would have to make the illogica l argument \n \n \nproperly pleading a claim as required by G.S. § 150B-23(a) and Rule 8(a).  In fact, it \nis one of the functions of Rule 15(b) to permit the Court to prevent a party from being \nforced to try claims of which it was not properly notified without that party’s consent.  \nIn this case , the Department objected to adjudicating the affiliated indebtedness \nclaim when first expressly raised in the proceeding at the summary judgment stage, \nand the ALJ properly exercised his discretion in denying an amendment at that time.   \n67.   In light of the above, Railroad Friction failed to allege facts supporting \na claim for relief based on  affiliated indebtedness as required by G.S. § 150B -23(a) \nand Rule 8(a).  Therefore, the Court concludes that  the Final D ecision of OAH \ngranting summary judgment to the Department on Railroad Friction’s refund request \nbased on affiliated indebtedness, and denying Railroad Friction’s motion for summary \njudgment, should be AFFIRMED, and Railroad Friction’s Petition for Judicial Review \nshould be DENIED.  \nIII. CONCLUSION \n68. For the reasons set forth above, the Court  concludes that the \nadministrative law judge properly determined that Railroad Friction is not a public \nutility entitled to single-factor tax apportionment, and properly concluded that \nRailroad Friction’s affiliated indebtedness basis for its refund claim was not properly \nbefore OAH with notice to the Department as required by G.S. § 150B-23(a) and Rule \n                                                 \nthat the Department acted improperly by failing to consider an issue that Railroad Friction \nnever expressly presented to it  prior to the Final Determination .  It was Railroad Friction \nwho allegedly miscalculated affiliated indebtedness in its or iginal returns, and in its 2012 \nand 2013 Amended Returns, and Railroad Friction never raised the issue to the Department \nduring the Departmental Review phase.  It would make no sense to permit the company to \nseek review of an issue on which the Department never ruled.   \n \n \n8(a).  Accordingly, the Court  holds that the administrative law judge did not err in \ngranting summary judgment in favor of the Department , and denying summary \njudgment to Railroad Friction  and in upholding the Department’s Final \nDetermination of February 9, 2017 .  Accordingly, Railroad Friction’s Petition for \nJudicial Review is DENIED. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 21st day of February, 2019. \n \n  /s/ Gregory P. McGuire \n     Gregory P.
