Ross (“Ross”), Douglas Elliot (“Elliot”), James Gibbs (“Gibbs”), and Gerald F. \nWright’s (“Wright”) (collectively the “Defendants” or “appraisers”) Motions for \nSummary Judgment (“Defendants’ Motions”).  After considering the parties’ \nmotions and briefs, and the arguments made by counsel during a hearing before \nthis Court on October 5, 2011, the Court GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS Defendants’ Motions. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{2} This action is a consolidation of two cases filed in McDowell County, \nNorth Carolina that deal with Plaintiffs’ 1 purchases of real estate in the residential \ndevelopment known as Wild Ridges at Morgan Creek (“Wild Ridges”). \n {3} The first case (“Cabrera Case”), 09 CVS 544, was filed on June 23, \n2009; designated as a mandatory complex business case on July 28, 2009; and \nassigned to this Court on July 29, 2009.  (Compl. p. 29; Desig. Order 1; Assign. \nOrder 2.)  The second case (“Mark Case”), 09 CVS 1062, was filed on November 16, \n2009; designated as a mandatory complex business case on December 17, 2009; \nassigned to the Honorable Ben F. Tennille on December 18, 2009; and reassigned to \nthis Court on February 23, 2010.  (Compl. p. 18; Desig. Order 1; Assign. Order 2.) \n {4} Plaintiffs’ initial Complaints alleged claims against the developer of \nWild Ridges, the lenders that extended financing to each Plaintiff (Bank of America \nCorp.; Branch Banking & Trust Company; Fifth Third Bank , N.A., as successor in \ninterest to First Charter Bank, N.A.; United Community Bank, N.A.; Wachovia \nBank, N.A.; and Flagstar Bank, F.S.B. (collectively the “lenders”)), and the \nappraisers who performed appraisals on lots financed by the lenders and purchased \nby Plaintiffs (Defendants Hensley, Ross, Eide, Van Dyke, Oakman, Highsmith, \nWright, and Unknown Appraisers 1–7). \n                                                 \n1 Unless indicated otherwise, the Court’s reference to “Plaintiffs” refers to all Plaintiffs in \nboth the 09 CVS 544 action and the 09 CVS 1062 action.  \n{5} Defendants Gibbs, Elliott, and Hollifield were not added as Defendants \nin the Cabrera Case until Plaintiffs properly filed an Amended Complaint on July 6, \n2010. \n{6} Shortly after these cases were designated to the Business Court, the \nChapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee for Wild Ridges filed a Suggestion of Bankruptcy for \nthe developer of Wild Ridges.  As a result, Plaintiffs’ claims against the developer \nwere stayed, and the Court proceeded with Plaintiffs’ claims against the lenders \nand the Defendants.  On January 26, 2010, and March 22, 2010, the Court entered \nOrders in the Cabrera and Mark Cases respectively, that dismissed all of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the lenders, leaving open only the claims against the appraisers.  \nCabrera v. Hensley , No. 09 CVS 544 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 26, 2010) (order granting \nlender defendants’ motions to dismiss); Mark v. Wachovia Bank, N.A. , 09 CVS 1062 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 22, 2010) (order granting lender defendants’ motions to \ndismiss). \n{7} On March 23, 2010, the Court entered an Order consolidating the \nCabrera Case and the Mark Case for all purposes including discovery, pre-trial \nmotions, and trial.  The parties proceeded with discovery, and Defendants’ Motions \nwere filed prior to the Court’s May 2, 2011, post-discovery deadline.  Plaintiffs filed \nresponses to Defendants’ Motions, and all Defendants, except Defendant Gibbs, \nfiled Replies in Support of Defendants’ Motions.  This Court held a hearing on \nDefendants’ Motions on October 5, 2011.  \nII. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n {8 } Summary judgment is improper where findings of fact are necessary to \nresolve an issue of material fact.  Collier v. Collier , 204 N.C. App. 160, 161–162, 693 \nS.E.2d 250, 252 (2010) (citing Hyde Ins. Agency v. Dixie Leasing Corp. , 26 N.C. App. \n138, 142, 215 S.E.2d 162, 164–165 (1975)).  However, for the aid of the parties and \nthe courts, the trial court may provide a summary of material facts that it finds to \nbe uncontroverted in deciding the motion.  Id.  The following facts are undisputed in \nthe record. \n {9} Land Resource Group, Inc. (“Land Resources Group”), a Georgia \ncorporation with its registered offices in Raleigh, North Carolina, developed and \nmarketed Wild Ridges through its various affiliates and collected real estate \ncommissions from the sale of lots to Plaintiffs.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35–36.) \n {10}   Wild Ridges was planned and marketed as an upscale gated \nresidential community that would include common amenities such as an exclusive \nclubhouse, hot tub facilities, swimming pool, resident gardening areas, hiking trails, \nand other luxury common areas.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 62–63.) \n {11} When Plaintiffs purchased their lots in Wild Ridges, roads were \nbeginning to be cut, paving had not begun, few lots had been cleared, and the \ninterior of the development was largely inaccessible except by all-terrain vehicle.  \n(Defs. Van Dyke and Hensley’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3; see e.g. , D. Nelson Dep. \nat 17:9–13, 20:14–21:22, 34:24–35:4.)  Many of the Plaintiffs were entertained by \nthe developer in nearby Asheville, North Carolina, and taken for tours of the \nundeveloped Wild Ridges property.  (Defs. Van Dyke and Hensley’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nSumm. J. 3; see e.g. , Dawn Blitsch Dep. at 37:16–38:12.)  \n {12} Each Plaintiff executed a purchase agreement with the developer for \nthe purchase of a lot at Wild Ridges.  Only Plaintiffs Richard and Jeri Skelton’s \npurchase agreement contained a financing and appraisal contingency that would \nhave relieved the Skeltons of thier obligation to complete the purchase of their Wild \nRidges lot if they were unable to secure financing through a lender, or if the lot \nappraised below a predetermined amount.  (R. Skelton Dep. at 46:11–15, 47:19–\n21.) 2  \n {13} After the purchase agreements were executed, Plaintiffs secured, \nthrough lenders of their choice, financing for the purchase of lots at Wild Ridges.  \nPlaintiffs’ lenders contracted with the Defendants to perform appraisals for the \nbenefit of the lenders.  (Defs. Van Dyke and Hensley’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  \nPlaintiffs do not contend that Defendants’ appraisals were for the direct benefit of \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs Richard and Jeri Skelton voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice on \nJune 30, 2011.  (Pls. Richard and Jeri Skelton’s Notice of Vol. Dismissal with Prej. 1–2.) \nanyone other than the lenders.  Each Defendant included representations in their \nappraisals, testified at deposition, or contended by way of affidavit that the lender \nwas the only intended user of the appraisal.  (Van Dyke Dep. at 97:1–98:13; Hensley \nDep. at 44:4–45:2; R. Keith Hollifield Dep. at 9:3–12; Nelson Eide Dep. at 45:3–19; \nJames H. Gibbs Dep. at 9: 5–12; Defs. Ross and Elliott’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 11–12; \nDef. Wright’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 5; Defs. Highsmith and Oakman’s Mot. Summ J. \nAff. A & B ¶ 6.) \n {14} Plaintiffs did not review, or have access to, the final appraisals of their \nlots prior to signing purchase agreements to buy property in Wild Ridges, and only \ntwo Plaintiffs received copies of the appraisals of their property prior to closing. 3  In \nfact, some Plaintiffs did not see the appraisal of their property, or learn of the \nappraised value, until giving their pre-trial deposition.  ( E.g. , Darren Blitsch Dep. \nat 15:10–14, 16:7–14; Dawn Blitsch Dep. at 94:17–25; S. Cecchin Dep. at 52:8–16; T. \nCecchin Dep. at 32:6–11; Lendin Dep. at 31:16–32:2; Mallett Dep. at 60:4–6; B. \nNelson Dep. at 18:23–19:1; Perla Dep. at 59:11–16; Sherman Dep. at 77:1–10, \n77:22–78:7; J. Skelton Dep. at 24:24–25:2.)                 \n {15} In late 2008, the development of Wild Ridges stopped, Land Resources \nGroup closed its sales office and shut down operations, and to date, no further \ndevelopment or construction has occurred in Wild Ridges.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 73.) \n {16} Plaintiffs assert claims for professional negligence, fraud in the \ninducement, and unfair and deceptive trade practices against Defendants.  (Am. \nCompl. 29–31.) \nIII.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n{17} The purpose of summary judgment is to determine whether any issues \nof material fact exist, and if there are none, to eliminate the necessity of a full trial \nwhere only questions of law are involved.  Strickland v. Lawrence , 176 N.C. App. \n                                                 \n3 Plaintiffs Christopher and Sophie Ondrus (“Ondrus Plaintiffs”) testified at deposition that \nthey received a copy of the appraisal prior to closing and briefly reviewed the report.  \nPlaintiffs do not present, nor forecast the presentation of, any evidence showing that the \nOndrus Plaintiffs received the appraisal prior to their execution of the purchase agreement.     \n656, 661, 627 S.E.2d 301, 305, disc. rev. denied , 360 N.C. 544, 633 S.E.2d 472 (2006) \n(citing Foster v. Winston-Salem Joint Venture , 303 N.C. 636, 641–42, 281 S.E.2d 36, \n40 (1981)).  “The movant has the burden of establishing the absence of any triable \nissues of fact.”  Id.   This burden can be met in one of two ways: “(1) ‘by proving an \nessential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at \ntrial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense’; or (2) ‘by showing through \ndiscovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential \nelement of her claim.’” Id.  (quoting Dobson v. Harris , 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d \n829, 835 (2000)). \n{18} “In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, ‘the court may consider \nthe pleadings, depositions, admissions, affidavits, answers to interrogatories, oral \ntestimony[,] and documentary materials.’”  Id.  (quoting Dendy v. Watkins , 288 N.C. \n447, 452, 219 S.E.2d 214, 217 (1975)).    \nIV. \nANALYSIS \nA. \nSTATUTE OF LIMITATIONS \n {19} Defendants Hollifield, Elliott, and Gibbs all argue that certain \nPlaintiffs who brought claims against them for professional negligence are barred \nby the applicable statute of limitations. 4  The varying procedural postures of each \nPlaintiff prompt the Court to address Plaintiffs’ claims individually. \n1. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n {20} North Carolina has established a three-year statute of limitations for \nclaims of professional negligence.  N.C.  G EN . S TAT . §§ 1–52(1)-(5) (2012).  “A cause of \naction based on negligence accrues when the wrong giving rise to the right to bring \nsuit is committed, even though the damages at that time be nominal and the \n                                                 \n4 Defendant Hollifield argues that Plaintiffs David and Daiva Stratton (“Stratton \nPlaintiffs”) are barred by the statute of limitations, Defendant Elliot argues that Plaintiff \nRita Bhat (“Bhat”) is barred by the statute of limitations, and Defendant Gibbs argues that \nPlaintiffs Barry and Deborah Nelson (“Nelson Plaintiffs”) are barred by the statute of \nlimitations. \ninjuries cannot be discovered until a later date.”  Harrold v. Dowd , 149 N.C. App. \n777, 781, 561 S.E.2d 914, 918 (2002) (citing Pierson v. Buyher , 101 N.C. App. 535, \n537, 400 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1991)). \n{21} Claims included in an amended pleading relate back to the filing of the \noriginal pleading when the original pleading gives sufficient “notice of the \ntransactions, occurrences, or series of transactions or occurrences, to be proved \npursuant to the amended pleading.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(c).   \n{22} Rule 15(c) deals with the relation back of claims, not parties: \nNowhere in the rule is there a mention of parties.  It speaks of claims \nand allows the relation back of claims  if the original claim gives notice \nof the transactions or occurrences to be proved pursuant to the \namended pleading.  When the amendment seeks to add a party-\ndefendant or substitute a party-defendant to the suit, the required \nnotice cannot occur.  As a matter of course, the original claim cannot \ngive notice of the transactions or occurrences to be proved in the \namended pleading to a defendant who is not aware of his status as \nsuch when the original claim is filed.  We hold that [Rule 15(c)] does \nnot apply to the naming of a new party-defendant to the action. It is \nnot authority for the relation back of a claim against a new party.  \nCrossman v. Moore , 341 N.C. 185, 187, 459 S.E.2d 715, 717 (1995) (emphasis \nadded). \n {23} “An action may be commenced by ‘filing a complaint with the \ncourt’ or by ‘the \nissuance  of a summons’ and an order extending permission to \nfile.”  Beall v. Beall , 156 N.C. App. 542, 547, 577 S.E.2d 356, 360 (2003) \n(citing N.C. R. Civ. P. 3(a)) (emphasis in original).  \n2. \nCLAIM FOR PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE BROUGHT BY DAVID AND DAVIA \nSTRATTON  \n {24} David and Davia Stratton (“Stratton Plaintiffs”) attempted to add \nDefendant Hollifield as a party to this case on May 27, 2010, by filing an Amended \nComplaint without the Court’s permission.  Hensley , No. 09 CVS 544 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Aug. 24, 2010) (order granting Defendant Hollifield’s motion to dismiss).  \nEventually, the Stratton Plaintiffs filed a proper motion for leave to file an amended \ncomplaint, and the Court granted the motion on July 1, 2010.  An effective \nAmended Complaint was filed on July 6, 2010.  (Cabrera Am. Compl. pg. 32.)  \n{25} The facts alleged against Defendant Hollifield in the Amended \nComplaint focus on Hollifield’s appraisal of Lot # 162.  The Stratton Plaintiffs (the \nparties who purchased Lot # 162) allege, and Defendant Hollifield agrees, that \nHollifield performed the appraisal of Lot # 162 on June 22, 2007.  (Am. Compl. ¶ \n173; Defs. Eide and Hollifield’s Br. in Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 11.)  Defendant \nHollifield argues that because the Stratton Plaintiffs’ case against him did not \ncommence until the civil summons was issued on September 22, 2010, their claim \nfor professional negligence is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  In \ntheir response, the Stratton Plaintiffs do not contest the issuance date of the \nsummons, therefore, the Court accepts Defendant’s assertion as an undisputed fact.  \n(See Pls.’ Resps. Defs.’ Mots. Summ. J.)  \n {26}   The Stratton Plaintiffs were parties to the original Cabrera Case filed \non June 23, 2009, and alleged in the Complaint a claim for professional negligence \nagainst “Unknown Appraiser #5.”  (Compl. ¶ 211.)  The substitution of Defendant \nHollifield in the Amended Complaint for “Unknown Appraiser # 5” attempts to \nidentify the previously unknown appraiser, and to have the professional negligence \nclaim relate back to the date when Plaintiffs filed the original Complaint.   \n{27} A cause of action for professional negligence would have accrued “when \nthe wrong giving rise to the right to bring suit [wa]s committed, even though the \ndamages at that time [were] nominal and the injuries [could not] be discovered until \na later date.”   Harrold, 149 N.C. App. at 781, 561 S.E.2d at 918 (citation omitted).  \nIn this case, the “wrong” would have been the negligent appraisal of Lot # 162.  The \nAmended Complaint alleges that Defendant Hollifield’s negligent appraisal of Lot # \n162 was performed on June 22, 2007.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 173.)  Accordingly, at the \nlatest, the alleged “wrong” by Defendant Hollifield would have been completed by \nJune 22, 2007.  With the Stratton Plaintiffs’ cause of action for professional \nnegligence accruing on June 22, 2007, a claim must have been commenced against \nDefendant Hollifield by June 22, 2010.  N.C.  G EN . S TAT . §§ 1–52(1)-(5) (establishing \na three-year statute of limitations for claims of negligence).   \n{28} The Court finds the Stratton Plaintiffs’ argument that Rule 15(c) \ncontrols the relation back of parties, and allows for their professional negligence \nclaim to relate back to the initial filing of Plaintiffs’ original Complaint, to be \nunpersuasive.  As the North Carolina Supreme Court has repeatedly held, Rule 15 \n“does not apply to the naming of a new party-defendant to the action.  It is not \nauthority for the relation back of a claim against a new party.”  Crossman , 341 N.C. \nat 187, 459 S.E.2d at 717; Estate of Fennell v. Stephenson , 354 N.C. 327, 334–35, \n554 S.E.2d 629, 633–34 (2001); Brown v. Kindred Nursing Ctrs. East, LLC , 364 \nN.C. 76, 81–82, 692 S.E.2d 87, 91 (2010).   \n{29} As stated above, the court in Crossman  held that:  \n[w]hen the amendment seeks to add a party-defendant or substitute a \nparty-defendant to the suit, the required notice cannot occur. As a \nmatter of course, the original claim cannot give notice of the \ntransactions or occurrences to be proved in the amended pleading to a \ndefendant who is not aware of his status as such when the original \nclaim is filed.  \nCrossman , 341 N.C. at 187, 459 S.E.2d at 717. \n{30} Here, Plaintiffs did not commence their action against Defendant \nHollifield until they filed a proper Amended Complaint on July 6, 2010.  Beall , 156 \nN.C. App. at 547, 577 S.E.2d at 360 (citing N.C. R. Civ. P. 3(a)).  Because Plaintiffs \ndid not commence their action against Defendant Hollifield by June 22, 2010, their \nclaim for professional negligence is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  \nAccordingly, Defendant Hollifield’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to the \nStratton Plaintiffs’ claim for professional negligence is GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED and the Stratton \nPlaintiffs’ claim for professional negligence is hereby DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED with prejudice. \n3.  \nCLAIM FOR PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE BROUGHT BY RITA B HAT  \n {31} Plaintiffs attempted to add Defendant Elliott as a party to this case on \nMay 27, 2010, by filing an Amended Complaint without the Court’s permission.  In \nan Order entered September 1, 2010, this Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims against \nDefendant Elliott for insufficiency of process, but without prejudice for Plaintiffs to \nattempt to make timely service on Defendant Elliott.  Hensley , No. 09 CVS 544 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 1, 2010) (order granting Defendant Elliott’s motion to \ndismiss).  Eventually Plaintiffs filed an effective Amended Complaint and \nDefendant Elliot was added as a party to this case.    \n {32} In the Amended Complaint filed July 6, 2010, Plaintiff Bhat alleges \nthat on or about June 28, 2007, Defendant Elliott negligently performed an \nappraisal of Wild Ridges Lot # 225.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 178.)  A three-year statute of \nlimitations applies to claims of professional negligence, N.C.  G EN . S TAT . § 1–52(5), \nand a cause of action for professional negligence accrues “when the wrong giving \nrise to the right to bring suit [wa]s committed, even though the damages at that \ntime [were] nominal and the injuries [could not] be discovered until a later date.”   \nHarrold, 149 N.C. App. at 781, 561 S.E.2d at 918 (citation omitted).  In this case, \nthe “wrong” would have been the negligent appraisal of Lot # 225. \n {33} Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Elliott was professionally negligent in \nhis appraisal of Lot # 225.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs were required to bring any claim \nfor professional negligence against Defendant Elliot within three-years of June 28, \n2007, when Defendant Elliott allegedly performed the appraisal.  Because Plaintiffs’ \nattempted amendment of the Complaint was ineffective, Defendant was not \nproperly made a party to this action until Plaintiffs filed an effective Amended \nComplaint on July 6, 2010.  Because Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint was filed more \nthan three-years after the date on which the alleged wrong giving rise to Plaintiff \nBhat’s claim occurred, Plaintiffs’ claim is barred by the applicable statute of \nlimitations.   \n{34} As discussed above, the Court finds unpersuasive Plaintiffs’ argument \nthat Rule 15(c) allows for the claims brought against Defendant Elliott to relate \nback to the date on which Plaintiffs initially filed their Complaint.  Because \nPlaintiffs’ claim for professional negligence is barred by the applicable statute of \nlimitations, Defendant Elliott’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff \nBhat’s claim for professional negligence is GRANTEDGRANTED GRANTED GRANTED and Plaintiff Bhat’s claim for \nprofessional negligence is DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED with prejudice.  \n4. \nCLAIM FOR PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE BROUGHT BY PLAINT IFFS KEITH AND \nDIANE NELSON (“NELSON PLAINTIFFS”) \n {35} The Nelson Plaintiffs attempted to add Defendant Gibbs to this action \nby amending their Complaint on May 27, 2010.  In an Order entered on September \n9, 2010, the Court held that the attempted amendment was ineffective because \nPlaintiffs had failed to seek leave from the Court to amend their complaint. \nHensley , No. 09 CVS 544 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 9, 2010) (order granting Defendant \nGibbs’ motion to dismiss).  As a result, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst Defendant Gibbs, but without prejudice to Plaintiffs to attempt proper \namendment and service.  Plaintiffs eventually filed an effective Amended Complaint \non July 6, 2010, and a summons was issued for Defendant Gibbs on September 22, \n2010.   \n {36} In the Amended Complaint, the Nelson Plaintiffs allege that on or \nabout June 29, 2007, Defendant Gibbs negligently performed an appraisal of Lot # \n155.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 113.)  A cause of action for professional negligence accrues \n“when the wrong giving rise to the right to bring suit [wa]s committed, even though \nthe damages at that time [were] nominal and the injuries [could not] be discovered \nuntil a later date.”   \nHarrold, 149 N.C. App. at 781, 561 S.E.2d at 918 (citations \nomitted).  In this case, the “wrong” would have been the negligent appraisal of Lot # \n155.  In North Carolina there is a three-year statute of limitations for claims of \nprofessional negligence.  N.C.  G EN . S TAT . § 1–52(5).   \n {37} Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Gibbs was professionally negligent in \nhis appraisal of Lot # 155.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs must have brought a claim for \nprofessional negligence within three-years of June 29, 2007, when Defendant Gibbs \nallegedly performed the appraisal.  Because Plaintiffs attempted amendment was \nineffective, Defendant Gibbs was not properly made a party to this action until \nPlaintiffs filed an effective Amended Complaint on July 6, 2010. Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint was filed more than three years after the date on which the alleged \nwrong giving rise to the Nelson Plaintiffs’ claim occurred.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ \nclaim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.   \n{38} As previously stated, the Court finds unpersuasive the Nelson \nPlaintiffs’ argument that Rule 15(c) allows for the claims brought against \nDefendant Gibbs to relate back to the date on which Plaintiffs initially filed their \nComplaint.  Because Plaintiffs’ claim for professional negligence is barred by the \napplicable statute of limitations, Defendant Gibbs’ Motion for Summary Judgment \nas to the Nelson Plaintiffs’ claim for professional negligence is GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED and their \nclaim for professional negligence is DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED with prejudice. \nB. \nPROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE \n {39} Defendants advance three arguments for why they are entitled to \nsummary judgment on Plaintiffs’ remaining claims for professional negligence.  \nFirst, Defendants argue that under established case law they did not owe a legally \nrecognized duty to any of the Plaintiffs.  Second, Defendants argue in the \nalternative, that even if Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiffs, a claim for \nprofessional negligence requires that the Plaintiffs reasonably rely on the \nDefendants’ representations, and that in this case, none of the Plaintiffs actually or \njustifiably relied on any of the Defendants’ appraisals.  Lastly, Defendants Van \nDyke and Wright argue that the Plaintiffs who asserted claims for professional \nnegligence against them were contributorily negligent, and thus barred from \nrecovery. \n{40} Plaintiffs respond that the Defendant appraisers did owe a duty to \nthird parties who might have relied on their appraisals, and that, with regard to \nreliance, Plaintiffs need only show that “a defendant’s words or conduct possessed \n‘the tendency or capacity to mislead’ or create the likelihood of deception.”  (Pls.’ \nMem. in Opp’n Defs. Van Dyke & Hensley’s Mot. for Summ. J. 8 (citations omitted).) \n \n \n1. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n {41} For claims of negligence alleging that the Defendants made negligent \nmisrepresentations, North Carolina imposes on appraisers the standard of liability \nespoused in Restatement of Torts (Second) § 552.  Ballance v. Rinehart , 105 N.C. \nApp. 203, 206–08, 412 S.E.2d 106, 108–09 (1992) (stating that “[section] 552 . . . is \nthe appropriate standard under which to assess a real estate appraiser’s liability.”); \nWilliams v. United Cmty. Bank , No. COA11–532, 2012 N.C. App. LEXIS 209, at \n*16–17, 724 S.E.2d 543, 550 (N.C. App. 2012) (stating that when evaluating \nnegligence claims brought against appraisers by third parties, the North Carolina \nCourt of Appeals “expressly adopt[s] the approach for determining negligence by \naccountants as set forth by our Supreme Court in Raritan River Steel Co. v. Cherry, \nBekaert & Holland , 322 N.C. 200, 201, 367 S.E.2d 609, 610 (1988).”); Anderson v. \nCostal Cmtys. at Ocean Ridge Plantation, Inc. , 2012 NCBC 33 ¶¶ 47–63 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. May 30, 2012) (applying the standard of liability established in Ballance  \nand Raritan  to evaluate plaintiffs’ claims for negligent misrepresentation against \nappraisers). \n {42} The standard stated in section 552 was adopted by the North Carolina \nSupreme Court in \nRaritan as the standard of liability for accountants, and provides \nthat: \nInformation Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others   \n \n(1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, \nor in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, \nsupplies false information for the guidance of others in their business \ntransactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by \ntheir justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise \nreasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the \ninformation. \n \n(2) . . . [T]he liability stated in Subsection (1) is limited to loss suffered \n \n(a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit \nand guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the \nrecipient intends to supply it; and \n \n(b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the \ninformation to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a \nsubstantially similar transaction. \n \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 552 (1977). \n {43} In applying this more limited standard of liability to real estate \nappraisers, North Carolina’s courts recognized the potentially excessive liability \nthat might result if a reasonable forseeability test were applied to appraisers \nbecause “[l]ike an accountant, real estate appraisers have no control over the \ndistribution of their reports once rendered and therefore cannot limit their potential \nliability.”  \nBallance , 105 N.C. App. at 207, 412 S.E.2d at 109. \n {44} Even when the requisite relationship is present between plaintiff and \ndefendant, section 552 also requires the plaintiff to show reliance on the negligently \nprovided information.  Restatement (Second) of Torts § 552(1).  “One who, in the \ncourse of his business, . . . supplies false information for the guidance of others in \ntheir business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them \nby their justifiable reliance  upon the information.”  Id.  at § 552(1) (emphasis added).  \nJustifiable reliance requires that the plaintiff actually relied on the information.  \nRaritan , 322 N.C. at 206, 367 S.E.2d at 612 (“A party cannot show justifiable \nreliance on information . . . without showing that he relied upon the actual . . . \nstatements themselves to obtain this information.”); Anderson , 2012 NCBC 33 at ¶ \n62 (“[D]irect reliance is precisely what is required to state a claim against Appraiser \nDefendants.”)  \n2. \nDUTY \n {45} In evaluating Defendants’ first argument, the Court must first \ndetermine whether Defendants owed a duty to Plaintiffs.  Under section 552, \nliability can be imposed on those who “in the course of [their] business, profession or \nemployment, . . . suppl[y] false information for the guidance of others in their \nbusiness transactions . . . .”  Restatement (Second) of Torts § 552(1).  However, this \nliability is limited to loss suffered “by the person or one of a limited group of persons \nfor whose benefit and guidance [the appraiser] intends  to supply the information or \nknows  that the recipient intends to supply it . . . .”  Id.  at § 552(2)(a) (emphasis \nadded).  Stated plainly, an appraiser owes a duty to those who he intends to be the \nrecipients of an appraisal and those to whom he knows the intended recipient also \nintends to supply the appraisal.  See id.    \n {46} This interpretation of section 552’s limit on liability is bolstered by the \ncomments to the section that discuss to whom a surveyor of property would be liable \nfor providing a negligent survey of real estate. \nIn 1934, [Company A], a firm of surveyors, contracts with B to make a \nsurvey and description of B’s land.  [Company A] is not informed of any \nintended use of the survey report but knows that survey reports are \ncustomarily used in a wide variety of real estate transactions and that \nit may be relied upon by purchasers, mortgagees, investors and others. \nThe survey is negligently made and misstates the boundaries and \nextent of the land.  In 1958 C, relying upon the report that B exhibits \nto him, purchases the land from B, and in consequence suffers \npecuniary loss. [Company A] is not  liable to C.  \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 552 cmt. h, illus. 12 (emphasis added); \nsee also  \nHowell v. Betts , 211 Tenn. 134, 362 S.W.2d 924 (1962) (stating the factual and legal \nunderpinnings for illustration twelve’s result).  “It is not enough that the maker \nmerely knows of the ever-present possibility of repetition to anyone, and the \npossibility of action in reliance upon it, on the part of anyone to whom it may be \nrepeated.”  Id.  at cmt. h.  \n {47} It is undisputed in this case that each of the Defendants was hired by \nthe lending institution engaged by each Plaintiff to finance the purchase of property \nat Wild Ridges.  In addition, the appraisals themselves indicate that the lending \ninstitution was the “client/lender.” ( See e.g., Summ. Appraisal Report Lot 81 p. 1; \nSumm. Appraisal Report Lot 129 p. 1; Summ. Appraisal Report Lot 11 p. 1; Summ. \nAppraisal Report Lot 126 p. 1; Summ. Appraisal Report Lot 75 p. 1;  Summ. \nAppraisal Report Lot 42 p. 1.)  In addition, each Defendant testified at deposition, \nor offered by way of affidavit, that the lending institution was the only intended \nuser of the appraisal.  (Van Dyke Dep. at 97:1–98:13; Hensley Dep. at 44:4–45:2; R. \nKeith Hollifield Dep. at 9:3–12; Nelson Eide Dep. at 45:3–19; James H. Gibbs Dep. \nat 9:5–12; Defs. Ross and Elliott’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 11–12; Def. Wright’s Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. 5; Defs. Highsmith and Oakman’s Mot. Summ J. Aff. A & B ¶ 6.) \n {48} Plaintiffs do not argue that they were the intended recipients of the \nappraisals performed by Defendants, rather “that a reasonably foreseeable Plaintiff \nis known  to the Defendant.”  (Pls.’ Mem. Law Opp’n. Defs. Van Dyke and Hensley’s \nMots. Summ. J. 7.)  Plaintiffs contend that the Court should apply the duty \nenunciated by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in Alva v. Cloninger , and hold \n“that the appraiser’s duty to third parties include [sic] a prospective buyer, \nregardless of privity, who reasonably relies upon the outcome of the appraisal.”  \n(Pls.’ Mem. Law Opp’n. Defs. Van Dyke and Hensley’s Mots. Summ. J. 3 (citing Alva \nv. Cloninger , 51 N.C. App. 602, 277 S.E.2d 535 (1981).) \n{49} In Alva , the court cited to section 552 to support its holding that the \nappraiser defendants could be found liable because “plaintiffs’ reliance upon the \nappraisal was, or should reasonably have been, expected by defendant.”  Alva , 51 \nN.C. App. at 611, 277 S.E.2d at 541.  However, the Alva  court failed to quote section \n552 in its entirety.  While section 552 does ask whether plaintiffs’ reliance should \nhave been reasonably expected by the defendant, it also limits a defendant’s liability \nto “the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance \n[the appraiser] intends  to supply the information or knows  that the recipient \nintends to supply it . . . .”  Restatement (Second) of Torts § 552(2)(a) (emphasis \nadded).  In Raritan , the North Carolina Supreme Court clarified the above-stated \nlimits on liability under section 552, by rejecting the reasonable forseeability test \nadopted in Alva , and the North Carolina Court of Appeals subsequently applied \nRaritan ’s limits on liability to appraisers in both Ballance and Williams .  Marcus \nBros. Textiles, Inc. v. Price Waterhouse, LLP , 350 N.C. 214, 219, 513 S.E.2d 320, \n324 (1999) (stating that the “ Raritan  . . . Court ‘rejected as too expansive the \nposition that extends liability to all persons the accountant should reasonably \nforesee might obtain and rely on the information generated.’” (quoting David A. \nLogan & Wayne A. Logan, North Carolina Torts  § 25.30, at 549 (1996))).  \nAccordingly, this Court can not conclude that the reasoning or holdings articulated \nin Alva  regarding forseeability represent the current law of North Carolina to be \napplied to this case.    \n{50} Even if the North Carolina Supreme Court had not clarified the limits \nof liability in Raritan , Plaintiffs’ argument, that “a reasonably foreseeable Plaintiff \nis known,” (Pls.’ Mem. Law Opp’n. Defs. Van Dyke and Hensley’s Mots. Summ. J. \n7.), is irreconcilable with section 552 and its accompanying comments.  Comment h \nto section 552 provides:  \n[i]t is enough that the maker of the representation intends it to reach \nand influence either a particular person or persons, known to him, or a \ngroup or class of persons, distinct from the much larger class who \nmight reasonably be expected sooner or later to have access to the \ninformation and foreseeably to take some action in reliance upon it .  \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 552 cmt. h (emphasis added).  While comment h \naddresses section 552(2)(a)’s limit on liability to those whom the maker of a \nrepresentation intended to supply the information, its distinction between those \nwho are known and intended to rely on the information, and those who are part of \n“the much larger class who might reasonably be expected sooner or later to have \naccess to the information and foreseeably . . . take some action in reliance upon it,” \nsuggests that those who are reasonably foreseeable are not the same as those who \nare known.  \nSee id.    \n{51} Taken to its logical conclusion, Plaintiffs’ argument—that those who \nare reasonably foreseeable to the maker of a representation are also known to the \nmaker—would eviscerate the limits on liability enunciated by the Court in Raritan . \nA Defendant would not have to “know that the recipient intends” to supply another \nwith the information, rather, liability would be extended to all reasonably \nforeseeable individuals that the intended recipient, unbeknownst to the Defendant, \nintended to supply the information.  This interpretation would effectively write out \nthe knowledge requirement from section 552. \n {52} Looking to the undisputed facts of this case, the Court finds that no \nevidence has been presented, nor have Plaintiffs argued, that they were the \nintended recipients of the appraisals.  Accordingly, under section 552, to establish \nthat Defendants owed a duty, the Court must find that there exists some evidence \nthat Defendants knew the intended recipients (in this case the lending institutions \nthat hired Defendants to perform the appraisals) intended to supply Plaintiffs with \nthe appraisals for Plaintiffs’ use in the transaction for which Defendants were hired, \nor a substantially similar transaction.  See  § 552(2)(a)-(b).  Such evidence, however, \nis nowhere to be found.  At best, Plaintiffs argue that because “each and every \nappraisal performed by the Defendants identifies  the individual Plaintiffs as \nprospective borrowers[,] . . . each Plaintiff herein was a forseeably [sic] affected by \nthe appraisals.” (E.g. , Pls.’ Mem. Law Opp’n. Mots. Summ. J of Defs. Eide and \nHollifield 7 (emphasis in original).)  Raritan , Ballance , and Williams  all establish \nthat reasonable forseeability is not the test for determining liability under section \n552.  In addition, there is no evidence before the court demonstrating that \nDefendants knew the intended recipients (the lenders) intended to supply Plaintiffs \nwith the appraisals.  Accordingly, Defendants have met their burden of showing \nthat there is no evidence to support the duty element of Plaintiffs’ remaining claims \nfor professional negligence.   \n3. \nRELIANCE \n{53} Defendants’ second argument contends that even if Defendants owed a \nduty to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs must show that they reasonably relied on the \nDefendants’ representations to prove their claim of professional negligence.  \n“Justifiable reliance is an essential element of both fraud and negligent \nmisrepresentation.”  Helms v. Holland , 124 N.C. App. 629, 635, 478 S.E.2d 513, 517 \n(1996) (citing C.F.R. Foods, Inc. v. Randolph Dev. Co. , 107 N.C. App. 584, 588, 421 \nS.E.2d 386, 389, disc. rev. denied , 333 N.C. 166, 424 S.E.2d 906 (1992).  The \n“question of justifiable reliance is analogous to that of reasonable reliance in fraud \nactions,” Marcus Bros. Textiles, Inc. , 350 N.C. at 224, 513 S.E.2d at 327 (citation \nomitted), which is normally “a question for the jury, unless the facts are so clear \nthat they support only one conclusion.”  Forbis v. Neal , 361 N.C. 519, 527, 649 \nS.E.2d 382, 387 (2007) (citing Marcus Bros. Textiles, Inc. , 350 N.C. at 225, 513 \nS.E.2d at 327).  “Justifiable reliance requires actual reliance.  Raritan , 322 N.C. at \n206, 367 S.E.2d at 612.  North Carolina’s Pattern Jury Instructions recite, that \n“‘[a]ctual reliance is direct reliance upon false information.’”  Walker v. Town of \nStoneville , No. COA10–278, 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS 709, *15 (N.C. App. 2011) \n(quoting N.C.P.I. - Civil 800.10 (1992)) (alteration in original).  “[A] party cannot \nshow justifiable reliance on information contained in [an appraisal] without \nshowing that he relied upon the actual [appraisal itself] to obtain this information.”  \nRaritan , 322 N.C. at 206, 367 S.E.2d at 612.   \n{54}  After reviewing the pleadings, contentions of counsel, and all the \nevidence presented to the Court in support of, and opposition to, Defendants’ \nMotions, the Court finds it undisputed that Plaintiffs did not rely on the \nDefendants’ appraisals when they entered into their respective purchase \nagreements to purchase property at Wild Ridges.  The evidence instead shows that \neach Plaintiff executed a purchase agreement to buy a lot at Wild Ridges prior to \nsecuring financing, and before an appraisal was performed on the purchased lot. 5  \n                                                 \n5 (see Darren Blitsch Dep. at 15:10–14 (stating that Plaintiff never reviewed the appraisals \nperformed on either of the lots he purchased); Dawn Blitsch Dep. at 94:17–25 (stating that \nPlaintiff never reviewed the appraisal performed on the lot purchased by Plaintiff); \nCunningham Dep. at 49:24–50:12, 53:7–18 (stating that Plaintiff never saw the appraisal \nprior to closing); S.

Sauchak Dep. at \n50:8–51:2, 51:21–52:3, 77:25–78:4 (stating that Plaintiff did not remember receiving the \nappraisal before signing the lot purchase agreement); L.

Mots. \nSumm. J. of Defs. Eide and Hollifield 9.)  This argument fails for two primary \nreasons.

McCormick Dep. at \n119:12–120:10 (stating that Plaintiff did not recall when he received the appraisal); C. \nMcCormick Dep. at 43:18–25 (stating that Plaintiff thought that she received the appraisal \nwith the closing paperwork); Bhat Dep. at 115:7–24 (stating that Plaintiff did not receive \nthe appraisal until after closing); K. Nelson Dep. at 36:19–37:5 (stating that Plaintiff never \nreceived a copy of the appraisal prior to closing and did not receive the appraisal until \nsometime in 2010); D.

Best Dep. at 56:6–11 \n(stating that Plaintiff thought that he received the appraisal after closing); L. Best Dep. at \n19:21–20:6 (stating that Plaintiff did not know when she received the appraisal and that \nshe never looked at it).)  \nappraised the lots differently, [p]laintiffs would still have been obligated to \npurchase them at the prices agreed to in the purchase contracts.”)   \n{56} Secondly, Plaintiffs’ argument indicates that, in addition to \noveremphasizing the significance of the closing process, they also relied on the \nactions of the bank, rather than the appraisals, to determine whether to proceed \nwith purchasing the property, i.e., with closing.  Plaintiffs stated in their responses \nthat the appraisals: \nwere performed as a predicate to financing, and [that Plaintiffs] would \nnot have gone through with these transactions in each instance had in \n[sic] not been for the appraisals. . . .  Thus, at the most fundamental \nlevel of intuition, there are no lender financed real estate closings at \nall without supporting appraisals.  And without financing, there is no \nclosing. . . . [T]his is a matter of general knowledge to the layperson, \nand it follows that [Plaintiffs] would never have incurred the massive \ndebt each owes had it not been for the appraisals.  \n(\nE.g. , Pls.’ Resp. Mots. Summ. J. of Defs. Eide and Hollifield 9–10.)  Essentially, \nPlaintiffs argue that if they had not received lender financing, then they would not \nhave incurred the debt that they now owe.   \n{57} Ignoring for a moment that Plaintiffs were obligated to pay upon \nexecution of their respective purchase agreements, Plaintiffs’ argument suggests \nthat because the appraisals indicated an artificially inflated value of the property, \nthe banks believed they had sufficient collateral to finance the loans they eventually \napproved, and because the banks financed Plaintiffs’ loans, Plaintiffs decided to \nclose on their property purchases.  Plaintiffs’ argument is that in reaching a \ndecision about whether the property was a good investment or was properly \nappraised, Plaintiffs used the banks as a proxy and relied on the banks’ decisions to \napprove financing rather than the appraisals.  This is exactly the type of indirect \nreliance that the North Carolina Supreme Court rejected in Raritan , “[A] party \ncannot show justifiable reliance on information contained in [an appraisal] without \nshowing that he relied upon the actual [appraisal itself] to obtain this information.”  \nRaritan , 322 N.C. at 206, 367 S.E.2d at 612.  Accordingly, the Court holds that \nPlaintiffs’ self-proclaimed reliance on the actions of the banks rather than the \ncontent of the appraisals, is insufficient to meet the justifiable reliance element of \nnegligent misrepresentation.  Id. ; see also Brinkman v. Barrett Kays & Assocs., \nP.A. , 155 N.C. App. 738, 743, 575 S.E.2d 40, 44 (2003) (stating that plaintiffs’ \nreliance on a governmental agency’s decision to issue a permit was not the kind of \nactual reliance required by law when there was no evidence to show that the \nrepresentations were made to plaintiffs).   \n{58} Because the Court holds that: (1) Defendants did not owe a duty to \nPlaintiffs and (2) Plaintiffs did not justifiably rely on Defendants’ appraisals, \nDefendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment as to this claim must be GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED \nand Plaintiffs’ claim for professional negligence is hereby DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED with \nprejudice.   \n{59} Having held that there was no duty or justifiable reliance, the Court \ndoes not reach Defendants’ arguments that certain Plaintiffs were contributorily \nnegligent. \nC. \nFRAUD IN THE INDUCEMENT  \n {60} Defendants offer a number of arguments in support of their Motions \nfor Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs’ claim for fraud in the inducement.  \nSpecifically, Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because: \n(1) no evidence has been produced to show that Defendants intended to deceive \nPlaintiffs, (2) Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged misrepresentations were \nmaterial facts, (3) Plaintiffs could not have reasonably relied on Defendants’ \nappraisals because there was no actual reliance, (4) Defendants did not make any of \nthe alleged misrepresentations at issue in this case to any of the Plaintiffs, and (5) \nthere was no evidence that Plaintiffs were actually deceived.  (Br. Supp. Mot for \nSumm. J. of Defs. Van Dyke and Hensley 7–10, 11–13; Defs. Eide and Hollifield’s \nMem. Supp. Summ. J. 12–13; Defs. Highsmith and Oakman’s Mem. Law Supp. Mot. \nSumm.

J. 14–16.)     \n{61} Plaintiffs respond to some of Defendants’ arguments, but not all.  \nIgnoring arguments 1, 4, and 5, Plaintiffs instead argue that Defendants’ Motions \nfor Summary Judgment should be denied because: (a) (in response to Defendants’ \nsecond argument) statements of opinion that are known to be contrary to the facts \nmay be actionable, Defendants are licensed by the state and subject to the Uniform \nStandards of Appraisal Practice, and Defendants were not able to produce any \nexamples of “nixed real-estate closings”; and (b) (in response to Defendants’ third \nargument) that reliance is a factual issue to be determined by the jury rather than \nat summary judgment.

Eide and \nHollifield 2, 10–11.) \n{62} “‘The essential elements of fraud [in the inducement] are: (1) [f]alse \nrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to \ndeceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting \nin damage to the injured party.’”  Media Network, Inc. v. Long Haymes Carr, Inc. , \n197 N.C. App. 433, 453, 678 S.E.2d 671, 684 (2009) (quoting Rowan County Bd. of \nEduc. v. U.S. Gypsum Co.,  332 N.C. 1, 17, 418 S.E.2d 648, 658 (1992)) (alteration in \noriginal) (adopting the elements of fraud as the elements for fraud in the \ninducement).  In addition, “[j]ustifiable reliance is an essential element of both \nfraud and negligent misrepresentation.”  Helms v. Holland , 124 N.C. App. at 635, \n478 S.E.2d at 517 (citing C.F.R. Foods, Inc. , 107 N.C. App. at 588, 421 S.E.2d at 389 \n(stating that a plaintiff’s reliance must be reasonable to prove fraud)).   \n{63} The “question of justifiable reliance is analogous to that of reasonable \nreliance in fraud actions,” Marcus Bros. Textiles, Inc. , 350 N.C. at 224, 513 S.E.2d \nat 327, which is normally “a question for the jury, unless the facts are so clear that \nthey support only one conclusion.”  Forbis , 361 N.C. at 527, 649 S.E.2d at 387 (citing \nMarcus Bros. Textiles, Inc. , 350 N.C. at 225, 513 S.E.2d at 327).  “Justifiable \nreliance requires actual reliance.  Raritan , 322 N.C. at 206, 367 S.E.2d at 612.  \nNorth Carolina’s Pattern Jury Instructions recite that ‘[a]ctual reliance is direct \nreliance upon false information.’”  Walker , 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS 709, *15 (2011) \n(quoting N.C.P.I. - Civil 800.10 (1992)) (alteration in original).  “[A] party cannot \nshow justifiable reliance on information contained in [an appraisal] without \nshowing that he relied upon the actual [appraisal itself] to obtain this information.”  \nRaritan , 322 N.C. at 206, 367 S.E.2d at 612.  In addition, “an essential element of \nactionable fraud is that the false representation or concealment be made to the \nparty acting thereon. ”  Hospira Inc. v. AlphaGray Corp. , 194 N.C. App. 695, 699, \n671 S.E.2d 7, 11 disc. review denied , 363 N.C. 581, 682 S.E.2d 210 (2009) (stating \nthat, absent an agency or fiduciary relationship, summary judgment was \nappropriate when the only evidence presented showed that defendant made \nrepresentations to a third-party and not plaintiff.) (emphasis in original). \n{64} Generally, the Court must also find that the representation upon \nwhich a fraud claim rests is “definite and specific,” and involves “[a] subsisting or \nascertainable fact, as distinguished from a matter of opinion or representation \nrelating to future prospects[.]” Ragsdale v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, 139, 209 S.E.2d \n494, 500 (1974) (citing Berwer v. Ins., 214 N.C. 554, 200 S.E. 1 (1938)).  However, \nthe general rule that liability is not imposed for an expression of opinion is:  \n“not a hard and fast rule; . . . it does not apply to the dishonest \nexpression of an opinion not actually entertained. . . .  [Thus,] a \nstatement purporting to be opinion may be the basis for fraud if, at the \ntime it is made, the maker of the statement holds an opinion contrary \nto the opinion he or she expresses, and the maker also intends to \ndeceive the listener.”    \nLeftwich v. Gaines , 134 N.C. App. 502, 508–09, 521 S.E.2d 717, 723 (1999) (quoting \n37 C.J.S. Fraud  § 13, at 190 (1997)) (first two alterations in original). \n {65} After reviewing the pleadings, contentions of counsel, and all of the \nevidence which was presented to the Court in support of, and in opposition to, \nDefendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court finds that: (1) it is \nundisputed that Plaintiffs did not rely on the Defendants’ appraisals when they \nentered into their respective purchase agreements to purchase property at Wild \nRidges, and (2) none of the representations at issue in this case were made by \nDefendants to any of the Plaintiffs. \n{66} As previously noted, Plaintiffs all executed purchase agreements to \nbuy their lots at Wild Ridges prior to securing financing and before appraisal of the \nlots were performed.  Thus, at the time each lot was appraised, Plaintiffs were \ncontractually obligated to purchase the property, and the appraisals could not have \nplayed a role in Plaintiffs’ decisions to purchase.    \n{67} Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ Motions should be denied because \n“Plaintiffs have made the point many times over in depositions that, although they \ndidn’t necessarily see the appraisals prior to having closed , at the very least they \nknew that they were performed as a predicate to financing.”  ( E.g. , Pls.’ Resp. Mots. \nSumm. J. of Defs. Eide and Hollifield 9 (emphasis added).) 6  For the reasons stated \nabove in the Court’s analysis of reliance as to Plaintiffs’ professional negligence \nclaims, the Court finds Plaintiffs’ argument unpersuasive.  Even if the Court found \njustifiable reliance, Defendants have satisfied the Court that Plaintiffs have neither \ndemonstrated nor forecast any evidence that the Defendants made any of the \nalleged misrepresentations directly to Plaintiffs as required by Hospira Inc. , 194 \nN.C. App. at 699, 671 S.E.2d at 11.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS Defendants’ \nMotions for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs’ claim for fraud in the inducement.  \nPlaintiffs’ claim is hereby DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED with prejudice.  The Court finds it \nunnecessary to address Defendants’ remaining arguments in support of Defendants’ \nMotions for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs’ claim for fraud in the inducement. \nD. \nUNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES \n {68} “North Carolina provides a private cause of action for persons injured \nby a violation of the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“UDTPA”).”  \nBrinkman , 155 N.C. App. at 743, 575 S.E.2d at 44 (citing N.C.  G EN . S TAT . § 75–16 \n(2001)).  “The elements of [a UDTPA] claim are: ‘(1) an unfair or deceptive act or \npractice, or an unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting commerce, (3) which \nproximately caused actual injury to the plaintiff or to his business.’”  Id.  (quoting \n                                                 \n6 See  note 4 supra . \nSpartan Leasing v. Pollard , 101 N.C. App. 450, 460–61, 400 S.E.2d 476, 482 (1991)).  \n“‘Where an unfair or deceptive practice claim is based upon an alleged \nmisrepresentation by the defendant, the plaintiff must show ‘actual reliance’ on the \nalleged misrepresentation in order to establish that the alleged misrepresentation \n‘proximately caused’ the injury of which plaintiff complains.’”  Hospira Inc. , 194 \nN.C. App. at 702, 671 S.E.2d at 12 (quoting Tucker v. Blvd. at Piper Glen L.L.C.,  \n150 N.C. App. 150, 154, 564 S.E.2d 248, 251 (2002)).   \n {69} For the reasons stated in the Court’s discussion of Defendants’ Motions \nfor Summary Judgment as to Plaintiffs’ claim for professional negligence and fraud \nin the inducement supra , the Court finds that no evidence has been presented or \nforecast that Plaintiffs actually relied on the alleged misrepresentations included in \nthe appraisals prepared by Defendants.  Thus, Defendants’ Motions for Summary \nJudgment are GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED as to this claim, and Plaintiffs’ UDTPA claim is hereby \nDISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED with prejudice.  The Court does not reach Defendants’ alternative \narguments in support of Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment as to \nPlaintiffs’ UDTPA claim. \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n {70} For the reasons stated above, Defendants’ Motions for Summary \nJudgment are GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED.  Plaintiffs’ claims for negligent misrepresentation, fraud \nin the inducement, and unfair and deceptive trade practices are hereby \nDISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED with prejudice. \n SO ORDERED SO ORDERED SO ORDERED SO ORDERED, this the 16 \nth  day of July, 2012.  \n "
