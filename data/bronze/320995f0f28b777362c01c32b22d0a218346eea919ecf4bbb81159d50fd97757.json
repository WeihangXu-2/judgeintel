(Entezam \nCountercl. ¶¶ 1–2.)  \n{4} Burgess has moved to strike Entezam’s filings, on the ground that they \nwere prepared and submitted by a person not licensed to practice law in North \nCarolina. \n{5} Pursuant to Rule 15.4 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure \nfor the North Carolina Business Court, the Court decides the motions without a \nhearing. \n{6} After considering the Court file, the motions, briefs, and submissions of \nthe parties, the Court DENIES Burgess’ Motion to Strike and defers ruling on \nEntezam’s Motion to Dismiss.  \n \nII. \nTHE FACTS \nA. \nPLAINTIFF’S CLAIMS \n{7} Burgess filed his pro se Complaint on 19 September 2007.   \n{8} The Complaint alleges that Defendants, including Entezam, \n“collectively and individually have hired or employed some Internet firm” to plant “a \n                                                 \n1 This matter was transferred to the North Carolina Business Court on 26 October 2007 and \nsubsequently assigned to me.  \n2 Entezam has not requested permission to electronically file her papers with the Business Court. \nSee BCR 4.2 (2006). \nbug or virus or worm” on Burgess’ computer, thus damaging the computer and \ninvading his property.  (Compl. ¶¶ 31–32.) \n \n \n{9} More accurately, however, Burgess’ chief complaint is that the \ncommercial websites of Entezam and the other Defendants found their way onto his \ncomputer without (Burgess asserts) his authority or permission.3 \nB. \nENTEZAM’S FILINGS  \n{10} Entezam contends this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over her \nbecause she lives in California and has no contacts with North Carolina.  (Entezam \nMot. Dismiss 2.) \n{11} According to Entezam, she operates a dental practice in Los Angeles \nCounty, California that has no connection to North Carolina.  Entezam further \nasserts she never intended to conduct business in North Carolina, and therefore \nnever advertised her dental services in this State.  (Entezam Mot. Dismiss 2.) \n{12} Entezam, however, has not filed an affidavit attesting to these facts.  \nInstead, she states only that her Motion is “[e]xecuted under penalty of perjury.”  \n(Entezam Mot. Dismiss 2.) \n{13} Entezam has also filed a Counterclaim alleging fraud and malicious \nprosecution.  According to Entezam, Burgess attempted to extort money from her in \nsettlement of Plaintiff’s claim and, when she refused, he maliciously filed his \n“fraudulent” claim against her.  (Entezam Countercl. ¶¶ 1–2.) \nC. \nPLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO STRIKE \n                                                 \n3 On 26 February 2008, the Court dismissed Burgess’ Complaint against sixteen of the Defendants \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction.  As to these Defendants (all of whom operate dental or law practices \nfar removed from North Carolina), Burgess failed to establish that Defendants had a sufficient nexus \nwith North Carolina so as to require them to defend against Plaintiff’s claims in this State.  Burgess \nv. Vitola, 2008 NCBC 4 ¶¶ 88–104 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 26, 2008) (order on motions to dismiss for \nlack of personal jurisdiction), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/ opinions/2008%20ncbc%204.pdf. \n{14} Burgess has moved to strike Entezam’s filings, on the ground that they \nwere prepared and submitted by a person not licensed to practice law in North \nCarolina. \n{15} According to Burgess’ unsworn papers, Entezam’s husband, Gerald \nSilver (“Silver”), called Burgess following receipt of Burgess’ demand letter.  (Mot. \nStrike 2.)  Burgess alleges that, during this phone conversation, Silver identified \nhimself as an attorney and threatened Burgess with various sanctions if he did not \ndrop his lawsuit.  (Mot. Strike 2.)   \n{16} When he refused to comply with Silver’s request, Burgess contends \nSilver drafted and submitted Entezam’s Answer and Counterclaim as well as the \nMotion to Dismiss.  (Mot. Strike 2.) \n{17} In support of this contention, Burgess points to a header on the first \npage of each of Entezam’s filings reciting the following: \nMona Entezam \nc/o Gerald N. Silver \n7100 Hayvenhurst Avenue \nPenthouse Suite C \nVan Nuys, California 91406-3804 \nTelephone (818) 994-6908 \nFacsimile (818) 994-1403 \n \n(Mot. Strike 2.) \n \n{18} Entezam’s filings also include a detailed proof of service document \nsigned by a Donna J. Regan, who states that her business address is the same as \nthat of Silver. \n{19} Additionally, Entezam’s filings were prepared on what is known as \n“ruled and numbered” pleading paper, meaning paper containing lined margins on \nboth sides and numbering of each line along the left margin.4   \n                                                 \n4 A representative sample of this pleading paper is found at http://www.uslegalforms.com/paper/ \ncapleading.doc.  Pursuant to North Carolina Rule of Evidence 201(b) and (c), the Court takes judicial \nnotice of Local Rule 11-3.2 of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, \nwhich encompasses the federal district where Silver’s office is located.  See Pos-A-Traction, Inc. v. \nKelly-Springfield Tire Co., 112 F. Supp. 2d 1178, 1184 n.3 (C.D. Cal. 1999) (taking judicial notice of \n{20} Entezam admits she received help with her filings from “a friend (not \n[her] husband), who is an attorney.”  (Opp’n Mot. Strike 2.)  According to Entezam, \n“Silver is an attorney practicing in California who merely assisted me in \npreparation of documents in legal form and he is not practicing law before this court \nand is not my attorney in this action.”  (Opp’n Mot. Strike 2.)  Entezam states \nfurther that “[t]he Answer and Counterclaim were prepared by me and simply \nmailed from Mr. Silver’s office, as I wanted to make sure that it was correctly and \ntimely filed.”  (Opp’n Mot. Strike 2.) \n{21} The Court takes judicial notice of the following facts:  (1) the State Bar \nof California’s online records reflect that a Gerald Neil Silver (Bar No. 73736) is an \nactive member of the California Bar, with an office located at 7100 Hayvenhurst \nAve., Ph C, Van Nuys, CA 91406-3804;5 and (2) online records maintained by the \nNorth Carolina State Bar do not reflect that Gerald Neil Silver is a licensed North \nCarolina attorney.6  See City of Sausalito v. O'Neill, 386 F.3d 1186, 1223 n.2 (9th \nCir. 2004) (stating that a court may take judicial notice of a record of a state agency \nnot subject to reasonable dispute).  \n \nIII. \nLEGAL PRINCIPLES \nA. \nUNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW \n{22} “In North Carolina only licensed attorneys may engage in the practice \nof law.”  In re Lazurus, No. 05-80274C-7D, 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 1093, at *8 (Bankr. \nM.D.N.C. Mar. 14, 2005) (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-4 (2005)).   \n{23} Under section 84-2.1 of the North Carolina General Statutes, the \npractice of law in North Carolina is defined broadly to include: \n                                                                                                                                                             \nlocal state court rule). The Court notes that this local rule requires the use of “ruled and numbered” \npleading paper for filings in that federal district court.  C.D. Cal. Loc. R. 11-3.2     \n5 See http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=73736. \n6 See http://www.ncbar.gov/members/member_search_results.asp?callID=1. \nperforming any legal service for any other pe rson, firm or corporation, \nwith or without compensation, specifically including the preparation or \naiding in the preparation of deeds, mortgages, wills, trust instruments, \ninventories, accounts or reports of guardians, trustees, administrators \nor executors, or preparing or aiding in the preparation of any petitions \nor orders in any probate or court proceeding ; abstracting or passing \nupon titles, the preparation and filing of petitions for use in any court , \nincluding administrative tribunals an d other judicial or quasi-judicial \nbodies, or assisting by advice, counsel, or otherwise in any legal work ;  \nand to advise or give opinion upon the legal rights of any person, firm \nor corporation: Provided, that the above reference to particular acts \nwhich are specifically included within the definition of the phrase \n“practice law” shall not be construed to limit the foregoing general \ndefinition of the term, but shall be construed to include the foregoing \nparticular acts, as well as all other acts within the general definition. \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-2.1 (2007) (emphasis added). \n \n{24} The North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct (“the Rules”) govern \nthe professional responsibilities of lawyers authorized to practice law in this State.  \nPursuant to the Rules, the North Carolina State Bar has previously determined \nthat an attorney licensed to practice law in North Carolina may provide advice to \npro se litigants in a North Carolina court proceeding.  See North Carolina State \nBar, RPC 114 (July 12, 1991).  “In so doing an attorney may provide assistance in \nthe drafting of legal documents, including pleadings.  When an attorney provides \nsuch drafting assistance, the Rules of Professional Conduct do not require the \nattorney to make an appearance as counsel of record.”  Id. \n{25} Nevertheless, a lawyer who is not licensed to practice in this State, and \nwho wishes to assist a party in a North Carolina court proceeding, may not look to \nthe Rules for guidance.  Rather, he must comply with the requirements of North \nCarolina law authorizing the limited pro hac vice admission of foreign attorneys for \na specific proceeding.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-4.1 (setting forth the requirements \nfor limited pro hac vice admission of out-of-state attorneys).   \n{26} In North Carolina, engaging in the unauthorized practice of law is a \nClass 1 misdemeanor.  See id. §§ 84-4, 84-8.   \nB. \nPERSONAL JURISDICTION \n{27} Once a defendant challenges personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff has the \nburden of proving prima facie that a basis for jurisdiction exists.  Wyatt v. Walt \nDisney World, Co., 151 N.C. App. 158, 162, 565 S.E.2d 705, 708 (2002) (citation \nomitted).  Nevertheless, where the allegations of a plaintiff’s complaint meet his \ninitial burden of proving the existence of jurisdiction, and where the defendant does \nnot contradict such allegations, they are accepted as true and deemed controlling.  \nId. at 163, 565 S.E.2d at 708 (citations omitted).  \n{28} However, when a defendant supplements his motion with affidavits or \nother supporting evidence, the allegations of the plaintiff’s complaint “‘can no longer \nbe taken as true or controlling and [the plaintiff] cannot rest on the allegations of \nthe complaint,’ but must respond ‘by affidavit or otherwise . . . setting forth specific \nfacts showing that the court has jurisdiction.’”  Id. (emphasis added) (quoting \nBruggeman v. Meditrust Acquisition Co., 138 N.C. App. 612, 615–16, 532 S.E.2d \n215, 218 (2000)).  \n \nIV. \nANALYSIS \nA. \nMOTION TO STRIKE \n{29} Burgess contends the Court should strike Entezam’s filings in this case \nbecause they were prepared and submitted by someone not authorized to practice \nlaw in this State.  \n{30} Entezam admits that Silver assisted her in preparing her filings with \nthis Court, but she denies that Silver’s help amounts to practicing law in North \nCarolina.   \n{31} While the Court concludes that Silver has engaged in the unauthorized \npractice of law, it will DENY Plaintiff’s Motion to Strike. \n{32} The practice of law in North Carolina is defined broadly to include \n“performing any legal service for any other person . . . with or without \ncompensation.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-2.1.  Among other things, the statute prohibits \n“the preparation and filing of petitions for use in any court, including \nadministrative tribunals and other judicial or quasi-judicial bodies” by an attorney \nnot licensed in this State.  Id.  \n{33} An attorney licensed in North Carolina may draft pleadings on behalf \nof a pro se party in a state court proceeding without making an appearance as \ncounsel of record.  See North Carolina State Bar, RPC 114 (July 12, 1991). \n{34} No such privilege, however, is afforded an out-of-state attorney unless \nhe complies with the requirements of section 84-4.1 of the North Carolina General \nStatutes governing the pro hac vice admission of foreign attorneys.  To hold \notherwise would allow attorneys not licensed or admitted to practice in North \nCarolina to circumvent this State’s requirements for pro hac vice admission.   \n{35} The record here shows that Silver is a California attorney who is not \nlicensed to practice law in North Carolina.   \n{36} Additionally, Entezam admits that Silver assisted her in preparing \nand submitting her filings in this case.  The record supports that admission; indeed, \nit strongly suggests that Silver drafted Entezam’s pleadings. \n{37}   Entezam readily concedes that she is a dentist practicing in \nCalifornia and is not a lawyer.  (Opp’n Mot. Strike 2.)  Despite this, her Answer \n(which appears on specialized pleading paper containing Silver’s business address \nand phone/fax numbers) competently admits, denies, or pleads lack of sufficient \ninformation as to Burgess’ allegations. \n{38} Entezam’s Answer (as well as her separate Motion to Dismiss) also \nasserts an affirmative defense based on lack of personal jurisdiction, citing both the \nrelevant North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure and the applicable “minimum \ncontacts” jurisdictional test.  These concepts, while well known to most lawyers, are \nnot normally part of the dental school curriculum. \n{39} Moreover, although not a model pleading, Entezam’s Counterclaim \nsets out two separate bases for relief (even if it mistakenly cites to North Carolina’s \nUnfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act as a basis for recovering attorney fees) \nand ends with a flourish by making a specific demand for a jury trial and attaching \na detailed proof of service, replete with the kind of legalese only a lawyer could love.  \n{40} In any event, Entezam’s attempt to split hairs on the breadth of \nSilver’s involvement in this case is unavailing.  Regardless of whether Silver drafted \nEntezam’s filings outright or merely assisted in their preparation, such action falls \nwithin the broad purview of the practice of law as defined by North Carolina law.  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 84-2.1; see also State Treasurer v. Jackson, 532 N.W.2d 538, 539 \n(Mich. 1995) (holding that two attorneys licensed in Illinois who had “assisted” in \nwriting briefs without being admitted pro hac vice in Michigan were engaged in the \nunauthorized practice of law). \n{41} That said, the Court has no authority to sanction Silver because he has \nnot formally “appeared” in this case.  See In re Smith, 301 N.C. 621, 633, 272 S.E.2d \n834, 842 (1981) (holding that, where an out-of-state attorney was never properly \nadmitted pro hac vice in North Carolina, a trial court had no jurisdiction to hold the \nattorney in contempt for failing to appear as counsel); see also ADi Motorsports, Inc. \nv. Hubman, No. 4:06CV00038, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85479, at *17 (W.D. Va. Nov. \n27, 2006) (stating that the court had no authority to discipline an attorney for ghost-\nwriting papers filed by a pro se defendant); cf. Egelhof v. Szulik, 2008 NCBC 2 ¶ 3 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 4, 2008), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/020408%20 \nEgelhof%20Order.pdf (indicating that because two attorneys appeared and argued a \nmotion and a third defended a client’s deposition in the matter, the Court had \njurisdiction to sanction them).   \n{42} As for Entezam, the Court declines to strike her filings because “to do \nso would unfairly penalize the [defendant] for the conduct of [her] attorney.”  Crosby \nv. United States, No. 2:93cr163, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37061, at *8 (E.D. Va. June \n22, 2005) (refusing to strike briefs that were ghost-written by counsel not properly \nadmitted to the bar of the court).    \n{43} Entezam, however, shall not be allowed to submit further filings in \nthis case unless and until she (1) files an affidavit averring that she intends to \nproceed pro se in this case and will not seek the assistance of another in preparing \nand filing papers unless that person is a North Carolina attorney or has been \nadmitted pro hac vice pursuant to section 84-4.1 of the North Carolina General \nStatutes; or (2) provides the Court with the name and address of a duly licensed \nNorth Carolina attorney whom she has retained to represent her.  Entezam shall \nhave thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the Court’s Order to comply with \nthese requirements.  \n{44} Thereafter, the Court will set a deadline by which Burgess shall \nrespond to Entezam’s counterclaims.  \n{45} The Court will also forward copies of this Order to the North Carolina \nand California State Bars for whatever action they deem appropriate as to Silver.  \nB. \nMOTION TO DISMISS \n{46} In her Motion to Dismiss, Entezam denies, “under penalty of perjury,” \nany contacts or activity involving Burgess or North Carolina that would subject her \nto this Court’s jurisdiction.7 \n{47} The relevant inquiry here is whether Entezam’s proclamation that she \nis signing the Motion to Dismiss as an affidavit, “executed under penalty of \nperjury,” is sufficient to qualify the motion as an affidavit.  If so (and for the reasons \nexplained in the Court’s 26 February 2008 Order in this case), Burgess has failed to \nmeet his burden of responding to Entezam’s Motion denying the material facts \nrelated to personal jurisdiction.  \n{48} In North Carolina, an affidavit must be signed and its contents sworn \nto by the affiant.  See Waters v. Wilson, No. COA06-1702, 2007 N.C. App. LEXIS \n2429, at *11 (N.C. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2007) (indicating that the court should have \nconsidered a signed, sworn affidavit in ruling on a summary judgment motion, \nabsent a valid reason for exclusion).   \n                                                 \n7 That Entezam also seeks affirmative relief in this Court is not fatal to her Motion to Dismiss for \nlack of personal jurisdiction.  See Bayou Steel Corp. v. M/V Amstelvoorn, 809 F.2d 1147, 1149 (5th \nCir. 1987) (holding that “the filing of a counter-claim, cross-claim, or third-party demand does not \noperate as a waiver of an objection to jurisdiction”).  \n{49} While the Court recognizes Entezam’s intent to swear to the \nallegations contained in her Motion to Dismiss, it is not satisfied that executing the \ndocument “under penalty of perjury” transforms it into a proper affidavit.     \n{50} The Court notes that, in federal court proceedings, written declarations \nmade under penalty of perjury are permissible in lieu of a sworn affidavit \nsubscribed to before a notary public.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1746 (2006) (stating that an \nunsworn declaration under penalty of perjury has the same “force and effect” as an \naffidavit).  \n{51} The Court has found no case, however, extending the application of \nthis statute to North Carolina state court proceedings.  To the contrary, the North \nCarolina cases uniformly demand strict compliance with the requirement that an \naffidavit be properly sworn.  See First Citizens Bank & Trust Co. v. Nw. Ins. Co., 44 \nN.C. App. 414, 420, 261 S.E.2d 242, 246 (1980) (indicating that any portion of an \naffidavit which is unsworn should be disregarded); Short v. City of Greensboro, 15 \nN.C. App. 135, 138, 189 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1972) (holding that an unsworn letter does \nnot meet the requirements of an affidavit); see also Barnhouse v. Am. Express Fin. \nAdvisors, Inc., 151 N.C. App. 507, 512, 566 S.E.2d 130, 134 (2002) (Greene, J., \ndissenting) (refusing to treat a memorandum as an affidavit because, among other \nthings, it was not sworn to). \n{52} As a result, the Court declines to recognize a document as a proper \naffidavit where, as here, its contents were not sworn to by the affiant.   \n{53} Nevertheless, the Court has previously dismissed Burgess’ claims \nagainst sixteen other Defendants in this case because they lacked sufficient contacts \nwith North Carolina to support personal jurisdiction.  In that regard, the \nallegations set out in Entezam’s declaration (if unrebutted) suggest that she too \nshould not be required to defend this litigation in North Carolina. \n{54} Accordingly, the Court will grant Entezam additional time to file a \nproper affidavit with the Court, but only after she complies with the requirements \nof paragraph 43 of this Order. \n{55} The Court will thereafter establish deadlines for Entezam to file a \nproper affidavit, and for Burgess to respond to any such filing.  \n \n \n \n \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n{56} The Court DENIES Burgess’ Motion to Strike. \n{57} Within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, Entezam shall (1) file \nan affidavit averring that she intends to proceed pro se in this case and will not \nseek the assistance of another in preparing and filing papers unless that person is a \nNorth Carolina attorney or has been admitted pro hac vice pursuant to section 84-\n4.1 of the North Carolina General Statutes; or (2) provide the Court with the name \nand address of a duly licensed North Carolina attorney whom she has retained to \nrepresent her.  Entezam shall file no further papers with the Court until she \ncomplies with these requirements.  \n{58} The Court defers ruling on Entezam’s Motion to Dismiss.  The Court \nwill grant Entezam additional time to file a proper affidavit with the Court in \nsupport of her Motion to Dismiss, but only after Entezam complies with the \nrequirements of paragraphs 43 and 57 of this Order. \n{59}  Thereafter, the Court will set deadlines by which the parties shall \nsubmit further filings as to Entezam’s Motion to Dismiss and Counterclaim.  \n{60} The Court will forward copies of this Order to the North Carolina and \nCalifornia State Bars for whatever action they deem appropriate as to Silver. \n  \n SO ORDERED, this the 26th day of March, 2008. \n  "
