Moore Jr. and Amelia Serratt, for Defendants MindPath Care Centers \nNorth Carolina, PLLC, MISO, LLC, Stanley Monroe, and Yvonne \nMonroe. \n \nEarp, Judge. \n \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3. When ruling on a motion to dismiss  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the \nNorth Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”), the Court does not find facts, but \nrather it recites the facts as alleged.  The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff’s \nFirst Amended Complaint (“Am Compl.”) (ECF No. 39.)   \n4. Defendant Mindpath Care Centers, North Carolina, PLLC (“Mindpath”) \nis a professional healthcare organization providing mental and behavioral care \nservices in North Carolina.  Until 2019, the company was known as Carolina Partners \nin Mental Healthcare, PLLC (“CPMH”).\n1  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 8, 11.)   \n5. Plaintiff Mary Hartsell is a b oard-certified Family Nurse Practitioner \nand Psychiatric and Mental Health Nurse Practitioner.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 1.)  Plaintiff \nsigned both an operating agreement and  a participating provider agreement  to \nbecome a member, minority interest holder, and employee of Mindpath in April 2001.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11–13.)   \n6. Defendant MISO, LLC (“MISO”) is a North Carolina limited liability \ncompany.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 3.)  MISO is owned and controlled by Stanley and Yvonne  \n \n1In this Order and Opinion, the Court refers to the entity that was CPMH prior to 2019 and \nMindpath after 2019 as “Mindpath.” \nMonroe, along with their brother, Steven  Monroe.  It p erforms billing and \nadministrative functions for Mindpath.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff was not a member \nof MISO.  (Am. Comp. ¶ 15.)  \n7. Defendant Stanley Monroe (“Stanley”) is president of Mindpath  but is \nnot alleged to be a member  of that entity.  Stanley is a managing member of MISO. \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 4.) \n8. Defendant Yvonne Monroe (“Yvonne”) is Stanley’s sister.  Yvonne is a \nmember of both Mindpath and MISO.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 5.) \n9. Plaintiff agreed to join Mindpath after “Defendants” promised that her \ntake-home pay would be 50% of Mindpath’s monthly gross collections from her clinical \nwork.  The other 50% of her gross collections w as to be used by  Mindpath to pay \noverhead and expenses.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 13.) \n10. Mindpath pa id MISO for billing and overhea d. (Am. Comp. ¶ 14.)  \nAccording to Plaintiff, Stanley and Yvonne, both of whom owned interests in MISO , \nconcealed the terms and details of “insider transactions” between Mindpath and \nMISO.  (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 16–18.)   \n11. Plaintiff often billed in excess of 200 clinical hours per month, but her \nmonthly statements showed large deductions in categories described only as “Practice \nManagement,” “Global,” and “Local,” resulting in Plaintiff’s take-home pay  being \n“well below the 50% of her gross receipts as she had been promised.”  (Am. Comp. ¶¶ \n19–21.)   \n12. Plaintiff a ddressed the matter with Stanley, who did not give her \nsatisfactory explanations for how the deducted funds were being used and “concealed \ninformation from [Plaintiff] from which she could ascertain the circumstances.”  (Am. \nComp. ¶ 22.)   \n13. Plaintiff was never asked to approve an agreement between Mindpath \nand MISO , and s he was never given detailed information about “these interested \ninsider transactions between MISO and Mindpath.”  (Am. Comp. ¶ 23.)   \n14. After 16 years as a “ partner”2 at Mindpath, Plaintiff gave notice of her \nresignation, effective 30 November 2017.  (Am. Compl. ¶  24.)  She requested that her \nownership interest in the PLLC be redeemed.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶  25–26.)   \n15. Plaintiff sent Stanley several emails and letters requesting that \nMindpath redeem her “ partnership interests.”  Stanley  promised Plaintiff that she \nwould eventually be paid, but he never provided specifics.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 26–27.) \n16. Instead, Plaintiff alleges that  Stanley “engaged in a pattern of deception \nand obfuscation,” first telling Plaintiff that Mindpath was involved in legal \nproceedings that prevented the redemption , then falsely accusing Plaintiff of \nimproperly withdrawing from Mindpath , and finally claiming that M indpath had \nadopted a policy not to redeem the interests of withdrawing partners.   (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 27–30.) \n17. Stanley also allegedly threatened Plaintiff by accusing her of “cost[ing] \n[Mindpath] more than the value of her partnership interest” but said that Mindpath \n \n2 Although she was a member in a PLLC, Plaintiff apparently referred to herself as a \n“partner” and her interest as a “partnership interest.” \nwould forgive her “debt” if she agreed to give up her right to have her ownership  \ninterest redeemed.  (Am. Comp. ¶ 31.) \n18. On 4 April 2018, Plaintiff made a demand pursuant to N.C.G.S.  § 57D-\n3-04 for records from which Plaintiff could determine the value of her ownership \ninterest.  (Am. Comp. ¶ 32.)  Mindpath responded that Plaintiff’s interest was worth \nover $9 ,000, but “falsely claim[ed] that Plaintiff had actively  solicited Mindpath’s \npatients to leave  [Mindpath]” in breach of her fiduciary obligations causing damage \nto the PLLC.  (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 33- 34.)  As a result, Mindpath refused to provide the \nrequested records.  (Am. Comp. ¶ 35.)   \n19. Plaintiff responded on 7 May 2018, denying that she had breached any \nobligation to Mindpath and again requesting company records to calculate the value \nof her  interest.  Mindpath provided a From K -1 but refused to provide any other \nrecords.  (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 36–37.)   \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n20. Plaintiff initiated this action on  29 March 2021. (ECF No. 1.)   On 7 \nJanuary 2022, she moved to amend her Complaint.  (ECF No. 30.)  The Court granted \nthe motion in part by Order entered 8 April 2022.  (ECF No. 38.)  Plaintiff th en filed \nher First Amended Complaint on 19 April 2022. \n21. In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts claim s against \nMindpath for failure to respond to her record demand and for breach of the PLLC’s \noperating agreement. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 38–48.)  Count Three asserts that Stanley, as \npresident of Mindpath, breached a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff when he refused to \nredeem her membership interest in the PLLC.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 49–55.)  Count Four, \nasserted against both Stanley and Yvonne, alleges that they breached their fiduciary \nduty to Plaintiff when, as an officer and a member of Mindpath , respectively, they \ndiluted her interest by transferring money from Mindpath to MISO in “self-interested \ntransactions” and then denied Plaintiff access to the financial records.   (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 56–67.)  Finally, Count Five of the Amended Complaint alleges that all of the \nDefendants, including Mindpath and MISO, engaged in constructive frau d. (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 68–76.) \n22. On 18 May 2022,  Defendants filed th is Motion seeking to dismiss \nPlaintiff’s third, fourth and fifth claims  for relief pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(6).  The Motion was fully briefed, and the Court entertained arguments at a \nhearing held on 25 August 2022.   (See ECF No. 48.)   The Motion  is now ripe for \ndisposition.3    \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) \n23. When ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the \nCourt’s inquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, \ntreated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under \n \n3 Prior to the filing of th is Motion, in response to the initial Complaint, Defendants filed a \npartial motion to dismiss  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  However,  because it was filed  after \nDefendants’ answer, the partial motion to dismiss was denied as untimely.  (See Order, ECF \nNo. 38.)  Thereafter, however, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, permitting Defendants \nto plead anew in response.  This time Defendants timely filed their motion to dismiss, (ECF \nNo. 40), prior to the filing of their answer, (ECF No. 42.)  The Court therefore addresses the \nMotion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), rather than Rule 12(c). \nsome legal theory, whether properly labeled or not.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 \nN.C. App. 669, 670 (1987) (citation omitted).  “[A] statement of claim is adequate if it \ngives sufficient notice of the claim asserted to enable the adverse party to answer and \nprepare for trial, to allow for the application of the doctrine of res judicata, and to \nshow the type of case brought.”  Sutton v. Duke , 277 N.C. 94, 102 (1971) (internal \nquotation omitted). \n24. Conversely, “[i]t is well- established that dismissal pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6) is proper when ‘(1) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the \nplaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to \nmake a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats \nthe plaintiff’s claim.’ ” Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC , 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) \n(quoting Wood v. Guilford Cnty., 355 N.C. 161, 166 (2002)). \n25. The Court is not required “to accept as true allegations that are merely \nconclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope \nHosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274 (2005) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \nB.  Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) \n26. As an additional basis for dismissal  of Counts Four and Five , \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff does not have standing and, therefore, that the Court \nlacks subject matter jurisdiction.  They contend that the claim s are derivative, not \ndirect, and they observe that Plaintiff failed to make the statutorily required demand \nbefore filing suit. See N.C.G.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2).  \n27. “Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court ’s proper exercise of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.”  Aubin v. Susi, 149 N.C. App. 320, 324 (2002) (citation \nomitted).  It refers to whether a party has “sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable \ncontroversy such that he or she may properly seek adjudicat ion of the matter.”  Am. \nWoodland Indus., Inc. v. Tolson, 155 N.C. App. 624, 626 (2002).  \n28. Prior to asserting a derivative claim, an LLC member must have: \nmade written demand on the LLC to take suitable action, \nand either (i) the LLC notified the member tha t the \nmember’s demand was rejected, (ii) 90 days have expired \nfrom the date the demand was made, or (iii) irreparable \ninjury to the LLC would result by waiting for the expiration \nof the 90-day period. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2). \n29. “The challenge to the adequ acy of any pre -suit demand is, inter alia, a \nchallenge to the Court ’s subject matter jurisdiction over the derivative claim.  \nBarefoot v. Barefoot, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 8, at **9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 2, 2022) (citing \nFinley v. Brown, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 79, at **8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 1, 2017).  The \nreason for the demand requirement is to “give an LLC the opportunity ‘to remedy the \nalleged problem without resort to judicial action, or, if the problem cannot be \nremedied without judicial action, to allow the [LLC], as the true beneficial party, the \nopportunity to bring suit first against the alleged wrongdoers. ’ ” Id. at **20 (quoting \nZoutewelle v. Mathis, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 13, 2018)).      \n30.  The burden is on Plaintiff to prove the existence of subject matter \njurisdiction.  Neuse River Found., Inc. v. Smithfield Foods, Inc ., 155 N.C. App. 110, \n113 (2002).  Absent that proof, the Court is required to dismiss the action.  See Sarda \nv. City/Cnty. of Durham Board of Adjustment , 156 N.C. App. 213, 215 (2003) (“If a \ncourt finds at any stage of the proceedings that it lacks jurisdiction over the subject \nmatter of a case, it must dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.” (citation omitted)); \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). \nIV.  Analysis \nA.  Breach of Fiduciary Duty \n31. Each of the three claims at issue turns on whether a fiduciary duty is \nowed by the implicated Defendant(s) to Plaintiff.  Azure Dolphin, LLC v. Barton, 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 90, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 2, 2017)  (Although breach of fiduciary \nduty and constructive fraud are distinct causes of action , “an essential element of \neach claim is the existence of a fiduciary relationship.”).  \n32. To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, Plaintiff  must plead the \nexistence of a fiduciary duty, a breach of that duty, and injury proximately caused by \nthe breach.  See Green v. Freeman , 367 N.C. 136, 141 (2013).  Constructive fraud \nrequires that Plaintiff plead,  in addition, that Defendants  sought to benefit \nthemselves through the breach.  See White v. Consol. Planning, Inc ., 166 N.C. App. \n283, 294 (2004). \n33. “[A] fiduciary relationship is generally described as arising when ‘there \nhas been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is \nbound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing \nconfidence.’ ”  Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A., 367 N.C. 363, 367 (2014) (quoting Green, \n367 N.C. at 141).  “North Carolina recognizes two types of fiduciary relationships: de \njure, or those imposed by operation of law, and de facto , or those arising from the \nparticular facts and circumstances constituting and surrounding the relationship.”   \nHager v. Smithfield E. Health Holdings, LLC, 264 N.C. App. 350, 355 (2019). \n34. LLCs are creatures of contract, and the members may choose to impose \nfiduciary duties on one another by agreement.  See, e.g. , Strategic Mgmt. Decisions, \nLLC v. Sales Performance Int’l, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *10 –11 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Aug. 7, 2017) (“The rights and duties of LLC members are ordinarily governed by \nthe company’s operating agreement, not by general principles of fiduciary \nrelationships.”); see also N.C.G.S. § 57D-2-30(a).  Absent such an agreement, however, \nthe general rule is tha t members of an LLC “do not owe a fiduciary duty to each \nother[.]”  Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 473 (2009).   \n35. Plaintiff conceded at the hearing that she is not pursuing a claim for \nbreach of a de jure fiduciary duty, and indeed she does not allege the existence of a de \njure fiduciary relationship.  Likewise, there is no allegation that a fiduciary duty was \nimposed by an operating agreement.  Consequently, the Motion turns on whether , \ngiven the facts alleged, a de facto fiduciary duty existed between Plaintiff and any of \nthe Defendants.  \n36. “The standard for finding a de facto  fiduciary relationship is a \ndemanding one: Only when one party figuratively holds all the cards —all the \nfinancial power or technical information , for example —have North Carolina courts \nfound that the special circumstance of a fiduciary relationship has arisen.”  \nLockerman v. S. River Elec. Mbrshp. Corp.,  250 N.C. App. 631, 636 (2016) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  Mere influence  over another’s affairs  is \ninsufficient.  See Id. \n37. With respect to Count Three, Plaintiff argues that Stanley “held all the \nfinancial power and technical know -how behind the Mindpath- MISO transactions, \nmembership redemption, and Plaintiff’s compensation under the Provider \nAgreement.”  Therefore, she contends, the Lockerman standard has been met. (Pl. ’s \nBr. Opp’n to Mot. [“Pl.’s Br.”] 7, ECF No. 43.) \n38. With respect to Count Four, Plaintiff argue s that Stanley, as president \nof Mindpath and an owner of MISO, and Yvonne, as an owner of both Mindpath and \nMISO, worked together to funnel money from Mindpath to MISO by “orchestrat[ing] \na series of insider transactions between the two companies.”  ( Pl.’s Br. 7).  Plaintiff \ncontends that she was never asked for input or given insight into the details of these \ntransactions. (Pl.’s Br. 2.)   Instead, Plaintiff contends that Stanley and Yvonne \ninitiated a “self -perpetuating scheme” in which they denied  Plaintiff access to \ncorporate records, threatened her with a lawsuit, and used MISO to “further insulate \nthemselves from discovery.”  She contends that this scheme, when taken as a whole, \ngives rise to fiduciary duties owed by Stanley and Yvonne  to Plaintiff.  (Pl.’s. Br. 5–\n7).  In making this argume nt, Plaintiff asks the Court to broad ly define the concept \nof a fiduciary relationship, noting  that it “need not be legal; it may be moral, social, \ndomestic or merely personal. ” ( Pl.’s Br. 6) (quoting Abbitt v. Gregory, 201 N.C. 577, \n598 (1931).  \n39. Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s argument with respect to Stanley \nexpands on the allegations in the Complaint, which themselves are too conclusory to \nsupport a conclusion that St anley had sufficient control over Mindpath to owe \nPlaintiff a de facto fiduciary duty.4  They further argue that MindPath is a member-\nmanaged LLC and, although Stanley is not a member -manager, Plaintiff is.  (Defs.’ \nReply Mem. Supp. Mot. [“Defs.’ Reply Br.”] 3–4, ECF No. 44.)  It follows, according to \nDefendants, that Stanley  “could not have held all of MindPath’s financial power or \ntechnical information,” and therefore could not have “held all the cards.”    \n40. As for  Stanley and Yvonne acting in concert, Defendants argue that \nthere is only one allegation in the Amended Complaint that speaks to their combined \ncontrol over Mindpath.  They contend that allegation—“At all times relevant to this \nComplaint, Mindpath and MISO were operated and controlled by Stanley and Yvonne \nMonroe,” (Am. Comp. ¶ 10 )—is merely conclusory and need not be accepted as true \nfor purposes of the Motion.  (Defs’ Reply Br. 2, fn 1.) \n41. The Court agrees that Plaintiff does not sufficiently allege that Stanley, \neither alone or in combination with Yvonne, exercised sufficient dominion or control \nover Mindpath to owe fiduciary duties to Plaintiff.  Stanley may have wielded power \nas a n officer of Mindpath, but he was not a member -manager, and there is no \nallegation that Plaintiff was stripped of her authority as a member-manager by the \n \n4 Defendants correctly observe that, under Rule 12(b)(6),  the Court must limit its \nconsideration to the allegations that appear in the Amended Complaint and cannot expand \nthose allegations to encompass the arguments in Plaintiff’s brief.  It is established law that \nthe Court must consider the Amended Complaint as plead and not as argued by counsel.  See \ne.g., Loray Master Tenant, LLC v. Foss N.C. Mill Credit 2014 Fund I, LLC, 2021 NCBC LEXIS \n15, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 18, 2021). \nPLLC’s operating agreement.  Using the Lockerman analogy, her status as a member \ngave Plaintiff “cards” to play.  Furthermore, Plaintiff’s conclusory alleg ation that \nStanley and Yvonne together controlled Mindpath lacks factual support  in her \nAmended Complaint.  A conclusory allegation, standing alone, cannot stave off a Rule \n12(b)(6) challenge.  See e.g., Meyer v. Walls, 347 N.C. 97, 114 ( 1997) (conclusory \nallegations are insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss).5 \n42. Finally, citing Richardson v. Utili-Serve, LLC, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 135, \nat **11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 17, 2020), Plaintiff argues that the holder of a majority \ninterest who exercises control over the LLC owes a fiduciary duty to the minority \ninterest members.  (Pl.’s Br. 6.)  Critically, however, while Plaintiff alleges that \nStanley and Yvonne “operated and controlled” both Mindpath and MISO (Am. Compl. \n¶ 10), she does not allege that Yvonne, or even Stanley and Yvonne  together, held a \nmajority interest in Mindpath.  Rather, Plaintiff acknowledges that Stanley owns no \ninterest in Mindpath.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 17.)  Absent allegations of a controlling \nownership interest, Richardson does not support Plaintiff’s claim.  See e.g., Vanguard \nPai Lung, LLC v. Moody , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 39 , at *17  (N.C. Super Ct. June 19, \n2019) (“As a general rule, members of an LLC do not owe a fiduciary duty to one \nanother, but in some circumst ances, ‘a holder of a majority interest who exercises \ncontrol over the LLC owes a fiduciary duty to minority interest members.’ ”) (quoting \nFiske v. Kieffer, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 22, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 9, 2016)). \n \n5 Moreover, Plaintiff can scarcely argue that she reposed “special confidence” in Stanley or \nYvonne Monroe.  To the contrary, the allegations reveal a growing dissatisfaction and loss of \ntrust. (See e.g., Am. Comp. ¶¶ 22-23, 62-63.)  \n \n43. “Without the existence of a fiduciary relationship there can be no claim \nfor breach.”  Bourgeois v. Lapelusa, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 111, at **15 (N.C. Super. Ct. \n2022).  Because the Court determines that Plaintiff’s allegations do not give rise to a \nde facto  fiduciary duty , Plaintiff’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Third and Fourth \nClaims for Relief is GRANTED, and Plaintiff’s Third and Fourth Claims for Relief \nare DISMISSED with prejudice.  \nB.   Constructive Fraud \n44. Count Five is a claim for constructive fraud brought against all four \nDefendants.  To assert such a claim Plaintiff must “allege the facts and circumstances \n(1) which crea ted the relation of trust and confidence, and (2) led up to and \nsurrounded the consummation of the transaction in which defendant is alleged to \nhave taken advantage of his position of trust to the hurt of plaintiff.”  Rhodes v. Jones \n232 N.C. 547, 549 (1950).  Thus, the existence of a fiduciary relationship is an \nessential element of a constructive fraud claim.   Brown v. Secor, 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n65, at **18 (N.C. Super Ct. 2017).   \n45. With respect to the claim against Mindpath, a North Carolina limited \nliability compan y does not owe fiduciary duties to its  members.  Consequently, \nPlaintiff cannot assert a cl aim for constructive fraud against Mindpath .  Merrell v. \nSmith, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 150, at **22–25 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 22, 2020) ( holding \nthat an LLC does not owe a fiduciary duty to its members and dismissing plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the LLC for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud).  As for \nMISO, there is no relationship between Plaintiff and that entity that would give rise \nto a fiduciary duty.  The result is that th e constructive fraud claim alleged against \nthe entity Defendants fails. \n46. With respect to the claim against the individual Defendants, Plaintiff \nalleges that Stanley, as president of Mindpath, and Yvonne, as a member of Mindpath \nand an owner of MISO, were in positions “of trust and confidence with respect to other \nmembers of Mindpath , including Dr. Hartsell. ”  (Am. Comp. ¶¶ 69–70).  As stated \nabove, however, the facts alleged do not support the existence of either a de jure or a \nde facto  fiduciary relationship between Plaintiff and the individual Defendants .  \nWithout a fiduciary relationship, there is no claim for constructive fraud.  See e.g., \nDS&T II, Inc. v. D&E Tax & Accounting, Inc., 2021 NCBC LEXIS 87, at **18 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Oct. 4, 2021)  (“A claim for constructive fraud requires the presence of a \nconfidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties.”).  Accordingly, Count Five \nfails with respect to the individual Defendants.6   \nV. CONCLUSION \n47. For the foregoing reasons, t he Court  hereby GRANTS Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss , and Plaintiff’s Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Claim s for relief  are \nDISMISSED with prejudice.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 Defendants also contend that Counts Four and Five fail because the claims ae derivative \nand Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the requirements for written demand on the LLC.  See Al-\nHassan v. Salloum, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 22, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. 2020).  Because the Court \nconcludes that no fiduciary duty exist s on the facts as alleged, the Court need not address \nthe merits of this contention.   \nThis the 2nd day of November, 2022. \n \n \n \n \n         /s/ Julianna Theall Earp \n Julianna Theall Earp \n Special Superior Court Judge \n  for Complex Business Cases \n "
