THIS MATTER  is before the Court on  the 21 August 2020 filing of  \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (the “Motion”) pursuant to Rule 56 of the \nNorth Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rule(s)”).  (ECF No. 56.) \n2. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court DENIES the Motion. \nRossabi Law PLLC , by Gavin J. Reardon and Amiel J. Rossabi , for \nPlaintiff Rossabi Law PLLC f/k/a Rossabi Reardon Klein Spivey PLLC \nand Third-Party Defendant Amiel Rossabi.  \n \nBoydoh & Hale, PLLC, by J.

Grp., LLC, 2021 NCBC 31. \n \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n3. This dispute arises out of legal services provided by Plaintiff  and Third-\nParty Defendant to Defendants and the parties’ disagreement regarding the payment \nof Plaintiff’s legal fees. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  “But to provide context for its ruling, the Court may state either \nthose facts that it believes are not in material dispute or those facts on which a \nmaterial dispute forecloses summary adjudication.”  Ehmann v. Medflow, Inc. , 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 88, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017). \n5. Third-Party Defendant Amiel Rossabi (“Rossabi”) is the managing partner \nof Plaintiff Rossabi Law PLLC (“Plaintiff”). 1  (Aff. Amiel J. Rossabi ¶ 2, ECF No. 63 \n[“Rossabi Aff.”].) \n6. Defendant N Club, LLC (“N Club”)  owns property located on South Elm \nStreet in Greensboro, North Carolina, which N Club leases to Defendant Greater \nGreensboro Entertainment Group (“GGEG” and with N Club collectively referred to \nas “Defendants”).  (Aff. Rocco Scarfone ¶ 7, ECF No. 58 2 [“Scarfone Aff.”].)  GGEG \n \n1 On 18 November 2020, Plaintiff filed the Motion to Amend Caption requesting that the \nCourt change the caption of this litigation to reflect Plaintiff’s change in name.  (ECF No. 67.)  \nPlaintiff, formerly known as Rossabi Reardon Klein Spivey PLLC, changed its name with the \nNorth Carolina Secretary of State and the North Carolina State Bar on 21 August 2020 to \nRossabi Law PLLC.  On 23 November 2020, the Court entered the Order on Motion to Amend \nCaption granting the Motion to Amend Caption to reflect Plaintiff’s name change.  (ECF No. \n69.) \n2 In filing Defendants’ Brief in Support of Defendants’ Moti on for Summary Judgment , \ncounsel for Defendants filed their brief in support of the Motion and all the exhibits submitted \nin support of the Motion as one .pdf document.  (See ECF No. 58.)   \n \n \noperates a music venue at the leased property, which is known as the Cone Denim \nEntertainment Center (“CDEC”).  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 7.) \n7. Rocco Scarfone (“Scarfone”) is a member and manager of Defendants .  \n(Scarfone Aff. ¶ 2.)  Scarfone is also the President of GGEG.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 3.)   \n8. At all times relevant to this litigation, Rossabi was a member of GGEG.  \n(Scarfone Aff. ¶ 6.) \n9. Jeffrey Furr (“Furr”) is a member of Defendants.  (Aff. Jeffrey Furr ¶ 2, ECF \nNo. 58 [“Furr Aff.”].)  Furr is also the Vice President of GGEG.  (Furr Aff. ¶ 3.)  \n10. Pursuant to Section 3.3 of GGEG’s Operating Agreement,  \nThe Vice -President of [GGEG] shall be notified of all legal matters \nincluding but not limited to leases, contract s, agreements, fees, and \nmajor expenditures of [GGEG] prior to their being incurred.  “Major \nExpenditure” is defined as any expenditure exceeding Ten Thousand  \nDollars ($10,000.00)[.]  Prior to entering any of the above or a Major \nExpenditure, the Vi ce-President and President shall  discuss and \nmutually agree.  Upon the event they do not agree then an agreement \nwill be reached by a Majority in Interest of the Members.  \n \n(Scarfone Aff. Ex. 2 § 3.3  [“Operating Agreement”].)  Scarfone owns the Majority in \nInterest of the Members as defi ned by GGEG’s Operating Agreement.  (Rossabi Aff. \n¶ 69.)   \n11. Rossabi has represented Defendants and Scarfone as their legal counsel for \nmore than ten years.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 5.)  Rossabi contends that he and Plaintiff have \nimplemented various billing arrange ments throughout their  representation of \nDefendants and Scarfone, including hourly rates, bartering, a contingency fee basis, \nand providing services at no cost.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 5.)  Scarfone contends that Rossabi \n \n \nand Plaintiff have represented GGEG pursuant to an hourly rate fee agreement since \n2014.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 8.) \n12. During July 2017, Scarfone received a letter f rom the City of Greensboro \n(the “City”) indicating that the City purchased property behind the CDEC and the \nCity intended to condemn N Club’s access easement and terminate GGEG’s shared \nparking agreement for the leased property.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 10; see also Compl. ¶ 20, \nECF No. 3.) \n13. Scarfone engaged Plaintiff to represent Defendants to prevent the City from \nproceeding with its plan to condemn N Club’s access easement and terminate GGEG’s \nshared parking agreement.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 9; Scarfone Aff. ¶ 11.)  At the initial stages \nof the dispute between Defendants and the City, Plaintiff represented Defendants on \nan hourly basis.  (Furr Aff. ¶ 8; Rossabi Aff. ¶ 15; Scarfone Aff. ¶ 12.)  \n14. On 24 October 2017, the City and N Club entered into the Professional \nServices Review Agreement (the “PSA”).  (Rossabi Aff. Ex. D; ECF No. 63.4 [“PSA”].)  \nPursuant to the terms of the PSA, the City was to pay or reimburse N Club for \npreliminary inspections, review, and analysis  of the City’s condemnation plan  up to \nforty-five thousan d dollars ($45,000) , which included reimbursement of legal  fees \nincurred by Defendants.  (PSA ¶ 4; see also Rossabi Aff. ¶ 26.) \n15. Plaintiff contends that the PSA was intended to be a limited agreement.  \n(Rossabi Aff. ¶ 29.)  Scarfone contends that the PSA covered all of Plaintiff’s legal fees \nthrough 19 December 2017.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 17.)   \n \n \n16. On 19 December 2017, against Defendants’ wishes, the Greensboro City \nCouncil approved the City’s condemnation of N Club’s access easement and the \ntermination of the shar ed parking agreement.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ ¶ 10, 34.)  At the 19 \nDecember 2017 City Council meeting, the City publicly adopted a resolution \nauthorizing the payment of Defendants’ legal fees.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 20.)   \n17. Plaintiff’s initial engagement with Defendants, as it pertains to the CDEC, \nwas limited to Plaintiff’s work related to stopping the City from approving \ncondemnation of N Club’s access easement .  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 36.)  Accordingly, it is \nPlaintiff’s position that Plaintiff’s initial representation of Defendants and the hourly \nrate agreement terminated on 19 December 2017  when the City approved the \ncondemnation plan.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 36.)   \n18. Approval of the condemnation meant that Defendants, at the advice of \nPlaintiff, would need to file a lawsuit ag ainst the City to seek protection against the \nloss of the easement and shared parking agreement (the “Cone Denim Action”).  \n(Rossabi Aff. ¶ 36; see also Compl. ¶ 36.)  Between 20 December 2017 and 19 January \n2018, Plaintiff drafted a complaint and motion f or temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction, which were ultimately filed.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶¶ 42, 47.) \n19. Defendants believed that at all times after 19 December 2017, the City was \nobligated to pay Defendants’ legal fees incurred in the Cone Denim Action.  (Scarfone \nAff. ¶¶ 21, 24.)   Rossabi contends that Scar fone represented to Rossabi that \nDefendants could not pay an hourly rate for Plaintiff’s legal services in the Cone \nDenim Action; therefore, Scarfone asked if Plaintiff could represent Defendants on a \n \n \ncontingency fee basis going forward , and Rossabi agreed on Plaintiff’s behalf .  \n(Rossabi Aff. ¶¶ 37, 39–40.)   \n20. Beginning on 20 December 2017, Rossabi contends that Plaintiff \nrepresented Defendants on a one- third (1/3) contingency fee basis.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ \n41.)  Rossabi did not immediately draft an agreement but waited until 25 January \n2018 to draft the contingency fee agreement (the “Contingency Agreement”).  (Rossabi \nAff. ¶¶ 41, 48.) \n21. The Contingency Agreement provides in part that Plaintiff  \nwill represent [ Defendants] with respect to the [Cone Denim Action ], \nwith the understanding that [Plaintiff] will receive a contingent fee \nequal to 331 3� % of the amount of recovery.  The recovery shall mean any \ncompensation GGEG and/or N Club receive, whether through \nsettlement or otherwise related to the [Cone Denim Action ].  If some or \nall of the compensation is not monetary, the value of such compensation \nshall be calculated to determine the full amount of recovery.   \n \n(Rossabi Aff. Ex. J, ECF No. 63.10.) \n22. On 26 January 2018, Rossabi hand delivered the Contingency Agreement \nto Scarfone at Plaintiff’s office.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 51.)  Scarfone represented to Rossabi \nthat Scarfone intended to sign the Contingency Agreement on behalf of Defendants.  \n(Rossabi Aff. ¶ 51.) \n23. On 27 January 2018 or  28 January 2018, Scarfone represented to Rossabi \nthat Scarfone signed the Contingency Agreement and he would deliver the signed \nContingency Agreement to Rossabi.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 53.) \n24. Plaintiff, on behalf of Defendants, initiated settlement discussions with the \nCity.  ( See Rossabi Aff. ¶¶ 56 –60.)  At a  28 March 2018 mediation with the City, \n \n \nScarfone acknowledged the existence of the Contingency Agreement.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ \n60; see also Scarfone Aff. ¶ 26.)   \n25. Rossabi believed that the settlement agreement should include “a provision \nto get the City to pay some of Defendants’ attorney’s fees.”  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 57.)  It was \nRossabi’s belief that “there was simply no way the City would agree to pay all  of \nDefendants’ legal fees[.]”   (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 58 (emphasis in original).)  Rossabi al so \nbelieved that disclosing the existence of the Contingency Agreement to the City would \nhave a negative impact on settlement negotiations; therefore, Rossabi and Scarfone \nagreed to not inform the City  that the parties entered into the  Contingency \nAgreement.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶¶ 58, 60.) \n26. Defendants and the City reached a settlement worth approximately one \nmillion dollars in the Cone Denim Action.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 63.) \n27. On 24 April 2018, Defendants and the City entered into a finalized \nsettlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”).  (Scarfone Aff. Ex. 8 \n[“Settlement Agreement”].)  Paragraph  19 of the Settlement Agreement provides \nthat:  \nThe City agrees to pay attorney’s fees of N Club and GGEG in the total \namount of $85,000 (not including payme nts already made by the City \npursuant to the [PSA], dated October 24, 2017), payable to Rossabi Law \nPartners within seven (7) business days of the full execution of this \n[Settlement] Agreement, which execution shall take place by April 24, \n2018.  As to all other costs and attorney’s fees, the parties will bear their \nown costs and attorney’s fees. \n \n(Settlement Agreement ¶ 19.)    \n \n \n28. Plaintiff received $85,000 pursuant to the terms of the Settlement \nAgreement.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 64.)  Plaintiff contends that it is entitled to $333,000 \npursuant to the terms of the Contingency Agreement.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 63.) \n29. On the other hand, Defendants believe and contend that Plaintiff would be \npaid in full for all of its legal work in the Cone Denim Action with Plaintiff receiving \n$85,000 of the settlement proceeds , specifically  identified by the Settlement \nAgreement as payment for Defendants’ attorneys’ fees .  (Scarfone Aff. ¶¶ 28– 34.)  \nScarfone represents that the City made two payments totaling $118,655 to Plaintiff, \non Defendants’ behalf, as payment of Plaintiff’s legal fees.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 35.)  It is \nDefendants’ position that the total payments by the City of $118,655 represent \npayment in full to Plaintiff for the hours Plaintiff worked on and billed for the Cone \nDenim Action.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 35.) \n30. After Defendants and the City entered into the S ettlement Agreement, \nScarfone informed Rossabi that Furr would not agree to pay Plaintiff pursuant to the \nterms of the Contingency Agreement.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 61.) \n31. On 26 April 2018, Rossabi emailed Scarfone and indicated that Rossabi had \ngiven Scarfone and Furr the Contingency Agreement; however, Rossabi had not yet \nreceived it back signed by Scarfone.  (Scarfone Aff. Ex. 10.) \n32. Defendants contend that neither Scarfone nor Furr approved the \nContingency Agreement with Plaintiff.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 36.)  Scarfone contends that \nexecution of the Contingency Agreement would require the approval of both Scarfone \nand Furr and that Scarfone alone could not have agreed to the Contingency \n \n \nAgreement pursuant to the terms of GGEG’s Operating Agreement.  (Scarfone Aff. ¶ \n36.)  \n33. Scarfone represents that he never signed the Contingency Agreement.  \n(Scarfone Aff. ¶ 45.)  Furr also represents that he never signed the Contingency \nAgreement.  (Furr Aff. ¶ 30.)   \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n34. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motion. \n35. Plaintiff initiated this action with the filing of its Complaint on 5 December \n2018.  \n36. On 8 March 2019, before this case was designated as a mandatory complex \nbusiness case and assigned to the undersigned, Defendants filed Defendants’ Motion \nto Dismiss and Motion to Strike pursuant to Rule 12 (the “Motion to Dismiss”).  (ECF \nNo. 6.)  On 27 June 2019, Superior Court Judge David L. Hall (“Judge Hall”) entered \nan order denying the Motion to Dismiss.  (ECF No. 7.) \n37. Defendants filed Defendants’ Answer to Complaint and Greater Greensboro \nEntertainment Group, LLC’s Third-Party Complaint on 29 July 2019.  (ECF No. 4.)   \nThe Third-Party Complaint caused Rossabi to be joined as a third-party defendant. \n38. On 30 July 2019, this matter was designa ted as a mandatory complex \nbusiness case, (ECF No. 1), and assigned to the undersigned, (ECF No. 2).   \n39. On 21 November 2019, Defendants filed Defendants’ Motion for Judgment \nUpon the Pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c).  (ECF No. 32.)  On 8 May 2020, the Court \n \n \nentered the Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion for Judgment Upon the \nPleadings denying the Rule 12(c) motion.  (ECF No. 53.) \n40. On 21 August 2020, Defendants filed their Motion and Brief in Support of \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment .  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF \nNo. 58 [“Br. Supp.”].)   Plaintiff filed Plaintiff’s Brief in Opposition to Defendants’ \nImproper Motion for Summary Judgment on 23 October 2020.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp. Defs.’ \nImproper Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 64 [“Resp. Br.”].)   \n41. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on 9 December 2020.  (See ECF No. \n66.)  The Motion is ripe for resolution. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n42. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with t he affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule 56(c).  “A ‘genuine issue’ is \none that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, \n83 (2000). \n43. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \nHensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc. , 193 N.C. App. 56 1, 563 (2008).  The movant \nmay make the required showing by proving that “an essential element of the opposing \nparty’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an \naffirmative defense, or by showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot \n \n \nproduce evidence to support an essential element of her claim.”  Dobson, 352 N.C. at \n83 (citations omitted). \n44. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a for ecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784−85 \n(2000).  The Court must view the evidence in the light most favora ble to the \nnonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83.  However, the nonmovant “may not rest upon \nthe mere allegations or denials of its pleading, but its response , by affidavits or as \notherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that the re is a \ngenuine issue for trial.  If [the nonmovant] does not so respond, summary judgment, \nif appropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant].”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule \n56(e).        \nV. ANALYSIS \n45. As an initial matter, the Court addresses Plaintiff ’s argum ent that the \nCourt may not rule on the merits of the Motion  as a reconsideration of Judge Hall’s \norder on the Motion to Dismiss.  Concluding that the Court may rule on the merits of \nthe Motion for the reasons stated herein, the Court will address Plaintiff’s claims for \nbreach of contract and quantum meruit in turn.  \n \n \n \n \nA. The Order on the Rule 12 Motion to Dismiss Does Not Foreclose the \nRule 56 Motion \n46. Plaintiff argues that the Motion is improper because this Court is unable to \nreconsider issues determined by Judge Hall’s ruling on the Motion to Dismiss.  (Resp. \nBr. 1 –3.)  Plaintiff contends that “Defendants have now –once again —sought \njudgment on the exact same legal issues that have already been decided in this case.”  \n(Resp. Br. 3. (emphasis in original).)   \n47. “It is well established that, ordinarily, ‘no appeal lies from one Superior \nCourt judge to another; that one Superior Court judge may not correct another’s \nerrors of law; and that ordinarily one judge may not modify, overrul e, or change the \njudgment of another Superior Court judge previously made in the same action.’”  Fox \nv. Johnson, 243 N.C. App. 274, 282 (2015) (quoting Calloway v. Ford Motor Co. , 281 \nN.C. 496, 501 (1972)).  “The only exception occurs when three conditions are met: (1) \nthe subsequent order was rendered at a different stage of the proceeding, (2) the \nmaterials considered by the second judge were not the same, and (3) the first motion \ndid not present the same question as that raised by the later motion.”  Fox, 243 N.C. \nApp. at 282 (cleaned up). \n48. Plaintiff’s argument fails for three reasons.   First, the Motion occurs after \nthe completion of discovery, which is  at a different stage of proceeding  than the \nMotion to Dismiss, which was filed at the beginning of this litigation.  See Wake Cty. \nv. Hotels.com, L.P., 235 N.C. App. 633, 650–51 (2014).  Next, the Court now considers \ndifferent materials , including affidavits, email communications, and other \n \n \ndocuments, than those that were before Judge Hall .  See Durand v. Krispy Kreme \nDoughnuts, Inc., 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS 1360, at *16–18 (2011) (concluding a second \ntrial court judge could rule on a Rule 56 motion after the initial trial court judge ruled \non a Rule 12 motion in part because the second judge reviewed evidence not available \nto the first judge).  Lastly, the Motion presents a different question than the questions \nruled on in Judge Hall’s order on the Motion to Dismiss.  See Adkins v. Stanly Cty. \nBd. of Educ., 203 N.C. App. 642, 692 (2010) (“The trial court’s standards for a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment are different and \npresent separate legal questions.”). \nB. The Breach of Contract Claim Survives Summary Judgment \n49. Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim is based on Defendants alleged breach of \nthe Contingency Agreement for Defendants’  failure to pay Plaintiff for sums owed \npursuant to its terms.  (Compl. ¶¶ 69 –75.)  Plaintiff contends that it is entitled to \nrecover 1/3 of one million dollars, the alleged value of the Settlement Agreement, less \nthe $85,000 already paid by the City  to Plaintiff pursuant to the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement.  (Compl. ¶¶ 62–63.)  Defendants, on the other hand, contend \nthat Plaintiff may not pursue a claim based on alleged breach of a contingent fee \nagreement because the North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct (the “RPC (s)”) \nrequire there to be a written agreement signed by Defendants and none exists.  (Br. \nSupp. 9–11.) \n50. “An essential element of claim for breach of contr act is the existence of a \nvalid contract between two or more parties.”  Kerry Bodenhamer Farms, LLC v. \n \n \nNature’s Pearl Corp., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 27, 2017) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   RPC 1.5(c) provides th at “[a] \ncontingent fee agreement shall be in writing signed by the client[.]”   N.C.R. PROF’L \nCONDUCT r. 1.5(c) .  Failure to comply with RPC 1.5 may render a contingent fee \nagreement unenforceable.  Dunn v. Dart , 2011 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *26 –27 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. July 14, 2011) (concluding that any agreement between the parties was \nnot enforceable absent compliance with RPC 1.5(e)); see also Law Offices of Juliano, \nP.C. v. Jensen , 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190905, at *2– 3 (M.D.N.C. 2015)  (providing \nthat “it would be highly unlikely for the North Carolina courts to enforce” a contingent \nfee agreement unrelated to the actual work performed and not in compliance with the \nRPCs). \n51. Defendants contend that it “is undisputed that there is no written \ncontingent fee agreement signed by either Defendant[;]” therefore, Defendants are \nentitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.  (Br. Supp. 10–\n11.)  However, Defendants’ position that it is “undisputed” that the Contingency \nAgreement was not signed is erroneous. \n52. Rossabi testified that Scarfone requested that Plaintiff represent \nDefendants on a contingency fee basis.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 39.)  On 25 January 2018, \nRossabi, on behalf of Plaintiff, drafted the Contingency Agreement.  (Rossabi Aff. Ex. \nJ; Rossabi Aff. ¶ 49.)  Rossabi represents, by way of his sworn affidavit, that Scarfone \nreceived the Contingency Agreement  and that Scarfone represented to Rossabi on \n \n \nseveral occasions that Scarfone signed the Contingency Agreement, thereby agreeing \nto its terms on behalf of Defendants.  (Rossabi Aff. ¶¶ 51, 53, 60.)   \n53. Defendants contend that Furr, as Vice President of GGEG, was required to \nagree to the terms of the Contingency Agreement and he did not .  (Reply Br. Supp. \nDefs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 4, ECF No. 65 [“Reply”].)  T he Court interprets Defendants’ \nargument to be that even if Scarfone signed the Contingency Agreement, Defendants \nwould not be bound by its terms.  (See Reply 4.)  Despite Defendants’ position to the \ncontrary, Section 3.3 of GGEG’s Operating Agreement granted Scarfone the \nauthority, as the owner of a Majority in Interest of the Members , to execute the \nContingency Agreement without Furr’s approval .  ( See Operating Agreement § 3.3 ; \nRossabi Aff. ¶ 69.)   \n54. While Scarfone denies signing the Contingency Agreement , he does not \ndispute the factual contention set forth in Rossabi’s affidavit that Scarfone \nrepresented to Rossabi that Scarfone signed the Contingency Agreement.  ( See \nScarfone Aff. ¶¶ 45–56.) \n55. Whether the Contingency Agreement was ultimately signed by Scarfone is \na genuine issue of material fact that the Court is unable to resolve without \nconsidering the credibility of Rossabi and Scarfone, which is inappropriate at this \nstage of the proceeding.  See Anders v. Hyundai Motor Am. Corp. , 104 N.C. App. 61, \n67 ( 1991) (“On summary judgment the court does not weigh the credibility of the \nevidence.”); see also Vernon, Vernon, Wooten, Brown & Andrews, P.A. v. Miller, 73 \nN.C. App. 295, 298–99 (1985) (reversing entry of summary judgment and concluding \n \n \nthat the parties’ conflicting affidavits raised issues of credibility sufficient to defeat \nthe plaintiff’s summary judgment motion).    \n56. Defendants contend that “Plaintiff’s entire claim for breach of a contingent \nfee agreement rests upon Rossabi’s claim that Scarfone said he signed a contingent \nfee agreement.”  (Br. Supp. 10.)  The Court does not dispute Defendants’ contention.  \nHowever, Rossabi’s sworn statement that Scarfone represented to him on numerous \noccasions that Scarfone signed the Contingency Agreement , Scarfone’s failure to \ndispute that he represented that he signed the Contingency Agreement,  and the \nsubmission of the draft Cont ingency Agreement is sufficient, albeit minimally \nsufficient, to create a genuine issue of material fact  sufficient for the breach of \ncontract claim to survive the  Motion.  While Plaintiff has not come forward at this \nstage of the proceeding with a signed copy of the Contingency Agreement, that is not \na requirement at summary judgment , and it will ultimately be Plaintiff’s burden at \ntrial to establish the execution and validity of the Contingency Agreement.3    \n57. Therefore, the Court DENIES the Motion to the extent it requests that the \nCourt grant Defendants summary judgment on Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.     \nC. The Alternative Quantum Meruit  Claim Survives Summary \nJudgment \n58. As an alternative claim of relief to Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim, \nPlaintiff asserts a claim based on quantum meruit .  (Compl. 11.)   In sum, Plaintiff \n \n3 Defendants, without citation to any applicable North Carolina law, contend that \n“[c]ontingent fee agreements are subject to a statute of frauds.”  (Br. Supp. 11.)  However, the \nCourt does not find any support for Defendants’ position and declines to apply the statute of \nfrauds to the Contingency Agreement.  See generally N.C.G.S. § 22-1 et seq. \n \n \ncontends that, even if a valid and enforceable contract did not exist between the \nparties, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the reasonable value of the services rendered \nby it to Defendants.  (Compl. ¶¶ 78– 85.)  Defendants contend that  the hourly fee \nagreement between Plaintiff and Defendants, pursuant to which Plaintiff was paid  \nin full, precludes Plaintiff from bringing its quantum meruit  claim.  (Br. Supp. 13–\n15.)   \n59. “Quantum meruit  is a measure of recovery for the reasonable value of \nservices rendered in order to prevent unjust enrichment.”  Paul L. Whitfield, P.A., v. \nGilchrist, 348 N.C. 39, 42 (1998).  “To recover in quantum meruit, plaintiff must show: \n(1) services were rendered to defendants; (2) the services were knowingly and \nvoluntarily accepted; and (3) the services were not given gratuitously.”  Envtl. \nLandscape Design Specialist v. Shields, 75 N.C. App. 304, 306 (1985). \n60. As noted above, it is Defendants’ position that an hourly fee agreement \ngoverns the payment of Plaintiff’s legal fees and the City paid Defendants’ legal fees \nin full .  (Br. Supp. 13 –15.)  The plain reading of the Settlement Agreement runs \ncontrary to Defendants’ position.  The Settlement Agreement clearly limits the City’s \npayment of Defendants’ attorney’s fees to $85,000 but in no way indicates that the \n$85,000 represented all of Plaintif f’s legal fees.  (Settlement Agreement ¶ 19.)  The \nSettlement Agreement leaves open the possibility that Plaintiff may be entitled to \nmore compensation for its legal services and expressly provides that “[a]s to all other \n \n \ncosts and attorney’s fees [exceeding the $85,000 payment], the parties will bear their \nown costs and attorney’s fees.”  (Settlement Agreement ¶ 19.)     \n61. Furthermore, as the Court has already concluded herein, it is unable to \nresolve issues of material fact at this stage of the proceeding, including whether the \nContingency Agreement was signed or whether an hourly fee agreement governed \nthe parties’ relationship through resolution of the Cone Denim Action or expired on \n19 December 2017.  (See Rossabi Aff. ¶¶ 36, 41; Scarfone Aff. ¶¶ 12, 35, 45.)   \n62. Defendants also contend that North Carolina law does not permit Plaintiff \nto recover in quantum meruit  based on an “unsigned contingent fee letter [.]”  (Br. \nSupp. 15.)   Contrary to Defendants’ position that an unsigned contingent fee \nagreement precludes Plaintiff from proceeding with its quantum meruit claim, North \nCarolina courts have held that while a contingency fee agreement may ultimately be \nunenforceable, this fact a lone does not bar a quantum meruit claim.  Robertson v. \nSteris Corp., 234 N.C. App. 525, 537 (2014) (“[T]he fact that an agreement for legal \nrepresentation was determined to be in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct \nand unenforceable is of no consequence where an attorney’s right of recovery arises \nin quantum meruit , because the trial court’s award of fees is based upon the \nreasonable value of the attorney’s services and not upon the failed agreement.”) \n(cleaned up); In re Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *23– 24 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. June 20, 2018) (“North Carolina appellate courts have held that an \nunderlying RPC 1.5(c) violation does not necessarily bar any and all recovery of \n \n \nattorneys’ fees and expenses if there is a valid basis for recovery beyond the contract \nbetween the attorney and client, such as quantum meruit.”).   \n63. Comment 12 to RPC 1.5 provides that this Court’ s determination of the \nmerits of Plaintiff’s claims for its legal fees should be reached by “an applica tion of \nlaw to fact and not application of this Rule.”  N.C.R. PROF’L CONDUCT r. 1.5(c) cmt. \n12.  As provided in Robertson, the North Carolina Supreme Court has made clear that \nan attorney, absent a contract, is “entitled to recover the amount that is reas onable \nand customary for work of like kind, performed under like conditions and \ncircumstances.”  Robertson, 234 N.C. App. at 537 (quoting Forester v. Betts, 179 N.C. \n681, 682 (1920)) ; see also Jamerson v. Logan , 228 N.C. 540, 544 –45 (1948) ( “Where \nthe plaintiff alleged a contract to pay for services performed, and upon the trial, failed \nto prove a special contract, but did prove the performance of the services and their \nvalue: Held, that he was entitled to recover upon quantum meruit [.]”)  Accordingly, \nshould Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim fail at a trial on the merits, Plaintiff is \npermitted to proceed on its  alternative claim for  quantum meruit  consistent with \nNorth Carolina law.   \n64. Therefore, the Court DENIES the Motion to the extent Defendants request \nthat the Court award summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiff’s quantum \nmeruit claim.   \nVI.      CONCLUSION \n65. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES  the Motion  and \nPlaintiff’s breach of contract claim and quantum meruit claim will proceed to trial. \n \n \n66. The Court shall set this matter for trial by separate order after consultation \nwith counsel for the parties, consistent with the Guilford County Jury Trial \nResumption Plan as implemented in the North Carolina Business Court. \nSO ORDERED, this the 5th day of May, 2021. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
