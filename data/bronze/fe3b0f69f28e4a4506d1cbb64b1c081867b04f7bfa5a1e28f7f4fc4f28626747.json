Sec ond Jud. Dist. Ct. May 12, \n2006).  The motion also indicated that some cy pr es distribution would be made subject to Court \napproval and that the cy pres  distribution should be to “public and/or non-profit entities that use \nMSG and Nucleotides and/or products  that use MSG or Nucleotides.”  Id. at 6.  What these \nentities may be is not specified, nor is the manner of their selection clear. \nNor can the Court glean from the pleadings before it what the attorneys fees and expenses \nwill be.  Thus, the bottom line number of dollars to come to North Carolina residents and the \nmanner in which those funds will be distributed is unclear. \nThe Court would call to the attention of counsel this Court’s opinion in Teague v. Bayer \nAG, 2007 NCBC 12 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 7, 2007), and the public policy expressed by the North \nCarolina General Assembly in section 1-267.10 of  the General Statutes that any class action \nfunds not distributed to or for th e benefit of class members be al located in accordance with the \nstatute.  The Court will await a formal motion to dismiss accompanied by more complete details. \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED, this the 7th day of May, 2007. \n \n \n       \n "
