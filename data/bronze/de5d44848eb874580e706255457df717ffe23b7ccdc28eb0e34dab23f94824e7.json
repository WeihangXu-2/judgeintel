While the Court does not make findings of fact on a motion for summary \njudgment, “it is helpful to the parties and the courts for the trial judge to articulate a \nsummary of the material facts which he considers are not at issue and which justify \nentry of judgment.”  Collier v. Collier, 204 N.C. App. 160, 161–62 (2010) (citation and \nquotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, the following background, drawn from the \nundisputed evidence submitted by the parties, is intended only to provide context for \nthe Court’s analysis and ruling and not to resolve issues of material fact. \n4. Defendant Window World, Inc. (“Window World”) is a replacement window \nand exterior remodeling company incorporated in North Carolina and headquartered \nin Wilkes County.\n6  Through a network of independently owned and operated stores, \nWindow World “ sell[s] and install[s] vinyl replacement windows, doors and siding, \nand related accessories to the public.”7  Defendant Window World International, LLC \n(“WWI”) is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business \nin Wilkes County, North Carolina. 8  WWI is a holding company whose primary \npurpose is to own and manage the Window World trademarks. 9  Defendant Tammy \n \n6 (15-CVS-1 Third Am.

Defendants’ first appendix is a compilation of depositions taken \nduring the course of discovery.  For ease of reference, the Court will cite to appendix pages \nand state to whom the deposition excerpt is attributed. \n \nWhitworth (“Ms. Whitworth”) is Window World’s CEO and the sole owner  of both \nWindow World and WWI.10   \n5. Plaintiffs are current franchisees of Window World. 11  They purchase \n“products (including vinyl replacement windows, doors and siding, and related \naccessories) at wholesale [from Window World- designated suppliers] and then sell \nand install them at retail under the ‘Window World’ name .”12  Window World \n“licenses use of the ‘Window World’ trademark and other associated trademarks to [ ] \nfranchisees.”13   \n6. For purposes of these Motions, Plaintiffs are organized into eight groups \nbased on franchise ownership and location: (i) Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC, \nWindow World of Dallas, LLC, Window World of Tri State Area, LLC, and James W. \nRoland (the “Roland Plaintiffs”); (ii) Window World of St. Louis, Inc., Window World \nof Kansas City, Inc., Window World of Springfield/Peoria, Inc., James T.

Window World was founded by Leon Whitworth in 1995 as a single store.14  \nBy 1998, however, Window World started licensing use of its trademarks to enable \nindependent storeowners to operate Window World stores in exclusive territories.15 \n8. To open a Window World store, storeowners were required to pay Window \nWorld an initial licensing fee or, alternatively, a prior storeowner’s debt in lieu of the \nlicensing fee.\n16  In addition to the licensing fee s, Window World generated revenue \nthrough s upplier rebates on windows and  sold to the storeowners.17  \n \n14 (Defs.’ 2d App. 2.App.17452 (Affidavit of Ruben Leon Whitworth).)   \n \n15 (Defs.’ 2d App. 2.App.17454 (Affidavit of Ruben Leon Whitworth).) \n \n16 (Pls.’ Br.

The designated vendors would integrate the rebate \namounts paid to Window World into the prices charged to storeowners.18 \n9. Between 200 1 and 2011, Plaintiffs began operating Window World \nlocations.19  Plaintiffs state that Leon Whitworth, and later Todd Whitworth, Window \nWorld’s CEO from 2007 to 2010, recruited them to become licensees of the Window \nWorld brand through in -person sales pitches and individual conversations with \nPlaintiffs.20  Plaintiffs allege that the Whitworths induced them “to become Window \nWorld dealers [by telling them Window World] would secure the best pri ce on the \nwindows through [Window World’s] collective buying power”  (emphasis added). 21  \nMore specifically, Plaintiffs  contend they “were told that by joining [Window World] \nthey would gain access to best pricing, better than could be obtained outside of the \nWindow World system.” 22  Plaintiffs further allege that they were informed they \n \n18 (See, e.g., Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.10447–10450 (Howard Blair Ingle).)  , \n ( se e, e.g. , Defs.’ 1st App. \n1.App.1199 (James Lomax, III); 1.App.2587 (Jonathan Gillette); 1.App.8174 (Tommy Jones); \n1.App.8356 (Jeremy Shumate).).   \n \n19 (See Pls.’ Br.

Window World refers to this base -level “best pricing” available to all \nstoreowners as “A pricing.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 9 ; see also Defs.’ 1st App. \n1.App.14146 (Mark Bumgarner).)   \n  \n\nwould gain access to even lower pricing if they “met a volume benchmark” set by \nWindow World.23  \n10. While Plaintiffs acknowledge Window World informed them that the \ncompany made money through supplier rebates on products sold to the storeowners, \nPlaintiffs contend Window World represented to Plaintiffs that “they would pay no \nmore than $10 per window  to [Window World] and that these ‘rebates’ would be \ncollected and remitted as part of Plaintiffs’ window purchases” (emphasis added).24   \n11. Although some Plaintiffs signed a written “Licensing Agreement” or \n“Franchise Agreement” with Window World immediately upon beginning operations \nat a Window World location, other Plaintiffs operated their Window World location \nfor months before signing a written agreement.\n25  Similarly, many Plaintiffs operated \n \n23 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 9 ; see also Volume One Pls.’ Exs. Ex. 13 .)  Window \nWorld refers to this pricing available to storeowners who meet certain volume benchmarks \nas “B pricing.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 9 ; see also Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.14146 \n(Mark Bumgarner).) \n \n24 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 10–11; see also Volume One Pls.’ Exs.

Window World, however, contends the company \ndid not agree in the written contracts executed with Plaintiffs to limit rebate amounts and \nthe company was thus “contractually free to change the rebate amounts at any time and \nwithout notice.”  (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 43, ECF No. 1010 (sealed), 1020 (redacted).) \n \n25 (See Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 3.)  For instance, though the Jones Plaintiffs \nacquired their Lexington, Kentucky store in August or September 2001, they did not sign a \nwritten “Licensing Agreement” until 28 February 2002.   (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. \nJ. Ex. 3.)  The fact that some Plaintiffs began operations before the written agreements were \nsigned is important because the parties dispute whether the written agreements or the \nparties’ oral agreements and course of dealing govern the nature of the parties’ relationship.   \n \ntheir stores for months, or even years, in the absence of a written agreement after the \nend of the initial “Licensing” or “Franchise” Agreement’s term.26   \n12. The written agreements initially signed by Plaintiffs generally classified \nPlaintiffs as “Licensees” and Window World as a “Licensor.” 27  Although some of the \ninitial agreements purported to grant a franchise, the agreements did not include any \nfranchise-related disclosures.\n28  In fact, the written agreements signed by most \nPlaintiffs between 2008 and 2011 specifically provided the agreements did not create \na franchise relationship: \nNothing in this Licensing Agreement shall be deemed to create any type \nof partnership, employment, agency, franchise, or other business \nrelationship other than LICENSOR and LICENSEE.  The parties \nacknowledge and agree that, to the extent the state in which the \nLICENSEE is granted its license has enacted statutes, codes, or \nregulations which govern franchises, the LICENSEE and LICENSOR \nare not subject to such laws and regulations and the LICENSOR shall \nnot be required to provide any disclosures to LICENSEE other than \nthose previously made to LICENSEE or made herein.  The LICENSEE \nagrees that the terms of the Licensing Agreement and the \nLICENSOR/LICENSEE relationship created hereunder shall be \ndeterminative of the rights and interests between the parties \nnotwithstanding any statutes, rules, or regulations governing franchises \nin the state where the LICENSEE does business.\n29  \n \n26 (See Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J.

Beginning in the early 2000s, Window World sought to “ professionalize.”30  \nTo that end, Window World  made several changes to its corporate structure and \ngovernance: \na. Window World  hired Howard Blair Ingle (“ Mr. Ingle”) as its CFO in \nSeptember 200731 and later promoted him to P resident of the company in \n2009;32   \nb. around early 2010, Window World, at the direction of Mr. Ingle, hired Beth \nVannoy (“ Ms. Vannoy”) as outside counsel purportedly to “look into the \npossibility of Window World becoming a franchise system , for business \nreasons.”33  Later the same year, Window World hired Ms. Vannoy as in-\nhouse counsel, where she testified she continued to “gather information for \na possible move to a franchise system”;34 \nc. in June 2010, WWI was formed 35 and Window World transferred all of its \nintellectual property assets (the “2010 Transfer”), including but not limited \n \n30 (Defs.’ Br.

After Ms. Vannoy consulted with outside counsel and outside counsel \nconsulted with regulators in several  states in which Window World had stores \nregarding whether Window World’s business structure  was subject to federal and \nstate franchising laws, the Window World board voted to “move forward with \nbecoming a franchise system” on 9 August 2011.38   \n15. To facilitate its purported transition to a franchise system, Window World \n“issued a form rescission letter [accompanied by franchise disclosure documents] to \nall store owners in October 2011  . . .

Pursuant to this schedule, the parties timely filed the Cross -Motions on 18 \nOctober 2023.  In the Cross-Motions, Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on their \nclaims for fraud, declaratory judgment, violation of N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1, negligent \nmisrepresentation, fraudulent transfer, and piercing the corporate veil .

Plaintiffs’ Motion excludes \nthe “Alternative Counterclaim” asserted by Ms. Whitworth  in the Answer filed on 27 July \n2017.  (Answer & Alt. Countercl. of Tammy Whitworth.)   \n \n67 Subparagraph (d) of Window World’s Fifth Additional Defense, asserted in the Answer and \nCounterclaims filed in 15-CVS-2 (the St. Louis Action) on 14 February 2017, states as follows: \n \nPlaintiffs’ claims are barred by all applicable statutes of limitations, statutes \nof repose, and borrowing statutes as follows:  . . .

Countercl. of Tammy Whitworth.) \n \n70 Tammy Whitworth’s Eighth Additional Defense, asserted in the Answer and Alternative \nCounterclaim filed in both 15-CVS-1 and 15-CVS-2 on 27 July 2017, alleges that “Plaintiffs’ \nclaims for breach of contract are barred to the extent they have committed their own \nantecedent breaches of the contracts.”  (15-CVS-1 Answer & Alt. Countercl. of Tammy \nWhitworth; 15-CVS-2 Answer & Alt. Countercl. of Tammy Whitworth; see also Pls.’ Mot.) \n \n71 (Defs.’ Mot.)   \n \n72 (Am. Notice Hearing, ECF No. 1016.) \nII. \nCHOICE OF LAW \n26. A “choice of law” contract clause provides “that the substantive laws of a \nparticular state [shall] govern the construction and validity of the contract.”  Cable  \nTel Servs., Inc. v. Overland Contracting, Inc. , 154 N.C. App. 639, 641 (2002).  The \ngeneral rule in North Carolina is that “where parties to a contract have agreed that \na given jurisdiction’s substantive law shall govern the interpretation of the contract, \nsuch a contractual provision will be given effect.”  Tanglewood Land Co. v. Byrd, 299 \nN.C. 260, 262 (1980).  Our courts, however, will not enforce a choice of law provision \nwhere: \n(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the \ntransaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties’ choice, \nor (b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a \nfundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest \nthan the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and \nwhich . . . would be the state of applicable law in the absence of an \neffective choice of law by the parties. \n \nCable Tel  Servs., Inc. , 154 N.C. App. at 642 –43 (citing  Restatement (Second) of \nConflict of Laws § 187 (1971)); see also Bundy v. Commercial Credit Co., 200 N.C. 511, \n516 (1931) (refusing to apply parties’ choice of Delaware law because their contractual \nstipulation was “immaterial” in that the “record [did] not disclose that any \ntransaction took place in Delaware or that the parties even contemplated ei ther the \nmaking or the performance of the contract in said State.”).   \n27. Plaintiffs in this action are foreign limited liability organizations, none of \nwhich conduct business in North Carolina.  However, in their executed written \nagreements, Plaintiffs consented that their licensing or franchise agreements “shall \nbe governed and interpreted by the laws of the State of North Carolina.”73  As North \nCarolina has a substantial relationship to the parties —Defendant Window World is \nincorporated in North Carolina and headquartered in Wilkes County —and the \napplication of North Carolina law is not, on its face, contrary to a “fundamental policy \nof a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the \ndetermination of the particular issue,” this Court will apply North Carolina law to \nthe disputed issues.  The parties do not dispute that North Carolina law  applies to \nthe issues presented by the Motions.    \nIII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n28. Under Rule 56(c), “[s]ummary  judgment is appropriate ‘if the pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the \naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \nany party is entitled to a judgment as a  matter of law.’ ”  Da Silva v. WakeMed, 375 \nN.C. 1, 10 (2020) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  “A genuine issue of material fact is \none that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Curlee v. Johnson, 377 N.C. 97, \n101 (2021) (cleaned up).  “Substanti al evidence is such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and means more \nthan a scintilla or a permissible inference[.]”  DeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co. , 355 \nN.C. 672, 681 (2002) (cleaned up).  “An issue is material if, as alleged, facts ‘would \n \n73 ( See, e.g. , Defs.’ 2d App. 2.App.16476, 16489, 16502, 16515, 16543, 16561  (Licensing \nAgreements).) \nconstitute a legal defense, or would affect the result of the action or if its resolution \nwould prevent the party against whom it is resolved from prevailing in the action.’  ”  \nBartley v. City of High Point , 381 N.C. 287, 292 (2022) (quoting Koontz v. City of \nWinston-Salem, 280 N.C. 513, 518 (1972)).  “When considering a motion for summary \njudgment, the trial judge must view the presented evidence in a light most favorable \nto the nonmoving party.”  Belmont Ass’n v. Farwig, 381 N.C. 306, 310 (2022) (quoting \nDalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651 (2001)).  \n29. “The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579 (2002).  The movant may meet this burden either \n(1) “by proving an essential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, \ncannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense,” or (2) “by \nshowing through disc overy that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to \nsupport an essential element of [its] claim[.]”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83 (2000) \n(cleaned up).  If the movant meets its burden, “the burden shifts to the nonmoving \nparty to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that the nonmoving party will \nbe able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial[.]”  Cummings v. Carroll , 379 \nN.C. 347, 358 (2021) (cleaned up); see also N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (“[A]n adverse party \nmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, \nby affidavits or as otherwise p rovided in this rule, must set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”).  \n30. When a party requests offensive summary judgment on its own claims for \nrelief, as Plaintiffs do here , “a greater burden must be met.”  Brooks v. Mt. Airy \nRainbow Farms Ctr., Inc. , 48 N.C. App. 726, 728 (1980).  The moving party “must \nshow that there are no genuine issues of fact, that there are no gaps in his proof, that \nno inferences inconsistent with his recovery arise from the evidence, and that there \nis no standard that must be applied to the facts by the jury.”  Parks Chevrolet, Inc. v. \nWatkins, 74 N.C. App. 719, 721 (1985).  For that reason, it is “rarely  . . . proper to \nenter summary judgment in favor of the party having the burden of proof.”  Blackwell \nv. Massey, 69 N.C. App. 240, 243 (1984). \nIV. \nANALYSIS \n31. As a foundational matter, the parties dispute what governs the parties’ \nbusiness relationship —the parties’ course of dealings and oral discussions or the \nwritten agreements executed by the parties.  Plaintiffs allege that, between 2002 and \n2011, they “entered into a regular, definite, and consistent course of dealings \nestablishing a business relationship between themselves and franchisees owned by \nthem . . ., on the one hand, and [Window World], on the other hand.”\n74  Plaintiffs \ncontend that  “[a]lthough the parties executed a number of written ‘Licensing \nAgreements’ during the relevant time period, the parties’ business relationship \nexisted independent of those written agreements, predated the execution of those \nwritten agreements, continued unabated and unaltered after the expiration of those \n \n74 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 30; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 65.) \n \nwritten agreements, and was not limited by those written agreements.” 75  \nDefendants, in contrast, contend that “Plaintiffs all signed written licensing \nagreements when they joined Window World” and that “[t]hose writings established \nthe material terms of Plaintiffs’ business relationship with [Window World].”76 \n32. In their initial pleadings, Plaintiffs assert several theories concerning why \nthe executed written agreements are “null, invalid, and unenforceable against \nPlaintiffs” and the parties’ course of dealings and oral discussions control. 77  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, the written agreements are invalid because: \n(1) “the cause and/or object of the agreement[s], as intended by [Window World], \nwas illegal”;78 \n(2) “enforcement of such agreements against Plaintiffs would be against public \npolicy . . . expressed in the Franchise Disclosure Rule’s requirements \napplicable to franchisors”;79 \n(3) the written agreements were “induced by [Window World’s] fraud”;80 and \n \n75 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 30; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 65.) \n \n76 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 1.) \n \n77 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 223; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 322.) \n \n78 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 224; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 323.) \n \n79 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 226; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 325.) \n \n80 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 227; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 326.) \n \n(4) “the putative obligations in the prior agreements are not enforceable against \nPlaintiffs because they arise from adhesionary contracts.”81 \n33. Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ causes of action for (1) a \ndeclaratory judgment that any and all prior written L icensing Agreements are null, \ninvalid, and unenforceable (First Cause of Action in the Baton Rouge Action/Third \nCause of Action in the St. Louis Action); (2) a declaratory judgment that Plaintiffs \nhave the right to continue to operate on the terms established by the parties’ course \nof dealings, rather than the written agreements (Second Cause of Action in the Baton \nRouge Action/Fourth Cause of Action in the St. Louis Action); (3) fraud (Sixth Cause \nof Action in the Baton Rouge Action/Eighth Cause of Action in the St. Louis Action)  \nand (4) negligent misrepresentation (Seventh Cause of Action in the Baton Rouge \nAction/Ninth Cause of Action in the St. Louis Action) .  Plaintiffs, in their cross -\nmotion, also seek offensive summary judgment on their negligent misrepresentation \nand fraud-based claims.  The Court will address  each of these motions for summary \njudgment before turning to the remaining claims at issue, beginning with the cross -\nmotions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ cause of action for fraud. \nA. Fraud \n34. Plaintiffs allege that Window World “failed to disclose, and in fact \nconcealed . . . information from Plaintiffs” to induce Plaintiffs to “operate as Window \nWorld franchisees, to assume debt owed by prior franchisees to vendors such as AMI, \nto continue to operate as Window World franchisees, to pay substantial amounts \n \n81 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 231; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 330.) \n \nadvertising Window World trademarks, and to make purchases from various \nsuppliers, including AMI.”82 \n35. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Window World: \nfraudulently concealed from Plaintiffs that [Window World]  is a \nfranchise subject to franchise disclosure laws, that Plaintiffs must pay \ncertain fees to [Window World]  or affiliates of [Window World] , that \n[Window World]  or its owners have ownership interests in certain \nsuppliers, that [Window World]  derives revenue from Plaintiffs’ \npurchase of products or supplies[,] the undisclosed kickbacks or rebates \n[Window World]  received on Plaintiffs’ purchase of products and \nsupplies, that the prices charged Plaint iffs for products and supplies \nfrom approved suppliers were inflated to provide greater revenue to \n[Window World], that the undisclosed kickbacks and rebates represent \nall or part of the promised volume discount, that [Window World]  \nprovided undisclosed “C” pricing to certain franchisees with lower levels \nof sales while representing that Plaintiffs were receiving the most \nfavorable “B” pricing, that [Window World]  receives other undisclosed \ncompensation and consideration from its approved suppliers, and tha t \n[Window World] itself was obligated to pay some or all of the debt that \n[Window World] required Plaintiffs to assume that was owed by prior \nfranchisees to vendors such as AMI.\n83 \n \n36. As a result of the alleged misrepresentations and omissions  listed above, \nPlaintiffs contend Window World “committed fraud in at least five distinct ways.” 84  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, Window World:  \n(1) “grossly misrepresented the royalties or ‘rebates’ Plaintiffs would pay [through \nWindow World -designated suppliers to Window World] to do business as \nWindow World dealers” (the “Rebate Misrepresentation Theory”);  \n \n82 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 263; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 367.) \n \n83 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 262; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 366.) \n \n84 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 44, ECF No. 976 (sealed), 1000 (redacted).) \n \n(2) “falsely promised that Plaintiffs would receive best pricing on the products \nthey purchased from [Window World-designated] suppliers” (the “Best Pricing \nTheory”);  \n(3) “knowingly concealed material facts it was duty -bound to disclose under \nfranchise law and otherwise, despite awareness of its legal obligation to do so” \n(the “Fraudulent Concealment Theory”); \n(4) “falsely disclaimed application of franchise law in the licensing agreements it \npresented to Plaintiffs to sign after June 2008”  (the “ Franchise Disclaimer \nTheory”); and \n(5) “in 2009, [Window World] misrepresented increases in the already-fraudulent \nrebates Plaintiffs paid” (the “2009 Price Increase Theory”).85   \n37. Window World’s fraud, Plaintiffs argue, “renders the written agreements \nPlaintiffs executed . . . void and unenforceable.”86 \n38. Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs’ fraud claims, contending  that \nDefendants are not liable on any of the five grounds listed above and, relatedly, that \nthe written agreements Plaintiffs executed are enforceable.  Defendants further \ncontend most of Plaintiffs’ fraud claims should be dismissed because they were \nbrought after the applicable statute of limitations  had expired.  The Court will \naddress each ground for fraud identified by Plaintiffs, as well as Defendants’ statute \nof limitations arguments, in turn.   \n \n85 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 44–45.) \n \n86 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 49.) \n \nElements of Fraud \n39. A claim for fraud may be based on an “affirmative misrepresentation of a \nmaterial fact, or [ ] a failure to disclose a material fact relating to a transaction which \nthe parties had a duty to disclose.”  Hardin v. KCS Int’l, Inc., 199 N.C. App. 687, 696 \n(2009) (internal citation omitted).  The “essential elements of actionable fraud are \nwell established: (1) False representation or concealment of a [past or existing] \nmaterial fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) \nwhich does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the injured party.”  Tillery Env’t, \nLLC v. A & D Holdings, Inc., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *19–20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. \n9, 2019) (alteration in original) (quoting Ragsdale v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, 138 \n(1974)).   \n40. For purposes of fraud, “a fact is material if, had it been known to the party, \nit would have influenced the party’s judgment or decision in making the contract.”  \nShaw v. Gee, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 21, 2016) (citing \nWhite Sewing Mach. Co. v. Bullock, 161 N.C. 1, 7 (1912)).  Further, as a general rule, \na claimant’s reliance on allegedly false statements must be reasonable, though the \nreasonableness of such reliance is typically a question for the jury.  Forbis v. Neal , \n361 N.C. 519, 527 (2007); Johnson v. Owens , 263 N.C. 754, 758 (1965) (“[W]here \nreliance ceases to be reasonable and becomes such negligence and inattention that it \nwill, as a matter of law, bar recovery for fraud is frequently very difficult to \ndetermine.”).      \n41. In alleging fraud by concealment  or omission, Plaintiffs must additionally \nshow that Defendants “had a duty to disclose material information to them, as silence \nis fraudulent only when there is a duty to speak.”  Lawrence v. UMLIC -Five Corp., \n2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 18, 2007) (citing Griffin v. Wheeler -\nLeonard & Co., 290 N.C. 185, 198 (1976)).  When two parties are engaged in an arm’s-\nlength transaction, two different scenarios will create a duty to disclose.  The first is \nwhen one party takes an affirmative step to conceal a material fact from the other.  \nHardin, 199 N.C. App. at  696; see also Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 138– 40.  A concealed \nfact is considered material when it would have influenced the decision or judgment \nof another party, if known.  White Sewing Mach. Co., 161 N.C. at 7; see also Godfrey \nv. Res-Care, Inc., 165 N.C. App. 68, 75–76 (2004).  The second is when “one party has \nknowledge of a latent defect in the subject matter of the negotiations about which the \nother party is both ignorant and unable to discover through reasonable diligence.”   \nHardin, 199 N.C. App. at 696  (quoting Sidden v. Mailman, 137 N.C. App. 669, 675  \n(2000)).   \n42. In addition to these situations, even when no duty to disclose exists, a party \nwho chooses to speak has a duty to make a full and fair disclosure of facts concerning \nthe matters on which he chooses to speak.  Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 139 (citing Low v. \nWheeler, 207 Cal. App. 2d 477,  484 (Ct. App. 1962) (“Even where there is no duty to \nmake a disclosure, when one does undertake to inform, he must speak the whole \ntruth.”)).    \nGround 1: Rebate Misrepresentation Theory \n43. Plaintiffs first contend that Window World “committed fraud by knowingly \nmisrepresenting the most basic financial element of the parties’ relationships: what \nPlaintiffs paid [Window World] for the right to do business under the Window World \nname.”87  Plaintiffs assert that Window World’s “rebate promises were central to their \ndecision to become dealers, that they trusted the promises [Window World] made, \nand that those promises led them to invest in the Window World brand.”\n88   \n44. S pecifically, Plaintiffs argue that Window World committed fraud by \nmisrepresenting the rebate amounts Plaintiffs would pay to Window World on \nwindows and .\n89  According to Plaintiffs, “[t]he record is undisputed \nthat [Window World] promised Plaintiffs that they would not pay more than $10 a \nwindow in rebates.”\n90  Despite promises made to Plaintiffs, Window World allegedly \n“had no intention of honoring these promises, and it did not do so.”91  Window World’s \nfraudulent conduct, Plaintiffs allege, is evidenced by the fact that Window World “was \nalready collecting rebates far in excess of the represented amounts when Plaintiffs \nbegan operating[.]”92 \n \n87 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 46.) \n \n88 (Pls.’ Reply Br. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Partial Summ. J.  23 [hereinafter “Pls.’ Reply Br.”] , ECF \nNo. 1025 (sealed), 1039 (redacted).) \n \n89 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 46–49.) \n \n90 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 46.) \n \n91 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 46.) \n \n92 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 46.) \n \n\n45. Furthermore, Plaintiffs contend that Window World’s rebate promises “were \nmaterial to each Plaintiff’s decision to become a [Window World] dealer,”93 Plaintiffs’ \nreliance on Window World’s rebate misrepresentations was reasonable, and \n“Plaintiffs were damaged [by Window World’s misrepresentations] in an amount \nequal to the difference between the rebates they were fraudulently promised and the \nrebates they actually paid.”94 \n46. Defendants seek to dismiss Plaintiffs’ fraud claim based on the alleged \nrebate misrepresentation, arguing that “Plaintiffs cannot establish any element [of \nfraud], much less run the table, for their rebate -fraud theory.” 95  Specifically, \nDefendants contend  that no Plaintiff group can establish the first element —that \nWindow World made a false misrepresentation of a material fact—as: \na. “most Plaintiffs did not testify that [Window World] promised that \nPlaintiffs’ rebate amounts would never exceed $10 per window”;\n96 \nb. “[s]ome Plaintiffs admitted that there was no discussion of rebate amounts \nuntil after signing a licensing agreement . . . [meaning that] these Plaintiffs \n \n93 (Pls.’ Reply Br. 22; see also Pls.’ Reply Br.

[t]hus, this information couldn’t \nhave been material.”\n100 \n47. Defendants further argue that there is “no evidence [Window World] sought \nto induce Plaintiffs’ reliance on the rebate amounts,”101 “Plaintiffs couldn’t reasonably \nrely on rebate representations that didn’t form part of the deal, no r could they \n \n97 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 39 ; see, e.g., Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App .1888 (James Lomax, \nIII); 1.App.5354–55 (Melissa Edwards); 1.App.8763 (Tommy Jones).) \n \n98 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ.

J. 42.) \n \n\nreasonably assume that the rebate amounts would stay at the same level forever,”102 \nand “Plaintiffs have not shown any damages associated with the alleged rebate \nfraud.”103 \n48. To be successful in their motion for summary judgment, Defendants must \ndemonstrate either (1) an “essential element of [Plaintiffs’ fraud] claim does not exist, \ncannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense” or (2) \nPlaintiffs “cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of [their fraud] \nclaim[.]”  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83.     \n49. Since Plaintiffs are moving for offensive summary judgment on their fraud \nclaims, they bear a much greater burden.  As stated above, to succeed, Plaintiffs must \nshow “that there are no gaps in [their] proof, that no inferences inconsistent with \n[their] recovery arise from the evidence, and that there is no standard that must be \napplied to the facts by the jury.”   Ford v. Jurgens, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 10 , *3 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 2, 2021) (citing Parks Chevrolet, Inc. v. Watkins, 74 N.C. App. 719, \n721 (1985)).  As with all motions for summary judgment, the C ourt must view “the \nevidence ‘in the light most favorable to’ [the non-moving party], taking their evidence \nas true and drawing inferences in their favor.”  Id.  (citing Furr v. K-Mart Corp., 142 \nN.C. App. 325, 327 (2001)).    \n50. Based on a careful review of the evidence advanced by the parties, the Court \nfirst concludes that Defendants’ Motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ fraud \n \n102 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 43.) \n \n103 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 45.) \nclaim based on rebate misrepresentation should be granted as it applies to the \nBallard Plaintiffs, the Ford Plaintiffs, the Jones/Shumate Plaintiffs, the Rose \nPlaintiffs, and these Plaintiffs’ related entities.  The foregoing Plaintiffs have not met \ntheir burden at the summary judgment stage of providing substantial evidence to \nsupport a conclusion that Window World misrepresented the rebate amounts \nPlaintiffs would pay to Window World.   \n51. In his deposition, James Ballard testified that Leon Whitworth did not make \nany specific representations to him regarding rebate amounts prior to his becoming \na Window World storeowner: \nQ: Did Leon Whitworth disclose to you the amount of the rebate that \nWindow World was to receive on purchases of approved products?   \n \nA: He just said a small margin, you know, a few dollars of windows is \nwhat he said.  He didn’t give me no specific amounts, no.”\n104  \n  \n52. The Ford , Rose , Jones, and Shumate  Plaintiffs similarly testif ied that \nneither Leon Whitworth, nor any other Window World representative, made specific \nrepresentations to them regarding rebate amounts prior to them becoming Window \nWorld storeowners.105   \n \n104 (Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.145 (James Ballard).)  Toni Ballard also testified she did not have \nany discussions with Window World regarding rebates or rebate amounts.  (Defs.’ 1st App.  \n1.App.573 (Toni Ballard).)   \n \n105 (Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.3846–47 (“The original agreement, Leon, with – with who I trusted, \nsaid [the rebate] would be a couple of bucks per window.”), 3973, 3979, 4505– 06 (Kenneth \nFord, Jr.); 1.App.4173 (“Rick Collins had mentioned that Window World gets something from \nthe manufacturer.  He didn’t say how much.”), 4177 (Angell Wesner-Ford); 1.App.6201 (“I did \nnot know what the rebate was . . . I don’t remember Leon saying a number.”), 6217–19, 6695 \n(Rick Rose); 1.App.6655, 6694 (Christina Rose); 1.App.8088– 90 (“Q: So you don’t recall any \nparticular amount of money that – A: One, that was 18 years ago.  That five or ten dollar \ncomment for some reason sounds familiar, but again, that was 18 years ago.”), 8794 (Tommy \n \n53. Since the foregoing Plaintiffs failed to provide substantial evidence to \ndemonstrate that the first element of a claim for fraud —that there was a false \nrepresentation of a material fact—existed or could be proven at trial, the Court need \nnot consider whether these Plaintiffs have met their summary judgment burden \nregarding the remaining elements.   \n54. R egarding the remaining Plaintiffs —the Edwards, Lomax/Gillette, Roland, \nand Williamson/Hopkins Plaintiffs—the Court finds that these Plaintiffs have met \ntheir burden at the summary judgment stage of providing substantial evidence to \nsupport a conclusion that Window World misrepresented the rebate amounts these \nPlaintiffs would pay to Window World.  The remaining Plaintiffs provided evidence \nthat (1) prior to their signing written agreements with Window World, Window World \nrepresented to them that they would not pay more than ten dollars in rebates per \nwindow and  (2 ) Plaintiffs paid .106  \n \nJones); 1.App.8763 (“Q: Did you ever ask [Leon Whitworth] how big those rebates were?  A: \nNo. He just always said that with our buying power together that no one could buy cheaper \nthan we do.”) (Jeremy Shumate).)   \n \n106 (Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.2708–09 (“Leon had, in our initial meetings, told me that, when he \nexplained the whole Window World system, that in exchange for providing the best pricing, \nthat they took a little, they were able to negotiate great prices because they used the buying \npower of all of the Window World stores out there, and that they would take a little off the \ntop.  And that little, he explained to me, was $10 . . . per window.”), 2823, 3428 (James \nRoland); 1.App.1183 (“I’ve seen the price list from 2001, or the rebate list that showed the \n  \n  \n . . . .[Leon Whitworth’s] exact words were something to the effect of, you know, \nwe weren’t trying to get rich.  We were going to make five or ten bucks a window.”), 1221–23, \n1249, 1888 (James Lomax, III); 1.App.7847–50 (“Q: So is it fair to say that your \nunderstanding is that Window World would never be able to receive a rebate on any product \nother than windows?  Is that your understanding?  A: That was what Leon told me.  I mean, \nmy understanding is just what Leon to ld me.  Leon said, you know, “I make ten bucks a \n \n\nFurthermore, the Court finds that these Plaintiffs have provided substantial evidence \nto support a conclusion that the rebate amounts were material to Plaintiffs.  In their \ndepositions, these Plaintiffs testified that representations surrounding pricing and \nrebates formed the foundation of their  relationship with Window World and the \nrebate amounts induced Plaintiffs, at least in part, to contract with Window World.107 \n55. The Edwards, Lomax/Gillette, Roland, and Williamson/Hopkins Plaintiffs  \nhave similarly put forth substantial evidence to s upport the remaining scienter, \nreliance, and injury elements of a prima facie case for fraud .  In a claim for fraud, \n \nwindow and you guys sell a bunch of windows,” and that’s how it works.”) (Scott Williamson).)  \nAlthough Mr. Gillette and Mr. Hopkins testified that they learned about the rebate amounts \nfrom their business partners (Mr. Lomax and Mr. Williamson, respectively), rather than \nthrough Window World, (see Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.2281–82 (Jonathan Gillette); 1.App.7080–\n81 (Brian Hopkins) ), the Court finds Window World’s alleged misrepresentations to these \nPlaintiffs’ business partners sufficient to create a fact issue for these Plaintiffs as to this \nelement.  Similarly, although Melissa Edwards testified that she and Michael Edwards were \nalready selling Window World products at the time Mr. Whitworth told them Window World \nwould be taking $5 a window , (see Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.5355 (Melissa Edwards)), Michael \nEdwards testified that the rebate misrepresentations were made before he and his wife began \nselling Window World products, which the Court finds sufficient to create an issue of fact as \nto this element of these Plaintiffs’ fraud -rebate claim.  (Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.4666 (“I was \ntold by Todd [Whitworth] when I started it was five to ten dollars a window, and that was it.  \nNothing else.  Nothing ever got told to me anything otherwise.”), 5120 –22, 5755 (“Q: So you \nknew at the start, prior to your signing the first Huntsville agreement, that Window World \nwas paid rebates, correct? A: $5 to $10, at the most . . . Q: Did you have any sense that that \ncould change?  A: No.  Q: Did you ever talk to [T odd Whitworth] about the rebate structure \nchanging?  A: No.  I went to work.”) (Michael Edwards).) \n \n107 (See Volume One Pls.’ Exs. Ex. 20; Pls.’ Reply Br. Exs. 3.3 , 3.4; see also Defs.’ 1st App. \n1.App.15801 (Window World).)  For instance, Mr. Roland testified “if Window World would \nhave done what it was supposed to do as a franchise and give full – reveal fully – the price of \ndoing business with them, in other words, if I would have known the amount of rebates that \nwere being charged from the beginning, I wouldn’t be here today.”  (Defs.’ 1st App. \n1.App.2717–18 (James Roland).)  Similarly, Mr. Lomax testified “[b]y the amount of rebate \nthey were collecting, the fact that I wasn’t getting the best price, the fact that even though \nLeon told me that it was automatic renewal, as long as I didn’t do anything wrong and I kept \npaying my bills, that we ’re going to change that in the future, there’s no way I would have \ninvested the type of time, energy, and money that it took to build what we have today.”  (Defs.’ \n1st App. 1.App.1925 (James Lomax, III).) \n“[t]he required scienter for fraud is not present without both knowledge and an intent \nto deceive, manipulate, or defraud.”  RD&J Props. v . Lauralea-Dilton Enters., LLC, \n165 N.C. App. 737, 745 (2004) (citing Myers & Chapman, Inc. v. Thomas G. Evans, \nInc., 323 N.C. 559, 568 (1988)).  Furthermore, in a claim for fraud, “a defendant \ncannot be liabl e for misrepresenting a fact that it has no knowledge is false.”  Id. \n(citing Taylor v. Gore, 161 N.C. App. 300, 303 (2003)).  Fraudulent intent “generally \nis proven by circumstances” and “can be shown by presenting evidence of some motive \non the part of the perpetrator.”  Latta v. Rainey , 202 N.C. App. 587, 600 (2010) \n(cleaned up).   \n56. Here, the remaining Plaintiffs provided evidence from which a reasonable \nfactfinder could conclude that Window World knew its alleged representations \nregarding rebate amounts were false and took steps to prevent Plaintiffs from \nlearning the actual amount paid to Window World in the form of rebates.\n108 \n \n108 (See Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 12; Volume One Pls.’ Dep. Excerpts, Ex. P,  \nWindow World Dep. 310:3–312:4, ECF No. 984.16 (sealed).)  Additionally, Plaintiffs provide \nevidence of Window World’s fraudulent intent as related to rebate misrepresentations.  “After \n[Window World] discovered that Roland learned the actual amount of the rebates, then -\n[Window World] President Dana Deem wrote to [Window World’s] board that he called AMI \nand ‘shared [his] anger’: \n \nAs you can clearly see on the attached spreadsheet, [Roland] has our exact \nrebate structure by item thanks to AMI.  [AMI officer Dave King] stated that \n[Roland] kept asking for more details and that is how the tab expanded, but \nthat is no excuse  . . . [King] knew that we did not want [Roland] to have the \nexact details of our rebate.”  \n \n(Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 13; See also Volume One Pls.’ Exs.’ Ex. 30, ECF No. \n977.31 (sealed).) \n \n57. In addition, these Plaintiffs provide substantial evidence to rebut \nDefendants’ assertion that their reliance on Defendants’ oral representations as to \nrebate amounts was “unreasonable as a matter of law” as “[t]he parties chose not to \nlimit rebates in their [written , executed, and fully -integrated] contracts.” 109  For \nexample, Plaintiffs point out that the majority of the written agreements executed by \nthe parties do not address rebates at all,110 the “parties’ oral agreements provide the \nonly source of any agreement on rebates —including that Plaintiffs would pay \nthem,”111 and Defendants frequently downplayed the importance of the written \nagreements in governing the parties’ relationship, often referring to the written \nagreements as “just paperwork.” 112  Based on the pro ffered evidence, a jury could \n \n109 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 43.) \n \n110 (See Defs.’ 2d. App. 2.App.16425– 16914.)  It is undisputed that the  existence of rebates \nwas not mentioned in the executed written agreements until the Franchise Agreements \nsigned by some Plaintiffs in 2013 were created ( see, e.g. , Defs.’ 2d. App. 2.App.16891 \n(Williamson Franchise Agreement executed 22 March 2013); 2.App.16933 (Edwards \nFranchise Agreement executed 10 June 2013).)  The Franchise Agreements contain the \nfollowing language, which does not refer to rebate amounts: \n \n“FRANCHISEE understands and agrees FRANCHISOR will receive rebates \nand other compensation from vendors and that such compensation is for \nservices rendered to the vendors and such compensation is reasonable.  \nFRANCHISEE agrees all rebates received by FRANCH ISOR are \nFRANCHISOR’S exclusive property and FRANCHISOR has no obligation to \nspend any portion of the rebates on FRANCHISEE’S behalf.”  \n \n(2.App.16891, 16933.)   \n \n111 (Pls.’ Reply Br. 25.)  \n \n112 (See, e.g., Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2, ECF No. 1008.2  (sealed); Defs.’ 1st \nApp. 1.App.1325–26 (James Lomax, III); 1.App.3135, 3538–39 (James Roland); 1.App.4783, \n5817 (Michael Edwards); 1.App.5349, 5409–10 (Melissa Edwards); 1.App.7325, 7800 (Scott \nWilliamson).) \n \nrationally  conclude that Plaintiffs were reasonable in their reliance on Defendants’ \noral representations concerning rebate amounts.  See Little v. Stogner, 162 N.C. App. \n25, 30 (2004) (“The reasonableness of a party’s reliance is a question for the jury, \nunless the facts are so clear that they support only one conclusion.” (quoting State \nProps., LLC v. Ray, 155 N.C. App. 65, 73 (2002))).   \n58. Last, Plaintiffs provide sufficient evidence at the summary judgment stage \nto permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude Plaintiffs were harmed in an amount \nequal to the difference between “the rebates they were fraudulently promised and the \nrebates they actually paid.”113   \n59. Based on the above, the Court concludes that Defendants’ Motion should be \ndenied as to the Edwards, Lomax /Gillette, Roland , and Williamson /Hopkins \nPlaintiffs’ (and their related entities’)  fraud claim based on the R ebate \nMisrepresentation Theory.  T he Court further concludes that these Plaintiffs’ \noffensive summary judgment motion on this claim should similarly be denied as \nPlaintiffs have failed to meet their high burden of “ show[ing] that there are no \ngenuine issues of fact, that there are no gaps in [their]  proof, that no inferences \n \n113 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 49 ; see also Volume Seven Pls.’ Exs. Ex. 216 \n[hereinafter “Bersin Report”], ECF No. 983.36 (sealed); Volume Seven Pls.’ Exs. Ex. 218, Aff. \nBrent K. Bersin, dated Apr. 7, 2017, at ¶  6 [hereinafter “Bersin Aff.”], ECF No. 983.38 \n(sealed).)  Plaintiffs have also provided evidence that, if not for the requirement to pay rebates \nthrough select vendors to Window World, they could purchase the same windows much \ncheaper from suppliers, such as AMI.  (See, e.g., Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.5634–35 (“Q: And Mr. \nStraus [of AMI] responded by telling you that if you were not a Window World store owner \npaying the Window World rebate, he would be able to sell you the same windows much \ncheaper.  Is that what you told me?  A: He just said if it wasn’t for Window World, I could get \nit for cheaper, yes.”) (Melissa Edwards).) \n \ninconsistent with [Plaintiffs’] recovery arise from the evidence, and that there is no \nstandard that must be applied to the facts by the jury.”  Parks Chevrolet, Inc., 74 N.C. \nApp. at 721.114 \n60. In particular, g enuine issues of material fact remain on the Rebate \nMisrepresentation Theory at least as to: whether Window World falsely represented \nrebate amounts; whether the rebate amounts were material; whether Window World \nintended to deceive Plaintiffs; whether Plaintiffs reasonably relied on Window \nWorld’s alleged oral representations; and whether Plaintiffs were harmed by Window \nWorld’s alleged misrepresentations.  The foregoing are all questions of fact which \nmust be resolved by a jury.  Head v. Gould Killian CPA  Grp., P.A., 371 N.C. 2, 9 \n(2018) (“Whether each of the elements of actual fraud and reasonable reliance are \nmet are ordinarily questions for the jury ‘unless the facts are so clear that they \nsupport only one conclusion.’ ”) (citing Forbis, 361 N.C. at 527).     \n61. Defendants additionally contend that Window World is entitled to summary \njudgment on Plaintiffs’ fraud claims due to North Carolina’s three -year statute of \nlimitations for fraud claims.\n115  Defendants argue that the period for Plaintiffs to \nbring their fraud claims began to run “when they joined [Window World], and \ncertainly no later than October 2011 when they received rescission letters and \n \n114 It is “rarely . . . proper to enter summary judgment in favor of the party having the burden \nof proof.”  Blackwell v. Massey, 69 N.C. App. 240, 243 (1984). \n \n115 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2, 47–51.)   \n \n[franchise disclosure documents].” 116  Since more than three years passed between \nOctober 2011 and the filing of these lawsuits on 2 January 2015, Defendants maintain \nthat the “three -year statute of limitations dooms the [fraud] claims for most \nPlaintiffs.”117 \n62. N.C.G.S. § 1-52(9) provides that, for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake, \n“the cause of action shall not be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the \naggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.”  Thus, the limitations \nperiod for a fraud claim “begins to run when the plaintiff first becomes aware of facts \nand circumstances that would enable him to discover the defendant’s wrongdoing in \nthe exercise of due diligence.”  Doe v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlotte, 242 N.C. \nApp. 538, 543 (2015).  \n63. Though Defendants contend Plaintiffs’ cause of action for fraud accrued in \nOctober 2011 at the latest, Plaintiffs provide substantial evidence that Plaintiffs did \nnot discover the facts constituting fraud as it relates to the rebate misrepresentations \nuntil 2013.  In his deposition, Mr. Roland testified, “I don’t believe that I knew what \nthe rebates were until – I have a billing practice with AMI that was authorized by –  \nby Window World sometime in 2013, the spring of 2013, where Win –  AMI gives me \n– separates the rebates from the invoices that they –  they send to me.

These Plaintiffs failed to produce substantial evidence demonstrating \nDefendants made a false representation concerning best pricing.  In their depositions, \nthe Jones/Shumate Plaintiffs testified they understood Window World’s “best pricing” \nrepresentation to relate to their competitors, i.e., non-licensees within their trade \narea.  However, these Plaintiffs were unable to provide evidence demonstrating the \nfalsity of Wi ndow World’s representations to them.\n137  Since the Jones/Shumate \nPlaintiffs failed to provide substantial evidence that Window World made a false \nrepresentation of a material fact to them, the Court grants Defendants’ motion for \nsummary judgment on Plaintiffs’ fraud claim regarding best pricing in relation to \nthese Plaintiffs.  \n72. Th e remaining Plaintiffs, however, have provided evidence from which a \nreasonable jury could find that Window World’s alleged “best price” representations \nwere false.  Specifically, the Edwards Plaintiffs provided evidence both that a non -\nlicensee competitor was able to access better prices and that they could access better \nprices by contracting with , directly, rather \n \n137 (Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.8744 (“Q: And are you aware of any nonlicensees  within the trade \narea that you had under Exhibit 600 who got a better price than you did?

The remaining Plaintiffs also have provided evidence that Window World’s \nalleged “best price” representations, as they understood them, were false by \nproducing evidence of Window World’s undisclosed “C” pricing level.140  Furthermore, \nthese Plaintiffs produced substantial evidence that Window World intentionally \n \n138 (Volume One Pls.’ Dep.

Indeed, Defendants \nacknowledge that it was a more favorable pricing level than the disclosed “A” and “B” pricing \nlevels.  Defendants argue, however, that “C” pricing ended in 2011.  (See Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nSumm. J. 94.) \n \nconcealed or denied the existence of “C” pricing. 141  Since “[w]hether the defendant \nacts with the requisite scienter for fraud is generally a question of fact for the jury ,” \nand because Plaintiffs have provided substantial evidence that Defendants were \naware of the falsity of their “best price” representations, the Court concludes that the \nremaining Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden at the summary judgment stage of \nshowing Defendants’ fraudulent intent.  Latta, 202 N.C. App. at 600 (citing Pearce v. \nAmerican Defender Life Ins. Co., 316 N.C. 461, 468 (1986)). \n74. In addition , Plaintiffs provide substantial evidence to rebut Defendants’ \nassertion that Plaintiffs’ reliance on Defendants’ alleged oral representations as to \nbest pricing was unreasonable since the contractual promise, as memorialized in the \nparties’ written agreements, was for Window World “ to help each dealer get better \nwindow prices than ‘non -licensee’ competitors are getting in their respective \nmarkets.”142  For example, Plaintiffs point to evidence from which a reasonable jury \ncould conclude that Defendants frequently downplayed the importance of the written \nagreements in governing the parties’ relationship, referring to the agreements as \n“just paperwork,” and that the parties operated for months or years in the absence of \n \n141 (See, e.g., Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.2046 (“I don’t know what Mr. [Todd] Whitworth did other \nthan deny the existence of anything other than A or B.”) (James Lomax, III); 1.App.5908–10 \n(Michael Edwards); Volume Three Pls.’ Exs.

Last, Plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence at the summary judgment \nstage to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude Plaintiffs were harmed in an \namount equal to the difference between “ what they were promised —best pricing—\nand what they actually received.”144   \n76. Based on the above, the Court finds genuine issues of material fact remain \nas to the breadth of Window World’s best pricing promise  to the Roland, \nLomax/Gillette, Edwards, Ford, Rose, Williamson/Hopkins and Ballard Plaintiffs, the \nmateriality of Window World’s best pricing promise to these Plaintiffs’ decisions to \n \n143 (See, e.g., Pls.’ Br.

Third, Plaintiffs argue that Window World committed fraud or fraudulent \nconcealment by “[withholding] material information from Plaintiffs when presenting \nthem with licensing agreements to sign.” 152  Plaintiffs contend that, by withholding \nsuch material information, Defendants failed to make franchise disclosures as \nrequired under 16 Code of Federal Regulations (“C.F.R.”) § 436.1, et seq . (the \n“Franchise Rule” or the “Franchise Disclosure Rule”).153   \n80. Fraud by omission arises when a defendant “had a duty to disclose material \ninformation to [the plaintiff], as silence is fraudulent only when there is a duty to \nspeak.”  Lawrence, 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *8.  This Court has previously identified \nthe following as elements a plaintiff must prove to succeed on a claim for fraud by \nomission: \n(1) the relationship [between plaintiff and defendant] giving rise to the \nduty to speak; (2) the event or events triggering the duty to speak and/or \n \n151 The Edwards Plaintiffs’ fraud claims under the B est Pricing T heory based on pricing \nexternal to the Window World system shall survive Defendants’ Motion under Rule 56.   \n \n152 (Pls.’ Br.

Richmond Comm. Coll. , 171 F.R.D. 189, 195 (M.D.N.C. \n1997)).  Our appellate courts have further held that a duty to disclose arises where:  \n(1) ‘a fiduciary relationship exists between the parties to the \ntransaction’; (2) there is no fiduciary relationship and ‘a party has taken \naffirmative steps to conceal material facts from the other’; and (3) there \nis no fiduciary relationship and ‘one party has knowledge of a latent \ndefect in the subject matter of the negotiations about which the other \nparty is both ignorant and unable to discover through reasonable \ndiligence.’ \n \nHardin, 199 N.C. App. at 696 (quoting Sidden, 137 N.C. App. at 675).  \n81. In a commercial transaction, “[a] duty to disclose material facts arises \n‘[w]here material facts are accessible to the vendor only, and he knows them not to \nbe within the reach of the diligent attention, observation and judgment of the \npurchaser.”  Everts v. Parkinson, 147 N.C. App. 315, 325 (2001) (emphasis removed).  \nA duty to disclose may also be imposed by operation of law.  See, e.g. , Williams v. E. \nCoast Sales, Inc., 59 N.C. App. 700, 703 (1982).\n154   \n82. Following the above-cited case law and the requirements enumerated by the \nFranchise Rule, Plaintiffs argue that Window World (1) had a duty to disclose \n \n154 Plaintiffs argue that this Court has previously determined that the Franchise Rule creates \na duty to disclose material facts for purposes of a fraud claim in Haigh v. Superior Ins. Mgmt. \nGrp., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 100, at *10–11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 24, 2017).  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nPartial Summ. J. 51–52.)  However, Haigh interpreted the obligation to disclose information \nunder the Franchise Rule in the context of N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1. \n \nfinancial information (including about rebates) to Plaintiffs 155; (2) “was fully aware \nof [or, at a minimum, recklessly indifferent to] its legal obligation to make franchise \ndisclosures”156; and (3)  willfully concealed material information  they were required \nby law to disclose, including “critical, material information about the financial terms \nof the parties’ relationship .”157  Plaintiffs  further argue that Window World’s \n“concealment of material facts” harmed Plaintiffs because “[Window World’s] \nconsciously false statements and noncompliance with franchise law allowed [Window \nWorld] to maintain its economic fraud.”158  Additionally, as Defendants’ concealment \nof material facts fraudulently induced Plaintiffs to join and remain a part of the \nWindow World system, Plaintiffs contend that Window World’s “fraud also renders \nthe written agreements . . . void and unenforceable as a matter of law.”159 \n83. Window World argues, as a threshold matter , that any fraud claims based \non the Franchise Rule are time -barred by the applicable statutes of limitations .160  \nPlaintiffs’ Franchise Rule claims, Defendants maintain, “accrued when Plaintiffs \nreceived copies of licensing agreements for signature. ”161  Defendants further argue \n \n155 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 52.) \n \n156 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 53–54.) \n \n157 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 55.) \n \n158 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ.

J. 41.)   \n \nthat the discovery rule does not toll this period as Plaintiffs “knew facts from which \nthey could determine a violation of the Franchise Rule when they signed their initial \nlicensing agreements.”162   \n84. Under the discovery rule, a plaintiff need only know the “facts” that “would \nenable him to discover the defendant’s wrongdoing in the exercise of due diligence.”   \nDoe, 242 N.C. App. at 543.  Ignorance of the law does not toll the statute of limitations.  \nLerch Bros. v. McKinne Bros., 187 N.C. 419, 420 (1924) (“Ignorance of a material fact \nmay excuse a party, but ignorance of the law does not excuse him from the legal \n \n162 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 43.)  “Franchise” is defined by the Federal Trade \nCommission as  \n \nany continuing commercial relationship or engagement, whatever it may be \ncalled, in which the terms of the offer or contract specify, or the franchise seller \npromises or represents, orally or in writing, that: \n \n(1) The franchisee will obtain the right to operate a business that is identified \nor associated with the franchisor’s trademark, or to offer, sell, or distribute \ngoods, services, or commodities that are identified or associated with the \nfranchisor’s trademark; \n \n(2) The franchisor will exert or has the authority to exert a significant degree \nof control over the franchisee’s method of operation, or provide significant \nassistance in the franchisee’s method of operation; and \n \n(3) As a condition of obtaining or commencing operation of the franchise, the \nfranchisee makes a required payment or commits to make a required \npayment to the franchisor or its affiliate. \n \n16 C.F.R. §  436.1(h).  Since the Licensing Agreements covered operation of the Plaintiffs’ \nbusinesses with Window World’s trademarks ( see, e.g., Defs.’ 2d App. 2.App.16435 § 1), the \nlevel of control Window World would have over the Plaintiffs’ businesses ( see, e.g., Defs.’ 2d \nApp. 2.App.16436–37 § 4.), the assistance Window World would provide Plaintiffs in setting \nup their businesses (s ee, e.g., Defs.’ 2d App. 2.App.16437 § 5), and the fees Plaintiffs would \npay as a condition of operating their businesses  (see, e.g., Defs.’ 2d App. 2.App.16435–45), \nDefendants contend Plaintiffs possessed the information necessary to determine if their \nrelationship with Window World was a franchise relationship at the time they received the \nLicensing Agreements.  (See Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 43.)  \n \nconsequences of his conduct.”); see also In re Lowe’s Cos. , 517 F. Supp. 3d 484, 502 \n(W.D.N.C. 2021) (“The running of a period of limitations is delayed by the discovery \nrule while the facts of the wrong remain unknown, but the statute of limitations is \nnot tolled if only the legal theory is not yet understood.”).    \n85. Plaintiffs, in response, argue that their Franchise Rule claims did not accrue \nwhen Plaintiffs received copies of the Licensing Agreements for signature because of \nWindow World’s “years-long efforts to cover up its franchisor status and its knowing \nviolations of franchise law.” 163  The wording and contents of the L icensing \nAgreements, Plaintiffs contend, was a continuation of Window World’s efforts to \nconceal its franchisor status.   Plaintiffs further argue that holding Plaintiffs’ \nFranchise Rule claims to have accrued when copies of L icensing Agreements were \nreceived for signature would result in their fraud claim being time -barred “even \nthough [Window World] has consistently claimed, in the face of all evidence to the \ncontrary, that [Window World] itself didn’t and couldn’t know it was a franchisor until \nAugust 2011.”164   \n86. The Court declines to find, as a matter of law, that the statute of limitations \non this aspect of Plaintiffs’ fraud claim began to accrue at the time the L icensing \nAgreements were signed.  A cause of action for fraud does not accrue until the injured \nparty discovers “the facts constituting the fraud.”  N.C.G.S. § 1-52(9).  Our State’s \nSupreme Court “has held in numerous cases that in an action grounded on fraud, the \n \n163 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 51.) \n \n164 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 50.) \n \nstatute of limitations begins to run from the discovery of the fraud or from the time \nit should have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence.”  Calhoun v. \nCalhoun, 18 N.C. App. 429, 432 (1973)  (emphasis added) (referencing Wimberly v. \nWashington Furniture Stores, Inc., 216 N.C. 732 (1940); Brooks v. Ervin Constr. Co. , \n253 N.C. 214 (1960); B -W Acceptance Corp. v. Spencer, 268 N.C. 1 (1966)) .  It would \nbe unreasonable for this Court to hold that Plaintiffs failed to exercise reasonable \ndiligence and should have discovered that Window World was a franchisor at the time \nPlaintiffs received copies of the Licensing Agreements when Defendants testified that \nthey “didn’t and couldn’t know [Window World] was a franchisor until August \n2011.”165  Thus, f or the purposes of this Order and Opinion, the Court will treat \nPlaintiffs’ claim as having accrue d at the time Window World made its franchise \ndisclosures to Plaintiffs on 11 October 2011. \n87. As Defendants rightly point out, the three-year statute of limitations would \nordinarily “doom” the Non -Tolling Plaintiffs’ fraud claims even when assuming the \naccrual date to be 11 October 2011. 166  These Plaintiffs contend, however, that they \n“have not delayed unreasonably in seeking relief against [Window World],”  arguing \nthat Window World “is barred from relying on any statute of limitations defense \nagainst Plaintiffs in light of the continuing wrong doctrine.”167  The Court agrees. \n \n165 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 50.) \n \n166 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 2.) \n \n167 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶¶ 156, 161; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶¶ 255, 260.) \n88. Our Supreme Court has held that the continuing wrong doctrine “provide[s] \nthat the applicable limitations period starts anew in the event that an allegedly \nunlawful act is repeated.”  Quality Built Homes Inc. v. Town of Carthage, 371 N.C.  \n60, 70 (2018).  When determining whether the continuing wrong doctrine  applies, \n“the reviewing court ‘must examine the wrong alleged by [the plaintiff] to determine \nif the purported violation is the result of ‘continual unlawful acts,’ each of which \nrestarts the running of  the statute of limitations, or if the alleged wrong is instead \nmerely the ‘continual ill effects from an original violation.’  ”  Id . (citing Williams v. \nBlue Cross Blue Shield, 357 N.C. 170, 179 (2003)).  \n89. In the Court’s Order and Opinion on Defendant Tammy Whitworth’s Motion \nto Dismiss, this Court found that “Plaintiffs have alleged facts that, when taken as \ntrue, show that [Window World] engaged in the allegedly wrongful conduct that gave \nrise to each claim up to the time the original complaints were filed in these actions  \non January 2, 2015.”  Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc. , \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 12, 2017).  Thus, this Court held \nthat Plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to survive the applicable statute of \nlimitations under the continuing wrong doctrine at the motion to dismiss stage of this \nlitigation.  Id.  The Court does not conclude differently at the summary judgment \nstage—as described earlier in this opinion, Plaintiffs have provided substantial \nevidence to support a finding that “many of [Window World’s] wrongful acts are \ndemonstrably continued wrongs, most particularly [Window World’s] repeated \nbreaches of its pricing and rebate promises.”168   \n90. As to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claim for fraud based on  Window World’s \nalleged withholding of “material information from Plaintiffs  . . . that franchise law \nobligated [Window World] to disclose in an FDD,” 169 the Court’s inquiry under Rule \n56 hinges on whether Window World possessed a duty to disclose this information at \nthe beginning of the parties’ relationship.   \n91. Plaintiffs allege Window World had a duty to disclose financial information, \nincluding information about C pricing and the rebates Plaintiffs paid, for three \nreasons: (1) the Franchise Rule “imposed on [Window World] a duty to disclose \nvoluminous information to Plaintiffs, including detailed financial information about \nwhat payments Plaintiffs were obligated to make and how much [Window World] \nearned from the parties’ relat ionship”170; (2) Window World “voluntarily made \nincomplete and inaccurate disclosures about the rebates Plaintiffs would pay to \ninduce them to become dealers”\n171; and (3) Window World “took affirmative steps to \nconceal material facts about the rebates Plaintiffs paid, including by instructing its \n \n168 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 53; s ee supra notes 117–20, 146 and accompanying \ntext.)  Plaintiffs additionally argue that equitable estoppel bars Window World from relying \non statute of limitations defenses.  (See, e.g., Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 53.)  Since \nthe Court finds this aspect of Plaintiffs’ fraud claims survives Defendants’ statute of \nlimitations argument due to the continuing wrong doctrine, the Court declines to address \nPlaintiffs’ equitable tolling argument.    \n  \n169 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 51.) \n  \n170 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 52.)  \n \n171 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 52.)   \n \nemployees and vendors to keep [Window World’s] rebate structure (including C \npricing) secret from Plaintiffs, which also created a duty to disclose.”172  Defendants, \nin contrast, maintain Plaintiffs’ omission theory fails because the “Franchise Rule \ndoesn’t create a state -law duty to disclose” and “the common law didn’t create any \ndisclosure duties either  . . . [because] there is never a duty to disclose information \nunless it is material.”173 \n92. As evidenced by the case law cited in the parties’ briefs, courts dispute \nwhether the federal Franchise Rule  creates a disclosure duty under North Carolina \nlaw for omission -based fraud claims .174  However, this Court need not consider \nwhether the Franchise Rule creates  a disclosure duty because  Plaintiffs have \nprovided substantial evidence to support a finding that a duty to disclose arose under \nthe common law.  As described in earlier sections of this opinion, Plaintiffs have \nprovided substantial evidence that Window World made incomplete and in accurate \ndisclosures about the rebates Plaintiffs would pay.175  As this State’s Supreme Court \nstated in Ragsdale, even when no duty to disclose exists, a party who chooses to speak \nhas a duty to make a full and fair disclosure of facts concerning the matters on which \nhe chooses to speak.  Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 139 (citing Low, 207 Cal. App. 2d at 484.  \n \n172 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 52.)  \n \n173 (Defs.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 27–28.) \n \n174 (See, e.g., Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 51–54; Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 55–\n59.) \n \n175 (See supra ¶¶ 43–60 and related notes.) \n \nFurthermore, as previously discussed, Plaintiffs have provided substantial evidence \nto permit a finding that Window World  “took affirmative steps to conceal material \nfacts about the rebates Plaintiffs paid  [and C pricing].” 176  In North Carolina, “[a] \nduty to disclose arises where . . . (2) there is no fiduciary relationship and ‘a party has \ntaken affirmative steps to conceal material facts from the other[.]’ ”  Hardin, 199 N.C. \nApp. at 696.      \n93. Also as discussed earlier in this opinion, and based on a careful review of \nthe evidence advanced by the parties, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have provided \nsubstantial evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that (1) information \nconcerning pricing and rebates was material to Plaintiffs, inducing them , at least in \npart, to join or remain a part of the Window World system; (2)  Plaintiffs’ reliance on \nthe omission (or misrepresentation) was reasonable; (3) Window World possessed the \nrequisite scienter when misrepresenting or concealing information about pricing and \nrebates; and (4) Plaintiffs were harmed by Window World’s omissions. 177  However, \nas also stated earlier in this opinion, genuine issues of material fact remain as to: the \nmateriality of Window World’s pricing and rebate representations; whether Window \nWorld intended to deceive Plaintiffs; whether Plaintiffs reasonably relied on Window \nWorld’s pricing and rebate representations  or omissions;\n178 and whether Plaintiffs \n \n176 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 52; see supra ¶¶ 54–56, 59–60, 72–73, 76 \n and related notes.)  \n \n177 (See supra ¶¶ 43–76 and related notes.) \n \n178 For instance, many Plaintiffs admit in their depositions they did not read or simply \nskimmed the Licensing Agreements and FDDs when they received them.  ( E.g., Defs.’ 1st \n \nwere harmed by Window World’s alleged misrepresentations or omissions. 179  The \nforegoing are all questions of fact that must be resolved by a jury.  Head, 371 N.C. at \n9.  Accordingly, t he Court will deny the Cross -Motions to the extent they seek \nsummary judgment on Plaintiffs’ fraud claim based on the Fraudulent Concealment \nTheory.   \nGround 4: Franchise Disclaimer Theory \n94. Plaintiffs next argue that Window World “committed fraud by including the \nfranchise disclaimer in the L icensing Agreements Plaintiffs signed ,”180 \nmisrepresenting to Plaintiffs that Window World was not a franchisor and that \nPlaintiffs were not franchisees.181  Plaintiffs allege that (1) “no dispute exists that \n \nApp. 1.App.4873, 5915 (Michael Edwards); 1.App.7820 (Scott Williamson); 1.App.6857 (Rick \nRose); 1.App.6593 (Christina Rose); 1.App.1474 (James Lomax, III) ; 1.App.2623 (Jonathan \nGillette); 1.App.3576 (James Roland); 1.App.3904–05 (Kenneth Ford, Jr.) ; 1.App.37 (James \nBallard); 1.App.8442–43 (Jeremy Shumate).)  Thus, it is unclear whether Plaintiffs would \nhave relied upon the omitted rebate or pricing information had it been timely disclosed.   \n \n179 (See supra ¶¶ 43–76.) \n \n180 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 56.)   \n \n181 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 56.)  Between 2008 and 2011, Plaintiffs’ executed \nLicensing Agreements contained the following franchise disclaimer language: \n \nNothing in this Licensing Agreement shall be deemed to create any type \nof . . . franchise, or other business relationship other than LICENSOR and \nLICENSEE.  The parties acknowledge and agree that, to the extent the state \nin which the LICENSEE is granted it s license has enacted statutes, codes, or \nregulations which govern franchises, the LICENSEE and LICENSOR are not \nsubject to such laws and regulations and the LICENSOR shall not be required \nto provide any disclosures to LICENSEE other than those previously made to \nLICENSEE or made herein.  The LICENSEE agrees that the terms of the \nLicensing Agreement and the LICENSOR/LICENSEE relationship created \nhereunder shall be determinative of the rights and interests between the \nparties notwithstanding any statutes, rules, or regulations governing \nfranchises in the state where the LICENSEE does business. \n \n[Window World’s] disclaimer of franchise law was false” ; (2) Defendants knew the \nfranchise disclaimer was false; (3) Defendants possessed fraudulent intent in making \nthe franchise disclaimer; (4) Plaintiffs reasonably relied on Window World’s false \ndisclaimer of franchise law; and (5) Plaintiffs were harmed because Window World \n“employed the franchise disclaimer to hide the truth about its rebates and pricing.”182  \n95. Defendants counter that  Plaintiffs’ franchise -stipulation theory fails \nbecause the franchise disclaimer is not a misrepresentation of fact—which they define \nas a detail subject to objective verification .  See Forbis, 361 N.C. at 526–27 (stating \nthat fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation requires “[f]alse representation or \nconcealment of a material fact”); Wilson v.

J. 56–59.)   \n \n2008) (“[F]raud may only be found in expressions of fact which (1) admit of being \nadjudged true or false in a way that (2) admit of empirical verification.”).  Rather, \nDefendants maintain that the disclaimer in the L icensing Agreements was “at most \na non-actionable representation of a legal opinion” 183 as to the relationship between \nthe parties, and both Plaintiffs and Defendants were in an equally good position to \njudge the nature of that relationship .184  See Dalton v. Dalton , 164 N.C. App. 584, \n586–87 (2004) (“Generally speaking, a party cannot attack the making of a contract \non the basis of fraud where the proof regarding the misrepresentation or \nmisstatement relates to a matter of law.”).   \n96. Defendants further argue that there was “ no actual or reasonable reliance \n[on the disclaimer]”185 and, therefore, that Plaintiffs have failed to “produce evidence \nto support an essential element of [their] claim[.]”  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83.  According \nto Defendants, “Plaintiffs can’t prove that they actually relied on the \nstipulation . . . [because] [o]nly one Plaintiff recalled reading the no- franchise \nstipulation, but he did not understand its significance or seek further information.”186  \nDefendants argue, in addition, that, “[e]ven if Plaintiffs had proffered evidence that \nthey read the no -franchise stipulations and understood what they meant, they still \n \n183 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 71.) \n \n184 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 62–63.) \n \n185 (Defs.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 30.) \n \n186 (Defs.’ Resp . Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 71; see also Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.7001 –03 (Brian \nHopkins).) \n \ndidn’t reasonably rely on them  . . . [because] [a]s Plaintiffs admit, such stipulations \nhave no legal effect.”187 \n97. Based on its careful review of the proffered evidence, the Court agrees with \nDefendants that Plaintiffs have not produced sufficient evidence to support the \nreliance element of their fraud claim based on the franchise disclaimer.  “Justifiable \nreliance is an essential element of both fraud and negligent misrepresentation.”  \nHelms v. Holland, 124 N.C. App. 629, 635 (1996); see, e.g., Marcus Bros. Textiles, Inc. \nv. Price Waterhouse, LLP, 350 N.C. 214, 224 (1999) (noting that fraud and negligent \nmisrepresentation require analogous showings of reasonable or justifiable reliance, \nrespectively).  The question of reliance is normally “a question for the jury, unless the \nfacts are so clear that they support only one conclusion.”  Forbis, 361 N.C. at 527.   \n98. Here, as Defendants suggest, to show actual reliance regarding the \nfranchise disclaimer, Plaintiffs, at a minimum, must produce evidence that they read \nthe franchise disclaimer or knew of its existence prior to signing the Licensing \nAgreements.  Th e Lomax/Gillette, Edwards, Ford, Rose, Jones/Shumate, Ballard, \nWilliamson/Hopkins, and Roland Plaintiffs, however, have all conceded that they did \nnot actually read the Licensing Agreements, have no memory of reading the Licensing \nAgreements,188 put no stock in their written contracts as they were “just \n \n187 (Defs.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 30.) \n \n188 The Lomax/Gillette, Ford, Rose, and Shumate Plaintiffs testified that they did not read \nthe Licensing Agreements or seek legal advice before signing them.  (Defs.’ 1st App. \n1.App.1235–36 (“Q: Did you tell Window World that when you signed the [licensing] \nagreement at Exhibit 680?  A: I never read the agreement  . . .

A: No.”) \n(Jeremy Shumate).)   \n \n189 The Edwards, Roland, Rose, Ford, Williamson, and Jones Plaintiffs testified that they put \nno stock in the written agreements as they were “just paperwork.”  (Defs.’ 1st App. \n1.App.5860 (Q: Did you read this agreement, sir, before you signed it?

A: The deal was always as it was verbally and as we ran our businesses. Q:  . . . [I]f \nyou rely on the verbal agreement, why didn’t you just do that, instead of signing the license \nagreement?  A: It was just paperwork.  It was a formality.”) (Angell Wesner-Ford); \n1.App.7889–92, 7918 (“I don’t think either party viewed this [written agreement] as anything \nother than just paperwork, just a formality.”) (Scott Williamson); 1.App.8739 (“I was told this \nwas just paperwork that had to be done . . . We had a verbal agreement and this was just the \npaperwork that had to be done.”) (Tommy Jones).)   \n \n190 While the Ballard Plaintiffs testified they read the written agreements, they have not \noffered evidence that they relied on the written agreements or the franchise disclaimer.  (See, \ne.g., Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.114, 288, 294 (James Ballard).)   \n \n191 The Edwards and Hopkins Plaintiffs testified that the franchise disclaimer did not mean \nanything to them at the time the written agreements were signed as they knew nothing about \n \nnot read the Licensing Agreements , seek legal advice, or understand what it meant \nto be a franchisee, the “facts are so clear that they support only one conclusion”—that \nthe disclaimer did not factor into any  Plaintiff’s decision to join or remain a part of \nthe Window World system —and no reasonable jury could find in favor of Plaintiffs \nconcerning the reliance element of fraud .  Accordingly, the  Court will grant \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment as it pertains to Plaintiffs’ fraud claim \nbased on the F ranchise Disclaimer Theory.192  For the same reasons, t he Court will \nalso deny Plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment as it pertains to this claim.     \nGround 5: 2009 Price Increase Theory \n99. Last, Plaintiffs argue that Window World committed fraud by “secretly \nincreas[ing] [the] wrongful rebates [Plaintiffs paid Window World] at the expense of \nsecuring best pricing for [Window World] dealers” and “fabricat[ing] the basis of the \nresultant price increases to hide what it had done.”193  Plaintiffs allege that the 2009 \nPrice Increases were in contravention of the oral promises made by Leon and Todd \n \nfranchise law.  (Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.5065 (“I’m not a franchise – I don’t know what [the \nfranchise laws] are”) (Michael Edwards); 1.App.5568 (“Q: Do you understand that franchising \nis a regulated industry in the United States?  A: I don’t know anything”) (Melissa Edwards); \n1.App.7001–02 (“I didn’t even know what [the franchise disclaimer] meant  . . . Q: Did you \ntake this agreement to an attorney to look at it and explain this franchise concept to you?  A: \nI did not.”) (Brian Hopkins).)   \n \n192 Plaintiffs attempt to save their fraud claim based on the Franchise Disclaimer Theory by \nstating “Plaintiffs had no choice but to rely on [Window World’s] representations because \n[Window World], the franchisor, had superior knowledge – a key rationale for the Franchise \nRule’s requirement that the franchisor disclose more information than th e franchisor may \notherwise do so.”  ( Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 70.)  However, Plaintiffs provide no \nevidence that they did, in fact, rely on Defendants’ franchise representations in the written \nagreements.   \n \n193 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 59.) \n \nWhitworth as to rebate amounts and “ best pricing ” and that Window World \nmisrepresented that these price increases were out of its control when, in truth, \nWindow World benefitted the most from the price increases.194  \n100. Even assuming Plaintiffs are able to produce substantial evidence to \nsupport their fraud theory based on the 2009 Price Increases, however, Plaintiffs, as \nDefendants correctly state, “don’t even explain what injury purportedly follows from \nthis theory.”\n195  To survive a motion for summary judgment, and to establish a prima \nfacie case for fraud, Plaintiffs must produce substantial evidence demonstrating that \nDefendants’ false representation “result[ed] in damage to the injured party.”  Tillery \nEnv’t, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *19 –20.  Plaintiffs have failed to meet this \nburden.   \n101. As Defendants state in their response brief,  \nPlaintiffs never explain what they would have done differently had they \nknown how the price increases on three [window] options  \n v ersus AMI.   By 2009, Plaintiffs were \nalready dealers.  Two years later, [Window World] informed Plaintiffs of \nthe Franchise Rule violations, gave them an FDD, and offered to let all \nof them rescind their contracts and leave the system.  Not one active \ndealer sought rescission.  If the outcome is the same with or without the \nrepresentation, th e representation couldn’t have been relied on and \ndidn’t impact Plaintiffs’ decisional process.  See Bumpers v. Cmty. Bank \nof N. Va. , 367 N.C.  81, 90 (2013) (“[A]ctual reliance requires that the \nplaintiff have affirmatively incorporated the alleged misrepresentation \ninto his or her decision -making process: if it were not for the \nmisrepresentation, the plaintiff would likely have avoided the injury \naltogether.”).\n196   \n \n194 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 59–60.) \n \n195 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 75–76.) \n \n196 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 76.) \n \n\n  \n102. Based on the above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to establish a \nnecessary element of their claim for fraud arising out of the 2009 Price Increases .  \nAccordingly, the Court grants this portion of Defendants’ M otion and will dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ fraud claim based on the 2009 Price Increases.197   \nB. Negligent Misrepresentation \n103. Plaintiffs and Defendants each seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claim \nfor negligent misrepresentation.  In their Third Amended C omplaints, Plaintiffs \nallege that: (1) Window World “owed a duty of reasonable care to Plaintiffs in \nproviding information relating to Plaintiff’s franchise relationship with [Window \nWorld], including, without limitation, by virtue of the duties and obligations placed \nupon [Window World] pursuant to the Franchise Disclosure Rule”; (2) Window World \n“breached its duty of reasonable care to Plaintiffs by providing false information \nconcerning Plaintiff’s franchise relationship with [Window World] ”; (3) “Plaintiffs \njustifiably and actually relied to their detriment upon information prepared without \nreasonable care by [Window World]”; and (4) “[a]s a consequence and proximate result \nof [Window World’s] negligent misrepresentations, Plaintiffs have been damaged.”\n198   \n104. Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ negligent \nmisrepresentation claim, contending that the “only misrepresentation alleged in the \ncomplaint for this claim is the failure to provide information under the Franchise \n \n197 For the same reason, t he Court will also deny Plaintiffs’ cross -motion for summary \njudgment as it pertains to this aspect of Plaintiffs’ fraud claims. \n \n198 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶¶ 271–74; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶¶ 375–78.) \n \nRule,” and  “[a] claim for negligent misrepresentation cannot be based upon a \nconcealment or failure to disclose.”199  The Court agrees. \n105. As this Court has previously explained, “ unlike fraud claims, a claim for \nnegligent misrepresentation must be based on an actual misrepresentation , not \nmerely an omission or failure to disclose information.”  B&D Software Holdings, LLC \nv. Infobelt, Inc. , 2024 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *35 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 1, 2024) ; see, \ne.g., Aldridge v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *112–13 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Dec. 31, 2019) (“[A] claim for negligent misrepresentation can only be based on \naffirmative misrepresentations, not on omissions.”). \n106. Plaintiffs base their claim for negligent misrepresentation on Window \nWorld’s failure to provide information it was required to disclose pursuant to the \nFranchise Rule.  Plaintiffs allege that Window World “owed a duty of reasonable care \nto Plaintiffs in providing information relating to Plaintiffs ’ franchise relationship, \nincluding . . . by virtue of the duties and obligations placed upon [Window World] \npursuant to the Franchise Disclosure Rule.”\n200  In other words, Window World owed \nPlaintiffs a duty to disclose particular information by virtue of their relationship. \n107. Plaintiffs further allege that Window World breached this duty to disclose \nby “providing false information concerning Plaintiffs ’ franchise relationship with \n[Window World].”201  Plaintiffs do not clarify in this cause of action , however, what \n \n199 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J.  60.) \n \n200 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 271; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 375.) \n \n201 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 272; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 376.) \n \nfalse information Defendants allegedly provided to Plaintiffs, or what information \nDefendants are alleged to have affirmatively misrepresented, and the only evidence \nPlaintiffs offer is predicated on Window World’s alleged failure to disclose information \nit otherwise had a duty to disclose.   \n108. Accordingly, since Plaintiffs’ claim for negligent misrepresentation is based \nupon a failure to disclose information and not on an affirmative misrepresentation, \nthe Court shall grant Window World’s Motion, dismissing Plaintiffs’ claim for \nnegligent misrepresentation against all Plaintiffs.  See, e.g., Harrold v. Dowd, 149 \nN.C. App. 777, 783 (2002); Aldridge, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *112– 13; B&D \nSoftware Holdings, LLC, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *35. \n109. Plaintiffs attempt to preserve their claim for negligent misrepresentation by \narguing in their response to Defendants’ Motion that:  \n[Window World] incorrectly states that the “ only misrepresentation \nalleged in the complaint for this claim is the failure to provide \ninformation under the Franchise Rule. ” . . . On the contrary, Plaintiffs \nassert claims for negligent misrepresentation based on the many \nmisrepresentations [Window World] made to Plaintiff s about the \nparties’ relationships.\n202 \n \n110. In their brief in support of their motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs \nalso assert that the same five theories pleaded in their fraud claim serve as the basis \nfor their negligent misrepresentation claim, contending:  \n[a]s set out above, [Window World] made numerous misrepresentations \nto Plaintiffs, on which Plaintiffs relied, and made them with fraudulent \nintent.  Those same misrepresentations establish [Window World’s] \nliability for negligent misrepresentation regardless of [Window World’s] \nintent.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment for \n \n202 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 63.) \n \nnegligent misrepresentation with respect to each misrepresentation \nidentified above.203 \n \n111. Defendants correctly point out in response, however, that these theories of \nnegligent representation “aren’t mentioned in the complaint or in the relevant part \nof Plaintiffs’ brief.” 204  Defendants further contend, and the Court agrees,  that, “[i]f \nthis tort were based on some misrepresentation theory besides what was pleaded, \n[Window World] was entitled to notice of that theory years ago.  Summary-judgment \nbriefing can’t amend a complaint.”205   \n112. The Supreme Court of North Carolina has also made clear that Rule 9(b) \napplies to claims for negligent misrepresentation just as it does to claims based on \nfraud.  See Value Health Sols., Inc. v. Pharm. Rsch. Assocs., 385 N.C. 250, 265 (2023) \n(“We hold that, in North Carolina, claims for negligent misrepresentation must \nsatisfy the heightened pleading standard of North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure \nRule 9(b).”).  As the Court explained:    \nAs in a fraud case, we require the plaintiff to identify this alleged \nnegligent misrepresentation with particularity so that the defendant \ncan understand the time, place, and content of the representation, the \nidentity of the person making the representati on, and how the plaintiff \njustifiably relied on that information.  Cf. Terry , 302 N.C. at 85.  As a \nfederal court succinctly explained when applying Rule 9(b) to negligent \nmisrepresentation claims, “[u]nless defendant and others share \nplaintiff’s view of t he situation, they will find it difficult to grasp \nplaintiff’s claim.” Breeden, 171 F.R.D. at 202.   \n \nId. at 266.    \n \n203 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 84.) \n \n204 (Defs.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 32.) \n \n205 (Defs.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 32.) \n113. Plaintiffs’ failure to assert their new affirmative misrepresentation theory \nin any of their three complaints —and to fail to do so in accordance with Rule 9(b)’s \nheightened pleading standard—requires dismissal of their negligent \nmisrepresentation claim to the extent it is based on this new theory .  See, e.g., B&D \nSoftware Holdings, LLC, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *16 (noting that “it is axiomatic \nthat a defendant must be put on notice of what it is defending against in order to \navoid being ambushed” ) and * 17–18 ( further observing that “ a claimant’s initial \npleading must adequately inform the responding party of what it is alleged to have \ndone wrong so that it can defend itself accordingly.  This principle is undermined in \ncases where, as here, a party seeks to assert a new theory of recovery for the first \ntime at the summary judgment stage.”) ; Bradshaw v. Maiden , 2020 NCBC LEXIS \n106 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sep. 15, 2020) (holding an amended complaint did not assert a \nseparate negligence claim against a hedge fund administrator as it pled facts only in \nsupport of a gross negligence claim), aff’d, 2022 N.C. App. LEXIS 950 (N.C. Ct. App. \nDec. 29, 2022); aff’d per curiam, 385 N.C. 642 (2024).   \n114. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs’ negligent \nmisrepresentation claim, which the Court concludes is pleaded only based on a failure \nto disclose, must  be dismissed.  The Court will therefore grant Defendants’ Motion \nand deny Plaintiffs’ Motion as to this claim. \nC. Declaratory Judgment \n115. Defendants next move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims for \ndeclaratory judgment (First and Second Causes of Action in the Baton Rouge \nAction/Third and Fourth Causes of Action in the St. Louis Action).   Plaintiffs also \nmove for summary judgment on their First Cause of Action in the Baton Rouge Action \nand their Third Cause of Action in the St. Louis Action “to the extent the cause of \naction is premised on fraudulent inducement.”206    \n116. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, “[a]ny person interested under \na . . . written contract . . . , or whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected \nby a . . . contract . . . , may have determined any question of construction or validity \narising under the . . . contract . . . , and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other \nlegal relations thereunder.”  N.C.G.S. § 1-254.  When asserting a claim for declaratory \njudgment, the claimant “must set forth in his pleading all facts necessary to disclose \nthe existence of an actual controversy between the parties  . . . with regard to their \nrespective rights and duties.”  Lide v. Mears, 231 N.C. 111, 118 (1949).   Summary \njudgment is appropriate in a declaratory judgment action where there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Early v. \nBrown, 116 N.C. App. 206, 208 (1994).     \nFirst Declaratory Judgment Claim \n117. In their Third Amended Complaints, Plaintiffs allege two claims for \ndeclaratory judgment, which the Court will address in turn.  In the first, Plaintiffs \n“seek a declaratory judgment that any and all prior written ‘Licensing \nAgreements’ . . . executed by [Window World] and any Plaintiff, are null, invalid, and \n \n206 (Pls.’ Mot. 3.) \n \nunenforceable against Plaintiffs.”207  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the executed \nwritten agreements are null, invalid, and unenforceable because: \n(1) “the cause and/or object of the agreement, as intended by [Window World], was \nillegal” (the “Illegality Theory”);208 \n(2) “enforcement of such agreements against Plaintiffs would be against public \npolicy . . . [as] expressed in the Franchise Disclosure Rule’s requirements \napplicable to franchisors” (the “Public Policy Theory”);\n209  \n(3) “the prior agreements are null, invalid, and unenforceable because they were \ninduced by [Window World’s] fraud” (the “Fraudulent Inducement Theory”);210 \nand \n(4) “the putative obligations in the prior agreements are not enforceable against \nPlaintiffs because they arise from adhesionary contracts” (the \n“Unconscionability Theory”).\n211 \nIllegality and Public Policy Theories \n118. Plaintiffs first allege that the  Licensing Agreements Plaintiffs signed are \nvoid because Window World “intentionally created franchise relationships with \nfranchisees such as Plaintiffs and, simultaneously, in bad faith, took affirmative steps \n \n207 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 223; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 322.) \n \n208 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 224; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 323.) \n \n209 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 226; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 325.) \n \n210 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 227; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 326.) \n \n211 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 231; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 330.) \n \nto hide from those franchisees that [Window World] owed to them a battery of \nrequired disclosures under federal law.” 212  Plaintiffs allege  that “[t]he licensing \nagreements themselves, the way [Window World] presented them, and the fraudulent \nfranchise-law disclaimer they contained formed a key part of [Window World’s] illegal \nscheme to cover up its misconduct and hide its fraud.”213  Window World’s “egregious \nconduct,” Plaintiffs contend, is “incompatible with the Franchise Rule’s purpose of \npreventing misrepresentation and nondisclosures  [by franchisors]” 214 and \n“enforcement of such agreements against Plaintiffs would be against [this] public \npolicy.”215  \n119. Defendants contend in response that “[a] contract is not illegal just because \na Franchise -Rule violation occurred before its execution.” 216  Furthermore, \nDefendants argue, “Plaintiffs do not satisfy North Carolina’s standards for illegality \n[because a] contract is illegal only if its performance requires an illegal action.”\n217 \n120. Under North Carolina law , “[t]he general rule is that an agreement which \nviolates a constitutional statute or municipal ordinance is illegal and void.”  Marriott \nFin. Servs., Inc. v. Capitol Funds, Inc., 288 N.C. 122, 128 (1975).  Additionally, “where \n \n212 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶  225; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 324; see also Pls.’ Br. \nOpp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 16.) \n \n213 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 167.) \n \n214 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 17.) \n \n215 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 226; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 325.) \n \n216 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 23.) \n \n217 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 25  (citing Mid-Am. Apartments, L.P. v. Block at Church \nSt. Owners Ass’n, Inc., 257 N.C. App. 83, 84 (2017)).)   \ncertain acts are expressly made illegal, contracts based on such acts are void.”  Id.   \nHowever, “there is  . . . ample authority that the statutory imposition of a penalty, \nwithout more, will not invariably avoid a contract which contravenes a statute or \nordinance when the agreement or contract is not immoral or criminal in itself.”  Id .  \nIndeed, “courts will not extend the terms of a penal statute to avoid a contract unless \nsuch a result was within the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute.”  Furr \nv. Fonville Morisey, 130 N.C. App. 541, 545 (1998); see also Electrova Co. v. Spring \nGarden Ins. Co., 156 N.C. 232, 235 (1911) (“Where the contract or agreement sought \nto be enforced has no direct connection with the illegal act, but is collateral to it, then \nthe contract is not tainted or affected by the illegal act.”). \n121. The relevant inquiry regarding  Plaintiffs’ first claim for declaratory \njudgment is whether the Franchise Rule makes certain acts illegal or whether the \nFranchise Rule merely imposes a penalty.  If the former, a contract in violation of the \nFranchise Rule is void for illegality, while if the latter, a contract is not necessarily \nvoid.  This question necessarily implicates the intent of the F ederal Trade \nCommission (the “FTC”), and Congress more broadly, in enacting the Franchise Rule.  \nSee Marriott Fin. Servs., Inc., 288 N.C. at 129.  \n122. The Franchise Rule is a federal regulation, enforced by the FTC, that \nrequires a franchisor to provide disclosures to a prospective franchisee containing \ninformation about the franchisor, the franchise being offered, how much the \nfranchised business may potentially earn, and other information about the franchise \nsystem.218  In relevant part, the Franchise Rule states that: \n[I]t is an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of Section 5 of \nthe Federal Trade Commission Act: (a) For any franchisor to fail to \nfurnish a prospective franchisee with a copy of the franchisor’s current \ndisclosure document . . . at least 14 calendar-days before the prospective \nfranchisee signs a binding agreement[.] \n \n16 C.F.R. § 436.2.   \n123. Section Five of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTCA”) in turn sets \nforth the procedure by which  the FTC may enforce violations of the FT CA.  \nImportantly, courts have repeatedly held that private parties are not permitted to \nenforce section 5 of the FTCA—only the FTC may do so.  See, e.g., Halloway v. Bristol-\nMyers Corp. , 485 F.2d 986, 987 (D.C. Cir. 1973); Klein Sleep Prods. v . Hillside \nBedding Co., No. 83 -4014, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19179 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 1983); \nVino 100, LLC v. Smoke on the Water, LLC, 864 F. Supp. 2d 269, 281 (E.D. Pa. 2012). \n124. This Court, like many courts before it, finds that permitting a franchisee to \nuse a franchisor’s alleged noncompliance with the Franchise R ule as a basis for \ninvalidating a franchise contract would be inconsistent with the intent of the FTC \nand Congress.  See, e.g., Palermo Gelato, LLC v. Pino Gelato, Inc., No. 12-CV-00931, \n2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9931, at *26 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 24, 2013) ( “It appears that every \ncourt that has confronted the issue has determined, with persuasive reasoning, that \na violation of the disclosure requirements of the Franchise Rule does not provide the \nbasis to render a subsequent agreement void as illegal or contrary to public policy.”).  \n \n218 See generally 16 C.F.R. §§ 436.1–.11. \nTo permit a franchisee to do so would essentially allow a plaintiff to circumvent the \nbar on private actions to enforce the FTCA and create a private right of action under \nsection 5.   \n125. Furthermore, as Defendants state in their briefing, the Licensing \nAgreements themselves do not violate the Franchise Rule or FTC A, nor do the \nLicensing Agreements themselves require the performance of an illegal action .  The \nconduct prohibited by the Franchise Rule is the failure to provide required disclosures \nprior to the signing of franchise a greements.  A franchisor’s  failure to disclose  is a \nmatter for the FTC to enforce and does not impact  the terms of the agreement \nbetween the franchisor and its franchisees.  See Hines v. Norcott , 176 N.C. 123, 125 \n(1918) (stating that a town ordinance that rendered a lease illegal did not invalidate \nthe lease itself because the statute concerned a “question between [the lessor] and \nthe town authorities”).  For the se reasons, therefore, the Court declines to hold that \nthe Licensing Agreements are void for illegality and will grant Defendants’ Motion \ndismissing Plaintiffs’ first declaratory judgment claim seeking a declaration to this \neffect.   \n126. Nor can the Court conclude that the fact that a franchisor violated the \nFranchise Rule in procuring a franchise agreement necessarily determines that the \nfranchise agreement is void as against public policy.  To the contrary, as our Supreme \nCourt has explained: \nThe reason that some contracts and agreements are declared void as \nagainst public policy is because the enforcement of them by the courts \nwould have a direct tendency to injure the public good.  The law does not \nconsider the advantage or interests of either party to the contract, but \nacts only from considerations of the public good  . . . [A] court should \ndeclare a contract void as against public policy only when the case is \nclear and free from doubt and the injury to the public is substantial and \nnot theoretical or problematical. \n \nElectrova Co., 156 N.C. at 235.   \n127. It does not appear that any injury —much less substantial injury —to the \npublic will result from enforcing the Licensing Agreements in the circumstances here.  \nAccordingly, the Court will also grant Defendants’ Motion seeking summary \njudgment on Plaintiffs’ first declaratory judgment claim to the extent it seeks a \ndetermination that the Licensing Agreements are void as against public policy. \nUnconscionability Theory \n128. Plaintiffs next argue that , “ [i]n the further alternative, the putative \nobligations in the prior agreements are not enforceable against Plaintiffs because \nthey arise from adhesionary contracts.”219   \n129. Under North Carolina law, in certain cases, contracts of adhesion can be \nstruck down if they are unconscionable.  Sears Roebuck & Co. v. Avery, 163 N.C. App. \n207, 216 (2004) (“Contracts of adhesion will not be enforced unless they are \nconscionable and within the reasonable expectations of the parties.”).  An \nunconscionable contract of adhesion is marked by its standard form, unchangeable \nterms, and lack of a realistic opportun ity to bargain.  See, e.g. , Tillman v. Comm. \nCredit Loans, Inc. , 362 N.C. 93, 102 (2008) (“An inquiry into unconscionability \nrequires that a court consider all the facts and circumstances of a particular case, and \n \n219 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 231; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 330.) \n \nif the provisions are then viewed as so one-sided that the contracting party is denied \nany opportunity for a meaningful choice, the contract should be found \nunconscionable.” (cleaned up)).   \n130. To establish unconscionability  under North Carolina law, Plaintiffs must \nshow both procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability.  Wilner v. \nCedars of Chapel Hill, LLC , 241 N.C. App. 389, 392 (2015).  “Procedural \nunconscionability involves ‘bargaining naughtiness’ in the formation of the contract, \nsuch as ‘fraud, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation, [or] inadequate \ndisclosure.’ ”  Weaver v. Saint Joseph of the Pines, Inc., 187 N.C. App. 198, 212 (2007) \n(quoting Rite Color Chemical Co. v. Velvet Textile Co. , 105 N.C. App. 14, 20 (1992)).  \n“Substantive unconscionability involves an ‘ inequality of the bargain ’ that is ‘ so \nmanifest as to shock the judgment of a person of common sense, and  . . . the \nterms . . . so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them on the one hand, \nand no honest and fair person would accept them on the other.”  Id. (quoting Brenner \nv. Little Red Sch. House, Ltd. , 302 N.C. 207, 213 (1981) ).  “ The courts of this State \nwill only set aside contractual agreements based upon unconscionability in a very \nrare case.”  Westmoreland v. High Point Healthcare Inc., 218 N.C. App. 76, 91 (2012).   \n131. Plaintiffs contend that t he Licensing Agreements  they entered are \nunconscionable in both process and substance and are thus invalid.\n220  They  argue \nthat the circumstances here “demonstrate unfairness, lack of meaningful choice, and \n \n220 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 15.) \n \nunequal bargaining power.” 221  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the Licensing \nAgreements are procedurally unconscionable because Window World “presented \nincreasingly more onerous agreements for execution long after Plaintiffs had begun \noperations and made extraordinary investments in their businesses and the Window \nWorld brand, all while assuring Plaintiffs that the new forms were ‘just paperwork,’ \ndidn’t apply to Plaintiffs, and wouldn’t cha nge the terms of the relationship.” 222  \nPlaintiffs further contend that Window World did so “knowing that it presented the \nlicensing agreements without making disclosures required by franchise law and while \nwithholding material facts under the common law,” thus effectively denying \n“Plaintiffs information necessary to make an informed decision how to proceed.”\n223   \n132. Plaintiffs assert that t he Licensing Agreements are also substantively \nunconscionable because of “the harshness and one -sidedness of the terms [Window \nWorld] now seeks to enforce . . . [such as] the right to take Plaintiffs’ businesses, \nwithout compensation and for no reason, on 90 days’ notice; to not renew Plaintiffs’ \nlicense (and thereby take their businesses) for any reason or no reason; to raise the \nroyalties Plaintiffs pay to any amount it chooses; and to repudiate [Window World’s] \n‘main pitch’ that it would secure best pricing for Plaintiffs.”\n224 \n \n221 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 15.) \n \n222 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 15.) \n \n223 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 15.) \n \n224 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 15–16.) \n \n133. Defendants counter that the procedural circumstances surrounding the \nLicensing Agreements’ formation were fair —contending that “Plaintiffs were given \nthe licensing agreements to read before signing”225 and that “Plaintiffs could and did \nnegotiate changes to their licensing agreements.” 226  Additionally, Defendants \ncontend that “the mere fact that a contract ‘actually may be unreasonable’ or ‘may \nlead to hardship on one side’ does not render it substantively unconscionable.” 227  \nDefendants assert that p arties “should be entitled to contract on their own terms \nwithout the indulgence of paternalism by courts in the alleviation of one side or \nanother from the effects of a bad bargain.” 228  Even if this were not the case, \nDefendants argue, “the agreements aren’t actually one- sided” and “the termination \nclauses weren’t unconscionable either.”229 \n134. As an initial matter, th e Court finds that a genuine dispute of fact exists \nregarding whether there was procedural unconscionability in the formation of the \nLicensing Agreements.  In their depositions, many  Plaintiffs testified that, because \nthey had already invested substantially in their Window World stores , declining to \nsign the written agreements and withdrawing from the Window World system was \n \n225 (Defs.’ Reply Br.

J. 15.) \n \nnot a feasible option at the time Window World presented the Licensing or Franchise \nAgreements for signature.230   \n135. That said, the record also shows , as Defendants contend, that “Plaintiffs \ncould and did negotiate changes to their licensing agreements.” 231  For example, the \nRoland Plaintiffs added a carve -out to their non -compete allowing them to continue \nselling a competing window product in a separate business that they owned. 232  \nSimilarly, t he Edwards, Ford, and Jones Plaintiffs made changes to their written \nagreements by negotiating for expanded exclusive trade areas .233  The Court \n \n230 (See, e.g., Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.6966–67 (“A: I’ll start with generally I was very surprised \nwith the agreement that ended up on my desk and with how late it was in arriving to me and \nhow far into debt I was at the time when I did receive it . . .

A: My wife and I, yes.”) \n \nconcludes that these competing proofs concerning procedural unconscionability \ncannot be resolved on summary judgment and must be resolved by a jury.     \n136. The Court similarly concludes that the record presents genuine issues of \nmaterial fact regarding whether the executed Licensing Agreements are \nsubstantively unconscionable.  In their briefing, Plaintiffs point to provisions in the \nwritten agreements that grant Window World the right to “take Plaintiffs’ businesses, \nwithout compensation and for no reason, on 90 days’ notice; to not renew Plaintiffs’ \nlicense[s] (and thereby take their businesses) for any reason or no reason; to raise the \nroyalties Plaintiffs pay to any amount [Window World]  chooses; and to repudiate \n[Window World’s] ‘main pitch’ that it would secure best pricing for Plaintiffs.”\n234  A \n \n(Kenneth Ford, Jr.); 1.App.8161 (“Q: In fact, you knew how to go to Window World and ask \nfor something that you thought was important to Lexington for it to be included in the \nagreement, correct?

However, a s our \ncourts have made clear, the bar for substantive unconscionability is high.  “The \ninequality of the bargain  . . . must be ‘so manifest as to shock the judgment of a \nperson of common sense, and  . . . the terms  . . . so oppressive that no reasonable \nperson would make them on the one hand, and no honest and fair person would accept \nthem on the other.’ ”  King v. King, N.C. App. 454, 458 (1994) (quoting Brenner, 302 \nN.C. at 213).  Whether Plaintiffs meet this high burden similarly cannot be resolved \non summary judgment and instead must be resolved by a jury.  Accordingly, \nDefendants’ Motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ first declaratory judgment \nclaim seeking a declaration that the Licensing Agreements are void for \nunconscionability shall be denied.  \nFraudulent Inducement Theory \n137. Plaintiffs also argue that “any and all prior written ‘Licensing \nAgreements’ . . . executed by [Window World] and any Plaintiff, are null, invalid, and \nunenforceable against Plaintiffs” because “they were induced by [Window World’s] \nfraud.”235  Plaintiffs allege that Window World “made affirmative misrepresentations \nand material omissions to Plaintiffs with the specific intention of inducing Plaintiffs \nto enter into franchise relationships with [Window World], to execute ‘Licensing \n \nwill attempt to negotiate prices for the benefit of FRANCHISEE, FRANCHISOR has no \nobligation to do so.)

Defendants contend in response that Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding \nfraudulent inducement “do not attack the written licensing agreements at all – they \ntarget the alleged oral statements that predated the licensing agreements ,” and \n“Plaintiffs point to no authority suggesting that a fully integrated contract should be \nset aside in favor of enforcing earlier, fraudulent oral statements.”238 \n139. As discussed above, however,  this Court finds that genuine issues of \nmaterial fact exist regarding whether Plaintiffs were fraudulently induced to contract \nwith Window World by Window World’s alleged rebate and best pricing \nmisrepresentations and, relatedly, by Window World’s alleged fraudulent omissions \nconcerning the nature of the parties’ relationship.  Accordingly, the Court denies the \nparties’ Cross -Motions to the extent they pertain to Plaintiffs’ Fraudulent \nInducement Theory as well as Defendants’ Motion to the extent it pertains to \nPlaintiffs’ Unconscionability Theory under the first claim for declaratory judgment.  \nAs noted above, however, the Court will grant Defendants’ Motion to the extent it \nseeks summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs’ first declaratory judgment claim \n \n236 (15-CVS-1 Third Am.

In their second claim for declaratory judgment (Plaintiff’s Second Cause of \nAction in the Baton Rouge Action or Fourth Cause of Action in the St. Louis Action), \nPlaintiffs contend that they are “entitled to a judgment declaring they have the right \nto continue to operate on the same terms established by the parties’ course of dealings \nthat existed independent of any prior written ‘Licensing Agreements’ or ‘Franchise \nAgreements[.]’ ”\n239  Defendants argue in opposition that, for the various reasons \noutlined earlier in this opinion, the “licensing agreements are  the parties’ ‘true’ \nagreements”240 and therefore that Plaintiffs’ claim should be dismissed.  Since, as set \nforth above, the Court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist at least \nregarding whether the written agreements are “null, invalid, and unenforceable \nbecause they were induced by [Window World’s] fraud,”\n241 the Court will deny \nDefendants’ Motion for summary judgment on this claim.   \nD.

Defendants argue, however, that the written agreements are enforceable as \na matter of law , the written agreements control the parties’ relationship,  and that \nDefendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claim for reformation \nand injunction because: (1) “Plaintiffs ratified their licensing agreements”; (2) \n“Plaintiffs waited too long to rescind”; (3) “Plaintiffs have not offered restitution”; (4) \nthe “licensi ng agreements are not illegal and do not violate public policy”; (5) the \n“licensing agreements are not void as ‘contracts of adhesion’ ”; (6) “Plaintiffs were not \nfraudulently induced into signing their licensing agreements”; (7) the “[p]arol -\nevidence rule bars reference to prior oral statements”; (8) there is a “presumption \nagainst contracts lasting indefinitely”; and (9) “[t]he parties ‘course of dealing’ didn’t \nchange.”\n248 \n143.

Co., 248 N.C. 215, 219 (1958)).   \n144. To survive summary judgment on a claim for “equitable reformation of a \ncontract on the basis of inequitable conduct by the promisor”: \na plaintiff must show a factual basis for four essential elements: (1) the \nwritten agreement did not properly express the intent of the parties, (2) \nthe conduct of the promisor caused the improper expression, (3) \nrelevant, competent evidence exists outside the written documents \nwhich shows the intention of the parties, and (4) injustice will result if \nthe contract is not rewritten.” \n   \nId. (quoting Carter v. West Am. Ins. Co., 190 N.C. App. 532, 537–38 (2008)).   \n145. Plaintiffs contend that the “facts here establish all four elements” of a claim \nfor reformation.\n249   \n146. As to the first element, Plaintiffs assert that the written agreements did “not \ncapture the parties’ true agreement” because, al though the “parties agreed that \n[Window World] would secure best pricing for Plaintiffs and that Plaintiffs would pay \n[Window World] no more than $10 per window in rebates” and that “Plaintiffs’ \n \n249 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 20.) \n \nlicenses were perpetual in the absence of material default,” “all licensing agreements \nomitted any reference to rebates, and all agreements from 2006 forward omitted any \nreference to [Window World’s] best -pricing promise and allowed [Window World] to \nterminate or not to renew Plaintiffs’ license without cause.”250   \n147. Each Plaintiff testified in these actions that the written agreement that the \nPlaintiff executed was different from the agreement the Plaintiff understood it to be.  \nAs previously discussed, with the exception of the Ballard, Ford, Jones/Shumate, and \nRose Plaintiffs, all Plaintiffs testified that their agreement with Window World was \nthat Plaintiffs would pay Window World no more than $10 per window in rebates.251  \nSimilarly, although they dispute the scope of Window World’s best pricing promise, \nall Plaintiffs testified that Window World had promised to secure Plaintiffs some form \nof best pricing.252  All Plaintiffs further testified  that, contrary to the terms in their \nwritten Licensing Agreements, Window World agreed that Plaintiffs’ “licenses” were \nperpetual in the absence of a material default. 253  The Court finds this evidence \n \n250 (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 20.) \n \n251 (See supra note 104–06.) \n \n252 (See supra note 135–36.) \n \n253 (See, e.g., Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J.

Similarly, Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence to meet their burden \non summary judgment to show the third element of a reformation claim.

Defendants challenge Plaintiffs’ evidentiary showing, contending that the \n“licensing agreements are fully integrated contracts with a merger clause” and that \n“[t]he parol-evidence rule bars [ reference to] pre-contractual negotiations.”255  The \nCourt finds Defendants’ parol evidence argument without merit  on the summary \njudgment record here.   \n151. Generally, “affidavits or other material offered which set forth inadmissible \nfacts should not be considered for summary judgment.”  Briley v. Farabow, 348 N.C. \n537, 544 (1998).  See also Strickland v. Doe, 156 N.C. App. 292 (2003) (in ruling on a \nmotion for summary judgment, the trial court should disregard portions of affidavits \ncontaining hearsay, legal conclusions, or inadmissible evidence).  However, here, as \ndiscussed at length above, Plaintiffs have offered evidence from which a reasonable \njury could conclude that the written agreements were procured by Window World’s \nfraud.  North Carolina law is clear that “[t]he parol evidence rule does not apply when \nit is alleged and shown that the execution of a written instrument was procured by \nfraud.”  Fox v. Southern Appliances, Inc., 264 N.C. 267, 274 (1965).   \n152. In addition, parol evidence may supplement a writing where it is silent.  See \n11 Williston § 33:21 (“If the parties never adopted the writing as a statement of the \n \n255 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 32.)    \nwhole agreement, the rule does not exclude parol evidence of additional promises.”).  \nBecause Plaintiffs provide substantial evidence to support their allegations that (1) \nthe written Licensing Agreements were induced by Window World’s fraud and (2) the \nwritten Licensing Agreements are silent on topics that both parties agree were within \nthe scope of their agreement, such as rebates, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have \noffered sufficient evidence to establish the third element of Plaintiffs’ reformation \nclaim at the summary judgment stage. \n153. Last, Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that an \ninjustice will result if the contract is not rewritten.   As discussed at length above , \nPlaintiffs have represented that they were induced to contract with Window World \nby Window World’s alleged promises concerning best pricing , rebates , and the \nperpetual nature of Plaintiffs’ licenses.\n256  A reasonable factfinder could conclude that \ninjustice would result if Window World could avoid these promises through \nenforcement of the written agreements omitting these terms.   \n154. Since Plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence to show at least a genuine \nissue of material fact as to each element of their claim for reformation and injunction, \nthe Court will deny Defendants’ Motion for summary judgment on these claims.  \nE. Breach of Contract \n155. Plaintiffs allege in their Third Amended Complaint that “[t]he parties’ \nagreements, as reflected in their course of dealings, included [Window World’s] \npromise to secure for Window World franchisees, including Plaintiffs, superior \n \n256 (See supra notes 107, 123.) \nwholesale pricing for the products Plaintiffs purchased, sold, and installed as Window \nWorld franchisees” (emphasis added).257  Plaintiffs allege that Window World breached \nthis promise by “failing to secure superior wholesale pricing from suppliers, requiring \nthat Plaintiffs purchase products and supplies at inflated prices from suppliers \nselected by [Window World], receiving undisclosed kickbacks or re bates on products \nand supplies purchased by franchisees from designated suppliers, providing \nundisclosed ‘C’ pricing to certain franchisees with lower levels of sales, requiring \ncertain Plaintiffs to take on debt obligations owed to AMI by former franchisees in a \nmanner not required of similarly situated franchisees, and failing to make franchise \ndisclosures required by applicable law.”258 \n156. Defendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ breach of contract \nclaim, contending generally that (1) the written Licensing Agreements control; (2) \nthere is no evidence that the written agreements were breached; (3) there is no \nevidence that Defendants made or breached any alleged oral “superior wholesale \nprice” promise; and (4) the parol evidence rule bars pre-contractual negotiations.259 \n157. To maintain an action for breach of contract, a party must show “(1) the \nexistence of a valid contract; and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. \nHill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26 (2000).   \n \n257 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 247; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 351.)  \n \n258 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 249; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 353.) \n \n259 (Defs.’ Mot. 7; Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 30.)   \n \n158. As discussed at length above, the parties dispute whether the written \nagreements or the parties’ oral agreements and course of dealing s form the contract \nbetween the parties, and the Court has found that each side has offered sufficient \nevidence to put this issue to a jury  for determination .  In addition, and also as \ndiscussed above, the Court has found that Plaintiffs have provided substantial \nevidence that Defendants breached their contractual “best pricing” promise by \n“providing undisclosed ‘C’ pricing to certain franchisees” and by “failing to secure \nsuperior wholesale pricing from suppliers ,”260 evidence sufficient to also put these \nissues to a jury.   \n159. Accordingly, the Court will deny Defendants’ Motion for summary judgment \non Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract, except those claims advanced by the \nJones/Shumate Plaintiffs .  As discussed previously, the Jones/Shumate Plaintiffs \ntestified that Window World’s “best pricing” representation concerned non-licensees \nwithin their trade area and were unable to produce evidence that Window World \nbreached this alleged best pricing promise. 261  The Court therefore will grant \nsummary judgment for Defendants on the Jones/Shumate Plaintiffs’ breach of \ncontract claim based on Window World’s alleged best pricing promise. \nF. Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \n160. Defendants next seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs ’ claim for breach of \nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  North Carolina law has long \n \n260 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 249; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 353; see also supra \n¶¶ 66–78 and related notes.) \n \n261 (See supra ¶ 71 and note 137.) \nrecognized that there is in every contract an implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing that “neither party will do anything which injures the right of the other to \nreceive the benefits of the agreement.”  Governor’s Club Inc. v. Governor’s Club Ltd. \nP’ship, 152 N.C. App. 240, 251 (2002).  Similarly, our courts have recognized that “[a] \ncontract . . . encompasses not only its express provisions but also all such implied \nprovisions as are necessary to effect the intention of the parties unless express terms \nprevent such inclusion.”  Lane v. Scarborough, 284 N.C. 407, 410 (1973).   \n161. To state a valid claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and \nfair dealing, a plaintiff must “plead that the party charged took action ‘which injure[d] \nthe right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement,’ thus ‘depriv[ing] the \nother of the fruits of [the] bargain.’ ”  Conleys Creek Ltd. P’ship v. Smoky Mt. Country \nClub Prop. Owners Ass’n, 255 N.C. App. 236, 253 (2017) (quoting Bicycle Transit \nAuth. v. Bell, 314 N.C. 219, 228–29 (1985)).  “Evasion of the spirit of the bargain, lack \nof diligence and slacking off, willful rendering of imperfect performance, abuse of a \npower to specify terms, and interference with or failure to cooperate in the other \nparty’s performance” may each constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing.  Intersal, Inc. v. Wilson , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 29, at *67 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 23, 2023) (quoting Restatement 2d of Contracts § 205 cmt. d (1981)).  \n162. Plaintiffs’ implied covenant claim rests on the same grievances as their \nbreach of contract claim; specifically,  that Window World breached the implied \ncovenant by:  \nfail[ing] to secure superior wholesale pricing from suppliers, requir[ing] \nthat Plaintiffs purchase products and supplies at inflated prices from \nsuppliers selected by [Window World], receiv[ing] undisclosed kickbacks \nor rebates on purchases of products and supplies made by Plaintiffs, \nfail[ing] to disclose the kickbacks and rebates, fail[ing] to disclose \n[Window World] ownership interests in various suppliers, provid[ing] \nundisclosed ‘C’ pricing to certain franchisees with lower levels of sales, \nwhile representing that Plaintiffs were receiving the most favorable ‘B’ \npricing, requir[ing] certain Plaintiffs to take on debt obligations owed to \nAMI by former franchisees in a manner not required of similarly \nsituated franchisees, and fail[ing] to make franchise disclosures \nrequired by applicable law.\n262 \n \n163. Under North Carolina law, “where a party’s claim for breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing is based on the same acts as its claim for \nbreach of contract, we treat the former as part and parcel of the latter.”  Cordaro v. \nHarrington Bank, FSB, 260 N.C. App. 26, 38– 39 (2018); see also  Se. Anesthesiology \nConsultants, PLLC v. Rose, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 52, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 20, \n2019) (“[G]ood faith and fair dealing claims that are ‘part and parcel’ of breach of \ncontract claims . . . merely stand or fall together.”).  Accordingly, the Court will deny \nDefendants’ Motion on Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of the implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing  in the same manner and to the same extent as the Court has \ndenied Defendants’ Motion on Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim .  Thus, the Court \nwill likewise enter summary judgment against the Jones/Shumate Plaintiffs on their \ngood faith and fair dealing claim as it did on those Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim.  \nG. Unjust Enrichment \n164. Plaintiffs plead, in the alternative to their claims for breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,  that “Defendants have \n \n262 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 256; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 360.) \n \nbeen unjustly enriched at Plaintiffs’ expense.” 263  Plaintiffs specifically allege that \nWindow World “ engaged in a wide range of misconduct that was intended to harm \nPlaintiffs’ interests and to further the interests of [Window World]” 264 and that “[i]t \nwould be inequitable and unjust ” for Window World “ to retain the benefits of its \nfranchise relationships with Plaintiffs, including the income it received as a result of \nthose relationships.” 265  Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary \njudgment on Plaintiffs’ claim for unjust enrichment because “the claim cannot lie \nwhere there is an express contract.”266 \n165. Under North Carolina law, “the mere fact that one party was enriched, even \nat the expense of the other, does not bring the doctrine of unjust enrichment into \nplay.”  Butler v. Butler, 239 N.C. App. 1, 7 (2015).  To survive a motion for summary \njudgment, and to establish a prima facie case for unjust enrichment, Plaintiffs must \nprovide evidence of the following elements:   \nFirst, one party must confer a benefit upon the other party.  Second, the \nbenefit must not have been conferred officiously, that is it must not be \nconferred by an interference in the affairs of the other party in a manner \nthat is not justified in the circumstances.  Third, the benefit must not be \ngratuitous.  Fourth, the benefit must be measurable.  Last,  the \ndefendant must have consciously accepted the benefit. \n \n \n263 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 281; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 36.) \n \n264 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 283; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 388.) \n \n265 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 284; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 389.) \n \n266 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 12, note 4 (citing Booe v. Shadrick , 322 N.C. 567, 570 \n(1988)).) \n \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, Nat’l Ass’n v. Browning , 230 N.C. App. 537, 541– 42 (2013) \n(cleaned up).  Thus, “to prevail on a claim of unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must show \nthat property or benefits were conferred on a defendant under circumstances which \ngive rise to a legal or equitable obligation on the part of the defendant to account for \nthe benefits received.”  Butler, 239 N.C. App. at 7 (citing Norman v. Nash Johnson & \nSons’ Farms, Inc., 140 N.C. App. 390, 417 (2000)) (cleaned up).   \n166. Furthermore, a claim for unjust enrichment cannot survive where a contract \nexists between two parties because the “doctrine of unjust enrichment is based on \nquasi-contract’ or contract ‘implied in law[.]’ ”  Atl. & E. Carolina Ry. Co. v. Wheatly \nOil Co., 163 N.C. App. 748, 753 (2004); see also Butler, 239 N.C. App. at 7; Booe v. \nShadrick, 322 N.C. 567, 570 (1988); Delta Envtl. Consultants, Inc. v. Wysong & Miles \nCo., 132 N.C. App. 160, 165 (1999) (“It is well established that if there is a contract \nbetween the parties, the contract governs the claim and the law will not imply a \ncontract . . . [in such cases] an action for breach of contract, rather than unjust \nenrichment, is the proper cause of action.” (internal citation and quotation marks \nomitted)).  Thus, a claim for unjust enrichment necessarily fails whenever a written \nor oral contract was in effect between the parties.   \n167. Based on the above, the Court will deny Defendants’ Motion as to Plaintiffs’ \nunjust enrichment claim at th e summary judgment stage .  All Plaintiffs have \nprovided substantial evidence to permit a factfinder to conclude that  the written \nLicensing Agreements were induced by Window World’s fraud and that this fraud \nrendered the written agreements Plaintiffs executed void and unenforceable.   \nGenuine issues of material fact remain concerning whether a valid contract, whether \nit be oral or written, was in effect between the parties.  Whether a valid, enforceable \ncontract existed between Plaintiffs and Window World is a question for the jury, and \nthus, a factual issue that cannot be resolved at the summary judgment stage.      \nH. Violation of N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 \n168. Plaintiffs also contend that they are “entitled to recover from Defendants for \nunfair or deceptive acts or practices.” 267  Specifically, Plaintiffs allege  that the \nfollowing unfair or deceptive acts or practices taken by Window World violated North \nCarolina’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 (the \n“UDTPA”): \na. “fail[ing] to make disclosures required by franchise disclosure laws”; \nb. “repeatedly misrepresent [ing] that [Window World] would secure for  \nPlaintiffs wholesale prices from suppliers at levels that fell below what \nretail establishments could otherwise obtain in the respective franchise \nterritory and that [Window World’s] buying power allowed it to secure the \nbest prices available for Plaintiffs”; \nc.  “repeatedly misrepresent[ing] that [Window World] had two tiers of dealer \npricing (‘A’ and ‘B’ pricing) for window purchases from AMI”; \nd.  “repeatedly misrepresent[ing] that Plaintiffs were entitled to receive, and \nin fact would receive and were receiving the best available pricing on \n \n267 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 276; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 380.) \nproducts and supplies if they achieved a certain volume of unit sales in a \nmonth”; \ne.  “provid[ing] undisclosed ‘C’ pricing to certain franchisees with lower levels \nof sales while representing Plaintiffs were receiving the most favorable ‘B’ \npricing”; \nf.  “receiv[ing] undisclosed kickbacks or rebates on Plaintiffs’ \npurchases . . . from [Window World] required suppliers”; \ng.  “hid[ing] from Plaintiffs the undisclosed kickbacks or rebates that [it] \nreceives on Plaintiffs’ purchases  . . . from [Window World] -designated \nsuppliers and all information about the amount of such rebates, the way \nsuch rebates were negotiated, calculated, and applied, the portions of the \nprices paid by Plaintiffs that constituted such rebates, and the impact of \nthe rebates on the cost of goods sold by Plaintiffs”; \nh. “requir[ing] Plaintiffs to assume debt owed by prior franchisees to \nvendors . . . by former franchisees in a manner not required of similarly \nsituated franchisees”; \ni. “fail[ing] to disclose that [it] was obligated to pay some or all of the debt \nthat [Window World] required Plaintiffs to assume”; and \nj. with certain designated suppliers, “agree[ing] to charge Plaintiffs inflated  \nprices for products and supplies to provide greater  revenue to [Window \nWorld].”\n268 \n \n268 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 278; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 382.) \n \n169. To maintain a private cause of action under the UDTPA, a plaintiff must \nshow that “(1) the defendant committed an unfair or deceptive act, (2) the act in \nquestion was in or affecting commerce, and (3) the act was the proximate cause of the \nplaintiff's injuries.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. at  656.  “A practice is unfair when it \noffends established public policy as well as when the practice is immoral, unethical, \noppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers.”  Marshall v. \nMiller, 302 N.C. 539, 548 (1981)).  “A deceptive practice is one which has the ‘capacity \nor tendency to deceive;’ proof of actual deception is not necessary.”  Lincoln v. Bueche, \n166 N.C. App. 150, 158 (2004) (quoting Abernathy v. Ralph Squires Realty Co. , 55 \nN.C. App. 354, 357 (1982)).   \n170. Plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to summary judgment on their \nUDTPA claim as “there are no genuine issues of material fact,” and they are entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.\n269 \n171. Defendants likewise seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claim, argu ing \nthat “(1) [t]he Franchise Rule cannot be privately enforced; (2) [i]ncorporation of the \nFranchise Rule would contradict the North Carolina Business Opportunity Sales Act; \n(3) [p]ervasive regulation of franchise relationships precludes application of section \n75-1.1; (4) [c]hoice-of-law principles foreclose application of section 75 -1.1 to foreign \nPlaintiffs; and (5) [s]ection 75-1.1 does not apply extraterritorially to claims by foreign \nplaintiffs against in-state defendants complaining of foreign injuries.”270  Defendants \n \n269 (Pls.’ Mot. 3–4.) \n \n270 (Defs.’ Mot. 12–13.) \n \nfurther contend that “[a]ll grounds [for summary judgment] that apply to the fraud \nclaims also apply to the section 75-1.1 claims as well.”271 \n172. Ms. Whitworth, in her individual capacity, also seeks summary judgment \non Plaintiffs’ UDTPA claim,272 contending that “there is no genuine issue of material \nfact that the Chapter 75 claim fails and cannot mature into liability that could be \nimposed on [Ms. Whitworth] due to Plaintiffs’ lack of in-state injury.”273  Specifically, \nMs. Whitworth argues: \nPlaintiffs do not seek damages for physical injuries sustained in North \nCarolina, damage to or loss of property in North Carolina, loss of \nbusiness opportunities in North Carolina, or any other compensable \ninjury allegedly sustained in North Carolina.  Because Plaintiffs’ alleged \ninjuries were not suffered in North Carolina, Plaintiffs do not have and \ncannot prevail on a Chapter 75 claim.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Chapter \n75 claim –  including the demand for treble damages –  cannot create \n \n271 As with their motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ fraud claims, Defendants argue \nthat summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ UDTPA claim is warranted because “(6) [c]laims based \non the Franchise Rule are time-barred because Plaintiffs had all necessary facts when they \nreceived their Licensing Agreements; (7) [c]laims based on the Franchise Rule are time-\nbarred because the continuing-wrong doctrine does not apply; (8) [t]he Franchise Rule does \nnot provide a disclosure duty; (9) [o]mission claim fails because Defendants had no duty to \ndisclose; (10) [o]mission claim fails because Plaintiffs did not reasonably rely on any omission; \n(11) [o]mission claim fails because allegedly omitted information was not material and \nPlaintiffs did not actually rely on any omission; (12) [e]xpress misrepresentation claim fails \nbecause there was no misrepresentation of fact; (13) [e]xpress misrepresentation claim fails \nbecause Plaintiffs did not reasonably rely on any misrepresentation; (14) [e]xpress \nmisrepresentation claim fails because Plaintiffs did not actually r ely on any \nmisrepresentation; (15) [c]laim based on C -pricing theory fails because there is no evidence \nthat Plaintiffs were promised the absence thereof; (16) [c]laim based on C-pricing theory fails \nbecause there is no injury caused by non-competitors receiving different pricing; (17) [c]laim \nbased on assumed-debt theory fails because Plaintiffs voluntarily entered into contracts in \nnew territories; [and] (18) [p]arol -evidence rule bars reference to prior oral statements.”  \n(Defs.’ Mot. 13–14.) \n \n272 (Whitworth’s Mot.) \n \n273 (Whitworth’s Mot. 1.) \n \nliability that may be imposed on [Ms. Whitworth] and should be \ndismissed.274 \n \n173. Historically, N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 was “specifically limited to dealings within \n[North Carolina].”  The ‘In’ Porters, S.A. v. Hanes Printables, Inc. , 663 F. Supp. 494, \n501 (M.D.N.C. 1987).  However, i n 1977, the  General Assembly deleted this \ngeographical limitation.  Id.  To determine where a UDTPA action arises, the North \nCarolina appellate courts have not firmly determined whether to apply the “most \nsignificant relationship” test or the lex loci test .  See, e.g., Izzy Air, LLC v. Triad \nAviation, Inc., 284 N.C. App. 655, 659 (2022).  Under the most significant relationship \ntest, a court must look to “the law of the state having the most significant relationship \nto the occurrence giving rise to the action.”  Id. (quoting Andrew Jackson Sales v. Bi-\nLo Stores, Inc., 68 N.C. App. 222, 225 (1984)).  Under the lex loci test, however, “[t]he \nlaw of the State where the last act occurred giving rise to [the] injury governs [the] \nSec. 75-1.1 action.”  Id. (alterations in original) (quoting United Va. Bank v. Air-Lift \nAssocs., 79 N.C. App. 315, 321 (1986)).  This Court previously opined in this case that \n“the Supreme Court of North Carolina will likely apply the lex loci rule to section 75-\n1.1 claims based on its rejection of the modern trend towards the ‘most significant \nrelationship’ test in the court’s Boudreau decision and has applied the lex loci rule to \nsuch claims.”  Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc., 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 60, at *25– 26 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 12, 2017) ; Boudreau v. Baughman , 322 \n \n274 (Br. Supp. Tammy Whitworth’s Mot. Partial Summ. J. on Pls.’ Attempt to Impose Liability \nArising Out of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75 -1.1 Due to Lack of In- State Injury 2 [hereinafter \n“Whitworth’s Br.”], ECF No. 712 (sealed), 715 (redacted).) \nN.C. 331, 335–36 (1988).  This Court has not changed its view and therefore will apply \nthe lex loci test to Plaintiffs’ section 75-1.1 claims.275 \n174. Applying the lex loci test here, the Court finds that the undisputed evidence \nshows that the last act giving rise to Plaintiffs’ injuries—indeed, all of the events and \ncircumstances giving rise to Plaintiffs’ UDTPA claim s—occurred outside North \nCarolina.  It is undisputed that a ll Plaintiffs are located outside North Carolina, all \nof their business operations are outside North Carolina, Window World’s alleged \nunfair or deceptive trade practices occurred outside North Carolina, Plaintiffs’ lost \nsales and revenue occurred outside North Carolina, and Plaintiffs’ allegedly excessive \npayments to Window World were made from outside North Carolina.   \n175. Defendants contend that lost profits and overpayment injuries are deemed \nto have occurred “where the plaintiff feels the pain,” which usually “will be in the \n \n275 The Court finds further, recent support for its conclusion in the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina’s decision in SciGrip, Inc. v. Osae , 373 N.C. 409 (2020) .  In that case,  which was \ndecided three years after this Court’s 2017 opinion quoted above, the Supreme Court elected \nto apply the lex loci test to a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, stating “this Court’s \njurisprudence favors the use of the lex loci test in cases involving tort or tort-like claims.”  Id. \nat 420.  The Supreme Court explained: \n \n[a]lthough we cannot disagree with SciGrip’s  contention that use of the most \nsignificant relationship test would provide North Carolina courts with greater \nflexibility in identifying the state whose law should apply in any particular \ninstance, that increased flexibility is achieved at the cost of in troducing \nsignificant uncertainties into the process of identifying the state whose law \nshould apply, which we do not believe would be beneficial.  Moreover, while the \napplication of the lex loci test can be difficult in some circumstances, including \ncases involving events that occur in and entities associated with multiple \njurisdictions, those difficulties pale in comparison with the lack of certainty \ninherent in the application of a totality of t he circumstances test such as the \nmost significant relationship test.   \n \nId. at 421–22.   \n \nstate of the plaintiff’s principal place of business.” 276  See, e.g., Clifford v. Am. Int’l \nSpecialty Lines Ins. Co., 2005 WL 2313907, No. 1:04CV486, at *8 (M.D.N.C. Sep. 21, \n2005) (“In determining where the injury occurred in a case involving commercial or \nfinancial injury rather than physical injury, courts often look at the location where \nthe economic loss was felt.”) .  Plaintiffs counter that the federal cases on which \nDefendants rely are not binding  on this Court and that “the law of the state where \nthe wrongful conduct occurred – not the state where plaintiffs felt economic loss in \ntheir ‘pocketbook’ ” should govern – in this case, North Carolina.277   \n176. While Plaintiffs are correct that the North Carolina  appellate courts have \nnot yet adopted the ”pocketbook rule,” the majority of federal courts in North Carolina \nhave followed this approach  in the absence of controlling authority from North \nCarolina’s appellate courts.  See The ‘In’ Porters, S.A., 663 F.Supp. at 501–02 (finding \nthat “section 1-75.4(4), as applied to defining the reach of 75-1.1, requires an in-state \ninjury to plaintiff before plaintiff can state a valid unfair trade [ practice] claim” and \n“section 75-1.1 applies only if the plaintiff alleges an in -state, injurious effect on his \nbusiness operations in North Carolina.”) ; Bendfeldt v.

Although these federal cases  are not binding,  the Court finds them \npersuasive and concludes that the Supreme Court of North Carolina would apply \ntheir holdings should it be presented with the issue now before the Court.  \nAccordingly, since Plaintiffs can point to neither an in- state injury nor any in- state \nbusiness operations, the Court will grant summary judgment for Ms. Whitworth and \nDefendants, and deny summary judgment for Plaintiffs,  on Plaintiffs’ section 75-1.1 \nclaim.   \nI. F raudulent T ransfer \n178. Plaintiffs allege  in their Third Amended Complaints that  “[o]n June 23, \n2010, [Window World] transferred all its intellectual property assets, including but \nnot limited to Window World trademarks, to an insider, WWI, with the intent to \nhinder, delay or defraud Plaintiffs, and other current or future creditors.” 278  As a \n \n278 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 289; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 394.) \n \nresult, Plaintiffs claim  that they “are entitled to avoidance of [Window World’s] \ntransfers to WWI to the extent necessary to satisfy Plaintiff’s claims.”279   \n179. Plaintiffs bring their fraudulent transfer claims under N.C.G.S. §§ 39-\n23.4(a)(1) and 39-23.4(a)(2) of the North Carolina Uniform Voidable Transactions Act \n(the “NCUVTA”, N.C.G.S. §§ 39-23.1–.12).280  Sections  39-23.4(a)(1) and (2) provide \nas follows: \n(a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is voidable as to a \ncreditor, whether the creditor’s claim arose before or after the transfer \nwas made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer \nor incurred the obligation:  \n(1) With intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; \nor  \n(2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for \nthe transfer or obligation, and the debtor:  \na. Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a \ntransaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were \nunreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or  \nb. Intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts \nbeyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they became due. \n \n180. Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on their fraudulent transfer claims, \ncontending there are no genuine issues of material fact that (1) “Plaintiffs are \n‘creditors’ for purposes of a fraudulent transfer claim” and (2) Window World \nfraudulently transferred its marks to WWI.\n281   \n \n279 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 300; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 405.) \n \n280 The Court has previously dismissed the Non -Tolling Plaintiffs’ claim under N.C.G.S. \n§§ 39-23.4(a)(2).  See Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 11, at *34–35.  \nThus, the Court will only consider the Non -Tolling Plaintiffs’ claim under N.C.G.S. § 39-\n23.4(a)(1) and the Tolling Plaintiffs’ claims under both N.C.G.S. §§ 39-23.4(a)(1) and (2).   \n \n281 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 86–88.) \n \n181. Defendants also move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ fraudulent \ntransfer claims, arguing that (1) “[t]he Non-Tolling-Agreement Plaintiffs’ [remaining] \nclaims under section 39.23.4(a)(1) are barred by the statute of repose”; (2) “[t]he \nTolling-Agreement Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the statute of repose because \n[WWI] was not a party to the Tolling Agreement and there is no evidence to support \npiercing the [Window World] corporate veil to reach [Ms. Whitworth], and no evidence \nto then support reaching [WWI] via an alter ego or other theory”; and (3) “[t]he \nTolling-Agreement Plaintiffs’ claims are barred on their merits because there is no \nevidence to show that [Window World] created [WWI] to hinder, delay, or defraud any \ncreditor.”\n282  Defendant WWI also seeks summary judgment on the Non -Tolling \nPlaintiffs’ fraudulent transfer claims, contending that these Plaintiffs’ “existing \nNCUVTA claims are barred by the statute of repose.”283 \n182. As a threshold matter, section 39-23.9 provides a statute of repose that any \n“claim for relief with respect to a voidable transfer or obligation” arising under section \n39-23.4(a)(1) must be brought “not later than four years after the transfer was made \nor the obligation was incurred, or, if later, not later than one year after the transfer \nor obligation was or could reasonably have been discovered by the claimant.”  \nSimilarly, section 39-23.9 provides that a claim arising under section 39-23.4(a)(2) \n \n282 (Defs.’ Mot. 15–16.)   \n \n283 (WWI’s Mot.) \n \nmust be brought  “not later than four years after the transfer was made or the \nobligation was incurred.”284   \n183. Defendants first contend that the Non -Tolling Plaintiffs’ section 39-\n23.4(a)(1) claims are “barred because the June 23, 2010 transfer ‘was or could \nreasonably have been discovered by the claimant’ by 2014 – one year before they \nsued.”285  Defendant s contend that Plaintiffs reasonably could have discovered the \ntransfer by this time because: \n(1) “[t]he assignment of the marks [to WWI] was recorded and publicly available \non the [United State s Patent & Trademark Office  (“USPTO”)] website as of \nJune 23, 2010”;286 \n(2) “[e]ach Plaintiff received [Window World’s] initial FDD in October of 2011 , \nwhich expressly disclosed [WWI’s] ownership and licensing of the marks to \n[Window World] on pages 1 and 20”;287 \n \n284 (N.C.G.S. § 39-23.9(1), (2); See also Pls.’ Resp.

The Non-Tolling Plaintiffs attempt to save their fraudulent transfer claim \nby arguing that “discovery has revealed another basis for the Non -Tolling Plaintiffs’ \nfraudulent transfer claim: distributions paid by [Window World] to Tammy \nWhitworth while [Window World] was insolvent. ”293  These Plaintiffs argue that \n“[b]ecause a claim based on those distributions is not barred by the statute of repose, \nDefendants’ Motion should be denied.”\n294  But as WWI correctly contends: “[f]or nine \nyears (2015 to 2023), [Window World’s] transfer of the marks to [WWI] has been the \nsole basis for Plaintiffs’ fraudulent transfer claims.  Plaintiffs never , until their \nsummary judgment brief filed in late 2023, asserted a fraudulent transfer claim based \non distributions to [Ms. Whitworth].”\n295   \n \noccurred, and not the date that the fraudulent nature of the transfer became apparent.”  \nThus, the court held that N.C.G.S. § 39-23.9 barred plaintiff creditor’s claims under sections \n39-23.4(a)(1) and 39- 23.5(a) because they arose from a transfer over four years before suit \nwas filed, and plaintiff had notice of the transfer over one year before suing, as due diligence \nwould have given inquiry notice.  Id. at 89–90. \n \n293 (Pls.’ NCUVTA Resp. 2.) \n \n294 (Pls.’ NCUVTA Resp. 2 .)  The Non -Tolling Plaintiffs contend that Window World’s \ntransfers to Ms. Whitworth are in violation of N.C.G.S. §  39-23.5(a), which provides:  “A  \ntransfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is voidable as to a creditor whose claim arose \nbefore the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer \nor incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalen t value in exchange for \nthe transfer or obligation, and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became \ninsolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.”  (See Pls.’ NCUVTA Resp. 3.) \n \n295 (Reply Br.

Turning next to the Tolling Plaintiffs’ fraudulent transfer claims, the Court \nnotes that it has previously determined that the Tolling Agreement tolled the statute \nof repose for the Tolling Plaintiffs’ claims under N.C.G.S. §§  39-23.4(a)(1) and \n(a)(2).296  As stated above, under section 39-23.4(a), a transfer is voidable as to a \npresent or future creditor297 if the transfer was made:  \n(1) With intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or  \n \nSecond Am.

The parties do not dispute that the \nTolling Plaintiffs are “creditors” for purposes of the NCUVTA.   \n \n(2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the \ntransfer or obligation, and the debtor:  \na. Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a \ntransaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were \nunreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction. \n \n189. Section 39-23.4(b) provides that “intent” may be determined by considering, \namong other factors, whether: \n(1) The transfer or obligation was to an insider;  \n \n(2) The debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred \nafter the transfer;  \n \n(3) The transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed;  \n \n(4) Before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor \nhad been sued or threatened with suit;  \n \n(5) The transfer was of substantially all the debtor's assets;  \n \n(6) The debtor absconded;  \n \n(7) The debtor removed or concealed assets;  \n \n(8) The value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably \nequivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the \nobligation incurred;  \n \n(9) The debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the \ntransfer was made or the obligation was incurred;  \n \n(10) The transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial \ndebt was incurred;  \n \n(11) The debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a \nlienor that transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor;  \n \n(12) The debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without \nreceiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or \nobligation, and the debtor reasonably should have believed that the \ndebtor would incur debts beyond the debtor's ab ility to pay as they \nbecame due; and  \n \n(13) The debtor transferred the assets in the course of legitimate estate \nor tax planning. \n \n190. To support their claim under section 39 -23.4(a)(1), the Tolling Plaintiffs \ncontend that “[Mr.] Ingle, [Window World’s] then -President, thrice testified that the \nassignment was intended to shield [Window World’s] intellectual property from \n‘claims like lawsuits made by licensees or franchisees.’  ”\n298  They argue in addition \nthat “several of the factors listed in Section 39 -23.4(b) demonstrate a fraudulent \ntransfer – including that [Window World] was insolvent, the intellectual property \nassets transferred for no consideration were easily [Window World’ s] most valuable \nassets, [Window World] transferred the assets to an LLC controlled by an insider, \nand [Window World] retained control of the assets through its domination of \nWWI[.]”299   \n191. Defendants argue that the Tolling Plaintiffs’ claims under section \n39-23.4(a)(1) fail for lack of evidence, contending that “[WWI] was created at [Mr.] \nIngle’s suggestion, not to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor, but rather: (1) for \nmultiple business reasons to protect the [Window World] IP against all outside \nagencies,300 and (2) to make a potential future sale easier.” 301  Defendants also \n \n298 (Pls.’ Br.

J. 91.) \n \nintellectual property assets Window World transferred to WWI were valuable assets, \nthat Window World transferred the assets without receiving monetary compensation, \nthat WWI was controlled by an insider (Ms. Whitworth), or that Window World \n“retained control of the assets through its domination of WWI.”307 \n193. Based on the above, the Court finds that the Tolling Plaintiffs have provided \nsufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that the 2010 Transfer was \nmade “with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor” and thus in \nviolation of section 39-23.4(a)(1).  As a result, the Court will deny Defendant Window \nWorld’s Motion for summary judgment on the Tolling Plaintiffs’ fraudulent transfer \nclaims under section 39-23.4(a)(1).  The Court will also deny the Tolling Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for offensive summary judgment on thei r claims under section 39- 23.4(a)(1) \nclaims because questions of material fact remain as to Window World’s intent in \nmaking the 2010 Transfer which must be resolved by a jury. \n194. The Tolling Plaintiffs also move for offensive summary judgment on their \nsection 39-23.4(a)(2) claims, contending that Window World “received no \nconsideration for the [trademark] assignment” and that “the record establishes that \nafter the transfer, [Window World’s] remaining assets were unreasonably small for \nits business.” 308  More s pecifically, the Tolling Plaintiffs point out  that the 2010 \nTransfer “left [Window World] with approximately $15 million in assets against \n \n307 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 87.) \n \n308 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 87–88.) \n \nnearly $60 million in liabilities ,”309 and assert that  “the assignment deprived \n[Window World] of the intellectual property it licensed to Plaintiffs and other dealers, \nwhich directly or indirectly generated substantially all of [Window World’s] revenue, \nand [that] WWI may terminate [Window World’s] license to the marks without cause \non ten days’ written notice.”310   \n195. Defendants contend that the Tolling Plaintiffs’ section 39-23.4(a)(2) claims \nfail because Window World received valuable “ consideration – protection of the \nmarks, which also benefitted Plaintiffs[, and Window World’s] success since 2010, \nshown by its financials, demonstrate that its assets were always more than sufficient \nfor its business.” 311  As discussed above, a genuine dispute of material fact remains \nas to whether Window World received a “reasonably equivalent value in exchange” \nfor the 2010 Transfer and whether Window World’s remaining assets were \n“unreasonably small” at the time of the transfer.  Accordingly, the Court will deny \nboth Window World’s and the Tolling Plaintiffs’ Motions for summary judgment on \nthe Tolling Plaintiffs’ fraudulent transfer claims under section 39-23.4(a)(2).   \n196.

Window World, Inc., 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 11, at *26–27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 11, 2019), this Court held that, due to the \nstatute of repose, the Tolling Plaintiffs’ claims against WWI and Ms. Whitworth could \nonly be sustained if these Plaintiffs are able to pierce the corporate veil between Ms. \nWhitworth, WWI, and Window World.\n313  The Court will thus  turn to Plaintiffs’ \npiercing the corporate veil and alter ego arguments.   \nJ. Piercing the Corporate Veil \n197. As our Supreme Court has stated, “the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil \nis not a theory of liability.  Rather, it provides an avenue to pursue legal claims \nagainst corporate officers or directors who would otherwise be shielded by the \ncorporate form.”  Green v.

Thus, those cases holding that equitable doctrines cannot toll statutes \nof repose have no application on the facts pleaded here.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts \nto permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the Tolling Agreement tolled \nthe four-year statute of repose in  sections 39-23.9(1) and (2) on their claims \nunder sections 39-23.4(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the NCUVTA.  \n198. In their Third Amended Complaints, Plaintiffs allege that they are “entitled \nto recover from Tammy Whitworth individually and from WWI on each of the causes \nof action Plaintiffs assert against [Window World] pursuant to the doctrines of \npiercing the corporate veil, mere instrumentality and/or alter ego.” 314  Plaintiffs \nassert two theories of recovery.  First, Plaintiffs assert Window World and WWI are \nalter egos.\n315  Second, Plaintiffs “allege that they are entitled to pierce the corporate \nveil between Tammy Whitworth and [Window World].”316  The Court will address the \nparties’ Cross-Motions on these theories of recovery in turn.   \n199. To prove an alter ego relationship between corporate entities, a claimant \nmust establish three things: \n(1) Control, not mere majority or complete stock control, but complete \ndomination, not only of finances, but of policy and business practice \nin respect to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as \nto this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence \nof its own; and \n \n(2) Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud \nor wrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive \nlegal duty, or a dishonest and unjust act in contravention of [a] \nplaintiff’s legal rights; and \n \n(3) The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the \ninjury or unjust loss complained of. \n \nGlenn v. Wagner, 313 N.C. 450, 455 (1985).   \n \n314 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 163; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 262.) \n \n315 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 89–90.) \n \n316 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ.

App. 628, 636 (2006).  \n“Rather, it is a combination of factors which  . . . suggest that the corporate entity \nattacked had ‘no separate mind, will or existence of its own’ and was therefore the \n‘mere instrumentality or tool’ of the dominant corporation.”  Id.  “Common ownership \nand management, without more, do not equate to the kind of complete domination \nneeded to show that one entity is another’s puppet.”  Harris v. Ten Oaks Mgmt., 2022 \nNCBC LEXIS 62, at *7 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 20, 2022). \n201. Plaintiffs contend that they “are entitled to judgment as a matter of law that \n[Window World] and WWI are alter egos.” 317  Plaintiffs argue  that “the undisputed \nevidence establishes that WWI is a mere instrumentality that [Window World] \ndominates for its own benefit.” 318  Plaintiffs further contend that the “control” \nelement is satisfied as (1) WWI, like Window World, is owned entirely by Ms. \n \n317 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 89.)  Plaintiffs, however, do not move for summary \njudgment on the issue of whether they are entitled to pierce the corporate veil between \nTammy Whitworth and Window World.   \n \n318 (Pls.’ Br.

Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that Window World used WWI, its alleged \nalter ego, to defraud Plaintiffs and commit “numerous unfair and deceptive acts \nagainst them.” 321  Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that  Window World’s “creation of \nWWI for the sole purpose of assigning [Window World’s] most valuable asset – its \nintellectual property – to keep it away from Plaintiffs and other creditors reinforced \n[Window World’s] scheme to shield itself from liability for  its fraud and knowing \nviolations of franchise -law.”322  In addition , Plaintiffs assert that Window World’s \n“fraudulent transfer to WWI  . . . significantly impaired [Window World’s] ability to \npay Plaintiffs’ damages.”323 \n \n319 (Volume Two Pls.’ Dep.

Defendants seek summary judgment dismissing Plaintiffs’ alter ego claims, \ncontending that “Plaintiffs fail the first and most crucial element of complete \ndomination . . . It is undisputed that [Window World] is, and has been since February \n2011, controlled by a Board of Directors [and] the [Window World] Board exercises no \ncontrol over [WWI], nor does [WWI’s] sole member control [Window World] .”324  \nDefendants further contend that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the complete -domination \nelement because “Plaintiffs have shown no evidence of undercapitalization of \n[Window World], disregard of corporate formalities by either entity, excessive \nfragmentation, siphoning of funds or absence of corporate records.”\n325  Defendants \nalso argue that Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the second element of their alter ego \nclaim as “Plaintiffs fail to show that creating a separate holding company to hold IP \nis improper . . . [or] that [Window World] used [WWI] to defraud them.” 326  Finally, \nDefendants contend that Plaintiffs have “cite[d] no evidence to support their \nstatement that the transfer ‘significantly impaired’ [Window World’s] ability to pay \ndamages.”\n327 \n \n324 (Defs.’ Resp.

To support their argument, Defendants have produced substantial evidence \nthat (1) WWI was created to protect Window World from outside agencies328; (2) WWI \nwas created to make a potential future sale easier329; and (3) the idea of transferring \nthe trademarks to a separate entity “arose years earlier, during a discussion \nwith  . . . a Greensboro lawyer, regarding ways to handle Leon [Whitworth’s] excess-\ncompensation issues during an IRS audit.”330   \n205. Although piercing the corporate veil “is a strong step: Like lightning, it is \nrare and severe,” Harris, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 62, at *10 (quoting State ex rel. Cooper \nv. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC , 362 N.C. 431, 439 (2008)), the Court finds that \ngenuine issues of material fact remain concerning whether (1) Window World had \n“complete domination” of WWI, particularly at the time of the contested 2010 \nTransfer since Window World’s Board was not in existence at this time ; (2) whether \nsuch control, if it existed, was used by Window World to commit fraud or wrong; and \n(3) whether Plaintiffs suffered injury. \n \n328 (Defs.’ 1st App. 1.App.10675 (“Q: And when you say the transference of Window World, \nInc.’s valuable intellectual property would protect it, would it protect it from claims like \nlawsuits made by licensees or franchisees?

Accordingly, the Court will deny the parties’ Cross -Motions on Plaintiffs’ \nclaim that Window World and WWI are alter egos.  Furthermore, because Plaintiffs \nhave produced sufficient evidence to sustain their claim that Window World and WWI \nare alter egos at the summary judgment stage, t he Court will also deny the parties’ \nCross-Motions on the Tolling Plaintiffs’ claims against WWI under sections \n39-23.4(a)(1) and (a)(2).    \n207. Plaintiffs next contend  that they are entitled to pierce the corporate veil \nbetween Tammy Whitworth and Window World, asserting that: \n[d]uring the period of Tammy Whitworth’s sole ownership of [Window \nWorld’s] stock, her control over [Window World]  . . . permeated the \nentire company and extended from [Window World’s] finances to its \npolicy making and business practices.  Accordingly, [Window World] and \nits affiliates and subsidiaries have and have had no separate mind, will, \nor existence of their own apart  from Tammy Whitworth or from the \naffiliated Window World entities she likewise controls.\n331   \n \n208. Under the instrumentality test adopted by our Supreme Court , “if the \nplaintiff is able to pierce the corporate veil, the shareholder and the corporation are \nshown to be . . . ‘one and the same.’  ”  Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC , 362 N.C. at 441 \n(citing Henderson v. Sec. Mortgage & Fin. Co. , 273 N.C. 253, 260 (1968)).  To  apply \nthe instrumentality rule, Plaintiffs must prove three elements: “(1) stockholders’ \ncontrol of the corporation amounting to ‘complete domination’ with respect to the \ntransaction at issue; (2) stockholders’ use of this control to commit a wrong, or to \nviolate a statutory or other duty in contravention of the other party’s rights; and (3) \n \n331 (15-CVS-1 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 166; 15-CVS-2 Third Am. Compl. ¶ 265.) \n \nthis wrong or breach of duty must be the proximate cause of the injury to the other \nparty.”  Id. (citing Glenn, 313 N.C. at 454–55). \n209. Defendants move for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ veil -piercing claim \nagainst Ms. Whitworth, arguing that she “lacked the requisite control in general.”332  \nDefendants contend that Mr. Ingle largely controlled Window World from February \n2010 to February 2011, offering evidence that he “handled the financials and kept \nthem close,”333 he “did not consult with [Ms. Whitworth] about day -to-day activities \nor contracts, sharing information on a ‘need-to-know basis,”334 and “the dealers went \nto [Mr. Ingle], not [Ms. Whitworth], for assistance.”335  During this time, Defendants \n \n332 (Defs.’ Br.

As noted above, veil piercing is an “extraordinary equitable remedy.”  \nHarris, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 62, at *6 (quoting Charter Commc’ns Operating, LLC  v. \nOptymyze, LLC No.2018-0865-JTL, 2021 Del. Ch. LEXIS 4, at *73  (Del. Ch. Jan. 4, \n2021).  Here, Plaintiffs have failed to produce substantial evidence to show that Ms. \nWhitworth had “complete domination” over Window World, WWI, or the disputed \ntransactions, including C pricing and the 2010 Transfer.  At the same time, \nDefendants and Ms. Whitworth offered undisputed evidence that she did not have \ncomplete domination over Window World, WWI, or the disputed transactions.  \nAccordingly, the Court will  grant Defendants’ Motion and dismiss Plaintiffs’ veil-\npiercing “claim”\n344 against Ms. Whitworth.   \n212. In addition, because Plaintiffs have failed to produce substantial evidence \nto support their veil -piercing claim against Ms. Whitworth, the Court further finds \nthat the Tolling Plaintiffs’ claims against Ms. Whitworth under sections 39-23.4(a)(1) \nand (a)(2) claims are time-barred by the applicable statute of repose.  The Court will \n \n343 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 94.) \n \n344 The Court notes that, although Plaintiffs bring their veil piercing contention as a claim, \npiercing the corporate veil is a remedy , not a separate cause of action.  See,  e.g., Window \nWorld of Baton Rouge, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *14 (“Veil piercing is an equitable \nremedy[.]” (citing Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC , 362 N.C. at 440)); Insight  Health Corp. v. \nMarquis Diagnostic Imaging of N.C., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 56, at *23 (N.C.

P laintiffs’ Damages Calculations \n213. Plaintiffs next contend that they are “entitled to summary judgment \nrelating to their damages in multiple respects.” 345  Specifically, Plaintiffs maintain  \nthat they are entitled to summary judgment: (1) “establishing as undisputed \nmultiple, related damage calculations made by Plaintiffs’ damages expert, Brent \nBersin, including the total rebates Plaintiffs paid [Window World] on their purchases \nfrom Associated Materials, Inc. (“AMI”)” and (2) “on the amount of damages they are \nentitled to recover for [Window World’s] fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices, \nand negligent misrepresentations.”\n346   \n214. Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to summary judgment establishing the \nfollowing damages amounts: \n(1) A total of $40,306,114 (not including interest, trebling, or attorneys’ \nfees) equal to the difference between the rebates WW fraudulently \npromised Plaintiffs they would pay, and fraudulently concealed that \nPlaintiffs were not paying, and the rebates Plaintiffs actually paid;\n347 \n \n(2) A  total of $37,565,225 (not including interest, trebling, or attorneys’ \nfees) equal to the amount of undisclosed rebates on  t hat \nPlaintiffs unknowingly paid because WW concealed those rebates and \nbecause WW concealed the existence of a separate pricing tier for dealers \n \n345 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 92.)  \n \n346 (Pls.’ Mot. 6.) \n \n347 (Pls.’ Mot. 6; Bersin Report at 6; see also Bersin Schedules; Bersin Aff. at ¶ 6.) \n \n\nwho did not pay rebates on , in contravention of WW’s \nrepresentations that Plaintiffs were receiving best pricing;348 and \n \n(3) A total of $10,155,554 (not including interest, trebling, or attorneys’ \nfees) equal to the amount of excess rebates Plaintiffs paid as a result of \nWW’s undisclosed and misrepresented 2009 rebate increases.349 \n \n215. Plaintiffs contend that summary judgment on their damages claims is \nwarranted because “Defendants offer no legitimate rebuttal to these \ncalculations . . .[,] do not identify any specific errors in Bersin’s . . . calculations[,] and \nconcede they have no basis to dispute the AMI data on which [some of] Bersin’s \ncalculations rest.”\n350  Further, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants do not “provide any \nalternative calculations that they claim more accurately reflect the amounts of \nrebates Plaintiffs paid above what they were promised.”\n351 \n216. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied because \n“Plaintiffs ignore both the procedural posture and the burden of proof.  [Window \nWorld] is not required to prove Plaintiffs’ damages for them.  Plaintiffs must prove \ntheir own damages.”\n352   \n217. More granularly, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ Motion should be denied \nas to Plaintiffs’ calculation for alleged rebate overpayments because the calculation \n \n348 (Pls.’ Mot. 6; see also Bersin Report.)   \n \n349 (Pls.’ Mot. 6; see also Bersin Report.)   \n \n350 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 93.) \n \n351 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 93.) \n \n352 (Defs.’ Resp. Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J. 47.) \n \n\n“assumes a hypothetical world where Plaintiffs were all promised the same thing: a \n$10 window rebate for B-tier dealers, a $15 window rebate for A-tier dealers, and no \nrebates  [a nd] Plaintiffs’ own evidence lays waste to that assumption.” 353  \nThe Court agrees.  As discussed above, some Plaintiffs testified that Window World \npromised rebates of $5 or $10 per window and others testified that no representations \nwere made regarding rebate amounts prior to them becoming Window World \nstoreowners.354  As such, Plaintiffs have not met their burden for offensive summary \njudgment to show that there are “ no gaps in [their] proof [concerning rebate \noverpayment damages], that no inferences inconsistent with [their] recovery arise \nfrom the evidence.”  Brooks, 48 N.C. App. at 728.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion for \noffensive summary judgment on its alleged rebate overpayment damages is denied. \n218. Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs’ damages calculation for alleged best \npricing misrepresentations  is incorrect because “Plaintiffs have not calculated \ndamages specific to any particular Plaintiff.”\n355  Plaintiffs argue that their best \npricing damages is “ e qual to the amount of undisclosed rebates on window  \nthat Plaintiffs unknowingly paid because [Window World] concealed the existence of \na separate pricing tier for dealers who did not pay rebates on window ,\n  in \ncontravention of [Window World’s] representations that Plaintiffs were receiving best \n \n353 (Defs.’ Resp.

J. 61–62.) \n \n\npricing.”356  However, as detailed earlier in this order and opinion , P laintiffs’ \ntestimony varies significantly concerning the rebate representations that were made \nand how different Plaintiffs interpreted and understood Window World’s \nrepresentations regarding “best pricing.” 357  Thus, the Court again finds that \nPlaintiffs have not met their burden to demonstrate that no genuine issues of \nmaterial fact remain as to the amount of best pricing damages .  The Court will \ntherefore deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for offensive summary judgment on these damages  \nas well.    \n219. Finally, and also a s discussed earlier in this order and opinion, the Court \nhas concluded that Plaintiffs have failed to offer substantial evidence that they were \ninjured by the 2009 rebate increases and that Plaintiffs’ claims based on those rebates \nshould be dismissed.358  In light of this failure of proof, the Court will likewise deny \nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment determining Plaintiffs’ damages for Window \nWorld’s “undisclosed and misrepresented 2009 rebate increases.”359   \n220. Based on the above, the Court denies Plaintiffs’ Motion for offensive \nsummary judgment on each of Plaintiffs’ requested damages determinations.      \nL. Defendants’ Counterclaims \n \n356 (Pls.’ Mot. 7.)   \n \n357 (See supra ¶¶ 43–78 and related notes.) \n \n358 (See supra ¶¶ 99–102 and related notes.) \n \n359 (See supra ¶¶ 99–102 and related notes.) \n \n221. Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on each of Defendants’ counterclaims \n(the “Counterclaims”) ,360 which seek a declaration that the Licensing Agreements \napplicable to each Plaintiff group are valid, that certain terms are enforceable and \nshould be enforced, and that any modification of the Licensing Agreements is invalid.  \n222. Plaintiffs contend they are entitled to summary judgment on Defendants’ \nCounterclaims because “[e]ach such counterclaim necessarily depends on the validity \nand enforceability of the agreements for which [Window World] seeks declarations .”  \nPlaintiffs further assert that “[b]ecause [the Licensing Agreements] all are void due \nto [Window World’s] fraudulent inducement, [Window World] cannot enforce any \nalleged rights under those documents.”\n361  As set forth at length above, however, the \nCourt has found that genuine issues of material fact remain and preclude summary \njudgment for any party on the validity of the Licensing Agreements.  Accordingly, the \nCourt will deny Plaintiffs’ Motion for summary judgment on Defendants’ \nCounterclaims. \nM. Window World’s and Ms. Whitworth’s Additional Defenses  \n223. Last, Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on: (1) subparagraph (d) of Window \nWorld’s Fifth Additional Defense; (2) Window World’s Sixth Additional Defense; (3) \nsubparagraph 5 of Tammy Whitworth’s Seventh Additional Defense; and (4) Tammy \nWhitworth’s Eighth Additional Defense.362    \n \n360 (Baton Rouge Answer ¶¶ 41–75; St. Louis Answer ¶¶ 51–95.) \n \n361 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 95–96.) \n \n362 (Pls.’ Mot. 7–8.) \n \n224. First, Plaintiffs seek summary judgment as to the portion of Window \nWorld’s Fifth Additional Defense and Whitworth’s Seventh Additional Defense which \nasserts that “[t]he Tolling Agreement should be disregarded for purposes of the \nstatute of limitations and/or repose to the extent, if any, that Plaintiffs are precluded \nfrom enforcing the Tolling Agreement by their own breach of the Tolling \nAgreement.”363  Plaintiffs assert that no evidence appears of record that the Roland \nPlaintiffs or the Lomax /Gillette Plaintiffs breached the Tolling Agreements 364; \nindeed, Plaintiffs offer evidence that Window World’s 30(b)(6) designee admitted that \nWindow World has no evidence that the Roland or Lomax/Gillette Plaintiffs breached \nthese agreements.\n365  In an apparent concession, Defendants do not respond to \nPlaintiffs’ argument in their briefing.  Based on its review, the Court concludes that \n \n363 (Baton Rouge Answer ¶ 42; St. Louis Answer ¶ 68; Answer and Alternative Countercl. \nTammy Whitworth ¶ 51 [hereinafter “Whitworth Baton Rouge Answer”], ECF No. 327 \n(sealed), 331 (redacted); Answer and Alternative Countercl. Tammy Whitworth ¶ 68 \n[hereinafter “Whitworth St. Louis Answer”], 15-CVS-2 ECF No. 345 (sealed), 349 (redacted).)  \nThese defenses differ in their wording, but they all assert that the Tolling Agreement should \nbe disregarded to the extent Plaintiffs are precluded from enforcing it due to their breach. \n \n364 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 96.) \n \n365 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 96; Volume One Pls.’ Dep. Excerpts, Ex. P, Window \nWorld Dep. 152:12– 154:5 (“In preparation for this deposition, we reviewed information \navailable to us.  And at this time, Window World is not currently aware of any information.  \nIt’s our understanding, when the defense was filed, we saw the filing of the secret Louisiana \nlawsuit as a violation of the confidentiality clause of the tolling agreement.  Q: Does Window \nWorld no longer see the filing of the Louisiana lawsuit as a violation of the tolling agreement?  \nA: No.  Q: Okay.  And, again, like I said, this refers to the Lomax plaintiffs.  The opposite \nanswer makes the same allegation with regard to the Roland plaintiffs.  Is Window World \naware of any factual information supporting the assertion that the Roland plaintiffs violated \nthe confidentiality provisions of the tolling agreement?  A: We’re not currently aware of the \ninformation.”).) \n \nsummary judgment should be entered for Plaintiffs on  these portions of Window \nWorld’s Fifth Additional Defense and Whitworth’s Seventh Additional Defense. \n225. Plaintiffs next seek summary judgment as to Window World’s Sixth \nAdditional Defense and Ms. Whitworth’s Eighth Additional Defense, which allege, \nsimilarly, that “Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract are barred to the extent they \nhave committed their own antecedent breaches of the contracts between the \nparties.”366  These antecedent breaches were identified in Window World’s 30(b)(6) \ndeposition as the facts underlying the case captioned as Window World International \nv. O’Toole, 21 F.4th 1029 (8th Cir. 2022),367 which include an alleged failure to provide \nfinancial reporting, 368 alleged territory infringements by certain franchisees, 369 \nalleged unauthorized ownership changes, 370 and alleged “efforts by Roland  to \n‘investigate alternative vendor sources’ in 2012 or 2013.”371 \n \n366 (Baton Rouge Answer ¶ 42; St. Louis Answer ¶ 56; Whitworth Baton Rouge Answer ¶ 51; \nWhitworth St. Louis Answer ¶ 68.)  \n \n367 (Volume One Pls.’ Dep. Excerpts, Ex. P, Window World Dep. 155:4–6; Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nPartial Summ. J. 96.) \n \n368 (Volume One Pls.’ Dep. Excerpts, Ex. P, Window World Dep. 154:24–56:7; Pls.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Partial Summ. J. 97.) \n \n369 (Volume One Pls.’ Dep. Excerpts, Ex. P, Window World Dep. 156:8– 59:7; Pls.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Partial Summ. J. 97.) \n \n370 (Volume One Pls.’ Dep. Excerpts, Ex. P, Window World Dep. 160:11–61:9.; Pls.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Partial Summ. J. 97.) \n \n371 (Volume One Pls.’ Dep. Excerpts, Ex. P, Window World Dep. 161:10–62:8; Pls.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Partial Summ. J. 97.) \n \n226. Plaintiffs assert that these defenses should be dismissed because Plaintiffs’ \nalleged breaches either “(1) occurred after the filing of the lawsuit, or (2) do not \nactually breach any licensing agreement provision, or both.”372  The Court agrees.   \n227. The O’Toole litigation arose from actions occurring in 2019. 373  Neither \nWindow World nor Ms. Whitworth has identified in the actions pending before this \nCourt any failure to provide financial reporting prior to 2019.  The evidence of record \nshows that a ny alleged territory infringements or ownership changes likewise \noccurred well after the filing of this action. 374  Furthermore, neither Window World \nnor Ms. Whitworth offers any evidence that the Roland Plaintiffs purchased products \nfrom any alternative suppliers, or explain how investigation into alternative \nsuppliers violate s the Licensing Agreements.  Perhaps not surprisingly, Window \nWorld and Ms. Whitworth do  not address Plaintiffs’  arguments in their briefing.  \nAccordingly, after careful review, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs are entitled to \nsummary judgment dismissing Window World’s Sixth Additional Defense and Ms. \nWhitworth’s Eighth Additional Defense.   \n \n372 (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 97.) \n \n373 (See Window World Int’l v. O’Toole, 21 F. 4th 1029 (8th Cir. 2002) (dismissing appeal from \n2020 WL 7041814 (E.D. Mo.
