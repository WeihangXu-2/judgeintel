INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION    \n    \n{2} \n This litigation involves disputes relating to the ownership, \nmanagement, operation, and sharing of expected profits and opportunities of \nDrymax Sports, LLC (“Drymax”), a North Carolina limited liability company \n(“LLC”) whose members include individual Plaintiff William A. B. Blythe (“Blythe”), \ncorporate Defendant Hickory Brands, Inc. (“HBI”), and individual Defendants  \nRobert E. Bell III (“Rob Bell”), Virginia Bell, and Nissan Joseph (“Joseph”).   \n{3}  The pending motions for summary judgment include a tangle of \ninterrelated issues arising from the Amended Complaint, which includes 358 \nnumbered paragraphs and asserts 18 claims, including both individual and \nderivative claims which overlap substantially, and from an answer with affirmative \ndefenses and a counterclaim.  The Parties filed a total of 265 pages in briefs, as well \nas extensive appendices.  Oral argument on the summary judgment motions \nencompassed an entire day, and the Parties have submitted supplemental briefing \nafter oral argument.   \n{4}  To analyze these issues, the court distilled the competing central \nstorylines that center on discussions surrounding and agreements, if any, reached \nat Drymax’s formation in 2003 following an earlier business venture between \nBlythe and HBI which had begun in 2001.  In 2001, HBI purchased certain assets, \nincluding certain patents from SecondWind Products, Inc. (“SecondWind”), which \nBlythe founded, Blythe retained control of certain trademarks, including \nActiveDry® and Drymax®, an individual Dan Talbott (“Talbott”) maintained control \nof the proprietary process, which the court refers to as the “Drymax Process,” which \nis used to apply a chemical applicant to provide desirable stay-dry properties, and \nHBI, SecondWind, Blythe, and Talbott executed a License and Supply Agreement \npursuant to which HBI was authorized to manufacture and sell socks using the \nActive Dry® or Drymax® trademarks to which the Drymax Process had been \napplied in exchange for paying Blythe and Talbott royalties.  \n  \n{5}  There were a number of documents generated around the time of \nDrymax’s formation, which Plaintiffs have referred to as “Foundational Documents” \nand which are critical to their claims.  These include a Drymax Operating \nAgreement which was never fully adopted, board minutes of both Drymax and HBI, \nand an “Operational Agreement,” which Plaintiffs assert is a binding agreement \nbetween Drymax and HBI.  The Parties have fundamentally different views of these \ndocuments.  Plaintiffs say the documents reflect understandings relating to the \npursuit of any product based on the Drymax Process, and that the sale and \nmanufacture of socks would at some point in the future shift from SecondWind \nbranded socks sold under the License and Supply Agreement to a new launched \nDrymax branded sock line which would be sold by Drymax rather than HBI, and \nthat the royalty stream would cease in favor of the formula agreement in the \nOperational Agreement by which HBI would be paid a percentage based on costs of \ngoods sold for logistical support but would otherwise enjoy profits only as a Drymax \nmember.  Defendants deny that the Operational Agreement is a binding agreement \nin the first instance, but even if it is, it never applied to the sale of socks, and that \nsocks sales have continued pursuant to the royalty arrangement of the License and \nSupply Agreement which has never been terminated.      \n{6}  The claims are interrelated in that Blythe contends that Defendants \nhave refused to acknowledge the Operational Agreement and that HBI has \ncontinually misappropriated opportunities owed to Drymax, have made decisions on \nHBI’s behalf to the detriment of Drymax, and have throughout this course of \nconduct unfairly excluded Blythe from management and enjoyment of his \nreasonable expectations.  Defendants challenge the entire set of Plaintiffs’ claims on \nthe assertion that they rest on the fundamental predicate that the Operational \nAgreement is an enforceable agreement applicable to socks, and further that any \nsuch claims are now time barred.  Plaintiffs’ method of computing its damages is \nthe subject of separate motions in limine.   \n{7}  In an effort to approach the interrelated issues in a logical fashion, the \ncourt first addresses Defendants’ attack on Blythe’s standing.  Second, the court \n  \nidentifies claims the Plaintiffs have abandoned.  Third, the court examines whether \nany Drymax member has adequately supported a claim based on a fiduciary duty \nowed directly by one member to another member.  Fourth, the court addresses \nDefendants’ assertion that the Operational Agreement cannot be enforced, and \nwhether alleged breaches of fiduciary duties owed to Drymax or Blythe’s individual \nclaims depend entirely on that agreement or also include other claims.  Fifth, the \ncourt assesses how Defendants’ limitations defense applies to these various claims.  \n{8}  For purposes of the present motions, the court notes one issue the \nParties have not addressed and makes an assumption in Blythe’s favor on that \nissue.  In Meiselman v. Meiselman , the North Carolina Supreme Court held that \nwhen a shareholder brings suit seeking dissolution or other appropriate relief under \nthe North Carolina General Corporation Act, the trial court is: “(1) to define the \n‘rights or interests’ the complaining shareholder has in the corporation; and (2) to \ndetermine whether some form of relief other than dissolution is ‘reasonably \nnecessary’ for the protection of those ‘rights or interests.’”  309 N.C. 279, 301, 307 \nS.E.2d 551, 564 (1983).  The right the court recognized grew from the statutory \nremedy, and was based on certain policies inherent in the statutory scheme.  The \nNorth Carolina courts have not yet had to address whether similar provisions in the \nNorth Carolina Limited Liability Act (“LLC Act”) embodies the same policies that \nshould equally lead to granting a minority owner in a limited liability company \nsimilar rights to protect his reasonable expectations as a minority owner.  There are \npossible arguments on either side of this proposition, but those issues have not been \naddressed by the pending motions and the court considers any necessary \nconsideration of them to another day.  See  Douglas K. Moll, Minority Oppression & \nthe Limited Liability Company: Learning (or not) from Close Corporation History , \n40 W AKE FOREST L. R EV . 883  (2005). \n \n \n \n \n  \nII. II. II. II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY    \n    \n{9}  Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in Catawba County Superior Court on \nMarch 22, 2011, and their Amended Complaint on July 28, 2011.  Defendants \nsought designation as a complex business case based on later amendments, on \nMarch 16, 2012 the matter was designated as a mandatory complex business case \nby Order of Chief Justice Sarah Parker, and then assigned to the undersigned. \n{10}  All Parties timely filed post-discovery summary judgment motions on \nOctober 9, 2012.  The court heard oral argument on November 16, 2012.  Plaintiffs \nfiled a Supplemental Motion on December 3, 2012, which seeks to add additional \ndocuments to be considered in opposition to Defendants’ motions and to reopen \ndiscovery based on Defendants’ alleged discovery abuses.  By Order dated January \n4, 2013, the court accepted additional documents as a part of the record to be \nconsidered but denied the request to reopen discovery.  The court considers each of \nthe summary judgment motions now ripe for disposition.  \n \nIII. III. III. III.  STATEMENT OF STATEMENT OF STATEMENT OF STATEMENT OF RELEVANT RELEVANT RELEVANT RELEVANT FACTS FACTS FACTS FACTS    \n    \n{11}  The court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion for \nsummary judgment but examines whether the record establishes uncontested facts \nor the absence of evidence to support facts which demonstrate that the claims can \nbe resolved as a matter of law without the necessity of trial proceedings.  See Hyde \nIns. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp. , 26 N.C. App. 138, 215 S.E.2d 162 (1975).  \nFor purposes of assessing the motions, any contested fact has been assumed in favor \nof the Party opposing summary judgment.        \n    \nA. A. A. A.  The Parties The Parties The Parties The Parties    \n    \n{12}  Drymax is a North Carolina limited liability company whose \nmembers are Blythe, HBI, Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph.  Joseph was HBI’s \n  \npresident and chief executive officer of HBI from May 2003 until January 2008.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 24.) \n    \nB. B. B. B.  Drymax’s Formation Drymax’s Formation Drymax’s Formation Drymax’s Formation    \n \n{13}  Blythe has been involved in the footwear accessory, sock, and athletic \napparel industry for approximately  29 years and was the founder and sole owner of \nSecondWind.  (Blythe Aff. ¶¶ 5–6, Oct. 21, 2011.)  In 2001, Blythe sold most of \nSecondWind’s assets to HBI (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), which was then \ncontrolled by Robert E. Bell II (“R.E. Bell II”), the father of Rob Bell and Virginia \nBell.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 65:12–66:2.)  HBI entered a License and Supply \nAgreement with SecondWind, Blythe, and Talbott to sell socks using trademarks \nActive Dry®, Drymax®, and MicroZap® (“Trademarks”).  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 2, Oct. 25, \n2012; Blythe Dep. Vol. III 516:20–517:9; Blythe Dep. Ex. 130.)  The License and \nSupply Agreement states that Blythe owns the Trademarks (Blythe Aff. ¶ 22, Oct. \n25, 2012; Blythe Dep. Ex. 130) and Talbott owns the trade secret underlying the \nDrymax Process.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. III 517:10–18; Blythe Dep. Ex. 130.)  The \nDrymax Process is now licensed by Talbott’s successor, Russ Roberts (“Roberts”).  \nNeither Blythe nor Drymax have any written or oral agreements with Talbott or \nRoberts authorizing the use of the Drymax Process other than the License and \nSupply Agreement.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. III 513:22–514:25.) \n{14}  In 2003, Blythe indicated his intent to terminate the License and \nSupply Agreement.  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 2, Oct. 25, 2012.)  R.E. Bell II requested instead \nthat Blythe and Joseph, HBI’s President, discuss a new venture to pursue the \nDrymax Process.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 95:19–96:25, 97:1–17; Joseph Dep. 8:13–15.)   \n{15}  R.E. Bell II and his wife died in a plane crash before any venture was \nformalized.  Rob Bell and Virginia Bell became the majority owners of HBI and \nserved as HBI officers.  (Virginia Bell Dep. 11:6–7, 25:5–12.)  The Parties continued \ndiscussions and Drymax was formed on November 6, 2003.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I \n122:14–125:12, Blythe Dep. Ex. 102.)  The members agreed to the following initial \n  \ndivision of ownership:  Blythe 40%; HBI 30%; Joseph 20%; Rob Bell 5%; and \nVirginia Bell 5%.  (Blythe Dep. Ex. 104.)   \n{16}  Several transfers of membership interests were made between or \namong the original members, and the Parties disputed the effect of these transfers \non management control.  Those disputes were the subject of the court’s December \n10, 2012 Order which determined that the current ownership and control of Drymax \nas follows: (1) Blythe owns a 40% economic interest and a 40% control interest; (2) \nHBI owns a 20% economic interest and 0% control interest; (3) Joseph owns a 0% \neconomic interest and a 20% control interest; (4) Rob Bell owns a 20% economic \ninterest and a 20% control interest; and (5) Virginia Bell owns a 20% economic \ninterest and a 20% control interest.  As a result, no single member owns a \ncontrolling interest.      \n    \nC. C. C. C.    An An An An Initial Drymax Initial Drymax Initial Drymax Initial Drymax Operating Agreement Operating Agreement Operating Agreement Operating Agreement Was Drafted  Was Drafted  Was Drafted  Was Drafted    \n    \n{17}  An attorney prepared a Drymax Operating Agreement (the “Operating \nAgreement”) on or about November 26, 2003. (Am. Compl. ¶ 35.)  Blythe contends \nhe signed and returned the agreement to Joseph without changes.  (Blythe Dep. \nVol. I 138:4–141:25.)  Defendants testified that they never signed the Operating \nAgreement.  (Rob Bell Dep. 192:10–195:1; Virginia Bell Dep. 44:7–45:9; Joseph Dep. \n87:25–89:3.)  Plaintiffs filed initial claims to enforce the Operating Agreement but \nthey no longer seek to enforce it as a binding agreement, although they believe it \nmay have evidentiary value in interpreting other claims.  (Pls.’ Resp. to Defs.’ Mot. \nfor Summ. J. (hereinafter “Pls.’ Resp. Br.”) 71.) \n \nD. D. D. D.  Board Minutes and the Board Minutes and the Board Minutes and the Board Minutes and the ““ ““Operational Agreement Operational Agreement Operational Agreement Operational Agreement”” ””    \n \n{18}  The Drymax members held their first member meeting on January 15, \n2004.  (Blythe Dep. Ex. 104.)  The minutes of this meeting reflect the initial \nownership percentages and reflect that the members by unanimous consent elected \n  \na board of directors consisting of all of the individual members.  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 17, \nOct. 25, 2012; Blythe Dep. Ex. 104.)  A Drymax board meeting was then held that \nsame day.  The minutes of that meeting reflect several matters, including that:  (1)  \nBlythe would be Drymax’s Managing Member; (2) all financial and strategic \ndecisions would be made with the Board’s authorization; (3) “HBI will add 20% to \nall goods sold on behalf of Drymax LLC” to include services of inventory \nmanagement, supplier reorders, order picking and processing, logistics and \nwarehousing, cost of labor for packaging, and financial accounting, but excluding \npackage costs, outbound freight, and defects; (4) Drymax would provide a note to \nHBI for legal and product developments to date; (5) Drymax would borrow \nadditional funds for molds and operational costs at an interest rate of 4.5% until \n“sales are able to provide it;” and (6) Blythe would initiate and coordinate \ntransferring Drymax trademarks.  (Blythe Dep. Ex. 104.)     \n{19}  On February 1, 2004, Joseph emailed Blythe stating that HBI’s Board \nhad met and decided that HBI and Drymax Sports should enter into a working \nagreement.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 180:6–15.)  Joseph attached a document entitled \n“Operational Agreement” which Joseph indicated he was prepared to sign on HBI’s \nbehalf.1  (Blythe Dep. Ex. 105.)  The Operational Agreement contained language \nsimilar to the January 15, 2004 Drymax Board minutes, with some variation.  \nAmong other language, the Operational Agreement included the following terms: (1) \nHBI would loan development costs to include but not be limited to enumerated \ncategories; (2) Drymax would repay the greater of 4.5% or Prime plus 0.05%; (3) \nHBI would have a 30% equity stake in Drymax; (4) HBI would charge a “20% mark \nup on cost of goods to cover the costs related to services,” with the enumerated \nservices being similar to but not an exact match for the categories enumerated in \nDrymax’s board minutes; (5) certain sales expenses were to be Drymax’s \nresponsibility; and (6) Drymax could not change agreements without HBI’s consent. \n                                                 \n1  The court here assumes that Blythe sign and approved the Operational Agreement. Cites in the \nbrief refer to Blythe’s testimony regarding approval of the Operating Agreement.  \n  \n{20}  Plaintiffs contend that both the Drymax board minutes and the \nOperational Agreement apply to socks and would in the future replace the royalty \nagreement in the License and Supply Agreement.  Plaintiffs emphasize that the \nagreement was “that HBI will add 20 percent to all goods sold on behalf of Drymax, \nLLC. ”  (Blythe Dep. Ex. 104, (emphasis added); Blythe Dep. Vol. II 257:7–22.)  \nDefendants contend that if arrangements were intended to apply to the sale of \nsocks, the Parties would have made express reference to and provided for \ntermination of the License and Supply Agreement which by its own terms continues \nto renew automatically until terminated.  (Defs.’ Br. in Supp. of Their Mot. for \nSumm. J. as to Claims by Drymax Sports, LLC (hereinafter Defs.’ Br. in Supp.) 6; \nBlythe Dep. Ex. 105.)  Defendants seek to support their position by evidence that \nBlythe thereafter accepted royalties and Drymax continues to accept royalties.  \nBlythe acknowledges that HBI sold Active Dry branded and later Drymax branded \nsocks pursuant to the License and Supply Agreement after Drymax was formed \n(Blythe Dep. Vol. I 216:17–217:13), but contends that these sales were only to \ncontinue until Drymax was prepared to launch a new Drymax branded line, which \nit has never been able to do solely because of Defendants’ wrongful conduct.  \n(Compare , Defs.’ Br. in Supp. 19–21 and  Pls.’ Resp. Br. 42.)  The Parties also \ndisagree on the point in time at which it may be asserted that Drymax would have \nbeen ready to launch the new product line so as to trigger the Operational \nAgreement.  As discussed below, that date may be critical to the limitations defense, \nat least as to certain claims.  \n \nE. E. E. E.    Drymax Drymax Drymax Drymax    Begins Begins Begins Begins Operations Operations Operations Operations    \n    \n{21}  HBI provided Drymax an initial line of credit to finance development \nefforts.  (Lasecki Aff. ¶ 5; Blythe Dep. Ex. 104.)  Blythe alleges that at some point, \nHBI charged excessive interest on amounts it advance but reverted to the agreed \n4.5% around the time the lawsuit was filed.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 99–101.)  Defendants \n  \nstress that HBI has provided Drymax with all back office and administrative \nsupport.  (Lasecki Aff. ¶ 6.) \n{22}  Blythe contends that he assigned the Trademarks first licensed by the \nLicense and Supply Agreement to Drymax on May 21, 2004 in consideration for his \n40% share in Drymax and his expectation that he would be allowed to participate in \nthe control and management of Drymax.  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 22, Oct. 25, 2012.)  Blythe \nunderstood that all members would share pro rata in the company’s distributions, \nprofits, and costs.  (Blythe Aff. ¶¶ 24–25, Oct. 25, 2012.)  \n{23}  When Drymax was formed, HBI’s product line included insoles, but its \nline did not employ the Drymax Process. (Blythe Dep. Vol. II 407:14–22; 199:23–\n201:20.)  HBI then contributed its insole patents acquired from SecondWind to \nDrymax and Drymax launched a new insole product line.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I \n136:17–137:2.)  HBI loaned Drymax the development costs for these insole products \nsold under the Drymax name.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 204:19–23.)   \n{24}  Drymax began selling the “X-Soles” in 2006 and booked the sales as \nsales by Drymax.  (Lasecki Aff. ¶ 11.)  Blythe contends that HBI well understood \nthe terms of the Operational Agreement as evidence by the fact that Drymax paid \nHBI the cost of goods sold plus 20% of the X-Soles’ sales.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I \n207:22–210:3.)  The License and Supply Agreement was in effect in 2006 when \nDrymax began selling X-Soles, and at that time HBI continued selling Active Dry \nlabeled socks and paying royalties individually to Blythe and Talbott.  (Blythe Dep. \nVol. I 216:17–217:13.)   \n{25}  From time to time, Drymax bought socks utilizing the Drymax Process \nfrom HBI at wholesale prices, which Drymax then resold at retail prices at various \nmarathon events.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. II 365:14–366:4; Lasecki Aff. ¶ 8.)  These sales \nwere booked in Drymax’s accounting records as purchases for resale and no 20% \nservice charge was paid to HBI on such sales.  (Lasecki Aff. ¶ 10.)   \n{26}  The Parties agree that HBI sold socks pursuant to the License and \nSupply Agreement from 2004 to April 2007, and that HBI paid royalties on these \nsales which were received by Blythe individually with no payment to Drymax, and \n  \nthe 20% markup arrangement from the Operational Agreement was not applied to \nthose sales.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 214:17–217:13.)  The Parties agree that at some \npoint socks which had been previously branded as Active Dry were branded as \nDrymax and still sold pursuant to the terms of the License and Supply Agreement \nwith Blythe receiving royalties individually.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I  215:11–216:23.) \n{27}  Blythe, however, asserts that HBI was to continue to sell SecondWind \nbranded socks and pay the 5% royalty only until the launch of a new Drymax \nproduct line was ready.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 217:1–23.)  Blythe contends that once \nthe Drymax products were designed, the necessary packaging was prepared, and \nmarketing was in place, SecondWind branded products were to disappear, and with \nthem the royalty arrangement, and thereafter sales would be booked at Drymax, \nDrymax would pay HBI the agreed upon cost of goods plus 20% in accordance with \nthe Operational Agreement, and members would enjoy profits only as Drymax \nmembers sharing in accordance with their ownership.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 217:23–\n218:24.)  As stated above, Defendants contend that the Operational Agreement was \nnever meant to apply to the sale of socks in the first instance and that sock sales are \nto be governed exclusively by the License and Supply Agreement.  (Defs.’ Br. in \nSupp. 19–21.)   \n{28}  The License and Supply Agreement states that it automatically renews \non an annual basis unless it is terminated in writing.  (Blythe Dep. Ex. 130 ¶ 7.)  It \nfurther provides that it can only be modified via a writing executed by all parties, \nbut allows royalty payments to be assigned without such a written modification.  \n(Blythe Dep. Ex. 130 ¶¶ 7, 15.)  Blythe testified that he agreed in 2007 that the 5% \nroyalty payment pursuant to the License and Supply Agreement would no longer be \npaid to him individually but instead would be paid to Drymax.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I \n217:14–218:15; Blythe Aff. ¶ 31, Oct. 25, 2012.)   This Agreement reflected his \nunderstanding that the time to launch the Drymax product line had approached \nand the Operational Agreement should be implemented for the new line of socks.  \nHe also thought at the time that in transferring the royalty stream to Drymax, the \nroyalty payments would continue for a “temporary period” while Drymax’s \n  \naccounting system was modified to accommodate the new arrangements.  Blythe \ncontends he discussed this temporary continuation of royalties with Joseph as \nreflected in an email exchange.2   (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 218:25–219:5.)  Blythe contends \nthat the temporary period was to be for approximately 30 to 60 days to facilitate an \naccounting change (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 221:11–222:3), which he assumed meant a \nchange over to the terms of the Operational Agreement.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 224:13–\n25.)  Defendants deny there was ever any agreement to suspend royalties.  (Blythe \nDep. Vol. I 217:8–23; 218:7–219:4.)   \n{29}  Defendants instead contend that the License and Supply Agreement \nremains in effect today, that there has been no written termination or modification \nof it.  HBI continues to pay royalties pursuant to the License and Supply \nAgreement, although payments are now being paid to Drymax.  (Defs.’ Br. in Supp. \n9; Lasecki Aff. ¶ 19.)    In January 2010, HBI increased the royalty payment from \n5% to 10% (Blythe Dep. 227:16–19; Lasecki Aff. ¶ 18), at which time it stopped \nadvancing funds to Drymax.  (Lasecki Aff. ¶ 18.)  Blythe contends that he objected \nwhen this change was made.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 228:18–229:2.)   \n \nF. F. F. F.    Plaintiffs’ Assertion of Plaintiffs’ Assertion of Plaintiffs’ Assertion of Plaintiffs’ Assertion of    Alleged Conflicts of Interest Alleged Conflicts of Interest Alleged Conflicts of Interest Alleged Conflicts of Interest    \n \n{30}  Blythe contends that Defendants have improperly excluded him from \nmanagement of Drymax and in doing so have taken actions that are not in the best \ninterests of Drymax.  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 35, Oct. 14, 2011.)  Blythe particularly \ncomplains of Rob Bell’s assertion that he controls Drymax due to his control of HBI \nand HBI’s exclusive control of Drymax’s accounting and finances.  Blythe contends \nthat in addition to failing to honor Drymax’s rights under the Operational \nAgreement, Defendants’ various acts also fail to honor Blythe’s legitimate \n                                                 \n2   A series of emails were exchanged between Lisa Lasecki, an HBI employee, and Blythe regarding \nthe royalty payment being paid to Drymax beginning in May 2007.  In the emails Blythe states \n“Lisa, I think the check is supposed to go to Drymax, LLC and not to me.  It is a temporary way for \nHickory to pay a license fee to Drymax, LLC for selling the Drymax socks.  I will no longer get a \ncheck for the Drymax socks.”  Lisa Lasecki responded, “Thanks for the clarification.  I spoke with \nNissan regarding this and he has cleared this mix up I had in my notes.”  (Blythe Dep. Ex. 106.)       \n  \nexpectations as a minority member.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 11–15.)  Blythe characterizes \nDefendants’ overall course of conduct as being in direct conflict with Drymax’s \ninterests.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 12.)   \n{31}  Blythe alleges several specific examples.  He indicates he learned in \n2011 that Rob Bell and HBI were restructuring the Drymax sales force without \nBlythe’s participation, although he was to have control over the sales direction.  \n(Pls.’ Resp. Br. 12–13.)  Blythe also asserts that HBI usurped opportunities owed to \nDrymax, by taking secret actions intended to steal the use of the proprietary \nDrymax Process and to represent to the marketplace that HBI, not Drymax, owns \nthis technology.  As an example, Blythe points to the drafting of a 2010 licensing \nagreement with the company that actually performs the manufacturing using the \nDrymax Process, attempting secretly to delete Drymax and substitute HBI as the \nlicensed party.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 14; Blythe Aff. ¶ 45, Oct. 14, 2011; Pls.’ Resp. Br. Ex. \nL, K.)  Blythe further contends that HBI also has usurped Drymax’s sales, has \nmaintained complete control of Drymax’s assets, has misappropriated Blythe’s ideas \nfor a new soccer sock, and has moved Drymax website hosting to a service under \nHBI’s exclusive control.  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 35, Oct. 14, 2011; Pls.’ Resp. Br. 15.)      \n{32}  Blythe contends that in the process HBI has starved Drymax of \nresources necessary for it to grow and achieve the expectations evidenced in the \nFoundational Documents.  Blythe complains that HBI has refused to let Drymax \nhave its own sales force.  (Blythe Aff. ¶¶ 22, 28, 34, Oct. 14, 2011; Pls.’ Resp. Br. 12.)  \nHe also complains that HBI has unnecessarily increased Drymax’s debt and has \nimproperly impounded all Drymax revenues in order to make payments on that \ndebt.  Blythe contends that Drymax would have been able to grow substantially but \nfor the diverted opportunities and cash flow.   (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 27.)   \n{33}  Finally, Blythe contends that HBI operates in direct competition with \nDrymax by currently producing and selling insoles through the 10-Seconds, New \nBalance, The Athlete’s Foot, and Foot Solutions brands, and by producing privately \nlabeled socks.  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 38, Oct. 14, 2011; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 107–08, 111.)   \n \n  \nG. G. G. G.    Blythe’s Blythe’s Blythe’s Blythe’s Conclusion that Defendants Refuse Conclusion that Defendants Refuse Conclusion that Defendants Refuse Conclusion that Defendants Refuse to Honor t to Honor t to Honor t to Honor the Operational he Operational he Operational he Operational     \nAgreement Agreement Agreement Agreement     \n    \n{34}  The time when Blythe contends that the License and Supply \nAgreement was to cease being the controlling document for sock sales is imprecise, \nbut it appears he believes that the Operational Agreement should have been \nimplemented for socks sometime during the April 2007 to June 2007 timeframe.  \n(Blythe Dep. Vol. I 217:8– 219:4.)  He also contends that it was some significant \ntime thereafter before he was first able to determine that Defendants instead \nrefused to recognize and implement the Operational Agreement, and, in fact, made \nrepresentations which led him to believe to the contrary, including their assurances \nthat the agreements would be honored.     \n{35}  Disputes between Blythe and the other members clearly began before \n2007.  Blythe alleges that there were several instances when he was required  to \ninsist that the other Drymax members honor the early agreements.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. \n16–17.)  For example, he alleges that the May 6, 2006 Drymax Board meeting \nminutes acknowledge that the License and Supply Agreement for Active Dry sock \nsales and royalty payments would end as Drymax sock sales would commence in \nearnest.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 17; Rob Bell Dep. Ex. 9.)   Yet, after this meeting Blythe \nemailed Joseph to ask if arrangements were in place to make the shift to have \nDrymax undertake the sock sales, to which Joseph responded that “the short \nanswer is not yet but we can get there fast . . .”  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. Ex. L, Part 1.)  This \nprompted a January 27, 2007 email from Blythe to Joseph in which Blythe accused \nthat Joseph did not want Drymax to exist at all, and concluded, “Nissan this is \nturning out to be a big fraud, I need to see a lot (not some) good faith on Hickory’s \nbehalf IMMEDIATELY or I will seek legal action to reverse what has taken place.”  \n(Pls.’ Resp. Br. Ex. L, Part 1; Blythe Dep. Ex. 131.)  Blythe testified that he did not \ntrust Joseph when he first met him and that Joseph has never earned his trust.  \n(Blythe Dep. Vol. III 535:5–536:9.) \n  \n{36}  Nevertheless, Blythe contends that Defendants gave him assurances \nadequate to convince him that the both the Operating Agreement and the \nOperational Agreement were in force and would be honored.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I \n225:1–2; Pls.’ Resp. Br. 15.)  He indicated that there was nothing in the financial \nrecords in early 2007 that would have caused him to believe otherwise.  He notes \nthat Drymax sock sales began in the spring of 2007 at the same time when X-Soles \nsales were declining so that the first sales of the new Drymax socks line would not \nhave been expected to have an immediate large increase in Drymax revenues.  \n(Blythe Aff. ¶ 32, Oct. 25, 2012.)  Defendants counter that the financial records \nclearly show that HBI was continuing to treat sales as governed by the royalty \nagreement and not the Operational Agreement.  Blythe indicates that he did not \nand should not have been expected at this time to notice Defendants’ failure to \nimplement the Operational Agreement.  (Blythe Dep. Vol. I 229:3–233:25.)  Blythe \nfurther asserts that when Joseph left HBI, Rob Bell assumed responsibility for \nDrymax’s financials and purposefully disrupted Blythe’s receipt of Drymax financial \nstatements from September 2008 through March 2009.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 19; Blythe \nAff. ¶¶ 33–34, Oct. 25, 2012.)  Blythe also stresses that during the 2007– 2008 time \nframe he was devoted full-time to developing and selling Drymax socks and cannot \nbe expected to have noticed discrepancies between financial statements and his \nunderstanding of how Drymax sock sales should have been handled.  He admits \nthat he was provided financial statements whenever he requested them, and when \nhe realized he had not received certain monthly statements, he requested them \nfrom Lisa Lasecki who sent them.  (Blythe Aff. ¶¶ 33–34, Oct. 25, 2012.)  He \ncontends it was not until he received these requested financials along with emails \nfrom Lisa Lasecki in 2009 that he was able to determine that Defendants were not \nfollowing the Operational Agreement.  (Blythe Aff. ¶ 37, Oct. 25, 2012.)  Blythe \nindicated that he then resigned as President of Drymax, but Rob Bell then \nconvinced him to withdraw his resignation through other new false assurances.  \n(Pls.’ Resp. Br. 20; Pls.’ Resp. Br. Ex. L, Part 1 HBI_DOC_0687995–\nHBI_DOC_0687996; Blythe Aff. ¶ 39, Oct. 25, 2012.) \n  \n{37}  Defendants deny misleading Blythe.  They contend that financial \nstatements Blythe received and for which he is charged with knowledge, clearly and \neasily indicate that HBI was continuing to make royalty payments rather than \nimplementing the cost of goods agreement Blythe contends HBI was obligated to \nfollow.  Defendants contend that Blythe was on notice of his various claims that \ndepend upon his interpretation of the Operational Agreement well before the three \nyears prior to filing suit.  Blythe contends that he is entitled to the benefit of a \ndiscovery rule and that he should not be reasonably expected to have discovered his \nclaim more than three years prior to filing suit.  Further, Blythe contends that \nDefendants should be estopped from relying on a statute of limitations defense \nbecause of their assurances that the Operational Agreement would be followed.

Blythe did not make any demand that \nDrymax pursue litigation.  Initially, Blythe contended that he had authority to \nretain counsel and bring suit pursuant to authority granted to him by the initial \nDrymax Operating Agreement he contended had been adopted. \n{39}  The Amended Complaint asserts the following causes of action by both \nPlaintiffs: (1) Usurpation of Control Against Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, HBI, and \nJoseph; (2) Breach of Director’s and Manager’s Fiduciary Duties Against Rob Bell, \nVirginia Bell, and Joseph; (3) Breach of Duties of Loyalty Against HBI, Rob Bell, \nVirginia Bell, and Joseph; (4) Waste Against HBI, Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, and \nJoseph; (5) Conversion Against HBI, Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph; (6) Fraud \nand Deceit Against HBI, Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph; (7) Unjust Enrichment \nAgainst HBI, Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph; (8) Quantum Meruit  Against HBI, \nRob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph; (9) Quantum Valebant  Against HBI, Rob Bell, \nVirginia Bell, and Joseph; (10) Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Against HBI, \n  \nRob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph; (11) Civil Conspiracy Against HBI, Rob Bell, \nVirginia Bell, and Joseph.  The Amended Complaint asserts the following causes of \naction only by Blythe: (12) Oppression of Meiselman Rights and Expectations \nAgainst HBI, Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph; (13) Breach of Contract (Breach of \nthe Operating Agreement) Against HBI, Rob Bell, Virginia Bell, and Joseph; (14) \nConstructive Fraud Against Rob Bell; (15) Breach of Fiduciary Duty to Non-\ncontrolling Member Against Rob Bell; and (16) Breach of Fiduciary Duty Against \nRob Bell.  The Amended Complaint asserts the following causes of action only by \nDrymax: (17) Breach of Contract (The HBI Operational Agreement) Against HBI; \nand (18) Breach of Fiduciary Duty Against Rob Bell.    \n{40}  Defendants filed counterclaims: (1) requesting declaratory relief as to \nthe status of the membership interest transfers, management rights, the \ninvalidation of the Operating Agreement, and continued application of the License \nand Supply Agreement; (2) breach of fiduciary duty against Blythe for having \nbrought the lawsuit without consulting the other members and by forcing the \ncompany to incur unnecessary expenses; and (3) a request for judicial dissolution if \nBlythe’s construction of the effect of transfers of membership interests were \nadopted.  They also included an affirmative defense based on the statute of \nlimitations which has a central focus in their motions for summary judgment.  The \ndeclaratory judgment and dissolution claims in the counterclaim related to the \nmembership interest transfers were resolved by the court’s December 10, 2012 \nOrder.   \n    \nIV. IV. IV. IV.

Blythe has Standing to Bring a Derivative Action on Behalf of Drymax Blythe has Standing to Bring a Derivative Action on Behalf of Drymax Blythe has Standing to Bring a Derivative Action on Behalf of Drymax Blythe has Standing to Bring a Derivative Action on Behalf of Drymax    \n    \n{42} \n Defendants first contend that Blythe was not authorized to bring a \ndirect action because he did not have such authority by reason of the Drymax \nOperating Agreement which was never adopted.  Blythe appears to agree that \nbringing a direct action in Drymax’s name would require the approval, consent, \nagreement, or ratification of a majority of the managers, see  Crouse v. Mineo , 189 \nN.C. App. 232, 239, 658 S.E.2d 33, 37–38 (2008) (citing N.C.G.S. § 57C-3-23), and he \nhas abandoned any claim that the Drymax Operating Agreement was adopted as an \nagreement that now controls.  Accordingly, if Blythe has authority to assert an \naction for Drymax, he must bring a derivative claim.  \n{43}  Defendants contend that Blythe cannot sue derivatively because his \neconomic interests diverge from that of Drymax or its other members because of his \nclaim for unreimbursed expenses that lies against Drymax.  They also say he cannot \nfairly represent Drymax because of his personal grudges with other members of \nDrymax’s Board.  They assert he cannot then fairly and adequately represent the \ncorporation as required under N.C.G.S. § 55-7-41.  (Defs.’ Br. in Supp. 31.)   \n{44}  Blythe disclaims that he is pursuing a claim against Drymax for \nunreimbursed expenses, and rather any advances he has made in that regard would \nbe addressed later as capital contributions.  He claims that he has met all of the \nrequirements of N.C.G.S. § 57C-8-01 necessary for him to bring a derivative action, \n  \nand that North Carolina’s LLC Act does not, as Defendants contend, include a \nrequirement that a derivative plaintiff must “[f]airly and adequately represent[ ] \nthe interests of the corporation.”  A provision to that effect is contained in the \nBusiness Corporation Act, see N.C.G.S. § 55-7-41, but there is no similar provision \nin the LLC Act.  The LLC Act allows a member to bring a derivative action if:  \n(1) [t]he plaintiff does not have the authority to cause the limited \nliability company to sue in its own right; and (2) [t]he plaintiff (i) is a \nmember of the limited liability company at the time of bringing the \naction, and (ii) was a member of the limited liability company at the \ntime of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains . . .   \n \nN.C.G.S. § 57C-8-01.   \n{45}  The LLC Act does require the complaint to allege with particularity \nany efforts made by the plaintiff to obtain relief or reasons for failure to make \nefforts.  Id.   Also, Rule 23(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure requires \nthat a complaint alleging a derivative action be verified.  Peak Coastal Ventures, \nLLC v. Suntrust Bank , 2011 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 5, 2011).   \nThe court concludes that Blythe has satisfied requirements necessary to have \nstanding to bring derivative claims.

Dalton v. Camp , 353 N.C. 647, 651, 548 S.E.2d \n704, 707 (2001).  In North Carolina, managers of a limited liability company \ngenerally owe a fiduciary duty to the company, but not to individual managers or \nmembers.  Id.   As a result, a claim for breach of a manager’s fiduciary duty is \ngenerally properly maintained by the company, not by individual members.  Id.  \nHowever, a controlling shareholder may owe a fiduciary duty to minority \nshareholders.  Id.   “Members of a limited liability company are like shareholders in \na corporation in that members do not owe a fiduciary duty to each other or to the \ncompany.”  Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., LLC , 196 N.C. App. 469, 473–74, 675 S.E.2d 133, \n137 (2009).    \n{48}  Blythe asserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty owed by Rob Bell to \nother members as a controlling member.  Defendants assert a counterclaim against \nBlythe because he has taken steps under a claim of controlling Drymax.    \nDefendants initially argued that Blythe’s position should be rejected as inconsistent \nwith his claim that he had achieved effective majority control by reason of the \nmembership interest transfers.  (Defs.’ Br. in Opp. to Pls.’ Mot. for P. Summ. J. \n(hereinafter Defs.’ Opp’n Br.) 21–22.)  The court’s December 10, 2012 Order \ndetermined that no Drymax member has ever had majority control.  Blythe also \nalleged a constructive fraud claim against Rob Bell only, which depends on Rob Bell \nhaving a controlling interest or Blythe having ceded dominion and control to him \nbecause of a relationship based on trust and confidence.  See  Keener Lumber Co. v. \nPerry , 149 N.C. App. 19, 28, 560 S.E.2d 817, 823 (2002) (quoting Terry v. Terry , 302 \nN.C. 77, 83, 273 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1981)).  Blythe rests this claim on his assertion \nthat Bell exercises de facto control because he controls HBI and HBI controls \nDrymax’s accounting.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 27–28.)   \n  \n{49}  The court concludes there is inadequate evidence to conclude that Rob \nBell “holds all the cards” in the relationship.  The evidence also demonstrates \nBlythe’s business sophistication, his role as Drymax’s manager, and his access to \nDrymax financial information.  (Defs.’ Br. in Supp. 12; Defs.’ Br. in Supp. of Their \nMot. for Summ. J. as to Claims by William A. B. Blythe (hereinafter Defs.’ Br. in \nSupp. as to Blythe) 24–27.)  Blythe also admits that he holds the power to terminate \nthe use of the Trademarks and admits he never trusted HBI’s President Joseph.  \n(Defs.’ Br. in Supp. as to Blythe 24–27.)   While he may have standing to assert \nviolations of fiduciary duty owed to Drymax, he has not demonstrated a basis to \nclaim a fiduciary duty owed to him individually. \n{50}  In sum, there is no basis to impose fiduciary duties owed by one \nDrymax member to another.  Any such claim should be dismissed and breach of \nfiduciary duty claims should be limited to duties owed to Drymax.  \n \nE. E. E. E.

Initially, \nDefendants assert then that such claims fail because, as a matter of law, the \nOperational Agreement does not apply to the sale of socks and, in any event, if \napplied to the sale of socks, the terms of the Operational Agreement are not \nsufficiently definite to be enforced. \n{52}  As a general proposition, where a party presents adequate facts that \nan agreement was reached, whether an agreement was actually reached so as to \nform a binding contract is a question of fact for the jury.  Story v. Stokes , 178 N.C. \n409, 411, 100 S.E. 689, 690 (1919).   Likewise, where there is evidence of an \n  \nagreement having been reached, but there is an ambiguity in the wording the \ncontracting parties used to reflect their agreement, a jury is allowed to consider \nextraneous evidence to determine the parties’ agreement.  See Whirlpool Corp. v. \nDailey Constr., Inc. , 110 N.C. App. 468, 471, 429 S.E.2d 748, 751 (1993).    \n{53}  Having carefully studied the entire record and the substantial \narguments presented, the court concludes that the Plaintiffs have presented \nsufficient evidence to pursue a breach of contract claim based on the Operational \nAgreement, and assuming the success of that claim, other claims that flow from \nDefendants’ failure to afford Drymax the opportunities flowing from the \nOperational Agreement, such that such claims should proceed to trial unless they \nare time barred.  While it is true that the Operational Agreement does not on its \nface specifically mention the sale of socks, and there is evidence suggesting the \ncontinuation of the License and Supply Agreement, the Parties promote different \nconstructions of the evidence that present disputed material facts to be resolved by \na finder of fact at trial.  As discussed more fully below, whether these claims are \ninstead time barred cannot be resolved until other disputed issues are resolved at \ntrial, and particularly the date on which the Operational Agreement can be \nconcluded to have been ready to be implemented but for Defendants’ refusal to do \nso.   \n{54}  The court cannot resolve at this time the extent to which Plaintiffs’ \nother claims depend entirely on enforcing the Operational Agreement.  Plaintiffs \nhave presented some claims that arguably are independent of the Operational \nAgreement.  Plaintiffs’ various claims include: (1) favoring HBI in ongoing \ntransactions, including refusal to finance Drymax operations to promote products; \n(2) requiring the proceeds of the royalties to be used to repay the debt to HBI, \nleaving Drymax unable to pays its debts when they became due; (3) charging an \ninflated interest rate on the loan to Drymax; (4) transferring assets and \nopportunities to HBI; (5) causing Drymax to pay expenses for the benefit of HBI and \nnot Drymax; (6) selling Drymax products through Strabell, LLC, of which Rob Bell \nis controlling owner and officer, at unauthorized and deep discounts thereby \n  \ndiminishing Drymax’s revenues; and (7) by selling HBI products in direct \ncompetition with Drymax.   \n{55}  Defendants separately claim that the claims that are not otherwise \ntime barred are also barred by the business judgment rule.  (Defs.’ Br. in Supp. 25.)  \nThis court has applied the business judgment rule to limited liability companies as \nwell as general corporations.  Mooring Capital Fund, LLC v. Comstock N.C., LLC , \n2009 NCBC LEXIS 32, at *30 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 13, 2009).  However, protection \nafforded by the business judgment rule is not unlimited and managers may face \nliability when they act outside the scope of managing the LLC.  Id.  (citing Hamby v. \nProfile Prods., LLC , 361 N.C. 630, 637 n.1, 652 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2007)).  Also, the \npresumption which the business judgment rule creates “can be rebutted by a \nshowing that the board violated one of its fiduciary duties in connection with the \nchallenged transaction.”  Green v. Condra , 2009 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *95 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Aug. 14, 2009) (quoting Wachovia Capital Partners, LLC v. Frank \nHarvey Inv. Family L.P. , 2007 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 5, \n2007)).  A plaintiff may overcome the presumption with proof that managers “failed \nto act (1) in good faith, (2) in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best \ninterest of the company or (3) on an informed basis.”  Technik v. WinWholesale Inc. , \n2012 NCBC LEXIS 5, at *32 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 13, 2012).     \n{56}  Plaintiffs forecast evidence, which if accepted, withstand summary \nadjudication.  Summary judgment cannot be granted on the basis of the business \njudgment rule.   \n \nF.   F.   F.   F.

(Pls.’ Resp. \nBr. 50–66.)  Defendants contend that all of Plaintiffs’ claims are time barred.  (Defs.’ \nBr. in Supp. as to Blythe 9.)  To resolve these contested positions, the court must \nfirst determine what statute of limitations applies, whether the statute has been \n  \ntolled, and whether Defendants are estopped from relying on a limitations defense.  \nThe court concludes that all claims are governed by the three-year limitations \nperiod, and that the contract claims and other claims which rest on a failure to \nimplement the Operational Agreement as a binding contract applicable to the sale \nof socks accrued at the point at which the Operational Agreement could have been \nimplemented but for Defendants’ improper failure to do so.  Determining that point \nin time, however, requires resolving contested issues of material fact.  The court \nconcludes, however, that this point in time must be determined and the limitations \nperiod then applied because the claims which depend on the Operational Agreement \nare not governed by the continuing wrong doctrine and the accrual of the cause of \naction is not governed by a discovery rule.  Assuming the statute would otherwise \nbar claims, the court concludes Plaintiffs’ have developed sufficient evidence to \nsupport an equitable defense that Defendants are estopped from relying on their \nlimitations defense.   \n1. The claims are governed by the three year statute of limitations  \n \n{58}  Plaintiffs claim the benefit of either a ten-year statute of limitations \nbased on a claim of constructive fraud or a four-year statute of limitations based on \nclaims for violation of the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act \n(“UDTPA”).   Plaintiffs’ sole constructive fraud claim was pled against Rob Bell \nindividually based on his alleged fiduciary duty owed to other members.  The court \nhas rejected that claim.  There is then no basis to apply a ten-year statute of \nlimitations. \n{59}  The court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claims fall outside the scope of the \nUDTPA.  A UDTPA claim requires a showing of “(1) an unfair or deceptive act or \npractice, or an unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting commerce, (3) which \nproximately caused actual injury to the plaintiff or to his business.”  See . N.C.G. S. \n§ 75-1.1(a) (2012); Cabrera v. Hensley , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *68 (N.C. Super. \nCt. July 16, 2012).  A breach of contract alone is not sufficient to state a claim under \nN.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.  Branch Banking & Trust Co. v. Thompson , 107 N.C. App. 53, 61, \n  \n418 S.E.2d 694, 700 (1992).  Further, matters related to internal corporate \ngovernance are not sufficiently in or affecting commerce to form the basis for an \nUDTPA claim.  See HAJMM Co. v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc. , 328 N.C. 578, 594, \n403 S.E.2d 483, 493 (1991); see also Maurer v. SlickEdit, Inc. , 2005 NCBC LEXIS 2, \nat *40 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 15, 2005).   \n{60}  The court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claims are directly related to, and \narise out of an asserted breach of contract not supported by the egregious \naccompanying facts that a breach of contract claim would require to be actionable \nunder the UDTPA, and further the disputes, including the contract claim, relate to \nmatters of internal corporate management.  As such, they do not involve external \ncommerce and do not fall within the UDTPA. \n{61}  The court reaches this conclusion mindful of documents Plaintiffs offer \nto suggest that Defendants unfairly represent outside the corporation that they own \nor control the Drymax Process when, in fact, they do not.  These documents include, \namong others, an article from an April 2007 interview with Josh Higgins \n(“Higgins”), who is now HBI’s President, in which Plaintiffs assert that Higgins \nfalsely claims that Drymax socks are HBI’s product and that HBI owns the \ntechnology.  (Pls.’ Br. in Supp. of Supplemental Mot. for Disc. Sanctions (hereinafter \n“Pls.’ Supplemental Br.”) Ex. F.)  Plaintiffs also submitted HBI’s profile from a \nwebsite maintained in connection with a 2011 and 2012 Outdoor Retailer \ntradeshow, in which it was represented that “HBI makes the best performance \nsocks available – Drymax® Socks.”  (Pls.’ Supplemental Br. 4–5, Ex. H, G.)   \nPlaintiffs further claim that Defendants considered attempting to surreptitiously  \nhave a license diverted to HBI, but no such effort was implemented.  Admittedly, \nsome of these statements may have been in commerce, but they were not \nstatements made or relied upon by Plaintiffs in commerce and they do not \ntransform the internal corporate disputes to disputes governed by the UDTPA.   \n \n \n  \n2. Plaintiffs are not entitled to the benefit of a discovery rule to \ndetermine the accrual of their causes of action, but may have an \nequitable estoppel defense   \n \n{62}  Plaintiffs contend that their claims for breach of contract, breach of \nfiduciary duty, and fraud are entitled to the benefit of the discovery rule.  Breach of \ncontract claims and breach of fiduciary duty claims that don’t rise to the level of \nconstructive fraud are governed by N.C.G.S. § 1-52(1) (2012), which does not contain \na discovery provision.  Toomer v. Branch Banking & Trust Co. , 171 N.C. App. 58, \n66, 614 S.E.2d 328, 335 (2005); Kaplan , 196 N.C. App. at 469, 473–74, 675 S.E.2d at \n137.  In contrast, the statute of limitations for a claim of fraud is three years but the \ncause of action shall not be deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the \naggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.  N.C.G.S. § 1-52(9) \n(2012).  Actual fraud has no all-embracing definition, but Plaintiffs must establish: \n“(1) [f]alse representation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably \ncalculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, \n(5) resulting in damage to the injured party.”  Forbis v. Neal , 361 N.C. 519, 526–27, \n649 S.E.2d 382, 387 (2007) (quoting Ragsdale v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, 138, 209 \nS.E.2d 494, 500 (1974)).  The reasonableness of a party’s reliance is a question for \nthe jury, unless the facts are so clear that they support only one conclusion.  Forbis , \n361 N.C. at 527, 649 S.E.2d at 387.     \n{63}  Plaintiffs’ fraud claim is based on their assertion that Defendants \nmisrepresented that all of the agreements were in force and that the Parties were \ngoing to make Drymax a company that would stand on its own, and in doing this \nBlythe relied on their acts and representations and Defendants diverted asserts \nfrom Drymax for the benefit of HBI.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 54–58.)   The court concludes \nthat the evidence does not adequately support a claim of fraud or fraudulent \nconcealment.  The contested facts rather play out as contrasting positions on (1) \nwhen the Operational Agreement was ready to be but was not implemented; and (2) \nwhether Defendants thereafter induced Blythe not to pursue his claim so that they \nshould be estopped from presenting a limitations defense.  \n  \n{64}  The limitations issue is unusual because Plaintiff’s claim that \nagreements reached in 2003 and 2004 regarding the future sale of Drymax branded \nsocks were not to be or were not capable of being implemented until a future point \nwhen Drymax was ready to launch and accept responsibility for the sale and \nmarketing of such socks.  Defendants less charitably argue that Plaintiffs’ claim is \nthat an agreement related to socks first “sprang into existence” at some point in \n2007.  The point at which Plaintiffs claim that the Operational Agreement could \nand should have been implemented is not easily fixed as a point in time, but it was \na definite point and is the date from which the statute of limitations should be \nmeasured.  Defendants claim that date was necessarily no later than mid 2007.  \n(Defs.’ Br. in Supp. 14–15.)  However, Plaintiffs dispute this factual assertion.  \nPlaintiffs also argue that Defendants controlled all the information necessary to \nuncover the breach of contract due to their positions on both sides of the agreement.  \n(Pls.’ Resp. Br. 66.)   Under the facts, the court believes this disputed evidence plays \nout as to whether Plaintiffs have an equitable estoppel defense to any statute of \nlimitations defense rather than providing Plaintiffs the benefit of a discovery rule \nthat would protect against the cause of action having accrued while Blythe awaited \na final determination of whether Defendants would honor the Operational \nAgreement. \n{65}  The doctrine of equitable estoppel may bar a litigant from relying upon \nthe statute of limitations.  Duke Univ. v. Stainback , 320 N.C. 337, 357 S.E.2d 690 \n(1987).  “Equitable estoppel arises when an individual by his acts, representations, \nadmissions or silence, when he has a duty to speak, intentionally or through \nculpable negligence, induces another to believe that certain facts exist and that \nother person rightfully relies on those facts to his detriment.”  Miller v. Talton , 112 \nN.C. App. 484, 488, 435 S.E.2d 793, 797 (1993).  The court need not find bad faith, \nfraud nor intent to deceive to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  Id.   The \nessential elements of estoppel include: (1) conduct on the part of the party sought to \nbe estopped which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material \nfacts; (2) the intention that such conduct will be acted on by the other party; and (3) \n  \nthe estopped party’s knowledge, actual or constructive, or the real facts.  The party \nasserting estoppel must have: (1) a lack of knowledge and the means of knowledge \nas to the real facts in question; and (2) relied upon the conduct of the party sought \nto be estopped to his prejudice.  Friedland v. Gales , 131 N.C. App. 802, 807, 509 \nS.E.2d 793, 796–97 (1998).  Applying estoppel depends on the facts of each case, and \nthe conduct of both parties must be weighed in balancing equity.  Miller , 112 N.C. \nApp. at 488, 435 S.E.2d at 797.  If the facts raise a permissible inference that the \nelements are present, but other inferences may be drawn from contrary evidence, \nthe issue of estoppel is for the finder of fact.  Id. ; see also Friedland , 131 N.C. App. \nat 809, 509 S.E.2d at 798.         \n{66}  The court concludes that there are disputed facts as to whether Blythe \nwas adequately mislead after being on notice of his potential claims so as to be \nentitled to the benefit of equitable estoppel.  However, he is not entitled to the \nbenefit of the discovery rule which is applied to claims based on fraud. \n  \n3. Plaintiffs’ claims based on the Operational Agreement are not \ngoverned by the continuing wrong doctrine   \n \n{67}  The general rule is that a cause of action accrues as soon as the right \nto institute and maintain a suit arises, and the limitations period begins to run \nwhen the cause of action accrues.  Williams v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of N.C. , 357 \nN.C. 170, 179, 581 S.E.2d 415, 423 (2003).  In certain circumstances, the limitations \nperiod may be tolled by application of the “continuing wrong” doctrine.  Id.   “A \ncontinuing violation is occasioned by continual unlawful acts, not by continual ill \neffects from an original violation.”  Id. (quoting Ward v. Caulk , 650 F.2d 1144, 1147 \n(9th Cir. 1981)).  When the doctrine applies, the statute of limitations does not \nbegin to run until the violative act ceases.  Id.  To determine whether the doctrine \napplies, the court must consider “the particular policies of the statute of limitations \nin question, as well as the nature of the wrongful conduct and harm alleged.”  \nWilliams , 357 N.C. at 179, 581 S.E.2d at 423 (quoting Cooper v. United States , 442 \nF.2d 908, 912 (7th Cir. 1971)).    \n  \n{68}  Plaintiffs claim that Defendants’ continued refusal to recognize the \ncontract between HBI and Drymax leads to the conclusion that every day is a new \nday in the relationship and a continuing abuse of that relationship adequate to \napply the continuing wrong doctrine to their claims.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. 62.)  \nDefendants instead contend that there is a single point in time when either a \nbreach of contract occurred or it did not and that the dispute matured at that fixed \npoint in time, so that Plaintiffs’ claims are only the continuing effects of the initial \nbreach.  (Defs.’ Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (hereinafter Defs.’ Reply) 18.) \n{69}  The court has carefully studied the cases upon which Plaintiffs rely to \ninvoke the continuing wrong theory.  In Marzec v. Nye , the North Carolina Court of \nAppeals applied the continuing wrong doctrine to certain of plaintiff’s breach of \nfiduciary duty claims but not others.  203 N.C. App. 88, 97, 690 S.E.2d 537, 544 \n(2010).  There the plaintiff alleged that the defendant breached his fiduciary duties \nby ceasing to make monthly salary payments to plaintiff and refusing to pay back \npay, refusing to comply with his request for accounting, failing to produce corporate \nrecords, taking out a personal loan in the company’s name and making payments \nwith company funds, and usurping a corporate opportunity.  Id.  at 94, 690 S.E.2d at \n542.  The court applied the continuing wrong doctrine to the failure to pay Marzec’s \nsalary or to provide him an accounting, but the court did not apply the doctrine to \nsave the claims based on the failure to produce corporate records, because this \nlatter claim was a continued ill effect from the single original failure to produce the \nrecords.  Id.  at 95, 690 S.E.2d at 543.  \n{70}  In Babb v. Graham , the Court of Appeals applied the doctrine to \nplaintiff’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty that alleged the trustee refused to make \nrequired distributions under a trust.  190 N.C. App. 463, 660 S.E.2d 626 (2008).  In \nan out of state case, Butler v. Gibbons , the court held that a new cause of action \naccrued each time the defendant failed to account and turn over proceeds earned \nfrom renting properties.  173 App. Div. 2d 352, 569 N.Y.S.2d 722 (1st Dept. 1991).  \n{71}  The court believes the facts of this case more closely approximate those \nof Stratton v. Royal Bank of Can. , where the continuing wrong doctrine was not \n  \napplied.          N.C. App.       , 712 S.E.2d 221 (2011).  There, the plaintiff inherited \nstock certificates in Bank of Manteo that had merged in 1962 with Planter’s Bank \nand later in 1990 with Centura Bank, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada.  The \nsurviving bank did not recognize the shares after the first merger.  Plaintiff brought \na claim for conversion and unjust enrichment.  Id.  at 224–25.  The Court \ndistinguished Marzec and Babb and held that the conversion of the stock was a \ndiscrete occurrence, and plaintiff’s loss of shareholder rights and dividends were the \ncontinual ill effects from the single initial conversion.  The court noted there was \nnot a clear cut wrong precipitating the subsequent injuries to the plaintiffs in \nMarzec  and Babb .  Id.  at 229.  The court further held that applying the continuing \nwrong doctrine to the facts presented there would contravene the underlying \npurposes of the statute of limitations by discouraging shareholders from promptly \ninvestigating and litigating stock conversion claims.  Id.  at 229–30. \n{72}  The court here again concludes that there was a single initial refusal \nby other members to honor the Operational Agreement in the manner that Blythe \nchampions.  Although defining the precise date this breach occurred may require \nresolution of disputed facts, a jury can affix the breach at a discrete point in time, \njust as the conversion in Stratton  occurred at a fixed point.  As a result, the court \nconcludes that a claim for breach of the Operational Agreement and any claims, \nincluding any breach of fiduciary duty claims, that depend upon such breach are not \ngoverned by the continuing wrong doctrine. \n{73}  It is possible that some of the fiduciary duty breaches which do not \nnecessarily depend on enforcing the Operational Agreement might be ones to which \nthe continuing wrong doctrine would apply under Marzec.  Some of them may not be \nsubject to a three year statute of limitations in the first instance.  But those that \nrest on the Operational Agreement are actionable, if at all, only if either they were \nbrought within three years of the date the jury determines the Operational \nAgreement was first ready to be implemented but for Defendants’ wrongful acts, or \nif Defendants are estopped from asserting a limitations defense.  Defendant’s \nlimitations defenses must await trial.     \n  \nV. V. V. V.  CONCLUS CONCLUS CONCLUS CONCLUSION ION ION ION    \n    \n{74}  For the reasons noted above, the court holds that:  \n(1) Certain claims in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nand Defendants’ two Motions for Summary Judgment related to the effect of \nmembership interest transfers were resolved by the court’s earlier December 10, \n2012 Order; \n(2) The remaining issue in Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment \nrelates to the counterclaim presented against Blythe individually for breach of his \nfiduciary duty to other members.  The Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment on that claim is GRANTED and that count of the counterclaim is \nDISMISSED; \n(3) Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of the Drymax Operating Agreement are \nDISMISSED; \n(4) The Amended Complaint may be not read to assert a claim by Blythe \nfor reimbursement of advanced expenses and no such issue may be submitted to a \njury; \n(5) All claims asserted by reason of an individual fiduciary duty owed by \none Drymax member to another Drymax member is DISMISSED; \n(6) Plaintiffs’ claims based on the UDTPA are DISMISSED; \n(7) In all other respects, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to \nBlythe’s claims and Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to Drymax’s \nClaims are DENIED, subject to further consideration of a limitations defense based \non the fact finder’s determination of when certain causes of action first accrued.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 4th day of February, 2013.   \n "
