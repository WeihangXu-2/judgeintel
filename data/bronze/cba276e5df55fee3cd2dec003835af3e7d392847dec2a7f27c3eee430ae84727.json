Dunn. \n \n \n \nStites & Harbison PLLC, by Chadwick A. McTighe (pro hac vice) and \nTimothy D. Thompson (pro hac vice), and Robinson, Bradshaw &  \nHinson, P.A., by Edward F. Hennessey, IV for Defendants Confluent \nHealth LLC; Laurence N. Benz; Breakthrough Cary PT, LLC; Mark F. \nWheeler; Jeffrey Hathaway; and Breakthrough Physical Therapy, Inc. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \nA. Facts. \n1. Defendant Breakthrough Cary  PT, LLC (“Breakthrough Cary”) is a \nlimited liability company organized under the laws of North Carolina, which engages \nin the business of providing physical therapy treatment to patients at multiple \nlocations across North Carolina.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 1–2.)1 \n2. Plaintiff Dunn Holdings I, Inc. (“Dunn Holdings”) is a North Carolina \ncorporation owned by Plaintiffs Dr. Christopher F. Dunn (“Christopher”) and his wife, \nTheresa M. Dunn.  (Id. at ¶ 6.)  In 2014, the Dunns sold substantially all of the assets \nof Dunn Holdings to Breakthrough Cary (“the Transaction”).  (Id. at ¶ 11.)  As a result \nof the Transaction, Dunn Holdings is a member of, and owns a 20% interest in, \nBreakthrough Cary.  The remaining 80% interest in Breakthrough Cary is currently \nowned by Defendant Confluent Health LLC (“Confluent”).2  (Breakthrough Cary Op. \nAg., ECF No. 50.1, at p. 30 (hereinafter “Operating Agreement”).)  Dunn Holdings is \na party to the Operating Agreement.  (Id. at p. 1.) \n \n                                                 \n1 The parties did not file any competent evidentiary materials in support of or opposition to \nthe Motion.  Accordingly, a ll facts recited herein are drawn from the allegatio ns in \nDefendants’ counterclaims (“CC”).  (Answ. and Countercl., ECF No. 59 at CC, pp. 27–38.) \n \n2 The 80% interest was originally held by  PT Development Cary, LLC (“PT Development”).  \nIt is undisputed that PT Development’s interest was later transferred to Confluent. \n \n \n3. In conjunction with the Transaction, Christopher was employed by  \nBreakthrough Cary and Breakthrough PT.  (ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶ 5.)  In December of \n2017, Christopher resigned as an employee of Breakthrough Cary and Breakthrough \nPT.  (Id. at ¶¶ 5, 56.)  Section 16.8 of the Breakthrough Cary Operating Agreement \nstates that “[i]n the event Christopher’s employment with Breakthrough [PT] is \nterminated for any reason whatsoever, then such termination of employment shall be \ndeemed as an offer by Dunn [Holdings] to sell all of its Membership Interests to \n[Breakthrough Cary], and [Breakthrough Cary] shall purchase such Membership \nInterests.”  (ECF No. 50.1, at pp. 22 –23; ECF No. 59  at CC, ¶ 51.)  The Operating \nAgreement provides that the purchase price shall be “the fair market value” of the \ntransferring member’s interest as determined by agreement among the members \nwithin 30 business days of the triggering event.  (ECF No. 50.1, at pp. 21–22.)  If the \nparties cannot reach agreement , the fair market value is det ermined through a \ndetailed appraisal process.  (Id.) \n4. Following Christopher’s resignation, Breakthrough Cary notified Dunn \nHoldings that it was invoking  the provisions of section 16.8 of the Operating \nAgreement and that Dunn Holdings was required to engage in the process for \ndetermining the fair market value of Dunn Holding’s interests in Breakthrough Cary.  \n(ECF No. 59 at CC, ¶¶ 56–62.)  Breakthrough Cary alleges that Dunn Holdings has \nrefused to participate in the mandatory appraisal and buyout process.  (Id. at ¶¶ 21, \n64.) \n \n \nA. Procedural History \n5. Plaintiffs filed their first Complaint in this matter on July 28, 2017.  \n(ECF No. 3.)  Plaintiffs subsequently filed an Amended Complaint on November 6, \n2017.  (ECF No. 7.)  On December 22, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Amend \nComplaint, (ECF No. 36 ), with a proposed Second Amended Complaint.  (ECF No. \n36.2.)  The Court granted the Motion to Amend Complaint on January 30, 2018 and \ndeemed the Second Amended Complaint to  have been filed and served upon \nDefendants on January 30, 2018.  (ECF No. 47.)   \n6. On May 8, 2018, Defendants filed their Answer and  Counterclaims.  \n(ECF No. 59.)  Defendants’ fourth counterclaim alleges that Dunn Holdings breached \nthe Operating Agreement by refusing to participate in the mandatory appraisal and \nbuyout process.  (Id. at CC, ¶¶ 49–64.)  Alternatively, the in the fourth counterclaim, \nBreakthrough Cary asks the Court to declare the rights of the parties under the \nOperating Agreement and to determine how the appraisal process should occur.  (Id. \nat ¶ 65.) \n7. On August 1, 2018, Breakthrough Cary filed the Motion for Partial SJ.  \nBreakthrough Cary seeks summary judgment on only Defendants’ fourth \ncounterclaim for breach of contract or declaratory judgment.  (ECF No. 71 , at p. 1.)  \nBreakthrough Cary also moves the Court to stay this lawsuit to allow completion of \nthe appraisal process.  ( Id.)  In support of the Motion for Partial SJ, Breakthrough \nCary filed a Memorandum in Support of its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nand Motion to Stay.  (“Mem. in Supp.”; ECF No. 72.)  Breakthrough Cary attached to \n \n \nthe Mem. in Supp. six (6) separate letters that had been exchanged between \nChristopher and Dunn Holdings, and Breakthrough Cary (“the Correspondence”).  \n(ECF Nos. 72.1 –72.6.)  The Correspondence was not accompanied by an affidavit.  \nBreakthrough Cary did not file any other materials in support of the Motion. \n8. On September 4, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Response to Defendants’ ( sic) \nMotion for Partial Summary Judgement and Motion t o Stay.  (ECF No. 76.)  \nBreakthrough Cary filed a Reply in Support of the Motion , (ECF No. 78),  and the \nMotion is now ripe for determination.   \nI. ANALYSIS  \n9. Breakthrough Cary moves pursuant to Rule 56(a) for summary \njudgment in its favor on its claim for a declaratory judgment, arguing that Dunn \nHoldings breached the Operating Agreement, (ECF No. 72, at pp. 1–7), and requests \nthat the Court \norder Dunn Holdings to identify its appraiser within 10 \ndays of the date the order granting this motion is issued, \nand . . . set a date by which the appraisal must be \ncompleted (Breakthrough Cary suggests that 90 days \nshould be more than sufficient). Further, the Court should \nstay all deadlines in this action so the appraisal process can \nproceed and the parties and Court c an avoid wasting \nresources. \n \n(Id. at p. 7.) \n \n10. Rule 56(a) provides that a claimant “ may, at any time after the \nexpiration of 30 days from the commencement of the action or after service of a motion \n \n \nfor summary judgment by the adverse party, move with or with out supporting \naffidavits for a summary judgment in his favor upon all or any part thereof.”   \n11. “Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that any party is entitled to \njudgment as a matte r of law.”  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic \nServs., LLC, 365 N.C. 520, 523, 723 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2012) ( citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  An issue is “material” if “resolution of the issue is so essential that \nthe party against w hom it is resolved may not prevail.”  Unitrin Auto & Home Ins. \nCo. v. McNeill, 215 N.C. App. 465, 467, 716 S.E.2d 48, 50 (2011)  (citation omitted).  \nWhen a party bearing the burden of proof moves for summary judgment on its claim, \nit bears “the burden of clearly establishing lack of a triable issue to the trial court.”  \nN.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sadler , 365 N.C. 178, 182, 711 S.E.2d 114, 116 \n(2011) (quotatio n marks  omitted).  The moving party can meet this burden by \n“show[ing] that there are no fact ual issues in dispute and ‘no gaps’ in their proof .”  \nHome Indem. Co. v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 128 N.C. App. 189, 199, 494 S.E.2d 774, \n780 (1998) (citing Parks Chevrolet, Inc. v. Watkins, 74 N.C. App. 719, 721, 329 S.E.2d \n728, 729 (1985)). \n12. In considering a motion for summary judgment, all evidence is viewed \nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Mosely v. WAM, Inc. , 167 N.C. \nApp. 594, 597, 606 S.E.2d 140, 142 (2004).  “If the movant demonstrates the lack of a \ngenuine issue of material fact, the burden shifts to the non-movant to present specific \n \n \nfacts which establish the presence of a genuine factual dispute for trial.”   Friends of \nCrooked Creek, L.L.C. v. C.C. Partners, Inc., 802 S.E.2d 908, 911–12, 2017 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 568, at *8 (2017) (quoting In re Will of Jones , 362 N.C. 569, 573 , 669 S.E.2d \n572, 576 (2008)). \n13. Plaintiffs contend that the Motion “is not supported by any affidavits, \nand there is therefore no competent evidence for the Court to consider as a summary \njudgment motion.”  (ECF No. 76, at p. 1.)  Plaintiffs further argue that the Motion for \nPartial SJ must be treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule \n12(c), which should be denied because Plaintiffs dispute allegations of material fact \nunderlying Breakthrough Cary’s counterclaim for breach of the Operating \nAgreement.  (Id. at pp. 1–2.)  While the Court is not persuaded that a motion for \nsummary judgment under Rule 56 can be converted into a motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings by the trial court, it need not reach this issue because Plaintiffs are \ncorrect that Breakthrough Cary has not filed appropriate supporting materials on \nwhich summary judgment can be granted. \n14. Unless based on admissions in the pleadings, a motion for summary \njudgment must be supported by admissible evidentiary materials, such as \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, responses to requests for admissions, and \naffidavits.  Rule 56(c); Blades v. Raleigh, 280 N.C. 531, 544–45, 187 S.E.2d 35, 43 \n(1972) (“[U]nder Rule 56 the court may receive and consider various kinds of evidence. \n. . . Evidence which may be considered under Rule 56 includes admissions in the \npleadings, depositions on file, answers to Rule 33 interrogatories, admissions on file \n \n \nwhether obtained under Rule 36 or in any other way, affidavits, and any other \nmaterial which would be admissible in evidence or of which judicial notice may \nproperly be taken. . . . Oral testimony may also be received by reason of Rule 43(e)” \n(citation omitted)).  In addition, submitted affidavits must meet the requirements \nof Rule 56(e) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure: “affidavits shall be made \non personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, \nand shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters \nstated therein.”  Rule 56(e).  Furthermore, \n[A]ffidavits or other material offered which set forth facts \nwhich would not be admissible in evidence should not be \nconsidered when passing on the motion for summary \njudgment.  Hearsay matters included in affidavits should \nnot be considered by a trial court in entertaining a party’s \nmotion for summary judgment. Similarly, a trial court may \nnot consider that portion(s) of an affidavit which is not \nbased on an affiant’s personal knowledge. \n \nWein II, LLC v. Porter, 198 N.C. App. 472, 476, 683 S.E.2d 707, 711 (2009) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).   \n15. In this case, Breakthrough Cary does not seek summary judgment based \non admissions in the pleadings, and has not filed affidavits or other proper materials \nin support of its Motion for Partial SJ.  Instead, it attached to its Memorandum six \nunsworn letters.  “Unsworn letters and correspondence are not the type of evidence \nconsidered by the court pursuant to Rule 56, and should not be considered during \nsummary judgment. . . . Instead, ‘parties are required to set forth facts in affidavits \nor as otherwise provided.’”  Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC v. Bruton Cable Serv., 233 \nN.C. App. 468, 473, 756 S.E.2d 863, 866–67 (2014) (quoting Strickland v. Doe , 156 \n \n \nN.C. App. 292, 296, 577 S.E.2d 124, 129 (2003); see also TD Bank, N.A. v. Williams, \n247 N.C. App. 864, 873, 787 S.E.2d 74, 80 (2016) (“Unsworn letters and \ncorrespondence are not the type of evidence considered by the court at summary \njudgment, and should not be considered.”). The contents of the unsworn letters \nconstitutes the type of “other material which set [s] forth facts which would not be \nadmissible in evidence.”  Wein II, LLC, 198 N.C. App. at 476, 683 S.E.2d at 711. \n16. Breakthrough Cary contends that it can make a motion for summary \njudgment because Rule 56(a) provides that a claimant can “move with or without \nsupporting affidavits.”  (ECF No. 78, at pp. 1 –2.)  However, it cites no appellate or \nother case authority in support of the argument that a movant can fulfill its burden \nunder Rule 56 with unsworn documen ts and need not file at least some type of \ncompetent materials (i.e., deposition, sworn responses to interrogatories, etc.).  To the \ncontrary, as discussed above, the Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that the type \nof materials relied upon by Breakth rough Cary here —unsworn letters —are not \nsufficient to support a motion for summary judgment.  See Strickland, 156 N.C. App. \nat 296, 577 S.E.2d at 129 (“The supplemental discovery, in the  form of a letter by \nplaintiffs’ attorney containing an unsigned summary of a report by a private \ninvestigator as to what the investigator was told . . .  is not the type of evidence that \nmay be relied on by the trial court in deciding a motion for summary judgment.”). \n17. In addition, the Co urt concludes that th e statement “with or without \nsupporting affidavits” in Rule 56(a) must be construed in the context of the rest of \nRule 56, including Rule 56(c).  Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., 358 N.C. 160, 188, 594 S.E.2d \n \n \n1, 20 (2004) (Courts do “not  read segments of a statute in isolation” but “[r]ather, [ ] \nconstrue statutes  in pari materia , giving effect, if po ssible, to every provision.”); \nErnie’s Tire Sales & Service v. Riggs, 106 N.C. App. 460, 464, 417 S.E.2d 75, 77 (1992) \n(“[A]ll parts of a statute mu st be read together, neither taking  specific words out of \ncontext, nor interpreting one part so as to render another meaningless.”).  Rule 56(c) \nprovides that summary judgment shall be granted “ if the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law. ” (emphasis added).  Read in light of Rule \n56(c), the language “with or without supporting affidavits” appears to simply mean \nthat a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56(a) may be supported by the other \nmaterials listed in Rule 56(c) , and does not need to be based on af fidavits.  This is \nconsistent with North Carolina case law regarding the materials that would support \nthe entry of summary judgment.  See Blades, 280 N.C. at 544–45, 187 S.E.2d at 43 \n(listing types of “evidence”, including affidavits,  that a court may prop erly consider \nin deciding a motion for summary judgment). \n18. Breakthrough Cary has not met its burden as the moving party under \nRule 56(a) because it has not filed any competent evidence in support of its motion \nfor summary judgment.  Therefore, the Motion should be DENIED. \n \n \nII. CONCLUSION \n19. THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion is DENIED. \n \nSO ORDERED, this, the 19th day of December, 2018. \n \n \n_/s/ Gregory P.
