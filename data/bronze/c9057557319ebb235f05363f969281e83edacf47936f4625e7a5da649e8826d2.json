Before the Court for decision are four motions:  \n(i) Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants Richard Brasser (“Brasser”) and Greg \nGentner’s (“Gentner”) Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs’ \nAffirmative Claims (the “Brasser/Gentner Motion”), (ECF No. 76);  \n(ii) Brasser and Gentner’s  Motion for Summary Judgment on Counterclaims \n(the “Brasser/Gentner Counterclaim Motion”), (ECF No. 78);  \n(iii) Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant rFactr, Inc.’s (“rFactr” or the “Company”) \nMotion for Summary Judgment as to rFact r’s Claims and \nDefendant/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs’ Counterclaims ( the “rFactr Motion”), \n(ECF No. 84); and  \n(iv) Defendants Chris and Caroline McDowell’s ( the “McDowells ” or, \nrespectively, “Chris” and “Caroline”) Amended Motion to Strike and/or \nrFactr, Inc. v. McDowell, 2020 NCBC 89. \nPreclude Reliance on Affidavit of Luis Gomez (the “Motion to Strike”), (ECF \nNo. 96), (collectively, the “Motions”) in the above-captioned case. \n2. This case arises out of Caroline’s October 2017 telephone call to Jackson \nNational Life Insurance Company (“Jackson National”), in which Caroline is alleged \nto have falsely represented that rFactr, a company with outstanding Internal \nRevenue Service (“IRS”) liabilities and with which Jackson National was negotiating \na contract, was financially unstable.  Soon after the call, Jackson National informed \nrFactr that it no longer wished to pursue negotiations or enter into a contract  with \nthe Company.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed suit against the McDowells, a sserting \nclaims based on Caroline’s call and contending that the call was the sole reason that \nJackson National did not enter a contract with rFactr. \n3. The McDowells have asserted counterclaims in response, alleging, among \nother things,  that Plaintiffs misrepresented the Company’s financial condition  to \ninduce the McDowells’ investment in the Company and that Brasser and Gentner \nbreached their fiduciary duties  to the McDowells  by misrepresenting rFactr’s \nfinancial condition , paying themselves excessive and unreasonable salaries , and \notherwise diverting corporate resources for their personal benefit. \n4. After considering the Motions, the briefs and related materials submitted in \nsupport of and in opposition to the Motions, and the arguments of counsel a t the \nhearing on the Motions, the Court GRANTS  in part and DENIES in part  the \nMotions. \nJames, McElroy & Diehl, P.A., by John R. Buric and John R. Brickley, \nfor Plaintiff rFactr, Inc. \n \nLincoln Derr PLLC, by Sara R. Lincoln and Phoebe Norton Coddington, \nfor Plaintiffs Richard Brasser and Greg Gentner. \n \nRosenwood, Rose & Litwak, PLLC, by Erik M. Rosenwood and Carl J. \nBurchette, for Defendants Chris McDowell and Caroline McDowell. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5. The Court does not make findings of fact  when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment. The following background, drawn from the evidence submitted \nin support of and in opposition to the Motions, is intended only to provide context for \nthe Court’s analysis and ruling.   \n6. The McDowells met and befriended Brasser in the mid-2000s.  (Dep. Chris \nMcDowell 26:24–27:9 [hereinafter “Dep. Chris”].)1  In 2011, Brasser approached the \nMcDowells to discuss a possible investment in his company —The Targeted Group, \nInc. (“Targeted Group”) .  ( Dep. Chris 27:12– 25.)  At that time, Brasser told the \nMcDowells that Targeted Group was in the business of “social media in the context \nof business to business selling,” (Dep. Chris 35:20–21), and that he was in the process \nof securing angel investors and multi -level marketin g groups and had already \nsecured customers, including Amway, (Dep. Chris 36:15–21, 53:22–55:8).   \n \n1 Excerpts of the deposition of Chris McDowell are located at ECF Nos. 82.1, 108.2, and 109.2. \n \n7. Chris, Caroline, or both2 subsequently invested $65,000 in Targeted Group \npreferred stock on October 26, 2011 from funds held in their joint bank account.  (Aff. \nChris ¶ 3, ECF No. 94; Dep. Chris 222:17–226:22.)  These shares were evidenced by \na stock certificate issued in Chris’s name. (The Targeted Group, Inc. Stock Certificate \n[hereinafter “ TGI Certificate”], ECF No. 83.2; Dep. Chris 224:4– 17.)  Although \nBrasser had represented to Chris in soliciting his investment that Amway was a \nsignificant Targeted Group customer, Chris discovered after his investment that \nAmway had never been a Targeted Group customer.  (Dep. Chris 54:22–55:8.)   \n8. In May 2013, Targeted Group changed its name to rFactr, resulting in the \nconversion of all of Targeted Group’s shares into rFactr shares.  (Aff. Greg Gentner \n¶ 7 [hereinafter “Aff. Gentner”], ECF No. 80; Articles Restatement The Targeted \nGroup, Inc., ECF No. 80.1; Aff. Richard Brasser ¶ 7 [hereinafter “Aff. Brasser”], ECF \nNo. 79; rFactr, Inc. Stock Certificate [hereinafter “rFactr Certificate”], ECF No. 83.3.)  \nAfterward, Chris learned that the Company had large debts it had retained from \nTargeted Group—debts Chris had asked about and that Brasser had not disclosed in \nsoliciting Chris’s investment.  (Dep. Chris 50:14–51:8.)   \n9. In 2015, Chris, Caroline, or both made a second investment in rFactr from \nfunds held in the ir joint bank account, this time investing $25,000 in an rFactr \nconvertible note.  ( Aff. Chris McDowell ¶ 4 [hereinafter “Aff. Chris”].)  Prior to this \ninvestment, Chris asked Brasser whether rFactr had any outstanding deb ts that \n \n2 The parties dispute who actually purchased the Targeted Group shares.  The determination \nof that issue is not material to the Brasser/Gentner and rFactr Motions  but, as discussed \ninfra, is material to the resolution of the Brasser/Gentner Counterclaim Motion. \ncould negatively impact the Company’s ability to pay the note .  Brasser responded \nthat the Company did not have any outstanding debts and that the investment would \nbe used to pay standard business expenses and grow the Company’s customer base.  \n(Aff. Chris ¶¶ 8–10.) \n10. Chris joined rFactr’s Board of Directors in or around March or April 2015.  \n(Dep. Chris 244:8–15.)  While serving on the Board of Directors, Chris often worked \nfrom home and conducted confidential business calls on speakerphone that Caroline \ncould and did hear from time to time.  (Dep. Chris 14:2–15:4; Dep. Caroline McDowell \n129:15–130:12 [hereinafter “Dep. Caroline”].)\n3  Caroline also had access to Chris’s \nwork email, which she accessed using a password Chris commonly used.  (Dep. Chris \n11:21–12:19; Dep. Caroline 139:21 –140:12.)  Although Caroline had used Chris’s \naccount previously with his approval  to make travel reservations , and while Chris \nknew Caroline had access to his email account , Caroline also regularly read Chris’s \nwork emails without his knowledge, marking  them as “unread” to hide her a ctions.  \n(Dep. Chris 11:21–12:19; Dep. Caroline 141:16–142:24, 146:2–13.) \n11. It was also in  2015 that rFactr and Jackson National entered into \nnegotiations for a multi-year license for certain rFactr software.  These negotiations \ncontinued into the fall of 20 17, and by that October, rFactr and Jackson National \nwere preparing a Master License and Services Agreement and Statement of Work .  \n(Aff. Chris ¶ 18; Aff. Gentner ¶¶ 14, 20; see Draft Master License &  Services \nAgreement & Statement of Work, ECF No. 80.3.) \n \n3 Excerpts of the deposition of Caroline McDowell are located at ECF Nos. 82.2, 107, and \n108.3. \n12. During the period of these negotiations and extending back to 2013, rFactr \nstruggled financially and suffered substantial losses.  (See  rFactr Investor Update  \nEmail Aug. 11, 2017 [hereinafter “rFactr Investor Update”], ECF No. 94.5 .)  The \nCompany ultimately could not afford to pay its creditors or business expenses.  ( Aff. \nChris ¶ 17.)  Indeed, rFactr’s failure to pay federal taxes prompted the IRS to file tax \nliens against the Company , (see Aff. Gentner ¶ ¶ 11 –12), and rFactr’s federal tax \nliability became substantial.4   \n13. On October 26, 2017, Caroline initiated the telephone call to Jackson \nNational that is at the center of Plaintiffs’ claims .  It is undisputed that she made \nseveral statements in the call, including that she wa s a former employee of rFactr  \nnamed Susan,5 that rFactr was about to be seized by the IRS, and that rFactr’s owner \nor Chief Executive Officer (“ CEO”) was being investigated for arson of his home.  \n(Audio Recording Phone Call, ECF No. 82.3; see also Dep. Caroline 194:15–196:8, \n229:22–230:2.)   \n14. The Jackson National representative who answered her call then \ntransferred her to Jeffrey Mitchell (“Mitchell”), a senior human resources business \nconsultant for Jackson National.  (Dep. Jeffrey Mitchell 5:12–18, 11:1–9 [hereinafter \n \n4 Brasser and Gentner disclosed the IRS liabilities to the Company’s board of directors for \nthe first time in June 2017 when rFactr owed over $900,000 to the IRS.  ( Aff. Chris ¶¶ 14–\n16.)  Two months later, rFactr disclosed to its i nvestors that it then had significant \noutstanding IRS liabilities of $720,000.  (rFactr Investor Update.) \n \n5 Caroline testified that she lied about her identity to keep her involvement secret from Chris.  \n(Dep. Caroline 192:11–193:12.)  Chris did not learn that Caroline made the call to Jackson \nNational until December 2017.  (Aff. Chris ¶ 23.) \n“Dep. Mitchell”] .)6  Caroline told Mitchell that she used to work for rFactr, ( Dep. \nMitchell 11:23–12:8), rFactr’s owners were in financial trouble, ( Dep. Mitchell 16:3–\n6), rFactr was in trouble with the IRS, (Dep. Mitchell 16:7–8, 17:6–10), rFactr’s CEO \nwas under investigation for arson, ( Dep. Mitchell 16:8–9, 17:19–18:1), and rFactr’s \nowners had withdrawn their children from school and were leaving the country, (Dep. \nMitchell 16:9–11, 19:24– 20:15).  Mitchell thought the call might b e a prank or \nphishing and did not investigate Caroline’s accusations, (Dep. Mitchell 18:14–25, \n21:18–22), but nonetheless reported the call to Jackson National’s in -house counsel, \n(Dep. Mitchell 20:20–21:13, 27:16–28:16).   \n15. The following day, Luis Gomez (“Gomez”), Jackson National’s Vice President \nof Marketing and Digital Strategy and one of its principal business contacts with \nrFactr, (Aff. Gentner ¶ 28 ; Aff. Luis Gomez ¶ 1 [hereinafter “Aff. Gomez”], ECF No. \n77), emailed the Company to advise that  Jackson National had “decided to move in \nanother direction” and that it would discontinue its contract negotiations with rFactr, \n(Aff. Gentner ¶ 29 ).  Brasser initially suspected that Jackson National terminated \nnegotiations because it had discovered rFac tr’s substantial IRS tax lien .  (Email \nRichard Brasser Oct. 27, 2017 [hereinafter “Oct. 27 Email”], ECF No. 79.5. )  It was \nmonths later when Brasser and Gentner learn ed of Caroline’s call to Jackson \nNational.  (Aff. Brasser ¶ 30; Aff. Gentner ¶ 30.)   \n \n6 Excerpts of the deposition of Jeffrey Mitchell are located at ECF Nos. 82.4 and 106.2. \nII. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n16. rFactr initiated this action on June 21, 2018 soon after Brasser and Gentner \nlearned of Caroline’s October 2017 call to Jackson National.  (Compl., ECF No. 123.)  \nrFactr subsequently amended its complaint on August 16, 2018, (First  Am. Compl., \nECF No. 3), and again, with leave of court, on October 25, 2018 to add Brasser and \nGentner as Plaintiffs, (Second Am. Compl [hereinafter “Compl.”], ECF No. 16).  rFactr \nasserts claims against the McDowells for tortious interference with prospe ctive \neconomic advantage and unfair or deceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75.1-1, \nand a claim  against Chris for breach of fiduciary duty.  (Compl. ¶¶ 84 –88, 97–104, \n105–09.)  Brasser and Gentner assert a defamation claim against the McDowells.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 89–96.) \n17. In response to Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint, on November 27, \n2018, the McDowells asserted counterclaims against (i) rFactr for shareholder \ninspection under N.C.G.S. § 55 -16-02 and for breach of contract, (ii)  Brasser and \nGentner for breach of fiduciary duty and fraudulent misrepresentation/concealment \nof material fact, and (iii) rFactr, Brasser, and Gentner for constructive fraud.   \n(McDowells’ Answer Pls.’ Second Am. Compl.  & Countercls. Against rFactr, Inc., \nRichard Brass er, & Greg Gentner , ¶¶ 98 –109, 110– 18, 119–27, 128 –36, 137– 47 \n[hereinafter “Answer”], ECF No. 18.)   \n18. Brasser and Gentner filed their Motions for Summary Judgment on June 1, \n2020.  (Pls. Richard Brasser & Greg Gentner’s Mot. Summ. J. Pls.’ Affirmative \nClaims, ECF No. 76; Pls.-Countercl. Defs. Richard Brasser & Greg Gentner’s Mot. \nSumm. J. Def.- Countercl. Pls.’ Claims, ECF No. 78 .)  rFactr filed its Motion for \nSummary Judgment on the same day .  (rFactr, Inc.’s Mot. Summ. J. rFactr, Inc.’s \nClaims & Def./Countercl. Pls.’ Countercls., ECF No. 84 .)  The McDowells filed their \nMotion to Strike on June 15, 2020, (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Mot. Strike and/or Preclude \nReliance Aff. Luis Gomez , ECF No. 88 ), and an Amended Motion to Strike on June \n29, 2020, (Defs.’ Am. Mot. Strike and/or Preclude Reliance Aff. Luis Gomez, ECF No. \n96). \n19. The Motions have been fully briefed, and a hearing on the Motions was held \non August 20, 2020 by videoconference (the “Hearing”), at which all parties were \nrepresented by counsel.  The Motions are now ripe for resolution. \nIII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n20. “Summary judgment is proper ‘if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.’ ”  Morrell v. Hardin Creek, Inc., 371 N.C. 672, 680, 821 \nS.E.2d 360, 366 (2018) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  “[T]he party moving for \nsummary judgment ultimately has the burden of establishing the lack of any triable \nissue of fact.”  Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co. , 313 N.C. 488, 491, 329 \nS.E.2d 350, 353 (1985).   \n21. The party moving for summary judgment may satisfy its burden by proving \nthat “an essential element of  the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be \nproven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense, or by showing through \ndiscovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential \nelement of [the] claim [.]”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 \n(2000) (citations omitted).  “If the moving party satisfies its burden of proof, then the \nburden shifts to the non-moving party to ‘set forth specific facts showing that there is \na genuine issue for trial.’ ”  Lowe v. Bradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369–70, 289 S.E.2d 363, \n366 (1982) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  “ [A] genuine issue is one which can be \nmaintained by substantial evidence .”  Kessing v. Nat’l Mortg. Corp. , 278 N.C. 523, \n534, 180 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1971) .  “Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as \na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and means more \nthan a scintilla or a permissible inference.”  Daughtridge v. Tanager Land, LLC, 373 \nN.C. 182, 187, 835 S.E.2d 411, 415 (2019) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  If the nonmoving party does not satisfy its burden, then “summary \njudgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant].”  United Cmty. \nBank (Ga.) v. Wolfe, 369 N.C. 555, 558, 799 S.E.2d  269, 271 (2017) (quoting N.C. R. \nCiv. P. 56(e)).   \n22. In determining whether the nonmoving party has satisfied its burden, the \nCourt “asks whether reasonable jurors could find by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the [nonmovant] is entitled to a verdict[.]”  Sloan v. Miller Bldg. Corp., 119 N.C. \nApp. 162, 165–66, 458 S.E.2d 30, 32 (1995) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986)) .  In making this determination, “[t]he \nevidence must be considered ‘in a light most favorable to the non -moving party.’ ”  \nMcCutchen v. McCutchen , 360 N.C. 280, 286, 624 S.E.2d 620, 625 (2006) (quoting \nHowerton v. Arai Helmet, Ltd., 358 N.C. 440, 470, 597 S.E.2d 674, 693 (2004)). \nIV. \nANALYSIS \n23. Because it seeks to limit the evidence the Court may consider in connection \nwith the rFactr and Brasser/Gentner Motions, the Court first turns to Defendants’ \nMotion to Strike. \nA. Motion to Strike \n24. Plaintiffs rely upon the a ffidavit of Jackson National’s executive, Luis \nGomez (“Gomez Affidavit” or the “Affidavit”), to support the entry of summary \njudgment on their claims against Defendants.  ( See Aff. Gomez.)  The McDowells \nmove to strike the Affidavit, contending that the Af fidavit (i) contains inadmissible \nhearsay and speculation, (ii) is protected from Plaintiffs’ use by the attorney client \nprivilege, and (iii) was obtained by Plaintiffs in violation of Rule 4.2 of the North \nCarolina Rules of Professional Conduct.7  (See Defs.’ Br. Supp. Am. Mot. Strike and/or \nPreclude Reliance Aff. Luis Gomez 6 [hereinafter “Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Strike”], ECF \nNo. 97.) \n \n7 See N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 4.2(a) (“During the representation of a client, a lawyer shall not \ncommunicate about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be \nrepresented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other \nlawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.”). \n25. Although Defendants seek to exclude the entirety of the Affidavit or “[a]t the \nvery least, paragraphs 15 through 23,” ( Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Strike  22), it appears \nthat paragraphs 17, 18, 19, and 23 of the Affidavit contain the assertions most \ngermane to the Court’s determination of the Motions .  Those paragraphs state , in \nrelevant part, as follows: \n17. Mr. Bauman informed m e that an unknown female recently called \nJackson National and provided derogatory information about rFactr. \n \n18. I understood that the caller informed Jackson National that rFactr \nwas about to be seized by the IRS, that the CEO of rFactr was being \ninvestigated for arson of his home, and that the owners of rFactr were \nremoving their children from school and leaving the country. \n \n19. Based on the information provided by the caller, Ken Bauman \nadvised me not to execute the contract with rFactr. . . . \n \n23. Jackson National did not enter into the contract with rFactr based \non the call it received on October 26, 2017. \n \n(Aff. Gomez ¶¶ 17–19, 23.)  \n26. Rule 56(e) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”) requires \nthat “[s]upporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall \nset forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively \nthat the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. \n56(e).  “[E]vidence set forth in affidavits that would be inadmissible at trial must be \nstricken and may not be considered by the court in rendering summary judgment.”  \nHammer v. Hammer, 179 N.C. App. 408, 411, 633 S.E.2d 878, 881–82 (2006).   \n27. Of particular relevance here, “ ‘ [h]earsay’ is a statement, other than one \nmade by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to \nprove the truth of the matter asserted .”  N.C. R. Evid. 801(c).  Because “[h]earsay is \nnot adm issible except as provided by statute or the Rules of Evidence[ ,]” State v. \nHinnant, 351 N.C. 277, 283, 523 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2000) (citing N.C. R. Evid. 802) , \n“[h]earsay matters included in affidavits should not be considered by a trial court in \nentertaining a party ’s motion for summary judgment[,]” Moore v. Coachmen Indus. \nInc., 129 N.C. App. 389, 394, 499 S.E.2d 772, 776 (1998).  \n28. In paragraphs 17, 18, and 19, Gomez describes  information that Ken \nBauman (“Bauman”), a Jackson National attorney, told him regarding an “unknown \nfemale[’s]” call to Jackson National.  (Aff. Gomez ¶ 17.)  These statements involve two \nlayers of hearsay: (i) Caroline’s statements to Jackson National and (ii) Bauman’s \nstatements to Gomez.  Plaintiffs argue that none of the statements constitute \ninadmissible hearsay because they are not offered to prove the truth of the matter \nasserted; rather, they are offered to explain Gomez’s actions in refusing to pursue  \ncontract negotiations.  (Pls. ’ Resp. Defs.’ Am. Mot. Strike and/ or Preclude Reliance \nAff. Luis Gomez 13 –14, ECF No. 119; rFactr’s Mem. Law Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Strike \nand/or Preclude Reliance Aff. Luis Gomez 16, ECF No. 120.) \n29. The Court disagrees.  Plaintiffs ’ briefs make plain that they  offer the \nAffidavit to establish that Caroline’s call was the sole reason Jackson National \ncancelled negotiations and did not enter into a contract with rFactr.  ( See, e.g., Pls. \nRichard Brasser &  Greg Gentner’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Pls.’ Aff. Claims 6 \n[hereinafter “Brasser & Gentner’s Br. Supp. Affirmative Claims”], ECF No. 82 (citing \nthe Gomez A ffidavit to state that “Jackson National did not enter into the contract \nwith rFactr because of the call from Mrs. McDowell”); Mem. Law Supp. rFactr’s Mot. \nSumm. J. 6 [hereinafter “Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot.”], ECF No . 85 (citing the Gomez \nAffidavit to state that “[a]s a result of Mrs. McDowell’s call, Jackson National did not \nenter into the contract with rFactr”).)   \n30. Indeed, the Affidavit is the only eviden ce on which Plaintiffs rely to claim \nthat Caroline’s call caused Jackson National to terminate contract negotiations with \nrFactr.  The Affidavit , however,  cannot establish a causal connection between \nCaroline’s call and the termination of contract negotiations unless the Court accepts \nas true the statements contained in paragraphs 17, 18, and 19.  Not only does Gomez \nrely on the truth of each of the hearsay statements to support his assertion in \nparagraph 23 that Jackson National did not enter into a contract with rFactr because \nof Caroline’s call, but those same four paragraphs also make plain that Gomez did \nnot have personal knowledge of Jackson National’s purported reason  for that \ndecision.  As Gomez avers, “[b]ased on the information provided by the caller,” \nBauman advised him not to enter the contract with rFactr.  (Aff. Gomez ¶ 19.)  Gomez \ndoes not testify that he made the decision to terminate contract negotiation s,8 and \neven if he had , his Affidavit establishes only that he terminated the negotiations \nbecause Bauman advised him to, not because of Caroline’s call itself.    \n \n8 Indeed, Brasser and Gentner interpret Gomez’s affidavit testimony to state that “Mr. \nBauman instructed Mr. Gomez that . . . he was not to sign [the contract] with rFactr[,]” \n(Brasser & Gentner’s Br. Supp. Affirmative Claims 6 (emphasis added)), making plain their \nview that Gomez was not Jackson National’s decisionmaker concerning a potential contract \nwith rFactr.   \n \n31. As such, the Court concludes that paragraphs 17, 18, and 19 constitute \ninadmissible hearsay, and paragraph 23 reflects inadmissible speculation, neither of \nwhich the Court may consider under Rule 56 .  See, e.g., Strickland v. Doe, 156 N.C. \nApp. 292, 295, 577 S.E.2d 124, 128 (2003) (“If an affidavit contains hearsay matters \nor statements not based on an affiant ’s personal knowledge, the court should not \nconsider those portions of the affidavit.  Similarly, if an affidavit sets forth facts that \nwould be inadmissible in evidence . . .  , such portions should be struck by the trial  \ncourt.” (citations omitted) ); see also, e.g. , S.C. Telcom ms. Grp. Holdings v. Miller \nPipeline LLC, 248 N.C. App. 243, 246, 788 S.E.2d 634, 637 (2016) (“Although a Rule \n56 affidavit need not state specifically it is based on personal knowledge, its content \nand context must show its material parts are founded on the affiant’s personal \nknowledge.” (quoting Hylton v. Koontz, 138 N.C. App. 629, 634, 532 S.E.2d 252, 256 \n(2000))).  The Court therefore shall grant the McDowells ’ Motion to Strike as to \nparagraphs 17, 18, 19, and 23 of the Gomez Affidavit  and not consider those \nparagraphs in connection with the Motions.9 \nB. Brasser/Gentner Motion  \n32. Brasser and Gentner argue that Caroline ’s undisputed statements during \nher telephone call to Jackson National —both as made to the Jackson National \nrepresentative who initially took her call and to Mitchell —constitute slander per se  \nand establish her liability for defamation as a matter of law.   (Brasser & Gentner’s \n \n9 In light of the Court’s ruling, t he Court declines  to consider the McDowells’ additional \ngrounds to strike the Affidavit.  The Court also concludes that, even if it were to consider the \nAffidavit, the Court’s summary judgment rulings herein would remain unchanged. \nBr. Supp. Aff irmative Claims 8.)  Brasse r and Gentner  further contend that \nCaroline’s statements are attributable to Chris  as a matter of law , rendering C hris \nand Caroline jointly and severally liable  on this claim .  (Brasser & Gent ner’s Br. \nSupp. Affirmative Claims 11.)   \n33. The McDowells argue in response that there is a genuine dispute as to the \nfalsity and defamatory nature of the statements, that the statements did not cause \nBrasser or Gentner injury, and that Caroline’s statements cannot be imputed to Chris \nunder North Carolina law.  (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Pls. Brasser & Gentner’s Summ. J. Mot. \nDefamation Claim 10, 17, 24 [hereinafter “Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Brasser & Gentner Mot. \nAffirmative Claims ”], ECF No. 1 14.1.)  The Court addresses the Bras ser/Gentner \nMotion first as to Caroline and then as to Chris. \n1. Caroline McDowell \n \n34. “In North Carolina, the term defamation applies to the two distinct torts of \nlibel and slander.”  Boyce & Isley, PLLC v. Cooper, 153 N.C. App. 25, 29, 568 S.E.2d \n893, 898 (2002).  As relevant here, “ [s]lander per se is an oral communication to a \nthird party which amounts to  . . . an allegation that impeaches the plaintiff in his \ntrade, business, or profession[.]”  Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \nIn an action for slander per se, “ malice and damages are deemed presumed by proof \nof publication, with no further evidence required as to any resulting injury.”  Id. \n35. To succeed on their Motion  against Caroline , Brasser and Gentner must \neach show that (1) Caroline “spoke base or defamatory words which tended to \nprejudice him in his reputation, office, trade, business or means of livelihood or hold \nhim up to disgrace, ridicule or contempt ;” (2) “the statement was false;” and (3) “the \nstatement was published or communi cated to and understood by a third person. ”  \nDonovan v. Fiumara, 114 N.C. App. 524, 532, 442 S.E.2d 572, 577 (1994) (emphasis \nomitted) (quoting West v. King’s Dept. Store, Inc., 321 N.C. 698, 703, 365 S.E.2d 621, \n624 (1988)).  “ When examining an allegedly defamatory statement, the court must \nview the words within their full context[.]”  Boyce & Isley PLLC, 153 N.C. App. at 31, \n568 S.E.2d at 899.  Further, “[w]ith respect to the issue of falsity ,” the Court must \n“ ‘overlook[ ] minor inaccuracies and focus[ ] on substantial truth.’  As such, ‘[m]inor \ninaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as the substance, the gist, the sting, of \nthe [slanderous] charge be justified.’ ”  Desmond v. News & Observer Publ’g Co., 375 \nN.C. 21, 67, 846 S.E.2d 647, 675 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \nMasson v. New Yorker Mag., Inc., 501 U.S. 496, 516–17 (1991)).10 \n36. Turning then to the evidence, it is undisputed that Caroline lied when she \ntold Jackson National that she was a for mer rFactr or Jackson National employee \nnamed Susan.  ( See Dep. Caroline 190:3 –11, 194:15– 195:4 (admitting that these \nstatements were untrue ).)  W hile deceptive, these false statements are about \n \n10 Desmond applied the “substantial truth” standard to a libel claim.  Although the Supreme \nCourt of North Carolina has not yet explicitly extended this same standard to slander claims, \nother jurisdictions have , and the Court believes the Supreme Court would likely do so if \npresented the opportunity .  See, e.g., Bruning v. Carroll Cmty. Sch. Dist. , No. C04-3091-\nMWB, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28718, at *45 (N.D. Iowa May 3, 2006) (applying the rule in a \nslander case and stating that “the Iowa Supreme Court has recognized substantial truth as \na defense in a defamation action”); Miles v. Ramsey, 31 F. Supp. 2d 869, 875 (D. Colo. 1998) \n(applying the rule to slander and stating that “ ‘[s]ubstantial truth’ is an affirmative defense \nto defamation in Colorado”); Porter v. Sw. Christian Coll ., 428 S.W.3d 377, 383 (Tex. App.  \n2014) (examining substantial truth of an allegedly slanderous statement “by considering \nwhether the allegedly defamatory statement was more damaging to the plaintiff's reputation \nin the mind of the average listener than a truthful statement would have been”).  \nCaroline, not Brasser and Gentner, and, as such, are neither slanderous nor \nprejudicial to either individual Plaintiff .  See, e.g ., Desmond, 375 N.C. at 41, 846 \nS.E.2d at 661 (requiring allegedly defamatory statement to be “of or concerning the \nplaintiff”).  \n37. Similarly, Caroline’s statements that rFactr was about to be seized by the \nIRS or was in trouble with the IRS were about rFactr—not Brasser and Gentner—\nand thus, even if false, do not permit the Court to conclude as a matter of law that \nthe statements “tend to disgrace and degrade [Brasser and Gentner] or hold [either] \nup to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule, or cause [either] to be shunned and  \navoided.”  Boyce & Isley PLLC, 153 N.C. App. at 30–31, 568 S.E.2d at 898–99 (citation \nomitted); see also, e.g ., Arnold v. Sharpe, 296 N.C. 533, 539, 251 S.E.2d 452, 456  \n(1979) (“In order for defamatory words to be actionable, they must refer to some \nascertained or ascertainable person and that person must be the  plaintiff.  If the \nwords used contain no reflection on any particular individual, no averment can make \nthem defamatory.”). \n38. In addition, the McDowells have offered evidence permitting a reasonable \nfactfinder to conclude that  at least Caroline’s statement that rFactr was in trouble \nwith the IRS was substantiall y true  because at the time of her call rFactr had \nsubstantial IRS debt, (rFactr Investor Update), it had failed to comply with its IRS \nrepayment plan, (Sept. 13, 2017 Text, ECF No. 94.19), and Brasser and Gentner were \nconsidering a distressed asset sale in an effort to settle the IRS claims, (Email Oct. 7, \n2017, ECF No. 94.7). \n39. As to Caroline’s alleged statements that are specific to Brasser and \nGentner—in particular, that rFactr’s owners were in financial trouble, (Dep. Mitchell \n16:3–6), rFactr’s CEO was under investigation for arson, ( Dep. Mitchell  16:8–9, \n17:19–18:1; Audio Recording Phone Call ), and rFactr’s owners had withdrawn their \nchildren from school and were leaving the country, ( Dep. Mitchell 16:9–11, 19:24–\n20:15)—the Court cannot conclude that the undisputed evidence of record establishes \nCaroline’s liability for defamation as a matter of law.   \n40. First, the alleged statement that Brasser and Gentner had removed their \nchildren from school and left the country, standing alone, does not disgrace, ridicule, \nor degrade either and thus  does not constitute slander per se.  Indeed, it is only by \nweaving Caroline’s statement together with “insinuations, innuendo, colloquium, and \nexplanatory circumstances” that Brasser and Gentner contend the statement is base \nand defamatory.  Nucor Corp. v. Prudential Equity Grp., LLC, 189 N.C. App. 731, \n736, 659 S.E.2d 483, 487 (2008) (requiring for slander per se that the allegedly \ndefamatory statement be “ stripped of all insinuations, innuendo, colloquium and \nexplanatory circumstances” and “construed only in the context . . . in which they are \nconstrained”). \n41. In addition, the record evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to \nthe McDowells, permits a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Caroline’s alleged \nstatements concerning the individual Plaintiffs’ “financial trouble” and that rFactr’s \nCEO was under investigation for arson were substantially true when made.  To that \nend, the McDowells rely upon affidavit testimony from each individual Plaintiff that \ncould permit a reasonable jury to conclude that each had some degree of “financial \ntrouble.”  (See Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Brasser & Gentner Mot. Affirmative Claims  12; Aff. \nGentner ¶¶ 1 1–12, 35; Aff. Brasser ¶¶ 11 –12, 39.)  Similarly, t he McDowells offer \nevidence that the Charlotte Fire Department (“CFD”) had listed the Brasser fire \ninvestigation as “open and active” at the time of Caroline’s call , (CFD Investigation \nDetails, ECF No. 82.5), which the Court concludes is sufficient to avoid summary \njudgment on this aspect of Brasser and Gentner’s defamation claim.11  \n42. For each of these reasons, therefore, the Court concludes that Brasser and \nGentner’s Motion seeking summary judgment on th eir defamation claim against \nCaroline should be denied. \n2. Chris McDowell \n \n43. Brasser and Gentner further contend that Caroline’s statements should be \nimputed to Chris and that each should be held jointly and severally liable as a matter \nof law.  (Brasser & Gentner’s Br. Supp. Affirmative Claims 11.)  The Court disagrees.  \nWhile “[i]t is well settled that all who take part in the publication of a [defamatory \nstatement] or who procure or command [defamatory] matter to be published may be \nsued by the person def amed either jointly or severally [,]” Desmond v. News & \nObserver Publ’g. Co., 241 N.C. App. 10, 30, 772 S.E.2d 128, 143 (2015) , our case law \nmakes clear that to impute the defamatory statement of one to another requires some \n \n11 Defendants also rely on Caroline’s deposition testimony that a CFD investigator suggested \nto her that she should report Brasser’s alleged arson to Brasser’s insurance company to show \nthat Brasser was under investigation for arson.  (Dep. Caroline 2 52:23–253:8.)  This \ntestimony, which is offered for the truth of the investigator’s statement, constitutes \ninadmissible hearsay and will not be considered by the Court.   \naction by the latter to participate in the former’s statement, see, e.g., Taylor v. Kinston \nFree Press Co., 237 N.C. 551,  552–53, 75 S.E.2d 528, 529–30 (1953) (citing cases in \nwhich the defendant actively  and voluntarily  published the allegedly defamatory \nstatement).   \n44. This rule makes sense  because joint and several liability in tor t requires \nthat a defendant act in concert with another tortfeasor.  See, e.g., Bowen v. Iowa Nat’l \nMut. Ins. Co., 270 N.C. 486,  491–92, 155 S.E.2d 238, 242– 43 (1967) (“In the case of \njoint tort -feasors, although there is a single damage done, there are several \nwrongdoers.  The act inflicting injury may be single, but back of that, and essential \nto liability, lies some wrong done by each tort-feasor contributing in some way to the \nwrong complained of.”); White v. Keller, 242 N.C. 97, 100, 86 S.E. 2d 795, 797 (1955) \n(“Joint tort-feasors are those who act together in committing a wrong, or whose acts, \nif independent of each other, unite in causing a single injury.”). \n45. Brasser and Gentner argue that Chris engaged in the requisite action here \nby allowing his wife “unfettered access” to his emails and not preventing her from \noverhearing his confidential conversations ; in sum , that Chris “took no steps to \nprevent his wife from  . . . sharing false information [.]”  (Brasser & Gentner’s Br. \nSupp. A ffirmative Claims 12.)  Chris’s failure to act , they contend,  “caused and \nprocured the slanderous material that [Caroline] communicated to Jackson \nNational.”  (Brasser & Gentner’s Br. Supp. Affirmative Claims 12.)  The Court is not \npersuaded.  Chris has offered substantial evidence that he was unaware of Caroline’s \nplan to call Jackson National and did not otherwise knowingly participate in the \nmaking of her allegedly defamatory statements.  ( See Aff. Chris ¶¶ 22–23.)  Such \nevidence is enough to preclude the entry of summary judgment on this claim against \nChris.   \nC. Brasser/Gentner Counterclaim Motion \n46. The McDowells  assert three counterclaims against Brasser and Gentner: \n(i) breach of fiduciary duty, (ii) constructive fraud, and (iii) f raudulent \nmisrepresentation.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 119, 128, 137.)  The McDowells frame their claims \nas direct, rather than derivative, and contend that Brasser and Gentner owed them \na special duty under North Carolina law.  Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on each \ncounterclaim, contending that neither Chris nor Caroline has standing to assert the \ncounterclaims.  (Pls. Richard Brasser &  Greg Gentner’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J.  \nDefs.’ Countercls. 1 [hereinafter “Br. Supp. Brasser/Gent ner Countercl. Mot.”], ECF \nNo. 83.)  The Court addresses each Defendant’s standing in turn. \n1. Caroline McDowell \n47. Brasser and Gentner contend that Caroline lacks standing to assert her \ncounterclaims because she is not now nor has she ever been a shareholder of rFactr.  \n(Br. Supp. Brasser/Gentner Countercl. Mot. 4.)  The thrust of their argument is that \nthey cannot be liable for breach of fiduciary duty or constructive fraud because, as \nmajority shareholders, they owe no fiduciary duty to Caroline, a non-shareholder, nor \nfor fraud because Caroline did not purchase any Company shares  and thus neither \nrelied upon nor suffered injury from any of their allegedly fraudulent \nmisrepresentations. \n48. Caroline argues in response that she has standing to assert her claims both \nbecause she is and has been a shareholder and because, in any event, Brasser and \nGentner owed her a fiduciary duty  based on the “parties’ friendship and the \nconfidence reposed in Plaintiffs by the McDowells when choosing to invest in rFactr.”  \n(Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Pls.’ Summ. J. Mots. Countercls . 8 [hereinafter “Defs.’ Br. Opp’n \nBrasser/Gentner Countercl. Mot.”], ECF No. 109.) \n49. The North Carolina Business Corporation Act defines a “shareholder” as \n“the person in whose name shares are registered in the records of a corporation or the \nbeneficial owner of shares to the extent of the rights granted by a nominee certificate \non file with a corporation.”  N.C.G.S § 55 -1-40(22).  Here, it is undisputed that \nCaroline has never appeared as a shareholder on the books of either Targeted Group \nor rFactr and that the Company has no nominee certificate on file showing that \nCaroline is the beneficial owner of any Company shares.  (Aff. Brasser ¶ 38. )  It  is \nalso undisputed that the stock certificate Targeted Group issued for the shares at \nissue clearly identifies Chris, not Caroline, as the owner of the shares.  ( TGI \nCertificate.)  Similarly, when Targeted Group was rebranded as rFactr, the Company \nissued rFactr shares to Chris, not Caroline.  (rFactr Certificate.)   \n50. Caroline argues that the Company’s failure to include her name on the stock \ncertificate for the shares at issue is not dispositive , and she offers evidence showing \nthat she and Chris intended for each investment in rFactr to be jointly held and that \nthe funds for each investment were paid from their joint account.  ( Defs.’ Br. Opp’n \nBrasser/Gentner Countercl. Mot. 8; Aff. Chris ¶¶ 3–4.)  She also relies on Brasser’s \nstatements to Chris that “you and Caroline will be really happy with this investment” \nand “you guys will be psyched” as establishing that Brasser “explicitly acknowledged \nthat the McDowells’ investment was jointly-held.”  (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Brasser/Gentner \nCountercl. Mot. 7; Dep. Chris 323:3–13.)  Caroline contends this showing is sufficient \nto avoid summary judgment for lack of standing.  The Court disagrees.  \n51. While it is true that “issuance or possession of [stock] certificates is not \ndispositive of one’s rights or standing as a stockholder[,]” Sessions v. Five “C’s,” Inc., \nNo. COA10-1426, 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS 1217, at *6 (N.C. Ct. App. June 21, 2011), \nand thus that the issuance of the stock certificates in Chris’s name alone “constitutes \nonly prima facie evidence of the ownership ” of those shares,  Meisenheimer v. \nAlexander, 162 N.C. 226, 235, 78 S.E. 161, 164 (1913), Caroline offers no evidence \nthat she was ever registered in the Company’s records as the direct or beneficial \nowner of the Company’s shares.  Nor does she point to any corporate resolution or \nother action authorizing that shares be issued in her name, offer evidence suggesting \nthat she or Chris directed the Company to issue the shares in both of their names, or \notherwise put the Company on notice of their intention to jointly hol d the shares .  \nSimilarly, she offers no evidence that she or  Chris ever took any action to correct or \nchange the stock certificates reflecting that Chris was the sole owner of the shares  \nafter the shares were issued.   \n52. In short, Caroline offers no evidence to support her claim other than her and \nChris’s current testimony stating that joint ownership was their intention at the time \nof purchase.  That she and Chris intended to jointly own the shares at issue, however, \ndoes not, without more, mean that they did so.  Similarly, Brasser’s statements do \nnot permit a reasonable jury to conclude either that Caroline was a shareholder of \nthe Company or even that the Company knew that the McDowells intended the \ninvestment to be  jointly held.  The Court therefore concludes on this record that \nDefendants have failed to bring forward evidence upon which a reasonable factfinder \ncould conclude that Caroline was ever a shareholder in the Company.   \n53. Caroline further argues that even if  she is not a shareholder, Brasser and \nGentner “owed [her] a fiduciary duty to act in her best interests with respect to the \ninvestments of the McDowells’ funds.”  (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n Brasser/Gentner Countercl. \nMot. 8.)   Again, t he Court disagrees.   “ North Carolina recognizes two types of \nfiduciary relationships: de jure, or those imposed by operation of law, and de facto, or \nthose arising from the particular facts and circumstances constituting and \nsurrounding the relationship. ”  Hager v. Smithfield E. Health Holdings, LLC, 264 \nN.C. App. 350, 355, 826 S.E.2d 567, 571, disc. review denied, 373 N.C. 253, 835 S.E.2d \n446 (2019).  Caroline  offers no evidence or argument to contend she stands in a de \njure fiduciary relationship with Brassser and Gentner; rat her, she claims a de facto  \nfiduciary relationship arising from the parties’ relationship.  ( Defs.’ Br. Opp’n \nBrasser/Gentner Countercl. Mot. 8–9.) \n54. Under North Carolina law, “ [a] [de facto] fiduciary relationship may arise \nwhere ‘there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good \nconscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the \none reposing confidence.’ ”  Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 141, 749 S.E.2d 262, 268 \n(2013) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, \n651, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001) ).  However, “[t]he standard for finding a de facto  \nfiduciary relationship is a demanding one: ‘[o]nly when one p arty figuratively holds \nall the cards . . . have North Carolina courts found that the special circumstance of a \nfiduciary relationship has arisen.’ ”  Hager, 264 N.C. App. at 356, 826 S.E.2d at  572 \n(quoting Lockerman v. S. River Elec. Membership Corp., 250 N.C. App. 631, 636, 794 \nS.E.2d 346, 352 (2016)).  “D etermining whether a fiduciary relationship exists \nrequires looking at the particular facts and circumstances of a given case.”  Highland \nPaving Co. v. First Bank , 227 N.C. App. 36, 42, 742 S.E.2d 287, 292 (2013)  (citation \nomitted). \n55. To show a fiduciary relationship here, Caroline cites evidence that the \nMcDowells had been friends with Brasser and Gentner for years and that they relied \non Brasser’s representations re garding rFactr when they decided to invest in the \nCompany.  (See, e.g., Aff. Chris ¶¶ 5, 7, 9; Aff. Caroline McDowell ¶¶ 5–6, ECF No. \n105.)  Evidence of friendship and general reliance, however, falls far short of showing \nthat Brasser and Gentner “figuratively h[eld] all the cards”  in her relationship with \nthem.  See, e.g., Painter v. Doe, No. 3:15-cv-00369-MOC-DCK2016, U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n119958, at *25 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 6, 2016) ( holding under North Carolina law that \n“[t]here simply is no case law that would support imposition of such a [fiduciary] \nrelationship based on a friendship or even an intimate friendship ”).  This is \nparticularly so here, where there is no evidence that Chris or Caroline were pressured \nto invest funds in the Company , were denied the opportunity to conduct necessary \ndue diligence prior to the investment, or were otherwise engaged in something other \nthan an arm’s length transaction with Targeted Group or rFactr.  As such, the Court \nconcludes that the undisputed facts of record establish as a matter of law that neither \nBrasser nor Gentner owed Caroline a fiduciary duty during the period at issue in this \nlitigation.   \n56. Having concluded that Caroline was neither a shareholder of Targeted \nGroup or rFactr nor one to whom Brasser and Gentner owed a fiduciary duty, the \nCourt concludes that Caroline lacks standing to bring  her counterclaims  against \nthese Plaintiffs.  Caroline’s counterclaims against Brasser and Gentner for breach of \nfiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and fraudulent misrepresentation shall therefore \nbe dismissed. \n2. Chris McDowell \n57. Brasser and Gentner contend that Chris’s claims belong to the Company \nand thus are derivative, not direct, requiring dismissal.  Under North Carolina law, \n“[t]he well -established general rule is that shareholders cannot pursue individual \ncauses of action against third parties for wrongs or injuries to the corporation that \nresult in the diminution or destruction of the value of their stock.”  Barger v. McCoy \nHillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 658, 488 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1997).  As applied here, this \ngeneral rule would require dismissal of Chris’s purported claims because they arise \nfrom his investment loss and would appear “  ‘identical to the injury suffered by’ the \ncorporate entity as a whole.”  Green , 367 N.C. at 144, 749 S.E.2d at  269 (quoting \nEnergy Invs. Fund, L.P. v. Metric Constructors, Inc. , 351 N.C. 331, 336, 525 S.E.2d \n441, 444 (2000)). \n58. However, “[t] here are two major, often overlapping, exceptions ” to the \ngeneral rule that a shareholder cannot sue for injuries to the corporation: “(1) where \nthere is a special duty, such as a contractual duty, between the wrongdoer and the \nshareholder, and (2) where the shareholder suffered an injury separate and distinct \nfrom that suffered by other shareholders.”  Barger, 346 N.C. at 658, 488 S.E.2d at 219 \n(citation omitted).  Of particular relevance to this case, both a special duty and a \nseparate and distinct injury have been found where a corporate actor’s fraudulent \nmisrepresentations induced the plaintiff to purchase the corporation’s shares.  See, \ne.g., id. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 220 (“A special duty  . . . has been found when the \nwrongful actions of a party induced an individual to become a shareholder[.]”); \nNewton v. Barth, 248 N.C. App. 331, 340, 788 S.E.2d 653, 661 (2016) (holding a direct \naction may lie where a plaintiff “never would have suffered any injury if they had not \nbeen fraudulently induced” into making the investment) ; see also , e.g.,  Howell v. \nFisher, 49 N.C. App. 488, 498, 272 S.E.2d 19, 26 (1980) (“ [A] corporation is not a \nnecessary party when stockholders seek damages in their own right for negligent \nmisrepresentations made to them before they were stockholders for the purpose of \ninducing their investment.”). \n59. Here, Chris offers evidence to support his claims for breach of fiduciary duty, \nconstructive fraud, and fraudulent misrepresentation that would permit a reasonable \nfactfinder to conclude that he would never have initially invested in the Company \nhad he known that Brasser’s representation that Amway  was a customer was false, \n(Dep. Chris 53:22–55:8; Aff. Chris ¶¶ 6–7), or made a second investment had Brasser \nrevealed the Company’s substantial tax liabilities  and been truthful concerning the \nCompany’s financial situation in response to Chris’s direct q uestions, (Aff. Chris ¶¶ \n10–11).  Accordingly, Chris has offered sufficient evidence to show both that Brasser \nwrongfully induced him to invest in the Company, thereby creating a special duty  \nunder Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 220, and that but for Brasser’s \ninducement, he “never would have suffered any injury [,]” Newton, 248 N.C. App. at \n340, 788 S.E.2d  at 661 (emphasis omitted), permitting a reasonable factfinder to \nconclude that he suffered an injury “separate and distinct from that suffered by other \nshareholders[,]” Barger, 346 N.C. at 658, 488 S.E.2d at 219 (citation omitted).   \n60. As a result, the Court concludes that Brasser and Gentner’s motion seeking \ndismissal of Chris’s claims for lack of standing should be denied.  See Norman v. Nash \nJohnson & Sons’ Farms, Inc., 140 N.C. App. 390, 397, 537 S.E.2d 248, 254  (2000) \n(recognizing a direct action exists “to recover damages from an ‘insider’ or other party \nwho induced him to buy or sell shares in the corporation either by actual \nmisrepresentations or by failing to disclose pertinent information about the corporate \naffairs in breach of a fiduciary obligation” (citations omitted)).   \nD. rFactr Motion \n1. For Judgment on rFactr’s Claims \n61. rFactr argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on each of its claims.  \n(Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot. 1.)  The Court considers each claim in turn. \ni.

A claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage exists \nwhere a party “interferes with a business relationship ‘by maliciously inducing a \nperson not to enter into a contract with a third person, which he would have entered \ninto but for the interference, . . . if damage proximately ensues, when this interference \nis done not in the legitimate exercise of the interfering person’s rights.’ ” Beverage \nSys. of the Carolinas, LLC v. Associated Bev erage Repair, LLC, 368 N.C. 693, 701, \n784 S.E.2d 457, 463 (2016) (quoting Spartan Equip. Co. v. Air Placement Equip. Co., \n263 N.C. 549, 559, 140 S.E.2d 3, 11 (1965)).   \n63. rFactr argues that summary judgment should be entered on  this claim \nbecause it is undisputed that Caroline’s statements to Jackson National ca used it to \n“change course and refrain from entering a contract with rFactr that it otherwise \nwould have.”  (Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot. 8.)  The only evidence rFactr offers in support, \nhowever, are the stricken paragraphs of the Gomez Affidavit.  (See Mem. Supp. rFactr \nMot. 8.)  Separately , the McDowells  have also offered evidence from which a \nreasonable factfinder could conclude that Jackson National terminated negotiations \nwith rFactr for reasons other than Caroline’s call, including rFactr’s substantial tax \nliabilities, which were a matter of public record.   (See Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. by \nrFactr 6, 9 [hereinafter “Br. Opp’n rFactr Mot.”], ECF No. 1 14.2; Oct. 27 Email; see \nalso Brasser & Gentner’s Br. Supp. Affirmative Claims  9 (admitting that “[a]n IRS \nlien is a public document”).)  For both of these reasons, therefore, the Court concludes \nthat summary judgment on this claim should be denied. \nii. Breach of Fiduciary Duty  \n \n64. rFactr also seeks summary judgment on its breach of fiduciary duty claim \nagainst Chris, its corporate director at all relevant times.  Chapter 57D of the North \nCarolina General Statutes provides that “an LLC’s managers and company officials \nowe fiduciary duties to the LLC to discharge their duties in good faith, with the care \nof an ordinary prudent person, and in the best interests of the LLC.”  Timbercreek \nLand & Timber Co.  v. Robbins, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 64, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. July \n28, 2017) (citing N.C.G.S. §  57D-3-21(b)).  rFactr contends that the undisputed \nevidence shows that because Chris allowed Caroline to access rFactr’s confidential \ninformation through “email [ ], conversations and business calls on  speaker phone,” \nhe acted in “complete disregard for hi s duty to act in good faith  . . . and in rFactr’s \nbest interests” as a matter of law.  (Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot. 10.)   \n65. Setting aside whether Chris’s alleged  inaction can establish a breach of \nfiduciary duty under North Carolina law, the parties offer conflicting evidence \nconcerning Chris’s knowledge of any conduct by Caroline that resulted in injury to \nrFactr.  First, it is undisputed that Chris gave Caroline access to his email account, \n(Dep. Chris 11:21–14:1; Dep. Caroline 146:17–21), and conducted conference calls by \nspeaker phone at his home within Caroline’s hearing, ( Dep. Chris 14:2 –15:4; Dep. \nCaroline 129:15–130:12), each of which permitted Caroline to learn rFactr’s \nconfidential information, (Dep. Chris 19:15–21:2; Dep. Caroline 129:5–130:12).  The \nMcDowells, however,  offer evidence that Caroline took measures that prevented \nChris from learning that she was secretly reading his work emails “with regularity[,]” \n(Dep. Caroline 139:1–142:13), including by marking those emails as “unread” after \nreading them, (Dep. Caroline 328:21–24).  Caroline also testified that she lied about \nher identity in the call to Jackson National so that Chris would not find out that she \nhad made the call.  (Dep. Caroline 192:11–193:12.)  For his part, Chris testified that \nhe was unaware of the extent of Caroline’s activity, including in connection with her \ncall to Jackson National, averring that he did not know the call took place until a \ncouple of months thereafter.  (Aff. Chris ¶¶ 22–23; Dep. Chris 185:10–22.)  Chris also \noffers evidence that Plaintiffs were aware that Caroline overheard Chris’s calls but \ndid not object or otherwise direct Chris to exclude Caroline from learning rFactr’s \nconfidential business information.  (Dep. Chris 11:21–14:22.)   \n66. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the McDowells, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs’ motion for entry of judgment on this claim should be denied. \niii. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices  \n67. rFactr seeks summary judgment on its Chapter 75 claim, contending that \nthe undisputed evidence shows that the McDowells engaged in unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices because Chris “conceal[ed] that he knew what [Caroline] did using \ninformation that he improperly gave her[,]” and Caroline “fabricat [ed] her identity \nand provid[ed] false information to Jackson [.]”  (Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot. 12.) 12  The \nCourt has already determined, however, that an issue of fact remains concerning \nChris’s knowledge of Caroline’s allegedly wrongful activities and whether Caroline ’s \nstatements to Jackson National were substantially true  and/or caused Jackson \nNational to terminate contract negotiations  with rFactr.  As a result, the Court \nconcludes that summary judgment is not properly entered for rFactr on its Chapter \n75 claim.\n13 \n2. Counterclaims \n68. rFactr argues that it is entitled to summary judgment dismissing each of \nthe McDowells’ counterclaims as a matter of law.  (Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot. 13.)   \ni. Breach of Contract \n69. rFactr contends that Chris’s breach of contract claim should be dismissed \nbecause the claim is “based on the incorrect assertion that he is the holder of a [n]ote \nissued by rFactr pursuant to a Note Agreement.”  ( Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot . 13; see  \nalso Answer ¶¶ 110–18.)  rFactr describes evidence suggesting that although Chris \nsent a $25,000 wire transfer  to rFactr, “he did not actually receive any such note or \n \n12 “To prevail on a claim of unfair and deceptive trade practices, a plaintiff must show: (1) \ndefendants committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice; (2) in or affecting commerce; and \n(3) that plaintiff was injured thereby.”  First Atl. Mgmt. Corp. v. Dunlea Realty Co., 131 N.C. \nApp. 242, 252, 507 S.E.2d 56, 63 (1998).  “[D]eliberate acts of deceit or bad faith do not have \nto be shown,” but rather that “the act possessed the tendency or capacity to mislead, or \ncreated the likelihood of deception.”  Boyd v. Drum, 129 N.C. App. 586, 593, 501 S.E.2d 91, \n97 (1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n \n13 In light of the Court’s rulings, the Court declines to consider the McDowells’ additional \narguments asserting that rFactr has failed to show proximate cause or damages as a matter \nof law.  (Br. Opp’n rFactr Mot. 21, 27.) \n \nloan documents, and does not have a certificat e from rFactr ‘of any sort .’ ”14  (Mem. \nSupp. rFactr Mot. 13 (citing Dep. Chris McDowell 238 :2–8).)  Thus, rFactr claims \nthere is no contract between Chris  and the Company, requiring dismissal of Chris’s \nclaim. \n70. Chris offers evidence in response that he loaned rFactr $25,000, (Aff. Chris \n¶ 4),15 and that a June 18, 2017 email from Gentner to Brasser, Chris, and other s \nshows that Chris had a contract with the Company for repayment with interest , \n(Email & Convertible Note Conversion Calculation, ECF No. 94.21 ; Defs.’ Br. Opp’n \nBrasser/Gentner Countercl. Mot. 15–16).  The email indicates that Gentner created  \na “Convertible Note Calculation Spreadsheet” and under the heading “rFactr \nConvertible Note Offering” lists Chris as the holder of a $25,000 convertible note \ncreated June 9, 2015 .  (Email & Convertible Note Conversion Calculation .)  The \nspreadsheet also includes a table calculating interest rates as of a September 1, 2017 \ndate of conversion.  (Email & Convertible Note Conversion Calculation.)  The Court \nconcludes that this evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue on Chris’s breach of \ncontract claim.  Summary judgment for rFactr must therefore be denied.16 \n \n14 The Court notes that rFactr failed to attach the cited pages of Chris’s deposition to its \nmotion or supporting brief and that the separate attachment it cites to does not include the \nreferenced pages. \n \n15 While rFactr bases its motion on Chris’s failure to offer written evidence of a loan, it is not \nclear whether rFactr disputes that Chris wired $25,000 to the Company with the expectation \nof repayment.  ( See Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot. 13.)  In contrast, Brasser and Gentner \nacknowledge that Chris’s wire of funds was a loan to the Company.  (Br. Supp. \nBrasser/Gentner Countercl. Mot. 2 (“Mr. McDowell made an additional loan of $25,000.00 to \nrFactr[.]”).)  \n \n16 As pleaded, the McDowells allege that rFactr breached a contract with Chris, not Caroline, \n(Compl. ¶¶ 111–17), but appear to bring the claim jointly as they allege they both incurred \nii. Shareholder Inspection \n71. rFactr seeks dismissal of the McDowells ’ claim for shareholder inspect ion \nunder N.C.G.S. § 55-16-01 because (i) Caroline is not a shareholder entitled to inspect \ncorporate records, and (ii) the McDowells received “all information they requested”  \nduring discovery,  thus mooting the claim.  ( Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot . 13.)  The \nMcDowells did not respond to rFactr’s Motion on this claim in their response brief or \nat the Hearing.  Where, as here, a party against whom summary judgment is sought \nfails to respond to the opposing party’s motion, “ summary judgment, if appropriate, \nshall be entered against him.”  N.C. R. Civ. Pro. 56(e); see also, e.g., G & S Bus. Servs., \nInc. v. Fast Fare, Inc., 94 N.C. App. 483, 486–87, 380 S.E.2d 792, 794 (1989) (affirming \nsummary judgment whe re the nonmovant failed to respond to the motion with \nsupporting materials).  The McDowells’ failure to respond in the circumstances here \nsuggests that they concede their inspection claim should be dismissed as moot.  In \nany event, the Court concludes, based  on the undisputed evidence of record, that \ndismissal on mootness grounds is proper as a matter of law.17   \n \ndamages from the alleged breach, (Compl. ¶ 118).  It is undisputed that Caroline did not enter \na contract with rFactr concerning Chris’s wire of $25,000, and Caroline is not alleged to have \nbeen a third-party beneficiary of Chris’s contract with rFactr.  (See Email & Convertible Note \nConversion Calculation.)  The Court therefore concludes that, to the extent Caroline asserts \na breach of contract claim against rFactr arising from Chris’s wire transfer, that claim should \nbe dismissed. \n \n17 The Court also notes that Caroli ne’s claim for shareholder inspection must fail for the \nseparate reason that, as discussed supra, she has failed to offer evidence show ing that she \nwas ever a shareholder of rFactr.  See N.C.G.S. § 55 -16-02 (providing for records that \n“shareholders” may inspect). \niii. Constructive Fraud \n72. rFactr’s Motion seeks dismissal of t he McDowells ’ claim for constructive \nfraud on the same lack of standing grounds argued by Brasser and Gentner in their \nCounterclaim Motion.  ( Mem. Supp. rFactr Mot.  13–16.)  The Court concludes that \nrFactr’s Motion raising the same contention should be treated in the same way and \nthus that the Motion should be granted as to Caroline’s claim and denied as to Chris’s \nclaim for the reasons previously discussed in resolving the Brasser/Gentner \nCounterclaim Motion. \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n73. WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing, the Court hereby ORDERS as \nfollows: \na. The McDowells’ Motion to Strike is GRANTED as to paragraphs 17, \n18, 19, and 2 3 of the Gomez Affidavit, and those paragraphs are \nhereby stricken from the Affidavit and shall not be considered on the \nMotions; \nb. The Brasser/Gentner Motion is  hereby DENIED, and Brasser and \nGentner’s defamation claim shall proceed to trial; \nc. The Brasser/Gentner Counterclaim Motion is GRANTED  as to \nCaroline’s counterclaims  for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive \nfraud, and fraudulent misrepresentation , and those claims are \nhereby DISMISSED with prejudice, and DENIED as to Chris’s \ncounterclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and \nfraudulent misrepresentation, and those counterclaims shall proceed \nto trial; \nd. The rFactr Motion is GRANTED as to Caroline’s breach of contract \nand constructive fraud counter claims, and the McDowells’ \nshareholder inspection counter claim, and those claims are \nDISMISSED with prejudice, and DENIED as to rFactr’s claims \nfor tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, \nbreach of fiduciary duty, and unfair and deceptive trade practices , \nand as to Chris’s counter claims for breach of contract  and \nconstructive fraud, and those claims shall proceed to trial. \nSO ORDERED, this the 8th day of December, 2020. \n \n     /s/ Louis A.
