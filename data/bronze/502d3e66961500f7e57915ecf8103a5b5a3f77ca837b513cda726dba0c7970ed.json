  "raw_text": "Epic Chophouse, LLC v. Morasso, 2019 NCBC 54. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nIREDELL COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n18 CVS 2372 \n \nEPIC CHOPHOUSE, LLC; \nRICHARD D. MACK; and LARRY \nSPONAUGLE, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nJAMES A. MORASSO; JAM \nRESTAURANT GROUP, INC.; \nCHILLFIRE GRILL, LLC; and \nWEBB CUSTOM KITCHEN, LLC, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR \nJUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \n \n \n1. This case arises out of a dispute between the members of Epic Chophouse, \nLLC (“Epic”), a North Carolina limited liability company that operates a restaurant \nby the same name.  Epic and two of its members, Richard Mack and Larry Sponaugle, \nallege that the third member, James Morasso, abandoned his duties as Epic’s general \nmanager and worked against Epic to benefit two other restaurants .  Due to those \nalleged bad acts, Mack and Sponaugle voted to oust Morasso from the business.  They, \nalong with Epic, then brought this suit against Morasso and t hree companies he \neither owns or manages. \n2. All four defendants filed this motion under Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(c)  of the \nNorth Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to narrow the claims against them.  \nFor the following reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part  the \nmotion.  \nDavid P. Parker, PLLC , by David P. Parker , for Plaintiff s Epic \nChophouse, LLC, Richard D. Mack, and Larry Sponaugle.  \n \nSellers, Ayers, Dortch & Lyons, P.A ., by Brett Dressler and Michelle \nMassingale Dressler, for Defendants James A. Morasso, JAM Restaurant \nGroup, Inc., Chillfire Grill, LLC, and Webb Custom Kitchen, LLC. \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion for judgment on the \npleadings.  The following factual summary is drawn from relevant allegations in the \ncomplaint.  (ECF No. 3 [“Compl.”].) \n4. The complaint does not provide much detail about Epic’s governance or the \nrestaurant it operates .  Originally developed as Hominy & Hogg  Concord, LLC in \n2009, the company  changed its name to Epic Chophouse, LLC about a year later.  \n(Compl. ¶ ¶ 3, 8, 10 .)  Mack, Sponaugle , and Morasso 1 were its founders  and only \nmembers.  (See Compl. ¶ 8.)  Shortly after Epic’s formation, the three entered into an \noperating agreement, which was later amended at least twice.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 8, 13.)   \n5. The operating agreement is not attached to the complaint, but Epic, Mack, \nand Sponaugle allege that it contains several provisions setting the bounds of the \nmembers’ authority.  Among other things, the operating agreement allegedly states \nthat Mack, Sponaugle , and Morasso  are “1/3 equal partners” ; that  any “major \ndecision” requires all three partners’ signatures and approval; and that “[n]o partner \nmay use the company  as leverage for any personal or other means without full \n                                            \n1 There is some confusion over whether Epic’s third member is Morasso or JAM Restaurant \nGroup, Inc. (“JAM”).  As one of their claims for relief, Epic, Mack, and Sponaugle  seek a \ndeclaratory judgment to resolve the confusion.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 86, 94.)  For ease of reference, \nand because Morasso is JAM’s registered agent and president, the Court refers to Epic’s third \nmember as “Morasso.”  (Compl. ¶ 5.)  \nconsent of the other two partners.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 9, 13.)  The agreement also designates \nMorasso as general manager with authority to handle the daily on-site operations at \nthe restaurant, such as maintaining food quality and working with customers .  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 9, 11, 12.)   \n6. Over the next four years, Morasso began to expand into other restaurants—\nin addition to being Epic’s general manager , he is the sole owner of  Webb Custom \nKitchen, LLC (“Webb”) and a manager at Chillfire Grill, LLC (“Chillfire”) .  (Compl. \n¶¶ 15, 20.)  According to the complaint , Morasso has used his position at  Epic to \nincrease Chillfire and Webb’s profitability while leaving Epic out to dry.  For example, \nwhen Morasso proposed switching Epic’s food vendor , neither Mack nor  Sponaugle \ngranted permission.  (Compl. ¶¶ 15, 16.)  Morasso secretly and unilaterally made the \nswitch anyway  in order to secure a volume discount for one or both of his other \nrestaurants.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 16, 17.)  Morasso later used Epic as leverage to secure \nother beneficial deals for Chillfire and Webb, including contracts for credit card \nmerchant accounts and payroll company charges.  (Compl. ¶ 23.)  As a result, Chillfire \nand Webb enjoy lower prices or costs at Epic’s expense.  (Compl. ¶¶ 18, 19, 24.)   \n7. In addition to using Epic as a bargaining chip, Morasso neglected his duties \nas its general manager.  (See Compl. ¶ 15.)  Morasso began spending most of his time \nat Chillfire and Webb, overseeing their social media outlets but not Epic’s, and \nencouraging Epic’s customers to patronize his other restaurants.  (Compl. ¶¶ 20, 22, \n25.)   Epic has had to hire an other general manager to perform Morasso’s duties.  \n(Compl. ¶ 21.)  \n8. Tensions boiled over during a September 2018 members’ meeting.  Mack \nand Sponaugle voted to remove Morasso for cause from his positions as member and \ngeneral manager of Epic.   (See Compl. ¶¶ 27, 28.)  They also voted to authorize a \nlawsuit against Morasso, both by waiving the 90-day notice required for Mack and \nSponaugle to bring a derivative action  on Epic’s behalf and by directing Epic to join \nlitigation on its own or jointly with Mack and Sponaugle.   (Compl. ¶  28.)  At the \nconclusion of the meeting, a  notice of trespass was issued forbidding Morasso from \nentering the premises, which he allegedly violated twice.  (Compl. ¶¶ 28–33.)   \n9. Epic, Mack, and Sponaugle brought this action  against Morasso,  JAM, \nChillfire, and Webb.  They claim that Morasso breached the operating agreement, \nbreached his fiduciary duty, committed trespass, tortious ly interfered with Epic’s \ncontracts, and committed unfair or deceptive trade practices.  They also seek a \ndeclaratory judgment establishing the identity of Epic’s members and the amount of \nMorasso’s buyout under the operating agreement.  Epic asserts each of these six \nclaims directly in its own right, and Mack and Sponaugle also assert the same claims \nindividually in their own right.  Finally, t he complaint includes a separate cause of \naction entitled “Derivative Action,” in which Mack and Sponaugle seek relief on Epic’s \nbehalf.   \n10. All four defendants jointly moved  to dismiss the individual claims of Mack \nand Sponaugle, the “Derivative Action” of Mack and Sponaugle, and the claim for  \ntortious interference with contract.  They filed their motion and a brief in support on \nJune 21, 2019.  (ECF Nos. 28–30.)  Epic, Mack, and Sponaugle did not respond within \nthe time allotted by Business Court Rule 7.6  and have not filed a response as of the \ndate of this Order and Opinion .  Accordingly, the Court considers and decides the \nmotion “as an uncontested motion” and elects to do so without a hearing .  (BCR 7.4, \n7.6.) \nII. \nANALYSIS \n11. Defendants dedicate the bulk of their brief to the claims of  Mack and \nSponaugle, arguing that they lack standing to bring suit either  individually in their \nown name  or derivatively on Epic’s behalf.2  (Mem. in Supp. 3 –6, ECF No. 30.)   \nStanding is “a threshold issue that must be addressed, and found to exist, before the \nmerits of the case are judicially resolved.”  Byron v. SYNCO Props., 813 S.E.2d 455, \n458 (N.C. Ct. App. 2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  The Court therefore \nbegins with standing before addressing a second issue, which concerns whether th e \ncomplaint sufficiently states a claim for tortious interference with contract.  (Mem. in \nSupp. 6–7.) \nA. Standing \n12. “One of the oldest and most basic powers of a corporation is the power to sue \nand be sued in its own name.”  Russell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina \nCorporation Law  § 3.03 (7th ed. 2018).  This power is inherent , a function of the \ncorporation’s status as a distinct legal entity that exists separate and apart from its \nshareholders.  See, e.g., Bd. of Transp. v. Martin, 296 N.C. 20, 28, 249 S.E.2d 390, 396 \n                                            \n2 This aspect of the motion is jurisdictional in nature, and the Court construes it as a motion \nunder Rule 12(b)(1), though the defendants did not cite that rule. \n(1978); Troy Lumber Co. v. Hunt , 251 N.C. 624, 112 S.E.2d 132 (1960).   The same \npower also inheres in a limited liability company, which is “an entity distinct from its \ninterest owners” and which  “has the same powers as an individual or a domestic \ncorporation to do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its business.”  \nN.C.G.S. §§ 57D-2-01(a); 57D-2-03. \n13. From this fundamental principle comes a nother: a n individual owner, \nwhether shareholder or LLC member, typically may not bring an action in his or her \nown name to enforce claims accruing to the company.  See Norman v. Nash Johnson \n& Sons’ Farms, Inc., 140 N.C. App. 390, 395, 537 S.E.2d 248, 253  (2000).  There are \ngood reasons for this.  One  is that “the duties, the breaches of which constitute the \nground of action, are duties to the corporation, considered as a legal entity, and not \nduties to any particular stockholder.”  Coble v. Beall, 130 N.C. 533, 536, 41 S.E. 793, \n794 (1902).  A second reason is that the harm to individual shareholders or members \nthrough diminution of the value of their stock or membership interest is derivative of \nthe broader injury to the company.  The i ndividuals are made whole when the \ncompany recovers.  See, e.g., Taha v. Engstrand, 987 F.2d 505, 507 (8th Cir. 1993); \nEmpire Life Ins. Co. v. Valdak Corp., 468 F.2d 330, 335 (5th Cir. 1972).  Leaving such \nclaims in the hands of the corporation or LLC therefore serves to limit the \nmultiplication of suits by individual owners and to respect its existence as a distinct \nlegal entity. \n14. In some circumstances, a shareholder or member may enforce a cause of \naction accruing to the company through a derivative action on the company’s behalf.  \nA derivative action is “one of the remedies which equity designed for those situations \nwhere the management through fraud, neglect of duty or other cause declines to take \nthe proper and necessary steps to assert the rights which the corporation has.”  \nAnderson v. Seascape at Holden Plantation, LLC, 241 N.C. App. 191, 204, 773 S.E.2d \n78, 87 (2015) (quoting Meyer v. Fleming, 327 U.S. 161, 167 (1946)) (emphasis omitted).  \nThe individual owner does not bring a derivative claim in his or her own name.   \nRather, the company remains the real party in interest.  See id.; N.C.G.S. § 57D-8-\n01(b) (derivative action by LLC member is one brought “in the right of an LLC”).  And \nany recovery from a derivative action flows to the company, not to the shareholder or \nmember bringing suit.  See Outen v. Mical, 118 N.C. App. 263, 266, 454 S.E.2d 883, \n885 (1995). \n15. Of course, i ndividual owners remain free to seek redress for  harms or \nwrongs that are peculiar to them.  This includes an action arising out of a special \nduty, such as a contractual  duty, between the wrongdoer and the individual or an \naction for personal injuries that are separate and distinct from the injuries sustained \nby the corporation or LLC.   See Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC , 371 N.C. 605, \n612, 821 S.E.2d 729, 734 (2018) ( citations and alterations omitted).   In these \ncircumstances, the shareholder or member may pursue an individual action even if \nthe corporation or LLC “also has a cause of action arising from the same wrong.”  \nBarger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks , 346 N.C. 650, 659, 488 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1997) .  \nThis, too, makes sense.  Any such action is one accruing to the individual, not to the \ncompany, and the company’s recovery for its own injuries would not make the \nindividual whole. \n16. These principles are settled and familiar.  Why retread them here?   The \nunusual posture of this case requires it.  Epic, an LLC, brought this action in its own \nname to pursue several claims against Morasso, its former general manager .  Mack \nand Sponaugle, as members of Epic, assert the exact same claims individually and in \ntheir own right.  And for good measure, Mack and Sponaugle also assert a standalone \nclaim labeled “Derivative Action,” which appears to be an effort to bring some or all \nof the claims on Epic’s behalf .  In short, this is  a direct action by the company, an \nindividual member action, and a derivative action all in one.  Something is amiss. \n17. To begin, t he “Derivative Action” is wholly out of place.  Because “the \ncorporation is the real party in interest, it follows that derivative actions are typically \nappropriate only when a corporation is unwilling or unable to litigate its claims for \nitself.”  Anderson, 241 N.C. App. at 204, 773 S.E.2d at 87.  That is not the case here.  \nEpic is a named plaintiff in this action, willingly li tigating all asserted claims for \nitself.  Thus, one of the essential preconditions of a derivative action is absent.3   \n                                            \n3 The opening brief cites the statutory preconditions contained in former section 57C-8-01(a), \nwhich stated in part that a derivative action was proper only if “the plaintiff does not have \nauthority to cause the limited liability company to sue in its own right.”  (Mem. in Supp. 3.)  \nSection 57C-8-01 was repealed some years ago .  The current statute simplifies a nd refines \nvarious preconditions for derivative actions, such as the demand requirement.  See N.C.G.S. \n§ 57D-8-01.  This statutory revision is not directly relevant for present purposes.  Here, the \nproblem with Mack and Sponaugle’s  derivative claim is even more fundamental, having to \ndo with the very nature of a derivative claim.  The purpose of a derivative claim is to permit \nthe member to assert a right or claim that the LLC has not assert ed.  In simple terms, the \nmember is allowed to step into the shoes of the LLC but only if the LLC isn’t already wearing \nthem.  \n18. Given their failure to file an opposition, Mack and Sponaugle have offered \nno reason to support their standing to pursue a derivative action either alongside or \nin lieu of Epic’s action.  And the Court perceives none.  There is no question that the \nasserted claims are claims accruing to Epic.  They involve, among other things, an \nalleged breach of Morasso ’s fiduciary duty to Epic, a trespass to its property, and \ninterference with its contracts.  All address duties owed to Epic and resulting injuries \nto it.  No party has suggested that Epic is incapable of fully and adequately litigating \nthese claims to com pletion, and the reasons that led equity to design the derivative \naction so long ago are simply not present here.   Allowing Mack and Sponaugle to \npursue identical claims on Epic’s behalf would only complicate matters, making it \nunclear who speaks for the company and potentially bringing into play remedies that \nwould otherwise be unavailable.  See N.C.G.S. § 57D-8-05 (addressing payment of \neach party’s expenses in derivative actions).   The Court therefore concludes that \nMack and Sponaugle lack standing to pu rsue a derivative action, and the claim \nentitled “Derivative Action” is dismissed without prejudice. \n19. Many of the individual claims are also  jurisdictionally deficient.  The \ncomplaint does not specify any separate and distinct injury to Mack and Sponaugle \nresulting from Morasso’s alleged breach of the operating agreement, breach of \nfiduciary duty, trespass, tortious interference with contract, or unfair or deceptive \ntrade practices.  In each case , they seek recovery based on financial harm to Epic, \nsuch as l ost profits, a reduced customer base, and other “damage to the business” \nfrom Morasso’s allegedly anticompetitive actions.  (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 42, 46, 58, 65, \n66, 70.)   These types of harms are plainly injuries to the company shared by all \nmembers proportionately.  At points, the complaint even concedes that Mack and \nSponaugle have been damaged in their capacit ies “as one third Members” of Epic.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 42, 50.)  \n20. Nor does the complaint allege a special duty.  One potential candidate would \nbe a f iduciary duty owed by Morasso to Mack and Sponaugle.   In general, though, \nmembers of an LLC  do not owe a fiduciary duty to one another or to the company, \nand managers owe a fiduciary duty only to the company.  See Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., \nL.L.C., 196 N.C. Ap p. 469, 473–74, 675 S.E.2d  133, 137 (2009).  The exceptions to \nthese rules—such as the duty that a controlling member may owe to other minority \nmembers—do not apply here.   As a result, the complaint does not include any \nallegations that Morasso, whether in his role as member or manager, owed a fiduciary \nduty to Epic’s other members.  \n21. Another potential candidate would be a contractual duty imposed by the \noperating agreement.  But the operating agreement is not attached to the complaint, \nand none of the allegations show that the operating agreement imposed a duty upon \nMorasso that was personal to Mack and Sponaugle as members.  The claim for breach \nof the operating agreement is premised on allegations that Morasso leveraged Epic \nfor his own benefit, abandoned his managerial duties, and generally failed  to act in \nEpic’s best interests.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 9, 42.)  As alleged, any duty that Morasso owed \nto Mack and Sponaugle was not personal to them  as members and “separate and \ndistinct from the duty” Morasso owed to Epic.  Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at \n220.   \n22. In sum, the complaint does not allege any special injury or special duty to \nsupport Mack and Sponaugle’s right to assert individual claims for breach of the \noperating agreement, breach of fiduciary  duty, trespass, tortious interference with \ncontract, or unfair or deceptive trade practices.  Therefore, these claims are dismissed \nwithout prejudice for lack of standing.  \n23. That leaves the claim for declaratory judgment.  This claim seeks to settle \ndisputes about who Epic’s members are and about the amount of any buyout of \nMorasso’s membership interest.  (See Compl. ¶ 94.)  Mack and Sponaugle bring this \nclaim in their capacities as parties to the operating agreement, seeking a declaration \nas to its interpretation .  (See Compl. ¶ 92.)  By statute, parties to a contract have \nstanding to seek this type of declaratory relief.  See N.C.G.S. § 1-254.  This right is \npersonal to Mack and Sponaugle and distinct from Epic’s own right, also as a party \nto the operating agreement, to seek declaratory relief.   The Court therefore d enies \nMorasso’s motion as to Mack and Sponaugle’s individual  claim for declaratory \njudgment. \nB. Tortious Interference with Contract \n24. Morasso separately argues that Epic’s claim for tortious interference with \ncontract should be dismissed under either Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c).  (Mot., ECF No. \n28.)  Because each defendant had already answered the complaint at the time t he \nmotion was filed, (ECF Nos. 12–14), it is untimely under Rule 12(b)(6).  Accordingly, \nthe Court applies the Rule 12(c) standard.  See New Friendship Used Clothing \nCollection, LLC v. Katz, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017) \n(“[A] post-answer Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may, if \nappropriate, be considered as a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings.”).   \n25. “A motion for judgment on the pleadings should not be granted unless the \nmovant clearly establishes that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and \nthat he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Carpenter v. Carpenter, 189 N.C. \nApp. 755, 7 61, 659 S.E.2d 762, 767 (2008).  “All well pleaded factual allegations in \nthe nonmoving party’s pleadings are taken as true and all contravening assertions in \nthe movant’s pleadings are taken as false.”  Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. 130, 137, \n209 S.E.2d 494, 499 (1974).  A Rule 12(c) motion “should be granted when a complaint \nfails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action  . . . .”  Robertson v. Boyd, 88 \nN.C. App. 437, 440, 363 S.E.2d 672, 675 (1988).  \n26. The complaint’s allegations in support of this claim are thin.  As stated, \nMorasso’s alleged wrongful acts include “[t]respass, changing food vendors, \nleveraging Epic’s volume, and other actions.”  (Compl. ¶ 65.)  Even under Rule 12(c)’s \nliberal standard, these threadbare allegations are inadequate. \n27. An essential element of any claim for tortious interference with contract is \nthe existence of a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third party .  See \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Kirkhart, 148 N.C. App. 572, 584 –85, 561 S.E.2d 276, 285 \n(2002).  Apart from the allegation that Morasso improperly switched  Epic’s food \nvendors, this element is absent.  The alleged trespass does not appear to involve any \ncontract at all;  the complaint states vaguely that Morasso caused a disturbance at \nthe restaurant while “many customers” were there.  (Compl. ¶  31.)  The allegations \nof leveraging do involve contracts but only to the extent that Morasso used Epic as a \nmeans to get better deals for Webb and Chillfire.  (Compl. ¶ 23.)  The complaint does \nnot allege that this improper leveraging interfered with Epic’s own contracts.  These \nallegations are inadequate to support a claim for tortious interference .  See, e.g. , \nGateway Mgmt. Servs. v. Carrbridge Berkshire Grp., Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 45, at \n*26 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 9, 2018).  \n28. Construed liberally, t he allegation that Morasso changed food vendors \nappears to concern a contract between Epic and a third -party vendor.  As alleged, \nthough, Morasso cannot be liable for interfering with that contract.  At the time, \nMorasso was Epic’s general manager.  (Compl. ¶ 9.)  Our courts have long held that \n“[a] party to a contract, including the party’s managing agent, cannot be liable for \nwrongful interference of the contract.”  Plasman v. Decca Furniture (USA), Inc., 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 80, at *41 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 21, 2016)  (quoting Palles v. Hatteras \nInv. Partners LLC, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 37, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 27, 2009)).  As \na matter of law, Morasso cannot be held liable for tortious interference with Epic’s \ncontract with a third-party food vendor.   \n29. The Court therefore grants Morasso’s Rule 12(c) motion as to Epic’s claim \nfor tortious interference with contract.  The claim is dismissed with prejudice. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n \n30. For all these reasons, the Court ORDERS as follows:  \na. The Court GRANTS the motion as to the “Derivative Action” brought by \nMack and Sponaugle.  This claim is DISMISSED without prejudice for \nlack of standing.  \nb. The Court GRANTS the motion as to Mack and Sponaugle’s individual \nclaims for breach of the operati ng agreement, breach of fiduciary duty, \ntrespass, tortious interference with contract, and unfair or deceptive \ntrade practices.  These claims are DISMISSED without prejudice  for \nlack of standing. \nc. The Court DENIES the motion as to Mack and Sponaugle’s indiv idual \nclaims for declaratory judgment. \nd. The Court GRANTS the motion as to Epic’s claim for tortious \ninterference with contract.  The claim is DISMISSED with prejudice. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 3rd day of September, 2019. \n /s/ Adam M.
