In this Order, the Court refers to these two defendants collectively \nas the “Mullen Defendants.”     \n 2\n(a) DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to its claim for breach of \ncontract; \n(b) GRANTS Mullen’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Plaintiff’s claim for breach \nof contract; \n(c) DENIES the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s claim \nunder the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (“UDTPA”); \n(d) GRANTS Mullen’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Other Relief \nRegarding Damages for “Diminution in Business Value” and also GRANTS Mullen’s separate \nmotion to exclude any expert testimony as to this issue; \n(e) DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to Submit Additional Materials in Opposition \nto Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Other Relief Regarding Damages for \n“Diminution in Business Value;” and \n(f) DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Proposed but \nUnasserted Defense. \nI. \n \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \n{4} Plaintiff Media Network, Inc. d/b/a Gateway Media (“Gate way”) filed the Complaint in \n05 CVS 7255 on 15 April 2005 and the Complaint in 05 CVS 15428 on 23 August 2005.2\n{5} Defendant Mullen Advertising, Inc. (“Mullen  Advertising”) answered the Complaint in \n05 CVS 7255 on 13 June 2005.  Mullen Advertising served an Amended Answer on 15 June \n2005. \n                                                 \n2 Among the many disputes between the parties in these cases is a disagreement as to the proper Mullen entity that \nshould be before the Court, which, in turn, resulted in Gateway filing two Complaints asserting essentially the same \nclaims.  Hereinafter, the Court will identify the pleadings as  “Compl. 7255” and “Compl. 15428.”  If the pleadings \nare referred to collectively, the Court will identify them as “Compls.”        \n 3\n{6} Defendant Long Haymes Carr, Inc. d/b/a/  Mullen LHC answered the Complaint in 05 \nCVS 15428 on 31 October 2005. \n{7} The cases were transferred to the North Ca rolina Business Court and assigned to me as \ncomplex business matters by order of the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court \ndated 3 February 2006. \n{8} The Complaints originally asserted claims against the Mullen Defendants for: (a) breach \nof contract, (b) misappropriation of trade secrets, (c) injunctive relief, (d) fraud, (e) negligent \nmisrepresentation, (f) tortious interference with contract, (g) trespass to chattels, (h) unfair and \ndeceptive trade practices, and (i) negligent supervision.  (Compl. 7255 ¶¶ 41-121; Compl. 15428 \n¶¶ 42-101.) \n{9} Subsequently, the parties stipulated to the en try of certain injunctive relief that resolved \nall claims except for those alleging breach of contract and unfair and deceptive trade practices.  \n(Consent Order and Inj. ¶¶ 1, 3, June 28, 2006.) \n{10} On 16 February 2006, Mullen Advertising fi led a motion and supporting brief seeking  \npartial summary judgment and other relief regarding damages for “diminution in business \nvalue.”  On 7 April 2006, Gateway filed its brief in opposition.  On 18 April 2006, the Mullen \nDefendants filed a reply brief as to this motion. \n{11} On 31 May 2006, Gateway filed a motion and supporting brief seeking summary \njudgment on its claims for breach of contract and unfair and deceptive trade practices, and a \nseparate motion and supporting brief seeking summary judgment as to a “proposed but \nunasserted defense.”  That same day, the Mullen Defendants filed a cross-motion and supporting \nbrief seeking summary judgment as to all claims. \n 4\n{12} On 23 June 2006, all parties filed opposition brie fs to the motions for summary judgment.  \nThe parties then filed reply briefs on 14 July 2006. \n{13} Finally, on 18 August 2006, Gateway filed a Motion for Leave to Submit Additional \nMaterials in Opposition to the Mullen Defendants’ pending Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment and Other Relief Regarding Damages for “Diminution in Business Value.”  The \nMullen Defendants filed a brief in opposition on 11 September 2006, and Gateway filed its reply \non 21 September 2006.3\n{14} The Court heard the parties’ oral argu ments on the various motions on 16 May and 8 \nAugust 2006. \nII. \nTHE FACTS \nA. \n \nTHE PARTIES \n \n{15} Gateway is a Delaware cor poration authorized to do business in North Carolina.  \n(Compls. ¶ 1.) \n{16} Mullen Advertising is a Massachusetts corp oration authorized to do business in North \nCarolina.  (Compl. 7255 ¶ 2.) \n{17} Long Haymes Carr, Inc. is a North Carolina corporation, with its  principal place of \nbusiness in Winston Salem, North Carolina.  (Compl. 15428 ¶ 2; Paul Slack Aff. ¶ 3.) \n                                                 \n3 Rule 15.8 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure for the North Carolina Business Court emphasizes that \n“[t]he Court favors concise briefs.”  BCR 15.8.  The briefing on the pending motions has been anything but concise, \nas the parties have deluged the Court with 13 briefs, totaling 245 pages, and seven binders of deposition testimony \nand supporting exhibits.  Several witnesses also felt compelled to file multiple affidavits in addition to their \ndeposition testimony; one witness, Brad Heard, filed three affidavits.  The Court accepts some blame for this \navalanche of paper because it allowed the parties to slice up the summary judgment pie by filing motions on discrete \nsub-issues.  Unfortunately, the Court’s reward for its largesse has been briefing (and oral argument) that, while  \nhelpful, has given true meaning to the law of diminishing marginal returns and delayed entry of the Court’s ruling.  I \ntake this opportunity to gently remind the bar that less is almost always best when it comes to the practice of law, \nand motions practice is no exception. \n 5\n{18} Mullen Advertising and Long Haymes Carr, In c. are subsidiaries of The Interpublic \nGroup (“IPG”), a New York corporation.  (Slack Aff. ¶ 2.) \n{19} Since on or about 2001, Long Haymes Carr, Inc. has done business in North Carolina \nunder the assumed name of Mullen/LHC.  (Slack Aff. ¶ 5.)  In or around 2004, Long Haymes \nCarr, Inc., filed documents in North Carolina to transact business as “Mullen.”  (Slack. Aff. ¶ 6.)  \nThe Court hereinafter refers to Defendant Long Haymes Carr, Inc. as “Mullen/LHC.” \n{20} Carl Haynes (“Haynes”) is a citizen and resi dent of North Carolina.  (Compl. 7255 ¶ 5.)  \nGateway alleges that, during all times relevant to these actions, Haynes was doing business as \nHigh Plains Business Consulting a/k/a High Plains Business a/k/a High Plains.4  (Compl. 7255 ¶ \n5).  At all times relevant to this action, Haynes also worked for Mullen/LHC as a Senior Vice \nPresident.  (Haynes Aff. ¶ 2, June 12, 2006.) \n{21} Haynes and Defendants Transit Ads Incorporat ed d/b/a Carteles, High Plains Business \nConsulting, and Carney Media, Inc., have all been dismissed from these actions. \nB. \nTHE CLAIMS \n{22} In addressing the competing motions for summary judgment, the Court has accepted the \nnon-moving party’s version of the facts, where supported in the record. \n{23} In these cases, Gateway alleges that one or both of the Mullen Defendants breached a \n“non-cancelable” contract in which Gateway was to provide services to the Mullen Defendants \nin connection with an advertising program for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (“RJRT”).  The \nMullen Defendants assert that the contract was cancelable on 60-days written notice and that a 2 \nFebruary 2005 letter from the Defendants to Gateway properly provided for termination effective \n4 April 2005. \n                                                 \n4 Gateway also named High Plains Business Consulting as a separate defendant in 05 CVS 7255. \n 6\n{24} The alleged contract between the parties centers around a cigarette advertising program \nfunded by RJRT in which “one-sheets” (described as poster-sized print advertisements) are \ndesigned and manufactured by an advertising agency for placement on a rotating basis in or \noutside convenience stores throughout the United States (hereinafter the “One-Sheet Program”).  \n(Compl. 7255 ¶ 6-7; Compl. 15428 ¶ 7-8; Dep. Ex. 193; Williard Dep. 13:15-19.) \n{25} Defendants admit that RJRT hired Mullen/ LHC to develop and manage the One-Sheet \nProgram.  (Defs.’ Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 27, May 31, 2006; Williard Dep. 21:16-\n22:10; Dep. Ex. 41.)  They deny that Mullen Advertising is liable for the claims at issue. \n{26} According to Gateway’s president, howeve r, there were many occasions where those \nwith whom he dealt with at Mullen/LHC (including, apparently, the switchboard operator) \nindicated that they worked for “Mullen Advertising” or “Mullen Advertising, Inc.”  (Brad Heard \nAff. ¶¶ 45-46, June 19, 2006.) \n{27} Mullen/LHC has managed the One-Sheet Pr ogram for over 12 years.  (Sterling Dep. \n18:16-24; Williard Dep. 17:5-11.)  In its role as manager, Mullen/LHC selected the “one-sheet” \nvendors, who then “posted” the advertising materials in specified geographic locations.  (Dep. \nEx. 29.) \n{28} As a Senior Vice-President for Mullen/LHC,  Haynes’s duties included the administration \nof the One-Sheet Program.  (Haynes Aff. ¶ 2, May 26, 2006; Slack Dep. 65:14-22.) \n{29} From approximately 1999 through 2002, non-pa rty Gateway Outdoor Advertising, Inc. \nserved as a vendor for the One-Sheet Program.  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶ 4, May 30, 2006; Craig \nHeard Dep. 44:17-45:16.) \n{30} In 2002, Gateway was spun-off from Gateway Outdoor Advertising, Inc. and took over as \none of four vendors for the One-Sheet Program.  (Craig Heard Aff. ¶¶ 1, 4-5, Apr. 5, 2006; Brad \n 7\nHeard Dep. 22:11-14.)  At the request of its lender, Gateway Outdoor Advertising, Inc. formed \nthis separate entity to facilitate loans for the funding of capital investments in the One-Sheet \nProgram.  (Craig Heard. Aff. I ¶ 5.)5\n{31} From 2002 through its termination by Mulle n/LHC in 2005, Gateway’s primary (if not \nexclusive) source of revenue was as a vendor for the One-Sheet Program.  (Compl. 7255 ¶ 22; \nCompl. 15428 ¶ 23; Whitt Aff. Ex. A; Brad Heard Aff. ¶ 14, Apr. 5, 2006; Craig Heard Dep. \n153:22-154:5.)6\n{32}  As a condition of obtaining the vendor contract for the One-Sheet Program, and allegedly \nunbeknownst to Mullen/LHC and RJRT, Haynes solicited and received over $750,000.00 in \n“consulting fees” from Gateway and its predecessor Gateway Outdoor Advertising, Inc.  (Compl. \n7255 ¶¶ 10-13; Compl. 15428 ¶¶ 11-14.)7\n{33} For its services as manager of the One-Sheet Program, Mullen/LHC received a per-sheet \nmonthly fee of $85.00.  (Compl. 7255 ¶ 17; Compl. 15428 ¶ 18.)  Mullen/LHC paid Gateway \n85% of the fee (or $72.25 per sheet) for its work in implementing the program.  (Compl. 7255 ¶¶ \n16-17; Compl. 15428 ¶¶ 17-18.) \n                                                 \n5 The other vendors were Defendants Carteles and Carney, and non-party Interstate Outdoor Advertising, L.P.  (Dep. \nExs. 193-94.) \n6 The one-sheet vendors were discouraged, if not expressly prohibited, from soliciting anti-tobacco or other \ncompetitive business.  (Sterling Dep. 178:10-182:7, 199:14-200:1.) \n7 Mullen/LHC characterizes the payments as commercial bribes, while Gateway insists that the payments were \nlegitimate fees for actual consulting services rendered by Haynes.  While it appears that Mullen/LHC’s \ncharacterization may be more accurate, the Court declines to resolve this issue here.  I include the background facts \nmerely because they provide the context for Mullen/LHC’s subsequent actions.  And to be fair to Haynes, the record \nin this case is replete with instances of other Mullen/LHC employees falling over themselves to scoop up “freebies” \nfrom one-sheet vendors and others soliciting Mullen/LHC’s advertising business, some of which violate the spirit, if \nnot the letter, of Mullen/LHC’s policy regarding acceptance of such items.  For example, Mullen/LHC employees \nroutinely solicited or accepted tickets to various high-profile professional sporting and entertainment events, \nincluding, in the case of one Mullen/LHC senior executive, $4,000.00 in tickets to the 2004 American League \nbaseball playoffs and World Series, and airfare, accommodations, meals, and venue tickets for the 2004 Summer \nOlympic Games in Athens, Greece.  (Dep. Exs. 5-8; Trosan Dep. 101:4-22, 133:12-22, 136:10-137:14, 182:19-\n186:20.) \n 8\n{34} Gateway implemented the One-Sheet Progr am upon receipt of so-called “insertion \norders.”  (Sterling Aff. Exs. A, B.)  The insertion orders are form documents that provided \nGateway with specific details regarding implementation of the One-Sheet Program in monthly \nintervals over the course of the contract year, including the convenience store locations to be \nserved, the number of “one-sheet” advertisements to be posted, the “issue” months for the \nparticular postings, and the total fee that Gateway would be paid for that order.  (Sterling Aff. \nExs. A, B.) \n{35} The “terms and conditions” portion of the insertion orders also provided that (a) \nMullen/LHC could “cancel this contract, with no obligation of payment or penalty . . . upon \nwritten notice to the [vendor] at least sixty (60) days, including Sundays and holidays, in \nadvance of any scheduled posting date;” and (b) the “contract contains the entire understanding \nbetween the parties and cannot be changed or terminated orally.”  (Sterling Aff. Ex. A.) \n{36}   In 2002 and 2003, the partie s performed the One-Sheet Program under contracts that \nallowed Mullen/LHC to cancel any uncompleted one-sheet postings pursuant to the 60-day \nnotice provision.  (Compl. 7255 ¶ 17; Compl. 15428 ¶ 18.) \n{37} In 2004, however, Mullen/LHC and RJRT negotiated a reduced gross monthly fee of \n$74.00 per sheet, which, in turn, resulted in a $62.90 per sheet fee to the vendors.  (Compl. 7255 \n¶ 18; Compl. 15428 ¶ 19.)  To induce the vendors to accept the reduced rate, Mullen/LHC (with \nRJRT’s consent) agreed that the vendor contracts for 2004 would be guaranteed for one year.  \n(Compl. 7255 ¶ 18; Compl. 15428 ¶ 19.)  Accordingly, without striking the form language \nregarding termination in the “terms and condition” portion of the insertion orders, the parties \nadded the following to the front page of the insertion orders for 2004: \nCONTRACTS ARE NON-CANCELABLE PER AGREEMENT WITH RJRT \nTO RECEIVE REDUCED SPACE RATE OF $74 GROSS PER UNIT PER  \n 9\nMONTH, FOR TRADITIONAL ONE-SHEETS . . . CONTRACTS WILL \nRUN THE TERM INDICATED. \n \n(Sterling Aff. Ex. A.)8\n \n{38} The parties performed the One-Sheet Program  without incident in 2004.  (Brad Heard \nAff. ¶ 14, May 30, 2006.) \n{39} On or about 5 October 2004, Haynes wrot e to Gateway and the other vendors to \nannounce a further reduction in the per-sheet fee for 2005 (hereinafter the “Haynes \nMemorandum”).  Specifically, Haynes told the vendors: \nAs we move forward toward issuance of RJRT one-sheet contracts for 2005 \nwe will be reducing the unit rate to $71 gross. \n \n. . . . \n \nThe $71 is predicated upon continuous contracts (non-cancelable) and \nsignificant volume to make the acceptance of our contracts worth your while. \n \n. . . . \n \nAs always, acceptance of the new pricing is your decision.  If you choose not \nto do so please let me know so we can plan accordingly. \n \n(Compls. Ex. 3.)  The Haynes Memorandum also explained that “our contracts specify the \nmarket in which we are placing one-sheets.”  (Compls. Ex. 3.) \n{40} In response, Gateway’s president, Brad Heard, wrote Haynes via e-mail that, “We are \ncertainly on board at the new rate.  We appreciate the business you have given us and look \nforward to 2005.”  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶ 18, May 30, 2006; Dep. Ex. 178.) \n{41} Sometime in November 2004, Mullen/LHC sent Gateway the insertion orders for 2005, \nwhich denoted the new $71.00 per-sheet gross fee.  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 22-23, May 30, 2006; \nBrad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 38, 44, June 19, 2006.)  Unlike the 2004 insertion orders, however, the 2005 \n                                                 \n8 The “terms and conditions” portion of the insertion orders resolved the inconsistency in the contract language by \nnoting that “[w]hen there is any inconsistency between these standard conditions and a provision on the face hereof, \nthe latter shall govern.”  (Sterling Aff. Ex. A.) \n 10\norders did not state expressly that they were non-cancelable.  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 22-23, May \n30, 2006; Brad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 38, 44, June 19, 2006.)  Rather, the documents contained the form \nlanguage used in earlier contract years allowing Mullen/LHC to cancel on 60-days notice.  (Brad \nHeard Aff. ¶¶ 22-23, May 30, 2006; Brad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 38, 44, June 19, 2006.) \n{42} When Brad Heard received the 2005 inserti on orders in early November 2004, he noticed \nthe omission and called Haynes, who assured him that this was an inadvertent error and that the \nreduced rate was based on a guaranteed one-year term.  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶ 38, June 19, 2006; \nBrad Heard Dep. 156:9-158:6, 160:5-17.) \n{43} In a series of e-mails in or around early February 2005, Haynes insisted that he had \npreviously confirmed the guaranteed term with his superior Carol Sterling.  (Haynes Aff. Exs. A-\nB, June 12, 2006.)  Mullen/LHC disputes this claim, insisting that Haynes had no authority to \nmake such a commitment because Mullen/LHC had not yet received approval from its client \nRJRT.  (Sterling Aff. ¶¶ 8-9; Slack Dep. 257:12-15; Troutman Dep. 207:7-25, 218:20-219:6.)  \nHaynes has since retracted his earlier e-mails, stating that although he “expected that the \nvendors’ 2005 contracts would be ‘non-cancelable’ . . . [Gateway knew that he] did not have \nauthority to provide contracts until all terms had been approved by [RJRT].”  (Haynes Aff. ¶ 7, \nMay 26, 2006.) \n{44} Regardless, on 8 December 2004, JoAn Williard , who served as Media Director for \nRJRT, notified Sterling of RJRT’s preliminary approval of one-year guaranteed contracts for the \n2005 One-Sheet Program.  (Dep. Ex. 21.)  A few days later, Williard received final approval for \nthis commitment, which she then communicated to Sterling by telephone.  (Williard Dep. \n337:13-25.)  Sterling claims to have no recollection of this conversation, however, and there is \nno evidence that Gateway was told of RJRT’s action. \n 11\n{45} Instead, following Heard’s conversation w ith Haynes in early November 2004, Heard \nsigned one or more of the 2005 insertion orders (containing the 60-day cancellation term), and \nGateway subsequently began performing in late December 2004 by, among other things, \nborrowing funds to implement the 2005 One-Sheet Program, purchasing equipment and other \nnecessary supplies, leasing space from convenience store operators, and convening operational \nmeetings with its management, employees, and subcontractors.  (Compl. 7255 ¶ 25; Compl. \n15428 ¶ 26; Brad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 51-55, June 19, 2006; Brad Heard Dep. 160:18-22.)\n9\n{46} In March 2004, IPG retained an outside acc ounting firm to investigate the “consulting \nfees” paid by Gateway to Haynes.  (Slack Dep. 27:18-28:12, 59:6-13; Battson Dep. 16:15-20.)  \nThe nearly year-long investigation confirmed that the payments had been made, and \nMullen/LHC concluded that they violated the company’s internal ethics rules.  (Battson Dep. \n20:18-24; Dep. Exs. 118, 340.)10  As a result, Mullen/LHC suspended Haynes in December \n2004, and then fired him in January 2005.  (Haynes Aff. ¶ 2, May 26, 2006; Haynes Aff. ¶ 2, \nJune 12, 2006; Ambrosio Aff. ¶¶ 3-4.) \n{47} On 2 February 2005, Mullen/LHC, at RJRT’s insistence, terminated Gateway as a one-\nsheet vendor pursuant to the 60-day termination provision in the 2005 insertion orders.  (Compls. \nEx. 4; Slack Dep. 236:10-20; Williard Dep. 85:23-86:22, 88:21-25.)  Mullen/LHC’s notice \nreferred specifically to the investigation regarding the payments made to Haynes as a basis for \nthe termination.  (Compls. Ex. 4.) \n                                                 \n9 Sometime in early November 2004, Haynes and Sterling discussed the vendors’ concerns over the lack of express \nlanguage in the insertion orders guaranteeing a one-year term.  (Sterling Dep. 51:25-64:25.)  Sterling, however, did \nnot tell Gateway that Mullen/LHC had not approved non-cancelable contracts for 2005 before Gateway began \nperforming.  (Sterling Dep. 67:2-8.)   \n10 According to Gateway, Mullen/LHC knew of the allegedly illegal payments as early as March 2004 and certainly \nno later than August 2004, when it discovered documents on Haynes’s computer referencing the payments.  (Battson \nDep. 16:15-20, 61:7-62:17, 73:8-10, 88:6-15.)  Gateway also alleges that, despite this knowledge, Mullen/LHC \nallowed Haynes to continue negotiating contracts with the vendors for 2005.  (See Compl. 7255 ¶ 35.) \n 12\n{48} Following its termination, Gateway was unable to obtain any other business to mitigate \nits damages.  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶ 20, Apr. 5, 2006; Brad Heard Dep. 206:13-19.)  The reason, \naccording to Brad Heard, is that the advertising industry has two major buying cycles:  (a) during \nthe Fall for the upcoming year; and (b) in the first quarter of each year for Spring or Summer \npromotions.  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶ 16, Apr. 5, 2006.)  According to Heard, because Mullen/LHC, \nknowing that the one-sheet business was Gateway’s sole source of revenue, terminated Gateway \nin February 2005, Gateway “missed out on both major buying cycles for 2005 and had \nsignificantly reduced ability to find replacement business for 2005.”  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 19, 20, \nApr. 5, 2006.)  As a result, the company shut down its operation and folded its assets and \nobligations into Gateway Outdoor Advertising, Inc.  (Brad Heard Aff. ¶ 22, Apr. 5, 2006.)\n11\n{49} Gateway seeks to recover more than $3 milli on in profits allegedly lost in 2005 following \nits termination as a one-sheet vendor, as well as $14.472 million in damages arising from the \nalleged diminution in Gateway’s business value.  (Whitt Aff. Ex. A ¶ 64.) \n{50} According to Gateway’s damages expert, T. Randolph Whitt (“Whitt”), the \napproximately $14.5 million in “diminution in business value” damages is derived by \n“‘estimating what the value of Gateway’s business would have been at the end of 2005 had the \nMullen/RJRT business continued . . . \nor a level of business similar to the Mullen RJRT \nbusiness, compared to the actual estimated value of the business at the end of 2005 without the \nMullen/RJRT business.’”  (Whitt Aff. ¶ 8 (quoting Whitt Aff. Ex. A ¶ 40) (emphasis in \noriginal).) \n                                                 \n11 In its 2 February 2005 termination notice, Mullen/LHC also raised some performance issues regarding Gateway’s \none-sheet postings.  (Compls. Ex. 4.)  Ultimately, however, Gateway was paid in full for its work up to and \nincluding the date of its termination.  (Troutman Dep. 233:14-25; Dep. Ex. 101.)   \n 13\n{51} More specifically, Whitt arrived at this fi gure by projecting Gateway’s expected net cash \nflows for the years 2006-2010 and then discounting these amounts to present value using a 22% \ndiscount rate.  (Whitt Aff. Ex. A ¶¶ 46-49.) \n{52} Mullen/LHC, however, was not obligated to provide any one-sheet business to Gateway \nbeyond 2005.  (Brad Heard Dep. 225:14-20; Guldner Dep. 191:19-25.)    \nIII. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD  \n{53} Summary judgment should be granted if “the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of \nlaw.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2006). \n{54} The moving party bears the burden of showing a lack of triable issues of fact.  Pembee \nMfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co., 313 N.C. 488, 491, 329 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1985).  Once the \nmoving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must “produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating that the [nonmoving party] will be able to make out at least a prima facie case at \ntrial.”  Collingwood v. Gen. Elec. Real Estate Equities, Inc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, \n427 (1989). \n{55} When considering a motion for summary judgment, a trial court may not  resolve issues of \nfact and must deny the motion if there is a genuine issue as to any material fact.  Singleton v. \nStewart, 280 N.C. 460, 464, 186 S.E.2d 400, 403 (1972).  “An issue is material if the facts \nalleged would constitute or would irrevocably establish any material element of a claim or \n 14\ndefense.”  Anderson v. Canipe, 69 N.C. App. 534, 536, 317 S.E.2d 44, 46 (1984).  “An issue is \ngenuine if it may be maintained by substantial evidence.” Id. \n{56} In deciding the motion, “‘all inferences of fact  . . . must be drawn against the movant and \nin favor of the party opposing the motion.’”  Caldwell v. Deese, 288 N.C. 375, 378, 218 S.E.2d  \n379, 381 (1975) (quoting 6 James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 56.15[3] (2d ed. \n1971)). \n{57} Finally, summary judgment is  a drastic remedy that should be granted cautiously.  Where \nthe slightest doubt exists as to the merits of the motion, it should be denied.  First Fed. Sav. & \nLoan Ass’n v. Branch Banking & Trust Co., 282 N.C. 44, 51, 191 S.E.2d 683, 688 (1972); \nVolkman v. DP Assocs., 48 N.C. App. 155, 157, 268 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1980). \nB. \nPROPER PARTY DEFENDANT \n{58} Mullen Advertising argues first that the se parate complaint filed against it in 05 CVS \n7255, which duplicates the claims filed against Mullen/LHC in 05 CVS 15428, should be \ndismissed because Mullen Advertising was not the corporate entity that dealt with Gateway.  \n(Defs.’ Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 27-29, May 31, 2006.)  I agree. \n{59} Gateway sued Mullen Advertising on 15 April 2005.  Approximately four months later, it \nfiled the same claims against Mullen/LHC.  Gateway asserts that it may seek relief against both \nMullen Defendants based on evidence that several of the Defendants’ representatives involved in \nthe decision to terminate Gateway as a one-sheet vendor claimed to be working for “Mullen \nAdvertising” and another representative expressed a belief that Mullen/LHC and Mullen \nAdvertising were the same company.  (Pl.’s Br. in Resp. to Def. Mullen’s Mot. for Summ. J. 33; \nBrad Heard Aff. ¶¶ 45-46, June 19, 2006.) \n 15\n{60}  To be blunt, these are the thinnest of factua l reeds on which to rest support for effectively \ndoubling the Court’s file and increasing the litigation burden for all parties.  In the first place, \nwhatever confusion Gateway may have had about the relationship of the Mullen Defendants \nshould have been laid to rest when it reviewed the North Carolina Secretary of State filings and \nother records showing clearly that Mullen/LHC and Mullen Advertising are separate companies.  \n(See Slack Aff. Exs. A-F.) \n{61} Moreover, in its briefs and arguments to th is Court, Gateway has never wavered from its \ninsistence that a contract was formed in October 2004 between its president Brad Heard and \nMullen/LHC’s former senior vice-president Carl Haynes.  Gateway, however, presents no \nevidence to dispute the fact that Haynes worked only for Mullen/LHC and, although \nMullen/LHC disputes Haynes’s authority with respect to the alleged contract, (see Mullen’s \nResp. to Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. for Breach of Contract and Unfair and Deceptive Trade \nPractices 13, June 23, 2006), it does not disavow responsibility for the actions taken by the \nindividuals that Gateway blames for wrongfully terminating the alleged contract. \n{62} Consequently, whatever Haynes (or any other individual) did with respect to the alleged \ncontract, and whatever liability arises from those acts, is the responsibility of Mullen/LHC alone.  \nI find absolutely no merit to Gateway’s attempt to prosecute two separate actions here. \n{63} Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant Mullen Advertising’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment and dismisses, with prejudice, the claims in 05 CVS 7255.  \nC. \nBREACH OF CONTRACT  \n{64} Both parties argue that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Gateway’s breach of \ncontract claim.  Because the specific evidence that Gateway relies on to buttress its claim is \n 16\ndeficient as a matter of law, the Court will GRANT Mullen/LHC’s motion and dismiss this \nclaim. \n1. \nAPPLICABLE LAW \n{65} The elements of a valid contract are offe r, acceptance, consideration, and mutuality of \nassent to the contract’s essential terms.  Cap Care Group, Inc. v. McDonald, 149 N.C. App. 817, \n822, 561 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2002) (“An enforceable agreement requires an offer, acceptance and \nconsideration.”); Snyder v. Freeman, 300 N.C. 204, 218, 266 S.E.2d 593, 602 (1980) (“The \nessence of any contract is the mutual assent of both parties to the terms of the agreement so as to \nestablish a meeting of the minds.”).  “It is a well-settled principle of contract law that a valid \ncontract exists only where there has been a meeting of the minds as to all essential terms of the \nagreement.”  Northington v. Michelotti, 121 N.C. App. 180, 184, 464 S.E.2d 711, 714 (1995) \n(citing O’Grady v. First Union Nat’l Bank of N.C., 296 N.C. 212, 221, 250 S.E.2d 587, 594 \n(1978)); see Boyce v. McMahan, 285 N.C. 730, 734, 208 S.E.2d 692, 695 (1974). \n{66} An agreement to make a contract, or as th e cases sometimes phrase it, “an agreement to \nagree,” does not constitute a binding obligation.  Gregory v. Perdue, Inc., 47 N.C. App. 655, \n657, 267 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1980).    For a contract to bind two parties, they must assent to the \nsame thing in the same sense, and their minds must meet at least with respect to all material \nterms.  Thus, a contract that leaves material terms open for future negotiations is invalid.  Id.; \nBoyce, 285 N.C. at 734, 208 S.E.2d at 695.  Put another way, “[i]f any portion of the proposed \nterms is not settled, there is no agreement.”  Goeckel v. Stokely, 236 N.C. 604, 607, 73 S.E.2d \n618, 620 (1952). \n 17\n{67} On the other hand, “the law . . . does not favor  the destruction of contracts on account of \nuncertainty, and ‘the courts will, if possible, so construe the contract as to carry into effect the \nreasonable intent of the parties, if it can be ascertained.’”  Welsh v. N. Telecom, Inc., 85 N.C. \nApp. 281, 290, 354 S.E.2d 746, 751 (1987) (quoting Fisher v. John L. Roper Lumber Co., 183 \nN.C. 486, 490, 111 S.E. 857, 860 (1922)).  Wherever possible, “courts should attempt to \ndetermine the intent of the parties from the language used, construed with reference to the \ncircumstances surrounding the making of the contract.”  Id. (citing Chew v. Leonard, 228 N.C. \n181, 44 S.E.2d 869 (1947)). \n2. \nANALYSIS \na. \nLEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLEGED CONTRACT \n{68} I conclude that I may determine the sufficiency  of the disputed contract as a matter of law \nand that, contrary to Gateway’s claim, the October 2004 exchange of correspondence between \nCarl Haynes and Brad Heard did not create a contract. \n{69} In its Complaints, Gateway asserts that the Haynes Memorandum committing \nMullen/LHC to a $71.00 per-sheet non-cancelable price for insertion orders commencing in \n2005, and the 7 October 2004 e-mail response by Brad Heard, Gateway’s president, accepting \nthese terms created a binding contract with nothing more to be negotiated by the parties.  \n(Compl. 7255 ¶¶ 20-22; Compl. 15428 ¶¶ 21-23.)  I disagree. \n{70} For the purposes of analyzing the sufficiency of Gateway’s breach of contract claim, the \nCourt assumes (as Gateway alleges) that Haynes was authorized to commit Mullen/LHC to the \n 18\nterms in the Haynes Memorandum and that Gateway accepted those terms.  Even so, however, \nthese writings fall far short of a contract. \n{71} On its face, the Haynes Memorandum refers to the parties moving “toward issuance of \nRJRT one-sheet contracts for 2005” before indicating that any such contracts will be predicated \non a reduced $71.00 per-sheet rate and a guaranteed one-year term.  (Compls. Ex. 3.) \n{72} The Haynes Memorandum also makes clear, however, that any such contracts would \n“specify the market in which we are placing one-sheets.”  (Compls. Ex. 3.)  Thus, while Haynes \ncertainly presented the $71.00 rate in conjunction with an offer of a non-cancelable contract, and \nGateway accepted those terms, the parties negotiated nothing else. \n{73} In North Carolina, “a contract, or offer to  contract, leaving material portions open for \nfuture agreement is nugatory and void for indefiniteness [and, therefore,] ‘a contract to enter into \na future contract must specify all its material and essential terms, and leave none to be agreed \nupon as a result of future negotiations.’”  Boyce, 285 N.C. at 733, 734, S.E.2d at 695 (quoting \nCroom v. Goldsboro Lumber Co., 182 N.C. 217, 220, 108 S.E. 735, 737 (1921)). \n{74} A party may not enforce a purported contract that omits the “nature and extent of the \nservice to be performed, the place where, and the person to whom it is to be rendered, and the \ncompensation to be paid,” Croom, 182 N.C. at 220, 108 S.E. at 737, or that fails to specify the \nquantity to be furnished.  Elks v. N.C. State Ins. Co., 159 N.C. 619, 626, 75 S.E. 808, 811 (1912); \nsee also Williamson v. Miller, 231 N.C. 722, 58 S.E.2d 743 (1950) (dismissing complaint where \nthe alleged contract for the sale of merchandise failed to provide for the sale and delivery of any \nspecified quantity of the goods). \n{75} The alleged contract in this case requ ired Gateway to post one-sheet cigarette \nadvertisements in or outside convenience stores throughout the United States.  (Dep. Ex. 29.)  \n 19\nFollowing their exchange of correspondence in early October 2004, the parties had reached \nagreement on only some of the material terms of the purported contract, that is, on a “unit” or \n“per-sheet” price, conditioned on a guaranteed one-year term.  Even with that commitment in \nhand, however, Gateway could not perform in October 2004, because it had not yet reached \nagreement with Mullen/LHC as to, among other things, the number of one-sheets to be posted, \nthe “issue months” for the postings, and their geographic locations. \n{76} Without agreement on these materials term s, the parties’ purported commitment on 7 \nOctober 2004 to a fixed unit price and a guaranteed term was meaningless because “‘there would \nbe no way by which the court could determine what sort of a contract the [future] negotiations \nwould result in; [and] no rule by which the court could ascertain what damages, if any, might \nfollow a refusal to enter into such future contract on the arrival of the time specified.’”  Boyce, \n285 N.C. at 734, 208 S.E.2d at 695 (quoting Croom, 182 N.C. at 220, 108 S.E. at 737). \n{77} Mullen/LHC presented these additional material  terms in the subsequent insertion orders \nthat Gateway’s president received in November 2004.  Because the parties had not yet \ncommitted to a contract, however, Mullen/LHC was free to retract its earlier offer of a \nguaranteed one-year term, which it did by tendering its form insertion order containing the 60-\nday cancellation provision.  Gateway’s president clearly understood the significance of this \nomission when he called Haynes to inquire about it. \n{78} For reasons I discuss later, the ensu ing conversation between Heard and Haynes—\nwherein Haynes allegedly assured Gateway’s president that this omission was inadvertent and \nthat the parties agreement in fact included a guaranteed one-year term—provides a sufficient \nbasis for Gateway to proceed on its claim alleging unfair and deceptive trade practices. \n 20\n{79} As to Gateway’s breach of  contract claim, however, there simply was no contract \nbetween the parties following Gateway’s receipt of the Haynes Memorandum and its 7 October \n2004 e-mail response because the offer was too indefinite to bind the parties. \nb. \nRATIFICATION AND USE OF PAROL EVIDENCE \n{80} Gateway also asserts that there is a genui ne issue of material fact as to whether \nMullen/LHC ultimately ratified a one-sheet contract for 2005 that included a one-year \nguaranteed term.  (Pl.’s Reply Br. In Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Against Def. Mullen for Breach \nof Contract and Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices 13-15, June 23, 2006.)  The Court disagrees. \n{81} Gateway’s first contention is that RJRT’s approval of non-cancelable contracts in or \naround December 2004 served as a ratification of the disputed contract by Mullen/LHC.  (Pl.’s \nReply Br. In Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. Against Def. Mullen for Breach of Contract and Unfair \nor Deceptive Trade Practices 15, June 23, 2006.)  This argument, however, confuses both the \nundisputed facts regarding the relationship of the parties to this transaction and the law of \nratification. \n{82} Ratification occurs when: \n[A] person with no authority whatsoever (or in excess of the limited authority \ngiven her) makes a contract as an agent for another or purports to do so.  Upon \ndiscovery of the facts, the principal may ratify the contract, in which event it will \nbe given the same effect as if the agent or purported agent had actually been \nauthorized by the principal to make the contract prior to the making thereof. \n \nBlanchard v. MBNA Am. Bank, N.A., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18450, at *15 (W.D.N.C. Aug. 9, \n2005) (citing Patterson v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 266 N.C. 489, 146 S.E.2d \n390 (1966)).  On the other hand, “‘ratification is not possible unless the person making the \ncontract, in doing so, purported to act as the agent of the person . . . claimed to be the principal.’” \n 21\nInv. Props. of Asheville, Inc. v. Allen, 283 N.C. 277, 288, 196 S.E.2d 262, 269 (1973) (quoting \nPatterson, 266 N.C. at 492-93, 146 S.E.2d at 393) (internal citation omitted) (ellipses in \noriginal). \n{83} In this case, there is no dispute that Mu llen/LHC was acting as agent for its disclosed \nprincipal, RJRT, and not the other way around.12  Gateway’s argument on ratification thus \namounts to the legal equivalent of attempting to force a square peg into a round hole.  In short, \nthe fact that RJRT, as principal, may have approved a non-cancelable contract with Gateway for \n2005 does not establish a ratification of that same contract by Mullen, as agent.  None of the \ncases that Gateway relies on extend the law of ratification so far, and this Court sees no good \nreason to twist an otherwise coherent legal concept beyond all recognition. \n{84} Gateway next argues that the following “undisputed” facts establish Mullen/LHC’s \nratification of a non-cancelable contract purportedly executed by Haynes: \n(1) Mullen negotiated with the one-sheet vendors, including Gateway, for a \nlower, non-cancelable rate of $71.00 for 2005; (2) Mullen issued insertion \norders for 2005 to Gateway and the other vendors in early November 2004 at \nthe $71.00 rate; (3) Immediately thereafter, Carl Haynes informed his \nsupervisor at Mullen, Carol Sterling, that he (on behalf of Mullen) had \npromised the vendors that their contracts would be non-cancelable if they \naccepted the $71.00 rate, and Mullen never re-issued insertion orders for 2005 \nat a higher rate; (4) Gateway and the other vendors performed in 2005 at the \nlower $71.00 rate and were paid by Mullen at the lower $71.00 rate; (5) On \nJanuary 21, 2005, Mullen informed a prospective replacement vendor that ‘the \nspace rate for non-cancelable orders is $71 gross per unit per month’ . . . and \n(6) Mullen received bonus and incentive compensation from RJRT in 2005 as \na result of reducing the rate from $74.00 to the non-cancelable rate of $71.00. \n \n(Pl.’s Br. in Resp. to Def. Mullen’s Mot. for Summ. J. 14-16, June 23, 2006.)  The Court again \ndisagrees. \n                                                 \n12 Mullen/LHC has not moved to dismiss the breach of contract claim on this basis.  See Baker v. Rushing, 104 N.C. \nApp. 240, 248, 409 S.E.2d 108, 112 (1991) (stating that “[a]n authorized agent who enters into a contract on behalf \nof a disclosed principal generally is not personally liable to third parties since the contract is with the principal.”).    \n 22\n{85} The first undisputed fact merely recount s the parties’ negotiations in October 2004, \nwhich the Court has already determined did not result in a contract.  Ratification presumes the \nexistence of a contract (albeit an unauthorized one), and Gateway’s assertion that preliminary \nnegotiations can amount to ratification improperly places the ratification cart before the contract \nhorse. \n{86} The second and fourth undisputed facts say noth ing about ratification and, in fact, ignore \nthe plain language of the insertion orders allowing Mullen/LHC to cancel any uncompleted work \non 60-days notice. \n{87} The fifth undisputed fact attempts to use Mu llen/LHC’s separate negotiations with other \none-sheet vendors as a basis for ratification of Gateway’s alleged contract.  The sixth undisputed \nfact attempts to fashion a similar connection arising from Mullen’s compensation arrangement \nwith its principal RJRT.  While I agree with Gateway that a jury “‘may find ratification from any \ncourse of conduct on the part of the principal which reasonably tends to show an intention on his \npart to ratify the agent’s unauthorized acts[,]”  Phillips v. Rest. Mgmt. of Carolina, L.P., 146 \nN.C. App. 203, 210, 552 S.E.2d 686, 691 (2001) (quoting Brown v. Burlington Indus., Inc., 93 \nN.C. App. 431, 437, 378 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1989)), I find as a matter of law that Mullen/LHC’s \nalleged conduct involving other contracts and parties does not reasonably allow for such a \nconclusion here. \n{88} Finally, the third “undisputed” fact amounts to  a claim that a jury should be allowed to \nconsider parol evidence of the parties’ true agreement regarding the 2005 One-Sheet Program.   \n{89} Generally, “[t]he parol evidence rule excludes prior or contemporaneous oral agreements \nwhich are inconsistent with a written contract if the written contract contains the complete \nagreement of the parties.”   Tar River Cable TV, Inc. v. Standard Theatre Supply Co., 62 N.C. \n 23\nApp. 61, 64-65, 302 S.E.2d 458, 460 (1983).  The parol evidence rule, however, does not bar the \nadmission of such evidence “to prove that a written contract was procured by fraud because ‘the \nallegations of fraud challenge the validity of the contract itself, not the accuracy of its terms[.]’”  \nGodfrey v. Res-Care, Inc., 165 N.C. App. 68, 598 S.E.2d 396, 403 (2004) (quoting Fox v. S. \nAppliances, Inc., 264 N.C. 267, 270, 141 S.E.2d 522, 525 (1965)) (alteration in original). \n{90} In response to Gateway’s cont ention, Mullen/LHC asserts that the written insertion orders \nbar any claim that the agreement was non-cancelable for one year because they provide expressly \nfor cancellation on 60-days notice and contain an integration or “merger” clause affirming that \nthe documents are a complete statement of the contract terms.  (Mullen’s Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. for \nSumm. J. for Breach of Contract and Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices 7-10, June 23, 2006.) \n{91} “North Carolina recognizes that merger clauses are valid contractual provisions and the \ncourts consistently uphold their use.”  Mech. Sys. & Servs., Inc. v. Carolina Air Solutions, L.L.C., \n2003 NCBC 9, at ¶ 25 (N.C. Super. Dec. 3, 2003) (citing Zinn v. Walker, 87 N.C. App. 325, 333, \n361 S.E.2d 314, 318 (1987)). \n{92} The primary purpose of a merger clause is  “to effectuate the policies of the Parol \nEvidence Rule; i.e., barring the admission of prior and contemporaneous negotiations on terms \ninconsistent with the terms of the writing.”  Zinn, 87 N.C. App. at 333, 361 S.E.2d at 318. \n{93} As Gateway notes, however, “[w]here giving e ffect to the merger clause would frustrate \nand distort the parties’ true intentions and understanding regarding the contract, the clause will \nnot be enforced.”  Id.  For this exception to apply, however, “the parties’ conduct [must indicate] \ntheir intentions to include collateral agreements or writings despite the existence of the merger \nclause and the parol evidence [must not be] markedly different, if at all, from the written \ncontract . . . .”  Id. at 334, 361 S.E.2d at 319 (emphasis added). \n 24\n{94} The Zinn holding does not aid Gateway here.  Taking the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to Gateway, Haynes’s promise of a guaranteed one-year term is completely at odds \nwith the express terms of the written insertion orders allowing Mullen/LHC to cancel any \nuncompleted one-sheet postings on 60-days notice.  Accordingly, the parol evidence rule bars \nGateway’s attempt to vary the terms of the paper writing. \n{95} Finally, as the Court more fully explains in its discussion of Gateway’s UDTPA claim, \nGateway’s complaint smacks of fraud in the inducement, which is a recognized exception to the \nparol evidence rule.  However, “‘an action for fraud inducing the execution of a contract is not \non the contract but in tort . . . .’”  Parker v. Bennett, 32 N.C. App. 46, 50, 231 S.E.2d 10, 13, \n(1977) (internal citation omitted).  Alternatively, fraud in the inducement can be asserted to \nrescind a contract or as a defense to a breach of contract claim, in which case the contract would \nbe rendered void.  Fox, 264 N.C. at 270, 141 S.E.2d at 525; see also Godfrey, 165 N.C. App. at \n78, 598 S.E.2d at 403. \n{96} In this case, Gateway has dismissed its fr aud claim against Mullen and Haynes, leaving \nonly its UDTPA claim, and Gateway clearly does not seek avoidance of the written insertion \norders, but rather wants to admit evidence of oral statements, consistent with its view of the \n“true” agreement.  Because, however, this evidence would substitute a new and different \nagreement from the one memorialized by the parties in writing, it is barred by the parol evidence \nrule.  See Neal v. Marrone, 239 N.C. 73, 78, 79 S.E.2d 239, 242 (1953). \n{97} Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS Mullen/LHC’s motion \nfor summary judgment as to Gateway’s breach of contract claim. \nD. \nUNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES  \n 25\n{98} Both parties have moved for summary judgment as to Gateway’s UDTPA claim.  \nBecause I conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to this claim, the Court will \nDENY the cross-motions. \n1. \nAPPLICABLE LAW  \n{99} The elements of a UDTPA claim are “(1)  defendant[] committed an unfair or deceptive \nact or practice, (2) in or affecting commerce and (3) plaintiff was injured as a result.”  Phelps-\nDickson Builders, L.L.C. v. Amerimann Partners, 172 N.C. App. 427, 439, 617 S.E.2d 664, 671 \n(2005). \n{100} “A practice is unfair when it offends esta blished public policy as well as when the \npractice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious[.]”  Marshall \nv. Miller, 302 N.C. 539, 548, 276 S.E.2d 397, 403 (1981). \n{101} As for the element of deception, “a plainti ff need not show fraud, bad faith, or actual \ndeception.  Instead, it is sufficient if a plaintiff shows that a defendant’s acts possessed the \ntendency or capacity to mislead or created the likelihood of deception.”  RD&J Props. v. \nLauralea-Dilton Enters., LLC, 165 N.C. App. 737, 748, 600 S.E.2d 492, 501-02 (2004).  “In a \nbusiness context, this question is determined based on the likely effect on ‘the average \nbusinessperson.’”  Id., 600 S.E.2d at 502 (quoting Bolton Corp. v. T. A. Loving Co., 94 N.C. \nApp. 392, 412, 380 S.E.2d 796, 808 (1989)). \n{102} Although it is a question of fact  whether the defendant performed the alleged acts, it is a \nquestion of law whether those facts constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice.  First Atl. \nMgmt., Corp. v. Dunlea Realty, Co., 131 N.C. App. 242, 252-53, 507 S.E.2d 56, 63 (1998).   \n 26\n{103} “It is well established[, however ,] that a mere breach of contract, even if intentional, is \nnot sufficiently unfair or deceptive to sustain an action [under the statute].”  Computer Decisions, \nInc. v. Rouse Office Mgmt. of N.C., Inc., 124 N.C. App. 383, 390, 477 S.E.2d 262, 266 (1996).  \nTo sustain a cause of action, a plaintiff is required to allege and prove that “substantial \naggravating circumstances” attended the breach.  Id. \n{104} Finally, when a UDTPA claim is based on alle ged misrepresentations, the plaintiff must \nshow that the misrepresentations complained of proximately caused it actual injury.  See Mosley \n& Mosley Builders, Inc. v. Landin Ltd., 97 N.C. App. 511, 517, 389 S.E.2d 576, 579 (1990); \nBartolomeo v. S.B. Thomas, Inc., 889 F.2d 530, 535 (4th Cir. 1989).  As to this issue, however, \n“whether plaintiffs’ damages were the proximate result of defendants’ actions is almost always a \nquestion of fact for the jury.”  Edwards v. West, 128 N.C. App. 570, 575, 495 S.E.2d 920, 924 \n(1998). \n2. \nANALYSIS \n{105} Gateway catalogues a virtual “ potpourri” of alleged misconduct by Mullen/LHC that it \nargues is sufficient to support its UDTPA claim.  (see Br. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. \nAgainst Def. Mullen for Breach of Contract and Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices 25-27; \nPl.’s Br. in Resp. to Def. Mullen’s Mot. for Summ. J. 28-29.)  For purposes of resolving the \ncompeting motions, however, the Court focuses on only one of these claims. \n{106} According to Plaintiff’s evidence, in or around 7 October 2004, Haynes promised \nGateway’s President that the 2005 one-sheet contract would be guaranteed for one year at a \nreduced rate of $71.00 per-sheet.  (Compls. Ex. 3.)  Haynes then later repeated that promise and \ncommitment when Heard called to discuss its omission from the 2005 insertion orders, (Brad \n 27\nHeard Aff. ¶ 38, June 19, 2006; Brad Heard Dep. 156:9-158:6, 160:5-17), and although Gateway \napparently did not know it at the time, Mullen/LHC’s principal later gave Mullen/LHC authority \nto execute a guaranteed contract, (Williard Dep. 337:13-25.)  Finally, neither Haynes nor his \nsuperior made any effort to disavow Haynes’s promise of a guaranteed one-year term.  (Sterling \nDep. 51:25-64:25, 67:2-8.) \n{107} Mullen/LHC’s evidence is that Haynes never made an unqualified commitment of a \nguaranteed term and that, in any event, Haynes knew he was not authorized to make such an \noffer when he did because RJRT had not given its approval.  (Sterling Aff. ¶¶ 8-9; Slack. Dep. \n257:12-15; Troutman Dep. 207:7-25, 218:20-219:6.) \n{108} Gateway responds that Haynes either had such  authority or falsely represented his bona \nfides when he committed Mullen/LHC to the one-year term and that Mullen/LHC did nothing to \ncorrect this misrepresentation.  (Pl.’s Br. in Resp. to Def. Mullen’s Mot. for Summ. J. 11-15, \nJune 23, 2006.) \n{109} This factual dispute is both material a nd genuine.  It is genuine because there is \nsubstantial evidence on either side of the issue.  It is material because if, as Mullen/LHC asserts, \nHaynes lacked authority to commit to a guaranteed one-year term, and if, as Gateway insists, \nHaynes made the promise anyway, then Gateway’s claim smacks of fraud in the inducement. \n{110} “The essential elements of fraud [or, in this  case, fraud in the inducement] are: ‘(1) False \nrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made \nwith intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the injured \nparty.’”  Rowan County Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 332 N.C. 1, 17, 418 S.E.2d 648, 658 \n(1992) (quoting Terry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 83, 273 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1981)). \n 28\n{111} Although Gateway need not prove fraud to make out its UDTPA claim, Edwards, 128 \nN.C. App. at 574, 495 S.E.2d at 924, proof of fraud would necessarily constitute a UDTPA \nviolation.  Bhatti v. Buckland, 328 N.C. 240, 243, 400 S.E.2d 440, 442 (1991). \n{112} Construing the disputed facts in the light most favorable to Gateway, Haynes’s alleged \nconduct (and Mullen/LHC’s ensuing silence)13 may well have been fraudulent and was certainly \nunethical.  At a minimum, it had the capacity or tendency to deceive, and Gateway’s evidence is \nthat—in reliance on Hayne’s promises—Gateway was deceived into undertaking a host of \ncommitments that it would not otherwise have made and also failed to pursue other business.  \n(Pl.’s Br. in Resp. to Def. Mullen’s Mot. for Summ. J. 28-29, June 23, 2006.) \n{113} Mullen/LHC’s retort that these facts allege at best a mere breach of contract misses the \npoint.  I agree with the views expressed in Broussard v. Meineke Discount Muffler Shops, Inc. \nthat trial courts should keep “open-ended tort damages from distorting contractual relations” and \nmust be vigilant against a party’s attempt “‘to manufacture a tort dispute out of what is, at \nbottom, a simple breach of contract claim[,]’” a practice that is “‘inconsistent both with North \nCarolina law and sound commercial practice.’” 155 F.3d 331, 346 (4th Cir. 1998) (quoting Strum \nv. Exxon Co., 15 F.3d 327, 329 (4th Cir. 1994)). \n{114} Nevertheless, in summoning Broussard for support, Mullen/LHC incorrectly focuses on \nits purported right to cancel the One-Sheet Program once the parties began performing in 2005.  \nThe factual crux of Gateway’s UDTPA claim, however, centers on (a) Haynes’s alleged \nmisrepresentations during the parties’ contract negotiations, when he induced Gateway to \n                                                 \n13 The court is aware that silence generally is not actionable as fraud unless there is a duty to speak, which in turn, \narises from a relationship of trust, confidence, inequality of condition and knowledge, or other attendant \ncircumstances.  Setzer v. Old Republic Life Ins. Co., 257 N.C. 396, 399, 126 S.E.2d 135, 137 (1962).  Regardless, \nthe critical question is whether Mullen/LHC’s acts, taken as a whole, had a capacity or tendency to deceive; \nGateway need not prove all of the elements of common law fraud.  See generally Pierce v. Am. Defender Life Ins. \nCo., 316 N.C. 461, 470, 343 S.E.2d 174, 180 (1986). \n \n 29\ncommit to the 2005 One-Sheet Program by reassuring Gateway’s president that it was \nguaranteed a one-year term, all the while knowing that he had no authority to make such a \ncommitment; and (b) Mullen/LHC’s failure to set the record straight.14  These facts are sufficient \nto withstand Mullen/LHC’s motion for summary judgment as to the UDTPA claim but, because \nthey are disputed, Gateway also is not entitled to summary judgment.  See Phelps-Dickson \nBuilders, 172 N.C. App. at 439, 617 S.E.2d at 671 (reversing summary judgment for defendant \non UDTPA claim where defendant’s agent made oral misrepresentations that were inconsistent \nwith the parties’ written contract); Process Components, Inc. v. Baltimore Aircoil Co., Inc., 89 \nN.C. App. 649, 654, 366 S.E.2d 907, 911 (1988) (holding that defendant-manufacturer's acts \nwere sufficiently deceptive when defendant promised plaintiff an exclusive distributorship while \ndefendant was still bound to an agreement with another distributor). \n{115} Mullen/LHC’s insistence that it did not authorize Haynes to act does not bar Gateway’s \nclaim.  In the first place, there is a genuine factual dispute as to Haynes’s apparent authority, an \nissue that the Court may not resolve on summary judgment. \n{116} Apparent authority is defined as “that authority which the principal has held the agent out \nas possessing or which he has permitted the agent to represent that he possesses.”  Zimmerman v. \nHogg & Allen, 286 N.C. 24, 31, 209 S.E.2d 795, 799 (1974).  Moreover, an employer is liable \nfor an agent’s fraud when committed within the scope of an agent’s apparent authority, “even \nthough the principal did not know or authorize the commission of the fraudulent acts.”  Norburn \nv. Mackie, 262 N.C. 16, 23, 136 S.E.2d 279, 284-85 (1964). \n                                                 \n14 Additionally, even if, as Mullen/LHC insists, the insertion orders purport to be the entire contract between the \nparties, Gateway would nevertheless be able to introduce parol evidence of Haynes’s additional promise where such \nstatements are offered to prove a UDTPA claim.  See Torrance v. AS & L Motors, Ltd., 119 N.C. App. 552, 554-55, \n459 S.E.2d 67, 68 (1995). \n 30\n{117} “[T]he determination of a prin cipal’s liability in any particular case must be determined \nby what authority the third person in the exercise of reasonable care was justified in believing \nthat the principal had, under the circumstances conferred upon his agent.”  Zimmerman, 286 N.C. \nat 31, 209 S.E.2d at 799. \n{118} This statement of the law answers Mulle n/LHC’s argument that Gateway could not \nreasonably have relied on Haynes’s alleged misrepresentations in the face of written insertion \norders stating expressly that its performance could be cancelled on 60-days notice.  Whether a \nperson exercised reasonable care is generally an issue of fact to be resolved by a jury.  Cf. Moore \nv. Crumpton, 306 N.C. 618, 624, 295 S.E.2d 436, 440 (1982) (stating that “[e]ven where there is \nno dispute as to the essential facts, where reasonable people could differ with respect to whether \na party acted with reasonable care, it ordinarily remains the province of the jury to apply the \nreasonable person standard.”). \n{119} Understandably, Mullen/LHC would like me to  conclude that Gateway’s reliance here \nwas unreasonable as a matter of law.  But, as our Supreme Court has noted: \nThe law does not require a prudent man to deal with everyone as a rascal and \ndemand covenants to guard against the falsehood of every representation \nwhich may be made as to facts which constitute material inducements to a \ncontract; [instead] there must be a reliance on the integrity of man or else \ntrade and commerce could not prosper. . . .  Just where reliance ceases to be \nreasonable and becomes such negligence and inattention that it will, as a \nmatter of law, bar recovery . . . is frequently very difficult to determine. . . .  In \nclose cases, however, we think that a [party to an action] . . . should not be \npermitted to say in effect, ‘You ought not to have trusted me.  If you had not \nbeen so gullible, ignorant, or negligent, I could not have deceived you.’  \nCourts should be very loath to deny an actually defrauded plaintiff relief on \nthis ground. \n \nJohnson v. Owens, 263 N.C. 754, 758, 140 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1965) (internal citations \nand quotations omitted). \n 31\n{120} There is conflicting evidence as to Haynes’s apparent authority to commit Mullen/LHC \nto a one-year guaranteed term for the 2005 One-Sheet Program, and consequently, there is a \ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether Gateway acted reasonably in relying on Haynes’s \nalleged statements that Mullen/LHC had committed to such a guarantee.  See First Union Nat’l. \nBank v. Brown, 166 N.C. App. 519, 527-28, 603 S.E.2d 808 (2004) (stating that “the law of \napparent authority usually depends upon the unique facts of each case . . . . [And where] the \nevidence is conflicting or susceptible to different reasonable inferences, the nature and extent of \nan agent’s authority is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.”).15\n{121} Accordingly, the Court DENIES the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment as to \nGateway’s UDTPA claim. \nE. \nDAMAGES FOR DIMINUTION IN BUSINESS VALUE \n{122} Mullen/LHC has also moved for summary judgment as to the proper measure of \ndamages, arguing that Gateway has improperly attempted to expand the scope of damages to \ninclude recovery of almost $14.5 million arising from the alleged diminution in value of \nGateway’s business. \n{123} Gateway responds that such damages are rec overable under the facts of this case and has \nmoved to supplement the record with testimony given by Mullen/LHC’s expert in other cases to \nprove the point. \n                                                 \n15 The Court acknowledges those cases barring UDTPA claims involving misrepresentations concerning the terms of \na contract.  See, e.g., Spartan Leasing Inc of N.C., v. Pollard, 101 N.C. App. 450, 400 S.E.2d 476 (1991).  I also \nrecognize that persons executing written contracts have a duty to read them and ordinarily are charged with \nknowledge of their contents.  Id. at 456, 400 S.E.2d at 479.  In this case, however, I have found that a contract did \nnot exist in October 2004, as contended by the Plaintiff.  Moreover, the evidence, taken in the light most favorable \nto Gateway, is that its president inquired as to the omission in the insertion orders regarding the guaranteed one-year \nterm and was assured by Mullen/LHC’s agent that it was an administrative error.  Given that Gateway did not have a \ndirect contractual relationship with RJRT, the ultimate beneficiary of its services, but instead relied on Mullen/LHC \nto advise it as to the scope of its performance of the One-Sheet Program, it is for a jury to decide whether Gateway \nacted reasonably. \n 32\n{124} I conclude that damages for diminution in Gateway’s business value are not recoverable \nin this case and, therefore, will GRANT Mullen/LHC’s motion and DENY Gateway’s motion to \nsupplement the record. \n{125} As noted earlier, Gateway’s UDTPA claim is essentially a claim alleging fraud in the \ninducement.  According to our Supreme Court, “[t]he measure of damages for fraud in the \ninducement of a contract is the difference between the value of what was received and the value \nof what was promised, and is potentially trebled by N.C.G.S. § 75-16.”  River Burch Assocs. v. \nCity of Raleigh, 326 N.C. 100, 130, 388 S.E.2d 538, 556 (1990) (internal citation omitted). \n{126} In this case, that measure of damages is the difference between Gateway’s expected profit \nhad it been allowed to perform for the full year and the amount Gateway was actually paid \nbefore being terminated in February 2005, with any such award potentially trebled.  See Horne v. \nCloninger, 256 N.C. 102, 104, 123 S.E.2d 112, 113 (1961) (“The jury, having established the \nfraud, should have awarded as damages the difference between the actual value and the value if \nthe [property] had been as represented.”). \n{127} The Court declines Gateway’s invitation to expand the scope of damages beyond the rule \nannounced in Horne.  Gateway relies on Pleasant Valley Promenade v. Lechmere, Inc., 120 N.C. \nApp. 650, 464 S.E.2d 47 (1995) as authority for pursuing “diminution in business value” \ndamages.  That decision, however, does not support such a result here. \n{128} In Pleasant Valley Promenade, the plaintiff limited partnership operated a shopping \ncenter that included a department store chain, defendant Lechmere, Inc., (“Lechmere”), as its \nanchor store tenant.  Although Lechmere owned the property upon which it operated its business, \nit was bound by a restrictive covenant with the shopping center developer to operate its store for \n 33\nseven years.  Lechmere, however, closed the store after only two years of operation and \nthereafter leased the space to a discount pharmacy chain.  Id. at 654-55, 464 S.E.2d at 52-53. \n{129} Plaintiff in that case alleged claims for br each of contract, fraud, and unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices.  The trial court granted a partial directed verdict on plaintiff’s fraud and UDTPA \nclaims and set aside the jury’s verdict of $8 million on the breach of contract claim.  Id. at 655, \n464 S.E.2d at 53. \n{130} The resulting cross-appeals ra ised a host of issues, including the proper scope of damages \nfor the breach of contract claim.  The precise question before the Court of Appeals was “whether \ndiminished market value is recoverable in a breach of contract action arising out of an anchor \nstore’s breach of covenants with the shopping center in which it resides.”  Id. at 666, 464 S.E.2d \nat 59. \n{131} As to that question, our Court of Appeals expressed the general rule th at “‘for a breach of \ncontract the injured party is entitled as compensation therefor to be placed, insofar as this can be \ndone by money, in the same position he would have occupied if the contract had been \nperformed.’”  Id. at 665, 464 S.E.2d at 59 (quoting First Union Nat’l Bank of N.C. v. Naylor, 102 \nN.C. App. 719, 725, 404 S.E.2d 161, 164 (1991)). \n{132} To that end, the Court agreed with the views of other courts that diminished market value \nmay be an appropriate measure of contractual damages measure where the harm suffered will not \notherwise be fully compensated.  Id. at 667, 464 S.E.2d at 60 (citing United Roasters, Inc., v. \nColgate-Pamolive Co., 649 F.2d 985 (4th Cir. 1981)). \n{133} But the specific holding in Pleasant Valley Promenade was very narrow, i.e., that \n“diminution in market value may be applied to redress breach of contract occurring between an \nanchor store and the shopping center in which it resides[.]”  Id. at 671, 464 S.E.2d at 62.  \n 34\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, recovery of diminution in business value damages is \nparticularly appropriate in such a context because of the cooperative enterprise that is a shopping \ncenter, “with each store’s success dependent on the continued operation of the other stores . . . .” \nand the critical role of the anchor store in the financial success of the entire shopping center.  Id. \n(quoting Dover Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Cushman’s Sons, Inc., 63 N.J. Super. 384, 164 A.2d 785, \n790 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1960)).  As the Court of Appeals explained: \nThe function of the anchor is to provide certainty of income stream, an \nidentity and stability for the center which, in turn, draws customers, attracts \nother tenants and increases overall sales.  Further, without an anchor store \nlong-term financing is virtually impossible to obtain.  Therefore, the anchor’s \nloss has been described as worse than a flood, fire or tornado, because usually \nthere is insurance to cover natural disasters. \n \nId. at 670, 464 S.E.2d at 61 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \n \n{134} The case before me does not mirror the unique  harm caused by a defendant who executes \na seven-year covenant to operate its business as the anchor tenant for a shopping center, and then \nabandons the center less than two years later.  Rather, the facts here involve a corporate entity \nspun off from its predecessor, whose sole raison d’être was to manage a single line of business \npursuant to annual contracts that, taken in the light most favorable to Gateway, guaranteed a \nrevenue stream for only one year. \n{135} I acknowledge that unfair and deceptive trade practices and unfair competition claims are \nneither wholly tortious nor wholly contractual in nature and the measure of damages is broader \nthan common law actions.  Bernard v. Cent. Carolina Truck Sales, Inc., 68 N.C. App. 228, 230, \n232, 314 S.E.2d 582, 584-85 (1984).  Nevertheless, a diminution in business value theory of \ndamages has no place here.  As the Eleventh Circuit held on facts remarkably similar to those \nbefore me, where a plaintiff business elects to serve one client and is “a creature of the contract” \nwith that client, the business has value only to the extent that the client chooses to renew the \n 35\ncontract.  Mark Seitman & Assocs., Inc., v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 837 F.2d 1527, 1532 n.7 \n(11th Cir. 1988). \n{136} The Court has already determined that Gate way’s claim for breach of contract fails, and \nthat the damage to Gateway, if any, arises, not from any alleged contractual breach, but as a \nresult of the alleged actions of Mullen/LHC’s agent in fraudulently inducing Gateway to \nperform. \n{137} Except by virtue of the statutory trebling of  damages that arises from these facts, \nhowever, Gateway’s actual damages are the same whether the case proceeds as a contract action \nor as a UDTPA claim.  That is, Gateway is entitled to recover the difference between the value of \nwhat was received (i.e., the profits earned and paid before Gateway’s termination) and the value \nof what was promised (i.e., the profits Gateway would have earned for the full year). \n{138} Gateway concedes that Mullen/LHC was not ob ligated to retain it as a one-sheet vendor \nbeyond 2005.  (Brad Heard Dep. 225:14-20; Guldner Dep. 191:19-25.)  Moreover, Gateway \ncame to life following a business decision by its predecessor, Gateway Outdoor Advertising, \nInc., at the request of its lender, to fragment its revenue stream to facilitate access to capital.  \n(Craig Heard Aff. ¶¶ 1, 4-5, Apr. 5, 2006.)  To then claim that a three-year-old company with \nrevenues tied almost exclusively to a single client suffered almost $14.5 million in diminution in \nbusiness value damages, in addition to over $3 million in lost profits, following a decision to \nterminate an alleged one-year contract is, I conclude, unbounded speculation. \n{139} Moreover, although couched as a figure pur porting to assess Gateway’s diminished \nbusiness value, Gateway’s damages calculation is nothing more than an estimate of its lost \nprofits for the years ending 2006-2010, discounted to their present value.  North Carolina courts, \nhowever, “have long held that damages for lost profits will not be awarded based upon \n 36\nhypothetical or speculative forecasts of losses.”  Iron Steamer, Ltd. v. Trinity Rest., Inc., 110 \nN.C. App. 843, 847, 431 S.E.2d 767, 770 (1993). \n{140} In this case, Gateway’s calculation of diminished business value damages is based on two \nassumptions.  The first, that Mullen/LHC would renew the one-sheet contract for 2006 and \nbeyond, is unfounded given the facts, and the second, that Gateway would have been able to \nsolicit a comparable level of business with more notice of its eventual termination, is speculative \ngiven that Gateway had no established history of profits from clients other than Mullen/LHC.  \nSee generally Old Well Water Inc., v. Collegiate Distrib. Inc., 2002 N.C. App. LEXIS 1939, at \n*12 (N.C. Ct. App. June 18, 2002) (affirming dismissal of a claim for lost profits where plaintiff \nwas a new business with no history of established profits and the evidence of projected profits \nwas speculative). \n{141} And while it is true that North Carolina has no per se rule that precludes an award of \ndamages for lost profits where a business has no recent record of profitability, such businesses, \nlike established businesses, must prove lost profits with reasonable certainty.  Olivetti Corp. v. \nAmes Bus. Sys., Inc., 319 N.C. 534, 546, 356 S.E.2d 578, 585 (1987).  Put another way, the \nplaintiff must show “that the amount of damages is based upon a standard that will allow the \nfinder of fact to calculate the amount of damages with reasonable certainty.”  Id. at 547-48, 356 \nS.E.2d at 586. \n{142} In this case, Gateway had no expectati on of serving as a one-sheet vendor beyond 2005, \nand Gateway has presented no evidence to show that a company created for the sole purpose of \nmanaging a single line of business could, in fact, diversify its operations so as to generate future \nrevenues equivalent to those lost by the termination of its relationship with its only client. \n 37\n{143} Accordingly, because Gateway’s estimate regarding “diminution in business value” \ndamages is based on assumptions that are either unfounded or purely speculative, the Court \nGRANTS Mullen/LHC’s motion for summary judgment as to this issue and will exclude any \nevidence of “diminution in business value” damages. \n{144} Also before the Court is Gateway’s motion for further supplementation as to the damages \nissue.  Gateway seeks to submit the deposition testimony of Mullen/LHC’s expert, given in other \ncases, wherein he purportedly agreed that “diminution in business value” damages are an \nappropriate measure of damages. \n{145} In light of my ruling above, this issue is moot.  Regardless, in determining the proper \nmeasure of damages, the Court cares not what an expert thinks, but only what North Carolina \nlaw provides.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES Gateway’s motion to supplement. \nF. \nUNASSERTED DEFENSE \n{146} Finally, Gateway moves for judgment as a ma tter of law to prevent Mullen/LHC from \ndefending against Gateway’s breach of contract and unfair and deceptive trade practices claims \non the basis of the allegedly unlawful “consulting” payments made by Gateway to Haynes. \n{147} Gateway argues, among other things, that Mullen/LHC has waived the matter by failing \nto plead it as an affirmative defense or, alternatively, by entering into the 2005 contract with \nGateway with full knowledge of the allegedly improper payments.  (Br. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot. for \nSumm. J. Regarding Proposed but Unasserted Defense of Def. Mullen 10-11, May 31, 2006.) \n{148} Mullen/LHC responds that Gateway’s payments to Haynes were in fact “kickbacks” that \nprovided independent grounds to terminate the one-year contract (if one existed) regardless of \n 38\nwhether the payments were pled as an affirmative defense.  (Mullen’s Resp. to Mot. for Summ. \nJ. Regarding “Unasserted Defense” 6, June 23, 2006.) \n{149} The Court DENIES Gateway’s motion.  In the first place, whether the alleged kickbacks \nprovided sufficient grounds to terminate the contract is moot, as I have dismissed Gateway’s \nbreach of contract claim. \n{150} Second, it is unclear whether the alleged kickbacks would be an affirmative defense to \nHaynes’s alleged misrepresentation that the 2005 insertion orders were guaranteed for a full year, \ngiven the disputed facts as to the nature of the payments and the relative knowledge of the \nparties.  Regardless, because Mullen/LHC has not asserted the kickbacks as an affirmative \ndefense to any claim, I decline to address it on summary judgment but do not foreclose further \nconsideration of the issue at trial. \nCONCLUSION \n{151} Based upon the foregoing, the Court: \n (a) GRANTS Mullen Advertising’s motion to dismiss all claims in 05 CVS 7255; \n(b) DENIES Gateway’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to its claim for breach of \ncontract; \n(c)  GRANTS Mullen/LHC’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Gateway’s claim \nfor breach of contract;  \n(d)  DENIES the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment as to Gateway’s claim \nalleging Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices; \n (e) GRANTS Mullen/LHC’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Other Relief \nRegarding Damages for “Diminution in Business Value” and also GRANTS Mullen/LHC’s \nseparate motion to exclude any expert testimony as to this issue; \n 39\n(f) DENIES Gateway’s Motion for Leave to Submit Additional Materials in \nOpposition to Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Other Relief Regarding \nDamages for “Diminution in Business Value;” and, \n(g) DENIES Gateway’s Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Proposed but \nUnasserted Defense. \nThis the 19th day of January, 2007. \n \n \n  \n 40"
