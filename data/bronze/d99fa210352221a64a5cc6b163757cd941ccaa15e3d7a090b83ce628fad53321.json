This \nmatter comes before the Court on Plaintiff and Defendant’s Motions for Summary \nJudgment under Rule 56. \n{2} Upon review of the briefs and oral argument, the Court GRANTS \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and DENIES Defendant’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment. \n \nSmith Moore LLP by James L. Gale and Laura M. Loyek for Plaintiff \nAvesair, Inc. \n \nPatton Boggs LLP by Read K. McCaffrey and Hagan Davis Mangum \nLangley & Hale PLLC by J. Scott Hale for Defendant InPhonic, Inc. \n \nTennille, Judge \n \nI. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n{3} This action was filed in Wake County Superior Court on August 5, \n2004.  This matter was designated a complex business case under Rule 2.1 and 2.2 \nof the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts by order of the \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated June 12, 2006, and \nassigned to the undersigned Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business \nCases by virtue of the same order. \n{4} Defendant filed a Motion for Summary Judgment under Rule 56 on \nApril 16, 2007.  Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment under Rule 56 on \nApril 26, 2007.  The Court heard oral arguments on both motions on June 14, 2007.  \nThe parties have engaged in mediation and, at the Court’s urging, direct \nnegotiations prior to this ruling. \n \nII. \nBACKGROUND \nA. \nTHE PARTIES \n{5} Plaintiff Avesair, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of the \nState of Delaware which had its principal place of business in Cary, Wake County, \nNorth Carolina at all times relevant to this matter.  Plaintiff is now located in \nRaleigh, Wake County, North Carolina. \n{6} Defendant InPhonic, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of \nthe State of Delaware.  InPhonic’s principal place of business is Washington, D.C.  \nInPhonic engages in business in North Carolina and maintained employees in Cary, \nWake County, North Carolina. \nB. \nTHE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT \n{7} The parties are involved in mobile communications.  Plaintiff Avesair \ndeveloped mobile marketing technology used to deliver targeted messages to mobile \ndevices.  Defendant InPhonic distributes mobile phones and provides wireless voice \nand data solutions to consumers. \n{8} The parties negotiated an asset purchase between approximately \nDecember 1, 2002 and April 16, 2003.  (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 12.)  On or about April 16, \n2003, the parties signed a non-binding letter of intent. (Compl. ¶ 12.)  On or about \nMay 13, 2003, the parties signed the Asset Purchase Agreement By and Between \nInPhonic, Inc. and Avesair, Inc. (“APA”). (Compl. ¶ 12.) \n{9} The sections of the APA at issue are as follows: \nIf Buyer [Defendant InPhonic] achieves greater than $2,000,000 in \ngross revenues up to a maximum of $3,333,333 in gross revenues \nduring the twelve (12) month pe riod commencing April 1, 2003 and \nending March 31, 2004 (the “Measuring Period”) as a result of the sale \nof products or services derived from Seller’s [Plaintiff Avesair’s] \nIntellectual Property  . . . Buyer sh all, subject to the provisions of \nSection 2.9 below, issue to Seller within thirty (30) days following April \n1, 2004, additional shares of Buyer’s Common Stock in an amount \nequal to three dollars ($3.00) of Buyer’s Common stock for each one \ndollar ($1.00) of any such gross revenue recognized by Buyer (the \n“Additional Shares”).   \n(APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i).) \nNotwithstanding Section 2.6(a)(i), if (1) Buyer fails to use \nCommercially Reasonable Efforts to sell products or services derived \nfrom Seller’s Intellectual Property, (2) if outside audited financial \ninformation is not provided at the end of the Measuring Period, (3) or \nBuyer terminates more than one of the Transferred Employees hired \nby Buyer after the Closing . . . then  Seller shall receive the number of \nAdditional Shares equal to the maximum net revenues of $3,333,333.   \n(APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii).) \nFor purposes of determining whether Seller is entitled to the \nAdditional Shares pursuant to Sect ion 2.6(a)(i) or Section 2.6(a)(iii) \nabove on or before April 15, 2004, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and \ndelivered to Seller a quarterly statement (the “Revenue Statement”) \nsigned by an officer of Buyer setting forth the actual amount of the \ngross revenue and the basis for such ca lculation.  If, within thirty (30) \ndays following receipt of the Reve nue Statements . . . Seller has not \ngiven Buyer written notice of its objection to the Revenue Statement . . \n. then the Revenue Statement shall be deemed accepted by Seller and \nwill be used to determine whether Seller is entitled to any Additional \nShares pursuant Section 2.6(a)(i). \n(APA ¶ 2.6(b).) \n{10} Defendant provided Plaintiff with financial information on April 29, \n2004.  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  Defendant and Plaintiff disagreed as to whether \nthis financial information was the Revenue Statement.  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4.; \nPl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. n. 2.)  Plaintiff gave Defendant written notice of \nits objection to the financial information provided on April 29, 2004, on May 26, \n2004.  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 5.)  If that financial information was \nthe Revenue Statement, Plaintiff still objected within thirty days of receipt in \naccordance with APA ¶ 2.6(b). \n{11} Both Motions for Summary Judgment focus on whether Defendant \nprovided the “outside audited financial information” required in the APA and \nwhether Plaintiff is entitled to damages for failure to provide the Additional Shares \nspecified in the APA. \n \nIII. \nANALYSIS \nA. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{12} The APA is to be governed by and construed under the laws of the \nState of Delaware.  (APA ¶ 8.8; Case Management Report ¶ q.)  The North Carolina \nSupreme Court “has held that where parties to a contract have agreed that a given \njurisdiction’s substantive law shall govern the interpretation of the contract, such a \ncontractual provision will be given effect.”  Land Co. v. Byrd, 299 N.C. 260, 262, 261 \nS.E.2d 655, 656 (1980). The “law of the forum, North Carolina, governs all matters \nof procedure” when a contract governed by another state’s substantive law is \nlitigated in North Carolina.  Taylor v. Abernethy, 174 N.C. App. 93, 103, 620 S.E.2d \n242, 249 (2005) (citing Arnold v. Charles Enterprises, 264 N.C. 92, 96, 141 S.E.2d \n14, 17 (1965)).  “The question of what is procedure and what is substance is \ndetermined by the law of the forum state.”  Boudreau v. Baughman, 322 N.C. 331, \n339, 368 S.E.2d 849, 856 (1988). \n{13} Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  “It is not the purpose of the \nrule to resolve disputed material issues of fact but rather to determine if such issues \nexist.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56 cmt.  The burden of showing a lack of triable issues of fact \nfalls upon the moving party.  See, e.g., Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co., \n313 N.C. 488, 491, 329 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1985).  Once this burden has been met, the \nnonmoving party must “produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that [it] will \nbe able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.”  Collingwood v. Gen. Elec. \nReal Estate Equities, Inc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989).  The Court \nmust exercise caution in granting a motion for summary judgment.  N.C. Nat’l Bank \nv. Gillespie, 291 N.C. 303, 310, 230 S.E.2d 375, 379 (1976).   \nB. \nBREACH OF CONTRACT \n{14} The situation presented is a difficult one.1  If Plaintiff prevails, it will \nreceive a benefit that was not earned under the earnout provision of the contract, \nbut results from a technical breach of contract by Defendant.  If Defendant prevails \nit will escape liability for ignoring provisions expressly bargained for in the contract \nin order to prevent litigation.  Neither the Court nor the parties have found middle \nground for compromise.  As a result, one must lose.  The Court will present the \nequities on both sides and then explain why it has ruled in favor of Plaintiff. \n{15} The Delaware Supreme Court recognizes many of the same principles \nof contract construction as North Carolina.  Contracts are to be “construed as a \nwhole, to give effect to the intentions of the parties.”  Northwestern Nat’l Ins. Co. v. \nEsmark, Inc., 672 A.2d 41, 43 (Del. 1996) (citations omitted).  The Delaware \nSupreme Court construes contracts, and by extension the intent of the parties, by \nfirst using the plain meaning of the contract.  Seaford Golf & Country Club v. E.I. \nDuPont de Nemours & Co., 925 A.2d 1255, 1260 (2007) (citations omitted).  It also \nholds to the contra proferentem principle of construction that any “ambiguities in a \ncontract should be construed against the drafter.”  Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Del. \n                                                 \n1 The Court has actually drafted two opinions – each granting summary judgment to one \nparty or the other.  It can only enter one of those opinions. \nRacing Ass’n, 840 A.2d 624, 630 (2003).2   If there is an ambiguity, the court is to \nturn once again to the plain meaning of the contract language to discern the intent \nof the parties.  Northwestern, 672 A.2d at 43.  Then the court is to look to extrinsic \nevidence for guidance in interpretation.  Id. \n{16} The terms of the APA called for the transfer of Plaintiff’s assets, both \ntangible and intangible, in exchange for 672,389 shares of Defendant’s Common \nStock and 672,389 shares of Defendant’s D-5 Preferred Stock. (APA ¶¶ 2.1, 2.5.)  \nThe monetary value of the exchange was $7 million worth of Defendant’s stock for \n$2 million in cash and $5 million in assets.  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. \n1. 7.)  Additionally, there was the possibility of $4 million worth of common shares if \nthe earnout threshold was reached.  (See Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1. 7 \nand APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i).)  If the earnout threshold was not met, the Plaintiff would not \nreceive the Additional Shares.  (APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i).)  The up-front consideration with \nan earnout agreement in the form of stock is a common business practice.  See, e.g., \nDale Oesterle, The Inexorable March Toward a Continuous Disclosure Requirement \nfor Publicly Traded Corporations:  “Are We There Yet?,” 20 Cardozo L. Rev. 135, \n171-172 (1998) (presenting the steps common in merger negotiations, including \nexchanging stock and setting an earnout).   \n{17} The APA also included a provision designed to avoid litigation over the \nearnout agreement.  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 12; APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii).)  Mr. \nFrey, a member of the Board of Directors for Plaintiff, stated that the liquidated \nremedies of ¶ 2.6(a)(iii) relieved Plaintiff of the risk that it would lose the Additional \nShares because of its failure “to sustain any such burden of proof” as to whether the \nearnout threshold had been met.  (Frey Aff. ¶ 10.)  The agreement acted to alleviate \nPlaintiff’s burden of proving that the earnout threshold had been met.  (Frey Aff. ¶¶ \n9-10.)  Plaintiff “agreed to a contract in which those revenues were presumed unless \nshown to be the contrary by outside audited financial information.”  (Frey Aff. ¶ 10.)  \n                                                 \n2 For a concise statement of Delaware rules of construction regarding plain meaning \ninterpretation and the intent of the parties, see Haft v. Dart Group Corp., 841 F. Supp. 549, \n564 (D. Del. 1993) and In re Explorer Pipeline Co., 781 A.2d 705, 713-14 (Del. Ch. 2001). \nMr. Frey had experience with difficulties regarding earnout provisions and \n“carefully negotiated” the provision with this presumption.  (Frey Aff. ¶ 10.)   \nPlaintiff’s concern was that once the APA was in place, it no longer had control over \nthe utilization of its assets or the books and records of Defendant.  (Pl.’s Resp. to \nDef.’s Mot. Summ. J. 12.)   Only by utilizing the assets through “commercial[ly] \nreasonable efforts” would Defendant’s revenue be enough to trigger the earnout \nagreement thereby requiring it to provide Plaintiff with more stock.  (Frey Aff. ¶ 8; \nCompl. ¶ 33.)  It would be very difficult for Plaintiff to prove that Defendant did not \nuse commercially reasonable efforts to utilize the assets without the outside audited \nfinancial agreement referenced in APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii).\n3  (Frey Aff. ¶ 10.)  The parties \nagreed to damages as the maximum amount of Additional Shares Plaintiff could \nreceive.  (\nCompare APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii) and APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i).)  The damages encouraged \nDefendant to use commercially reasonable efforts and to provide the outside audited \nfinancial information to Plaintiff which it would need to dispute those efforts and \nthe revenue.  (Compl. ¶ 22.)  Mr. Frey’s uncontradicted testimony establishes that \nthe audit provision was included to protect Plaintiff and avoid litigation. \n{18} However, provision 2.6(a)(iii) in relation to the earnout agreement \ncreated a windfall that may not have been expected, but should have been.  \nProvision 2.6(a)(iii) is a windfall for different reasons.  First, the amount of \ndamages, almost $4 million at the end of the Measuring Period, is over half the total \nvalue of the contract.  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1. 7.)  Second, the \nAdditional Shares in 2.6(a)(i) were further compensation when an earnout threshold \nwas met.  (Pl’s. Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1. 7.; APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i).)  Therefore, \nthe Additional Shares were related to the value of the assets being transferred.  In \n                                                 \n3 The Court notes that these motions only concern Plaintiff’s first claim for relief – \nthe Defendant’s breach of the APA by failure to provide Additional Shares when it did not \nprovide outside audited financial information.  (Compl. ¶ 30.) The Plaintiff’s second claim \nfor relief – Defendant has not used Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell [Plaintiff’s] \nproducts and services, (Compl. ¶ 30), – is still outstanding.  The receipt of the outside \naudited financial information would be at least beneficial (if not necessary) to the Plaintiff \nas it pursues this second claim for relief. \ncontrast, the Additional Shares under 2.6(a)(iii) were not further compensation but \nwere liquidated damages.  Those Additional Shares were related to a technical \nfailure on the part of Defendant and not the value of the assets being transferred.  \n(APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii)(2).)  The windfall could have been easily avoided in two ways.  \nDefendant could have provided the outside audited financial information or, upon \nthe decision to not provide the audited financials, the Additional Shares.  (APA ¶ \n2.6(a)(iii).)   \n{19} Defendant argues in a footnote that the Revenue Statement provided \nin April 2004 is in effect the “outside audited financial information” referred to in \nAPA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii).  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  Defendant then spends the remainder of \nits brief arguing that the provision awarding Plaintiff Additional Shares is an \nillegal penalty.  The Court recognizes that the Additional Shares constitute a \nwindfall to the Plaintiff even though the Court does not agree that the Additional \nShares in the APA should be interpreted as an illegal penalty. \n{20} Defendant argues that there is no question that the earnout targets \nwere not reached and that Plaintiff’s representatives were aware of that fact prior \nto the end of the period based upon information they were receiving from insiders \nwho were former Avesair employees.  Defendant also points to at least one instance \nin which Plaintiff took advantage of Defendant’s mistakes to receive money it would \nnot otherwise have been entitled to receive.\n4  (Def.’s Resp. to Pl’s Mot. Summ. J. 5.) \nThe implication, not entirely unfair, is that Plaintiff made its demand for an audit \nto trap Defendant into breaching the contract as the only way to get at the earnout.  \nThere is no explanation provided for Defendant’s failure to comply with the audit \nrequirement other than Defendant’s position that Plaintiff knew the audited \nmaterial would not show the target had been met. (Def.’s Reply Br. 12.)  Perhaps \nthe failure to comply was only hubris at work in the decision not to comply with the \ncontractual obligation.  Perhaps it was the very ineptitude Plaintiff was relying \nupon.  However, given Defendant’s restatements of income, (\nsee infra ¶ 27), the \n                                                 \n4 Those facts are unrefuted.  Plaintiff argues they are irrelevant. \npossibility exists that there was some other reason Defendant declined to have \nindependent auditors look at the situation.  The reason for Defendant’s decision is \nnot determinative.  The decision itself triggers liability. \n{21} APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii) states that outside audited financial information was \nto be provided by the Defendant to the Plaintiff at the end of the Measuring Period.  \n(APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii).)  The Measuring Period was defined as the “period commencing \nApril 1, 2003 and ending March 31, 2004.”  (APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i).)  Outside audited \nfinancial information is not defined.  The Court recognizes that Delaware’s rules of \ncontract construction, specifically plain meaning interpretation of contract terms, \napply.  (\nSee supra ¶ 15).  \n{22} According to the West Dictionary of Business Law Terms, “internal \naudit” is “[a]n audit conducted by an organization’s personnel.”  A Dictionary of \nBusiness Law Terms (Bryan A. Garner, ed., 1999).  In comparison, an “independent \naudit” is “[a]n audit conducted by an outside person or firm not connected with the \norganization being audited.”  Id. (emphasis added).  While “outside audited financial \ninformation” is not explicitly defined in the referenced dictionary, the Court finds \nthat the term is consistent with the definition of an independent audit and not an \ninternal audit. \n{23} The intent of providing the outside audited financial information was \nfirst to avoid litigation regarding the earnout threshold and second to provide \nPlaintiff with information on whether Defendant used commercially reasonable \nefforts to utilize the assets in the APA. (\nSupra ¶ 17).  The contents of the outside \naudited financial information must bear on both the earnout threshold (revenue) \nand the efforts to utilize the assets (spending) to effectuate the intentions of the \ncontract.  The Revenue Statement does not meet the definition or the intention of \n“outside audited financial information.” \n{24} Using both a plain meaning interpretation of the contract and extrinsic \nevidence regarding the intention of the parties when entering into the contract, the \nCourt finds that Defendant was required to provide something other than the \nRevenue Statement at the end of the Measuring Period, or a reasonable period \nthereafter, which bore both on whether the earnout threshold had been met and \nwhether Defendant used commercially reasonable efforts to utilize the assets in the \nAPA.   \n{25} Defendant provided Plaintiff with its S-1 filing on July 7, 2004. \n(McCaffrey Aff. Ex. A.)  This filing contained the audited consolidated balance \nsheets of InPhonic, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, and December \n31, 2002.  (McCaffrey Aff. Ex. A.)  As Plaintiff aptly pointed out, the S-1 filing does \nnot include the entire Measuring Period defined in the APA.  (Pl.’s Reply Br. 2-3.)  \nThe S-1 filing also does not differentiate or focus on the financial information that \nrelates to the earnout threshold or Defendant’s obligation to use commercially \nreasonable efforts to utilize the assets.  The S-1 filing provided on July 7, 2004, does \nnot fulfill the requirement of APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii)(2). \n{26} In the current matter, the contract required the outside audited \nfinancial information to be provided at the end of the Measuring Period.  (APA ¶ \n2.6(a)(iii)(2).)  However, the financial information was to include the entire \nMeasuring Period.  (APA ¶¶ 2.6(a)(i), (iii).)  The ability to provide outside audited \nfinancial information on the last day the financial information was to include would \nbe Herculean.  As discussed above, (supra ¶ 17), the intent of the parties was to \nprovide Plaintiff with information it would not otherwise have in order to contest \neither the earnout threshold revenues or Defendant’s efforts to utilize the assets.  \nProviding the outside audited financial information on the very day the Measuring \nPeriod ends is not necessary to effectuate these intentions.  Instead, Plaintiff would \nneed well-constructed financial information providing as much information as \npossible.  Requiring the production of financial information in an extremely short \ntime would not fulfill the desire for completeness.  The Court finds no extrinsic \nevidence that would indicate that the provision of the outside audited financial \ninformation by the end of the Measuring Period was necessary to the APA.  A \nreasonable period of at least sixty days would provide time to complete the required \naudit. \n{27} Delaware courts will find a material breach when there has been no \nperformance within a reasonable time.  Hifn, Inc. v. Intel Corp., C.A. No. 1835-VCS, \n2007 Del. Ch. LEXIS 58, at *37.  A reasonable time is inferred when there is no \ntime for performance fixed in a time is of the essence clause.  Id. (citing J.A. Jones \nConst. Co. v. City of Dover, 372 A.2d 540, 550 (Del. Super. 1977)).  Whether the \nfinancial information or the Additional Shares were provided in a reasonable time is \na question of fact.  Id. at 38.  In the present matter, neither the financial \ninformation nor the Additional Shares were ever provided.  (Supra ¶¶ 19-20).  The \nfacts of this case make it clear that the outside audited financial information is still \npertinent even at this late date.  Specifically, Plaintiff notes that there is evidence \nthat Defendant’s financial statements are unreliable because Defendant has \nrestated its income for the two periods directly subsequent to the relevant period.  \n(Pl.’s Reply Br. 2.).  If the statements are unreliable, Plaintiff will need the outside \naudited financial information to question whether the earnout threshold was truly \nnot met.  Also, Plaintiff still has a second cause of action pending in the present \ncase, failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the assets transferred in \nthe APA.  The audit provision was included to provide Plaintiff with independently \nverified information upon which it could rely in making a decision whether it had \nany rights to pursue under the contract.  It had to decide to file this suit without \nthat knowledge.  \n  \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{28} The APA was drafted by Defendant, including the provisions regarding \nthe Additional Shares.5  (Frey Aff. ¶ 11.)  The APA was also negotiated over a \nperiod of time in which Defendant could have objected to the Additional Shares \n                                                 \n5 The APA was drafted by Defendant’s counsel, who are now in the role of belittling \nthe contract for containing a liquidated damages provision it claims acts as an illegal \npenalty.   \nprovisions.6  (Frey Aff. ¶ 11.)  These two facts put the Defendant in a tenuous \nposition from which to challenge the APA.  \n{29} Defendant contends that there were only two possible outcomes \nregarding the Additional Shares:  either revenue was higher than the earnout \nthreshold and Plaintiff received Additional Shares, or revenue was lower than the \nearnout threshold and Plaintiff did not receive Additional Shares.  (Def. Reply Br. \n2.)  However, a reading of APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii) proposes a third outcome:  regardless of \nwhether the earnout threshold was met, if Defendant did not provide Plaintiff with \nan outside audited financial statement, then Plaintiff received Additional Shares.  \n(APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iii).)  This third outcome is the situation before the Court. \n{30} The Court has given considerable thought to the issue of illegal \npenalties and liquidated damages raised by Defendant.  Damages that were worth \n$4 million at the time of the breach are indeed severe when juxtaposed to the \noriginal transaction.  The fact that these damages are the very maximum that \nPlaintiff could ever hope of receiving under the earnout agreement highlights the \nharshness of the amount.  (APA ¶¶ 2.6(a)(i), (iii).)  Defendant has articulated the \nDelaware test of liquidated damages.7  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 7.)  Defendant has \npointed out the inequity involved in allowing Plaintiff to take the Additional Shares \nsimply because an outside audited financial statement was not provided. (Def.’s \nMot. Summ. J. 4; Def.’s Resp. to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1–2.)   \n{31} Plaintiff has not had completely clean hands during the time leading \nup to this matter.  Plaintiff was aware at the time the outside financial information \nwas not provided that the earnout threshold under APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i) was most likely \n                                                 \n6 Neither this statement nor the previous statement regarding the drafting of the \nAPA were objected to in Defendant’s Reply Brief. \n7 “Where (1) the damages that would result from a breach are uncertain or incapable \nof accurate calculation by any accepted rule of law, and (2) the amount fixed is a reasonable \nforecast of such damages, the provision is one for liquidated damages and will be enforced \nlike any other. Conversely, if the provision fails to meet one of these criteria, the damages \nstemming from a breach being easily ascertainable or the amount fixed excessive, the \nprovision is void as a penalty.”  W&G Seaford Assocs., L.P. v. E. Shore Mkts., Inc., 714 \nF.Supp. 1336, 1347 (1989) (citing Wilmington Hous. Auth., 665 F.Supp. 351, 354 (1987)). \nnot met.  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4-5.)  Defendant cites several correspondences \nplainly outlining that Plaintiff had no expectation that the earnout threshold would \nbe met.  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4-5.)  Plaintiff does not dispute the content of those \ncorrespondences but only disputes that Plaintiff had accepted that the earnout \nthreshold had not been met.  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  Plaintiff is \ncorrect in that whether or not the earnout threshold was met is not at the crux of \nthe current motion.  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  However, the intent of \nthe outside audited financial information was to confirm the revenues that \ndetermined whether the earnout threshold had been met and to avoid litigation \nover that matter.  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 11, 12; Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  \nThe intention of the parties lends itself to assigning damages.   \n{32} The Court has also considered the fact that Plaintiff did not file for \nspecific performance to obtain the outside audited financial information, but instead \nhas initiated this breach of contract action seeking damages which are significant \ncompared to the scope of the underlying transaction.  The Court finds it interesting \nthat while the purpose of the damages provision in 2.6(a)(iii) was to avoid litigation, \n(supra ¶ 17), Plaintiff has initiated this suit based on that provision without seeking \nthe outside audited financial information.  Plaintiff did send one correspondence \nafter the Measuring Period regarding the outside audited financial information, but \nthat correspondence requested the Additional Shares and not the audited financial \ninformation.8  (Pl.’s Resp. to Def’.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 5.) \n{33} As the Court noted earlier, (supra n. 3), Plaintiff still has another \nclaim for relief pending.  Plaintiff has accused Defendant of not using Commercially \nReasonable Efforts to utilize the assets transferred under the APA.  (Compl. ¶ 30.)  \nTo pursue this claim, Plaintiff could have used the outside audited financial \ninformation.  The reasoning for requiring the outside audited financial information \nwas two fold:  to determine if commercially reasonable efforts were used and to \n                                                 \n8 In the same correspondence, Plaintiff objected to the financial information that had \npreviously been provided by the Defendant. \ncheck the accuracy of the Revenue Statement figures that would determine whether \nPlaintiff was to receive Additional Shares under APA ¶ 2.6(a)(i).  The intent of the \nparties was to avoid litigation over both of these matters even though arbitration \nwas not agreed to for breaches of APA ¶ 2.6(a)(iiii).  (Compl. ¶ 32.)   \n{34} This is a difficult case.  The Court has considered what alternatives it \nmight have to reach some compromise that might appear fairer.  Should the Court, \non its own motion, require specific performance and order an independent audit \nrequiring Defendant to pay Plaintiff’s legal fees in obtaining the audit?  No one \nasked for that relief.  It would, in essence, deprive Plaintiff of the specific thing it \nbargained for – an audit or distribution of the shares without litigation over the \nearnout.  The Court would be rewriting the contract.  Should the Court find that \nthere was a breach, but leave it to a jury to decide damages?  Again, that remedy \nwould deprive Plaintiff of its negotiated bargain, and the Court would be rewriting \nthe contract. \n{35} There is certainly a strong argument to be made that Plaintiff will \nreceive a windfall and that it intentionally took advantage of Defendant’s failure to \nunderstand its contractual obligations.  In this Court’s view, the more important \nconsideration is the obligation of the courts to enforce contracts as they are written.  \nThis contract was negotiated at arm’s length.  It was drafted by Defendant.  It \ncontained one specific provision for the protection of Plaintiff in the earnout \nprovisions.  Defendant failed to comply with that provision.  The contract is \nunambiguous with respect to the remedy for that failure.  Plaintiff was entitled to a \ndistribution of stock with a value of $3,999,999.99 upon Defendant’s breach.  The \nCourt concludes that Defendant breached the contract and Plaintiff is entitled to \ndamages in the amount of $3,999,999.99.  Plaintiff is entitled to interest at the \nstatutory rate from the date of breach, which the Court finds is a reasonable period \nof sixty days after the close of the earnout period to provide the audited statement, \nor May 31, 2004. \n{36} The Court will not act to rewrite this contract nor will it save the \nDefendant from the consequences of its bargain.  The Delaware Supreme Court \nstates appropriately that “the fundamental maxim [of contract construction is] that \nthe parties are bound by the terms of their own agreement.”  Harry H. Rosin Co. v. \nEksterowicz, 73 A.2d 648, 651 (Del. Ch. 1950).  The Defendant finds itself in the \nunenviable position of being the party to a contract whose terms are burdensome, \nbut which must be adhered to nonetheless.   \n{37} Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED: \n1. Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. \n2. Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Its First Claim for Relief \nis GRANTED  \n3. Plaintiff is entitled to recover $3,999,999.99 as damages for \nDefendant’s breach of contract together with interest from the date of \nbreach. \n \nThis the 16th day of October, 2007. "
