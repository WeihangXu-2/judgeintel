  "raw_text": " \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 5594 \n \nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC \nand DUKE ENERGY PROGRESS, \nLLC, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nAG INSURANCE SA/NV (f/k/a \nL’Etoile S.A. Belge d’Assurances); et \nal., \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nARROWOOD INDEMNITY \nCOMPANY’S MOTION FOR \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE \nSTATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND \nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS, LLC’S \nMOTION TO STRIKE INADMISSIBLE \nSETTLEMENT COMMUNICATIONS \n \n \n1. THIS MATTER  is before the Court  on Defendant Arrowood Indemnity \nCompany’s1 Motion for Summary Judgment on the Statute of Limitations  filed on \nJuly 10, 2020  (the “Motion”), (ECF No. 770) , and Plaintiff Duke Energy Carolinas, \nLLC’s (“DEC”) (formerly Duke Power Company) 2 Motion to Strike Inadmissible \nSettlement Communications (the “Motion to Strike”), (ECF No. 785).   \n2. This action focuses on whether Defendants—all insurers who issued excess \nlevel insurance policies to DEC and DEP—are obligated to compensate those entities \nfor alleged liabilities linked to coal combustion residuals (“CCRs”), i.e., coal ash, at \nfifteen power plants DEC or DEP owns in North and South Carolina. \n \n1 Defendant Arrowood Indemnity Company’s predecessor, Royal Indemnity Company, and its \nrelated affiliates Royal Insurance Company and Royal & SunAlliance , took certain actions \nreferenced in this Order and Opinion .  To avoid confusion, the Court will reference these \nthree Royal entities and Arrowood Indemnity Company interchangeably in this Order and \nOpinion as “Arrowood.” \n \n2 DEC, its predecessor Duke Power Company,  and another entity taking actions referenced \nherein, Duke Energy Corporation,  will be referenced interchangeably in this Order and \nOpinion as “Duke.”  Plaintiff Duke Energy Progress, LLC (“DEP”) (formerly Carolina Power \n& Light Company) is not involved in the current Motion. \nDuke Energy Carolinas, LLC v. AG Ins. SA/NV, 2021 NCBC 11. \n3. Arrowood’s Motion puts at issue whether certain letters Duke and Arrowood \nexchanged between 1997 and 2001 triggered the applicable three -year statute of \nlimitations for Duke’s claims against Arrowood and thus whether this action, filed \nagainst Arrowood in 2017, is time -barred.  Having considered the Motion, the \nmaterials submitted in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the arguments of \ncounsel at the hearing on the Motion, and  other appropriate matters of record, the \nCourt hereby DENIES Arrowood’s Motion and GRANTS Duke’s Motion to Strike. \nPillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, by Mark J.

The Court does not make findings of fact on motions for summary judgment \nbut rather summarizes material facts it considers to be uncontested. \n5. It is undisputed that Arrowood issued an excess liability insurance policy to \nDuke (Policy No. EC103320) for the period October 31, 1984 to October 31, 1985 (the \n“Arrowood Policy” or the “Policy”).  (Arrowood’s Mot. Summ. J. Statute Limitations  \nEx. 1  [hereinafter “Arrowood Policy”] , ECF No. 77 6.1;\n3 Arrowood’s Mot. Summ. J. \nStatute Limitations Ex. 5 [hereinafter “Duke’s Version of Arrowood Policy”], ECF No. \n \n3 Where Arrowood’s and Duke’s proffered versions of the Policy are the same, the Court will \ncite to the Arrowood Policy at ECF No. 776.1 for ease of reference. \n776.5.)  Although Duke and Arrowood dispute whether the Policy contains a specific \nendorsement concerning its underlying first-layer insurance policy,4 the parties agree \nthat the Policy follows form to the Ranger Policy.5  (DEC’s Redacted Opp’n Arrowood’s \nMot. Summ. J. Statute Limitations 5 [hereinafter “Duke’s Opp’n Br.”], ECF No. 825.)6  \nThe parties also agree that the Arrowood Policy attaches at $52 million for each \noccurrence.  (Arrowood Policy at Item 4; Ranger Policy at Item No. 6, Underlying \nLimits Schedule No. 1 ; Arrowood’s Redacted Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ . J. Statute \nLimitations 4 [hereinafter “Arrowood’s Mem. Supp.”], ECF No. 775 ;7 Duke’s Opp’n \nBr. 1, 4.) \n6. Under the Policy, Arrowood (the “Company” under the Policy) is required  to \nindemnify Duke ( the “Insured” under the Policy ) “only [for] loss in excess of such \nunderlying limits [,]” and the Policy  “shall attach . . . only after the underlying \n \n4 Arrowood contends that the Policy contains an Endorsement #6, which lists as its \nunderlying policy Ranger Insurance Company policy number EUL300579 (the “Ranger \nPolicy”).  (Arrowood Policy at Endorsement #6; Ranger Ins. Co. Policy No. EUL300579 \n[hereinafter “Ranger Policy”], ECF No. 591.12.)  Duke disagrees.  ( Duke’s Version of \nArrowood Policy.)    \n \n5 A policy that “follows form” or a “following form policy” is one that “insures the same risks \ncovered by the underlying policy . . . but provides coverage to the insured in addition to and \nin excess of the coverage provided by [the underlying policy].”  Hartford Accident & Indem. \nCo. v. Chi. Hous. Auth., 12 F.3d 92, 95 (7th Cir. 1993).  As this Court has previously explained: \n“For example, Excess Insurer offers Excess Policy B to provide excess coverage on another \npolicy held by Policyholder, Primary Policy  A.  Excess Policy  B’s language defines Excess \nPolicy B’s coverage by incorporating Primary Policy A’s terms.  Excess Policy B ‘follows form’ \nto Primary Policy A or is said to provide follow-form coverage.”  Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC \nv. AG Ins. SA/NV, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 54, at *8 n.2 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 4, 2018). \n \n6 Duke filed its brief in opposition to the Motion under seal.  (ECF No. 788.)  For purposes of \nthis Order and Opinion, the Court will reference the redacted, public version.  (ECF No. 825.)  \n \n7 Arrowood filed its memorandum in support of its Motion under seal.  (ECF No. 771.)  For \npurposes of this Order and Opinion, the Court will refer ence the redacted, public version.  \n(ECF No. 775.) \ninsurers have paid or have been held to pay the full amount of their respective loss \nliability as described in the underlying limits[.]”  ( Arrowood Policy at Insuring \nAgreements 1–2.) \n7. The Policy contains a “Notice of Occurrence” Condition, which states:  \nWhenever the Insured has information from which they may reasonably \nconclude that an occurrence covered hereunder involves injuries or \ndamage which, in [the] event that the Insured shall be held liable, is \nlikely to involve this policy, notice shall be sent to the Company as soon \nas practicab le, provided however, that failure to give notice of any \noccurrence which at the time of its happening did not appear to involve \nthis policy, but which, at a later date, would appear to give rise to claims \nhereunder, shall not prejudice such claims[.] \n \n(Arrowood Policy at Condition 2.) \n8. The Policy also contains an “Action Against Company” Condition: \nNo action shall lie against the Company unless, as a condition precedent \nthereto, the Insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this \npolicy, nor until the amount of the Insured’s obligation to pay shall have \nbeen finally determined either by judgment against the Insured after \nactual trial or by written agreement of the Insured, the claimant and \nthe Company. \n \n(Arrowood Policy at Condition 8.) \n9. The Ranger Policy defines “occurrence ,” in relevant part , as “an accident, \nevent or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in  . . . \nPROPERTY DAMAGE, subject to the following clarifications [,]” which include “all \ninjury, damage or loss of use and all claims for injury, damage or loss of use arising \nout of the same accident, the same event or exposure to substantially the same \ngeneral conditions shall be considered as arising out of and comprisi ng a single \nOCCURRENCE[.]”  (Ranger Policy at §§ III(i), III(i)(1).) \n10. The current dispute between Duke and Arrowood centers on the \ninterpretation of certain  letters, identified below, the companies sent to each other \nbetween 1997 and 2001, as well as in 2016 and 2017, regarding the Arrowood Policy.   \nA. Duke’s 1997 Notice \n11. On February 13, 1997, Duke ’s Associate General Counsel sent a letter  to \nArrowood’s Asbestos Manager with the subject line:  \nInsured: [Duke] \nSites/Claims: Asbestos-Related Bodily Injury and Various Property \nDamage (See Attachment) \n \n(Arrowood’s Mot. Summ. J. Statute Limitations Ex. 2 at 1 [hereinafter “1997 Notice”], \nECF No. 776.2.)  The letter begins: \n[Duke] is writing to provide you with notice of certain claims and/or \ncircumstances that may give rise to certain claims for coverage .  Our \nrecords reflect that you issued D uke at least policy no. EC 103320 \n(10/31/84 – 10/31/85). \n \n(1997 Notice.)   \n12. Following a one-paragraph section titled “Asbestos -Related Bodily Injury \nClaims[,]” the  letter contains a six -page section titled “Environmental Property \nDamage Claims.”  (1997 Notice §§ I, II.)  Part B of this second section concerns “Coal-\nFired Power Plants” and identifies eight Duke -owned power plants in North and \nSouth Carolina.  The letter states that at five of the eight plants listed, groundwater \ntesting has shown “ the presence of contaminants above applicable state cleanup \ncriteria.”  (See 1997 Notice § II.B.1–2, 5–6, 8 (Allen (“Ground water sampling at this \nsite show the presence of contaminants above the applicable state cleanup criteria.”); \nBelews Creek (“Testing from these wells show the presence of contaminants in the \nground water above the applicable state cleanup criteria.”); Dan River (“Sampling of \nground water at the site demonstrates the presence of contaminants above the \napplicable state cleanup criteria.”); Marshall (“Sampling of ground water at this site \ndemonstrates the presence of contaminants above the ap plicable state cleanup \ncriteria.”); and Lee (“Sampling of ground water at this site demonstrates the presence \nof contaminants above the applicable state cleanup criteria.”) ).)  The letter further \nstates that “[n]o investigation has been conducted at [either Cliffside or Riverbend] \nto date” and that “ [n]o investigations or cleanup have been conducted at [Buck] to \ndate.”  (1997 Notice § II.B.3–4, 7.) \n13. The final sentence of the letter provides : “Please let us know as soon as \npossible if you believe that the policy(ies) sold by you to Duke do not provide defense \nand/or indemnity for the claims identified above.”  (1997 Notice.) \nB. Duke’s February 2000 Letter \n14. On February 29, 2000, Duke’s Deputy General Counsel sent a letter to \nArrowood’s Assistant Vice President  of Excess & Surplus Claims regarding both \nenvironmental and asbestos-related claims (“February 2000 Letter”).  (Duke’s Opp’n \nBr. Ex. 5 Feb. 29, 2000 Letter [ hereinafter “Feb. 2000 Letter”], ECF No. 7 94.)  The \nsubject line of that letter states:  \nInsured: [Duke] \n \nSites/Claims: Various Property Damage (See Attachment) and \nAsbestos-Related Bodily Injury Claims \n \n(Feb. 2000 Letter 1.) \n15. The letter specifically addresses “Duke’s environmental claims”: \nAs to your statement that further information is needed with regard to \nDuke’s environmental claims, we have voluminous documentation for \neach of the sites.  If you would like to review these documents at Duke’s \noffices, please let me know.  Alternatively, if you could be more specific \nas to the type of information you need, we are prepared to provide you \ncopies at your expense.  We note, however, that at the present time, Duke \ndoes not believe that it is reasonably likely that the costs for any of its \nenvironmental liabilities will exhaust the coverage underlying the \n[Arrowood] policy, which attaches at $50 million. \n \n(Feb. 2000 Letter 1 (emphasis added).)  \n16. The February 2000 Letter continues as to “Duke’s asbestos-related claims”: \nNevertheless, [Arrowood] is required to provide indemnification for \nDuke’s asbestos-related claims because Duke has spent an amount in \nexcess of the underlying limits of the [Arrowood] coverage.  [Arrowood] \nis obligated to indemnify Duke regardless of whether the underlying \ncarriers have provided indemnification.  \n \n(Feb. 2000 Letter 2.) \n17. Several months later, Duke’s Deputy General Counsel  sent a letter dated \nJune 6, 2000 to Arrowood (“June 2000 Letter”) stating, in relevant part, that “[w]e do \nnot disagree with your conclusion that [Arrowood] has ‘no duty’ as an excess insurer \nto investigate [Duke’s] asbestos and environmental claims.”  (Duke’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 6 \nJune 6, 2000 Letter [hereinafter “June 2000 Letter”], ECF No. 795.) \nC. Arrowood’s 2001 Letter \n18. On May 24, 2001, a Technical Analyst with Arrowood’s Environmental \nClaims Department sent a letter to Duke .  (Arrowood’s Mot. Summ. J. Statute \nLimitations Ex. 3 [hereinafter “2001 Letter”], ECF No. 776.3.)  The subject line states:  \nInsured: [Duke] \nSubject: Asbestos-Related Bodily Injury Claims \nPollution Related Property Damage Claims \n Policy No: REC103320 (10/31/84 to 10/31/85) \n Claim No: 0700011047-00 \n \n(2001 Letter 1.) \n19. The 2001 L etter begins: “Please consider this correspondence as our \nacknowledgment of the above captioned claims , which we have not received in their \nentirety.  This letter will set forth our coverage position with regards to these \nmatters.”  (2001 Letter 1.)   \n20. The 2001 Letter later continues:  \nPolicy REC103320 (10/31/84 to 10/31/85) is an Excess Umbrella Policy.  \nPolicy REC103320 (10/31/84 to 10/31/85) has policy limits of $12,000,000 \npart of $25,000,000 each occurrence and in the aggregate where \napplicable excess $50,000,000 each occurrence and in the aggregate \nwhere applicable excess primary.  Policy REC103320 (10 /31/84 to \n10/31/85) is excess of the underlying umbrella carrier, Ranger Insurance \nCompany policy.  We have not received any information to date that \nwould indicate that the layers of insurance below ours have been \nexhausted.  [Arrowood]  will not provide f or any of the defenses and/or \nindemnification of any matter until such time as all applicable \nunderlying insurance coverage is exhausted. \n \nWe have reviewed these matters for coverage under policy REC103320 \n(10/31/84 to 10/31/85) with [Arrowood] and now wish to inform you our \nfindings. \n \n(2001 Letter 1.) \n21. Following a section titled “Asbestos -Related Bodily Injury Claims[,]” the \nletter contains a second section titled “Pollution Property Damage Claims[.]”  (2001 \nLetter at 2.)  This second section provides that: \nThe information provided is very limited as to the facts and details \nsurrounding the pollution property damage claims.  According to the \ninformation received, various pollutants have been found at the property \nsites, including but not limited to . . . Coal-Fired Power Plants . . ., which \nresulted in the contamination of the soil and groundwater. \n \n(2001 Letter 2.) \n22. After quoting various provisions of the Arrowood P olicy, the letter then \nstates: \nWith regard to the Pollution -Related Property Damage claims, which \nincludes the soil and groundwater contamination caused by various \npollutants.  We refer you to the endorsement,  \nSudden and Accidental Pollution/Contamination on Air, Land \nand Water Exclusion  found under policy REC103320 (10/31/84 to \n10/31/85), which states: . . .  \n \nIn consideration of the premium charged, it is agreed that this coverage \nafforded by this policy shall not apply to any liability for personal injury \nor property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or \nescape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, \nliquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants, or \npollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any water course or body \nof water, but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, \nrelease or escape is sudden and accidental. \n \n(2001 Letter 5–6.) \n23. Arrowood then states its determination:  “Based on the aforementioned \npollution exclusion, [Arrowood] respectfully declines coverage for both indemnity and \ndefense for the Pollution-Related Property Damage claims.”  (2001 Letter 6.) \n24. The letter concludes:  \n[Arrowood] declines coverage for indemnity and defense in the Pollution-\nRelated Property Damage claims, as the Pollution Exclusion preclude[s] \ncoverage under policy REC103320 (10/31/84 to 10/31/85).  We trust that \nwe have adequately explained why the captioned policy would not \nrespond to the Pollution-Related Property Damage claims. \n \nShould there be any addition al information that would warrant our \nreconsideration, please forward it to the undersigned for review.  If you \nhave any questions concerning this letter , please contact the \nundersigned directly[.]   \n \n(2001 Letter 7.)  It is undisputed that Duke did not respond to the 2001 Letter.   \nD. Duke’s 2016 Notice \n25. Over fifteen years later, on August 29, 2016, Duke, on behalf of itself “ and \nits subsidiaries, affiliates, and predecessors” sent a letter to Arrowood (“2016 Notice”) \nstating that the letter:  \nprovides notice and/or updated notice, of occurrences that either have or \nmay give rise to claims that are covered under insurance policies issued \nby you.  Duke faces, or may face, liability in connection with its coal \ncombustion residuals (“CCRs”), including CCR impoundments, landfills, \nand other areas with CCRs, at various power plants, including bu t not \nlimited to in North Carolina, [and] South Carolina[.] . . . It has been \nalleged that these CCR units have caused third-party property damage, \nincluding contamination of groundwater and surface water.  Duke is \nbeing, or may in the future be, compelled to remediate this alleged third-\nparty property damage under state and federal law.  Duke hereby \nprovides notice under policies issued by you in connection with Duke’s \nCCR-related liability. \n \n(Duke’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 12 Aug. 29, 2016 Letter 1 [hereinafter “2016 Notice”], ECF No. \n801.) \n26. In the 2016 Notice, Duke states that it faces or may face potential liability \nfrom several sources, including under North Carolina’s Coal Ash Management Act \n(“CAMA”) enacted in September 2014 and the applicable federal “CCR Rule” effective \nin April 2015, as well as other state and federal statutes and regulations .  The 2016 \nNotice further provides that:  \nDuke may be, and in some instances already is, required to incur \nsubstantial costs to remediate  alleged third- party property damage \nallegedly emanating from CCR.  These costs either exceed the retentions \nand/or limits underlying your policies or threaten to do so.  Duke hereby \nnotifies you that coverage may be due to it under the terms of your \npolicies. \n \n(2016 Notice 4.) \nE. Duke’s 2017 Letters \n27. After receiving a Dec ember 6, 2016 letter from Arrowood asking for more \ninformation and reserving all rights under the Policy, ( Duke’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 13 Dec. \n6, 2016 Letter, ECF No. 802), Duke sent letters to Arrowood on Feb ruary 6 and 13, \n2017, stating that Duke faces “current liability” under CAMA and “additional \nliability” under the federal CCR Rule, (Duke’s Opp’n Br. Ex.14 Feb. 6, 2017 Letter 2, \nECF No. 803; Duke’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 15 Feb. 13, 2017 Letter 2, 4 [hereinafter “Feb. 13, \n2017 Letter”], ECF No. 8 04).  Duke’s February 13, 2017 letter further stated that \n“[t]he policy in Duke’s files does not contain a qualified pollution exclusion.”  (Feb. 13, \n2017 Letter 4.) \nF. Arrowood’s 2017 Letter \n28. By letter dated March 14, 2017 (“2017 Letter”) , Arrowood responded to \nDuke’s February 2017 letters .  ( Duke’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 16 Mar. 14, 2017 Letter \n[hereinafter “2017 Letter”], ECF No. 805 ; Second Aff. Ryan G. Rudich Supp. \nArrowood’s Mot. Summ. J. Statute Limitations Ex. 25 , Arrowood Mar. 14, 2017 \nLetter, ECF No. 838.4.)  The 2017 L etter explains that a pollution exclusion in the \nPolicy (“Pollution Exclusion”) excludes coverage for coal ash liability and provides, in \nrelevant part: \nAs previously stated, the [Duke] Policy contains Endorsement # 8 that, \nin short, excludes coverage of any liability arising out of pollution (the \n“Pollution Exclusion”).  [Duke], however, asserts that its copy of the \n[Duke] Policy does not include the Pollu tion Exclusion.  Please clarify \nwhether [Duke] agrees or disagrees that the [Duke] Policy includes the \nPollution Exclusion. \n \n(2017 Letter 1–2.) \n29. The 2017 Letter then refers to the 2001 Letter as a letter denying coverage \nfor Duke’s coal ash liability based on the Policy’s Pollution Exclusion: \nOn May 24, 2001, in a letter written in response to claims submitted \nunder the [Duke] Policy, Arrowood denied coverage for the Pollution -\nRelated Property Damage claims because the Policy contained the \nPollution Exclusion, which Arrowood quoted verbatim on page 6 of its \nletter.  This letter was addressed to Mr. Poe at [Duke].  [Duke] did not \ndeny that the Policy included a pollution exclusion. \n \n(2017 Letter 2.) \n30. Further, the 2017 Letter states that “Arrowood reserves all rights under the \n[Duke] Policy in connection with the seven CCR sites.”  (2017 Letter 2.) \n31. Shortly thereafter, on March 29, 2017, Duke filed this lawsuit , seeking \ncoverage for its coal ash remediation costs under numerous insurance policies, \nincluding the Arrowood Policy.  (Compl., ECF No. 1.) \n32. After full briefing, t he Court held a hearing on the Motion s on October 6, \n2020 by WebEx video conference (the “Hearing”), at which  all parties were \nrepresented by counsel.  The Motions are now ripe for resolution. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n33. Under Rule 56  of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”) , \n“[s]ummary judgment is appropriate ‘if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.’ ”  Da Silva v. WakeMed, 375 N.C. 1, 10 (2020) (quoting \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  “An issue is ‘genuine’ if it can be proven by substantial evidence \nand a fact is ‘material’ if it would constitute or irrevocably establish any material \nelement of a claim or a defense.”   Fullwood v. Barnes, 250 N.C. App. 31, 36 (2016) \n(quoting Lowe v. Bradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369 (1982)).  “Substantial evidence is such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion and means more than a scintilla or a permissible inference[.]”   DeWitt v. \nEveready Battery Co. , 355 N.C. 672, 681 (2002) (citati ons and internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The Court must view the evidence “in a light most favorable to the \nnon-moving party .”  McCutchen v. McCutchen, 360 N.C. 280, 286 (2006) (citation \nomitted). \n34. “The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579 (2002).  The movant may meet this burden either: \n(1) “by proving an essential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, \ncannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense ” or (2) “ by \nshowing through discovery that the opposing party cannot pr oduce evidence to \nsupport an essential element of [its] claim[.]”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83 (2000) \n(citations omitted).  If the movant  meets its burden, “the burden  then shifts to the \nnonmovant to come forward with specific facts establishing the presence of a genuine \nfactual dispute for trial.”  Pennington, 356 N.C. at 579; see also N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e) \n(“[A]n adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, \nbut his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth \nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n35. As an initial matter , “an insurance policy is a contract and its provisions \ngovern the rights and duties of the parties thereto.”  Fid . Bankers Life Ins. Co. v. \nDortch, 318 N.C. 378, 380 (1986).  The Supreme Court of North Carolina has recently \narticulated the relevant standa rds for the interpretation and construction of an \ninsurance policy as follows: \nWhen interpreting an insurance policy, courts apply general contract \ninterpretation rules.  See, e.g., Wachovia Bank & Tr. Co. v. Westchester \nFire Ins. Co., 276 N.C. 348, 172 S.E.2d 518 (1970).  “As in other \ncontracts, the objective of construction of terms in an insurance policy is \nto arrive at the insurance coverage intended by the parties when the \npolicy was issued.”  Id. at 354, 172 S.E.2d at 522 (citing McDowell Motor \nCo. v. N.Y. Underwriters Ins. Co., 233 N.C. 251, 63 S.E.2d 538 (1951); \nKirkley v. Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 232 N.C. 292, 59 S.E.2d 629 \n(1950)).  In North Carolina, determining the meaning of language in an \ninsurance policy presents a question of law for the Court.  Id. \n \nWhen interpreting the relevant provisions of the insurance policy at \nissue, North Carolina courts have long held that any ambiguity or \nuncertainty as to the words used in the policy should be construed \nagainst the insurance company and in favor of the policyholder or \nbeneficiary.  Id.  If a court finds that no ambiguity exists, however, the \ncourt must construe the document according to its terms.  Id. (citing \nWilliams v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 269 N.C. 235, 238, 152 S.E.2d 102, \n105 (1967)). \n \nAmbiguity is not established by the mere fact that the insured asserts \nan understanding of the policy that differs from that of the insurance \ncompany.  Wachovia Bank & Tr. Co., 276 N.C. at 354, 172 S.E.2d at 522.  \nRather, ambiguity exists if, in the opinion of the court, the language is \n“fairly and reasonably susceptible to either of the constructions for \nwhich the parties contend.”  Id.  The court may not remake the policy or \n“impose liability upon the company which it did not assume and for \nwhich the policyholder did not pay.”  Id. \n \nIf the policy contains a definition of a term, the court applies that \nmeaning unless the context requires otherwise.  Id.   However,  if the \npolicy fails to define a term, the court must define the term in a manner \nthat is consistent with the context in which the term is used, and the \nmeaning accorded to it in ordinary speech.  Id. (citing Peirson v. Am. \nHardware Mut. Ins. Co., 249 N.C. 580, 107 S.E.2d 137 (1959)). \n \nAccardi v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 373 N.C. 292, 295 (2020). \n36. Our courts have further instructed that “[t]he various terms of the policy are \nto be harmoniously construed, and if possible, every word and every provision is to be \ngiven effect.”  Woods v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 295 N.C. 500, 506 (1978) ; see also \nHarleysville Mut. Ins. Co. v. Buzz Off Insect Shield, L.L.C., 364 N.C. 1, 9 (2010) (“We \nconstrue all clauses of an insurance policy together,  if possible, so as to bring them \ninto harmony. ” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) ).  Moreover , “a \ncontract of insurance should be given that construction which a reasonable person in \nthe position of the insured would have understood it to mean[.]”  Grant v. Emmco Ins. \nCo., 295 N.C. 39, 43 (1978).  In sum, the “intention of the parties as gathered from \nthe language used in the policy is the polar star that must guide the courts[.]”  Cowell \nv. Gaston Cty., 190 N.C. App. 743, 746 (2008) (quoting McDowell Motor Co., 233 N.C. \nat 253).  \n37. Arrowood contends that Duke’s 1997 Notice constituted a “notice of \noccurrence” under the Policy that required Arrowood to determine whether the Policy \ncovered Duke’s liabilities arising from groundwater contamination at Duke’s coal ash \nbasins as described in the 1997 Notice.  Because Arrowood expressly denied coverage \nfor any such liability based on the Policy’s Pollution Exclusion in its 2001 Letter , \nArrowood argues that the applicable three-year statute of limitations under N.C.G.S. \n§ 1 -52(1) began to run  in May 2001 and that Duke’s failure to sue Arrowood for \nArrowood’s alleged breach of the Policy’s coverage provisions until 2017 necessitates \nthe dismissal of Duke’s claims as time-barred.  (Arrowood’s Mem. Supp. 7–8, 10, 12.)  \n38. Duke argues in response that Arrowood’s motion should be denied because \n“Duke could not and did not make a ‘claim’ to Arrowood for coal ash in 1997,” and \nthus that “there was no ‘claim’ for Arrowood to deny in 2001.”  (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 2.)  \nDuke further contends that Arrowood’s motion is without merit because Duke was \nnot “at liberty to sue” Arrowood until 2014 on grounds that “Duke had no coal ash \nliability and had spent no money on coal ash liability” until that time, and that even \nif Duke could have sued Arrowood prior to 2004, Duke had no duty under North \nCarolina law to do so.  ( Duke’s Opp’n Br. 2, 7, 18–21.)  Duke  also argues that \napplication of the continuing duty principle applied by the North Carolina Court of \nAppeals in Duke University v. St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co., 95 N.C. App. 663, 672 \n(1989), dooms Arrowood’s motion, and, further, that Arrowood’s contentions of \nprejudice due to Duke’s delay in filing this action are baseless and, in any event, \nirrelevant under proper statute of limitations analysis.  (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 21–24.) \n39. “Notice provisions in insurance contracts have long been recognized as valid \nin North Carolina.”  Royal Ins. Co. of Am. v. Cato Corp., 125 N.C. App. 544, 549 (1997).  \n“The purpose and intention of an insurance contract’s notice provision is to enable \nthe insurer to begin its investigation and to initiate other procedures as soon as \npossible after a claim arises, and to avoid any prejudice that might be caused by a \ndelay in receiving notice.”  S.C. Ins. Co. v. Hallmark Enters., 88 N.C. App. 642, \n646, disc. rev. denied, 322 N.C. 482 (1988).  “Unless  the insured . . . can show \ncompliance with the requirement, the insurer is relieved of liability.”  Cato Corp., 125 \nN.C. App. at 549 (quoting Davenport v. Indem. Co., 283 N.C. 234, 238 (1973)). \n40. The Policy here provides that an “occurrence” is, in relevant part, “an \naccident, event or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result \nin . . . PROPERTY DAMAGE[.]”  (Ranger Policy at § III(i).)  The Notice of Occurrence \nCondition in the Policy requires Duke to provide notice  “[w]henever [Duke] has \ninformation from which [Duke] may reasonably conclude that an occurrence covered \nhereunder involves injuries or damages which, in [ the] event that [Duke] shall be \nheld liable, is likely to involve this policy [.]”  (Arrowood Policy at Condition 2  \n(emphasis added).)   This same provision goes on to distinguish between an \n“occurrence” and a “claim,” noting that “failure to give notice of any occurrence which \nat the time of its happening did not appear to involve this policy, but which at a later \ndate, would appear to give rise to claims hereunder, shall not prejudice such claims.”  \n(Arrowood Policy at Condition 2 (emphasis added).)  But, as noted, the Policy’s notice \nobligation speaks only to an “occurrence,” not a “claim.”   \n41. The Court now examines Duke’s 1997 Notice against these Policy provisions.  \nDuke argues that its 1997 Notice did not constitute notice of a ny “claim” concerning \ncoal ash liability and instead simply provided a “notice of circumstances” that \npotentially might give rise to a “claim” at some later date.  For its support , Duke \npoints to its opening language in the 1997 Notice—“[Duke] is writing to provide you \nwith notice of certain claims and/or circumstances that may give rise to certain claims \nfor coverage”—and the fact that the 1997 Notice did not identify any “claims, suits, \nor liability, described no further action as being required, and described no money \nspent” at any of the listed plants.  (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 7.)  Arrowood contends that a \n“notice of occurrence” was the only notice required or contemplated under the Policy, \nthat Duke’s 1997 Notice was necessarily such a notice, and that Duke’s distinction \nbetween “claims” and “circumstances” is meaningless under the Policy’s plain \nprovisions.  (Arrowood’s Reply Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Su mm. J. Statute Limitations \n2–3, ECF No. 837.)   \n42. Although the parties have given considerable attention to these competing \npositions in their briefing and arguments, the Court concludes that it need not dwell \non them here in light of Duke’s subsequent communications  to Arrowood prior to \nArrowood’s 2001 Letter.  In particular, it is undisputed that Duke advised Arrowood \nin its February 2000 Letter that “at the present time, Duke does not believe that it is \nreasonably likely that the costs for any of its environmental liabilities will exhaust \nthe coverage underlying the [Arrowood] policy, which attaches at $50 million.”  (Feb. \n2000 Letter 1.)  Duke further advised in that same letter that Arrowood was “required \nto provide indemnification for Duke’s asbestos- related claims” but made no similar \ndemand concerning the potential coal ash liability mentioned  in the 1997 Notice.  \n(Feb. 2000 Letter 2.)  Then, in the June 2000 Letter, Duke stated that it agreed that \nArrowood had “ ‘ no duty ’ as an excess insurer to investigate [Duke’s] . . . \nenvironmental claims [,]” (June 2000 Letter), which the parties do not dispute \nincluded any potential claims for coal ash liability.8   \n43. Taken together  and even assuming the 1997 Notice was a “notice of \noccurrence” as Arrowood contends, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that before \nArrowood’s 2001 Letter denying coverage was sent,  Duke no longer “reasonably \nconclude[d]” that potential coal ash liability was “ likely to involve th [e] Policy” and \nthat therefore Duke no longer sought Arrowood’s determination of coverage for \npotential coal ash liability under the 1997 Notice.  The Notice of Occurrence Condition \nentitles Duke to decide when it “reasonably concludes” that the Policy is implicated.   \nEven if it had so concluded in 1997, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Duke \nprovided clear and unambiguous notice to Arrowood in 2000 that it no longer believed \nthe Policy was “likely involved” long before Arrowood sent its letter denying coverage \nbased on the Pollution Exclusion.  The Policy does not contemplate that Duke, having \nprovided notice that the Policy was not likely to be impl icated, should nevertheless \nbe forced to institute suit based on Arrowood ’s denial letter  sent after Duke’s \npurported “notice of occurrence” as to coal ash had been effectively withdrawn .  On \nthis record, the Court agrees with Duke that the 2001 Letter could reasonably be seen \nas “gratuitous and speculative[,]” (D uke’s Opp’n Br. 8), and did not trigger the \napplicable statute of limitations. \n \n8 See, e.g., Emps. Ins. v. Trico Prods. Corp., No. 93-CV-402A(H), 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19684, \nat *23–25 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 1997) (stating that “the excess insurer is not interested in every \naccident, but only in those that may be serious enough to involve it” (citation omitted)). \n44. Even if Arrowood’s 2001 Letter could constitute an anticipatory breach or \nrepudiation of the Policy , an issue the part ies debate, Arrowood’s Motion still fails  \nbecause Duke did not treat Arrowood’s letter as a breach of the Policy and thereby \ntrigger the applicable statute of limitations.  As explained by Court of Appeals Judge \nTyson in a dissent later adopted by the Supreme Court on appeal: \nFor repudiation to result in a breach of contract, “the refusal to perform \nmust be of the whole contract or of a covenant going to the whole \nconsideration, and must be distinct, unequivocal, and absolute[.]”  \nFurthermore, even a “distinct, unequivocal, and absolute” “refusal to \nperform” is not a breach “unless it is treated as such by the adverse party.”  \nUpon repudiation, the non-repudiating party “may at once treat it as a \nbreach of the entire contract and bring his action  accordingly.”  Thus, \nbreach by repudiation depends not only upon the statements and actions \nof the allegedly repudiating party but also upon the response of the non-\nrepudiating party. \n \nN.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hull, 251 N.C. App. 429, 438–39 (2016) (Tyson, J., \ndissenting) (citations omitted) , rev’d, 370 N.C. 486 (2018)  (adopting the dissenting \nopinion).  Here, it is undisputed that Duke did not respond to the 2001 Letter or \notherwise treat the 2001 Letter as an anticipatory breach or repudiation of the Policy.  \nAs a result, Hull makes plain that the 2001 Letter did not trigger the applicable \nstatute of limitations.9 \n \n9 Arrowood’s contention that its 2001 Letter was an actual, rather than an anticipatory, \nbreach of the Policy and thus triggered the statute of limitations is also without merit.  Since \na reasonable factfinder could conclude that Duke had effectively withdr awn its notice  \nthrough its February and June 2000 Letters , there was no Policy coverage to determine or \ndeny and, under Hull, the 2001 Lette r could have constituted an anticipatory breach or \nrepudiation.  But because it is undisputed that Duke did not treat the 2001 Letter as a breach, \nArrowood’s letter did not trigger the applicable statute of limitations. \n45. For each of these reasons, therefore, the Court concludes that Arrowood’s \nMotion must be denied.10  See, e.g., Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC v. Gray, 369 N.C. 1, \n5–6 (2016) (“Allowing a defendant’s motion for summary judgment on the basis of the \nstatute of limitations is appropriate only when all the facts necessary to establish the \nlimitation are alleged or admitted by the plaintiff, with the plaintiff receiving the \nbenefit of all relevant inferences.”).   \nIV. \nMOTION TO STRIKE \n46. Duke has moved to strike two exhibits —Exhibits 8 and 9, ( Aff. Ryan G. \nRudich Supp. Arrowood’s Mot. Summ. J. Statute Limitations Ex s. 8 –9, ECF No s. \n772.8–.9 (under seal), 776.8–.9 (public))—filed in support of Arrowood’s Motion.  Each \nis an excerpt from a report prepared by a settlement consultant for Duke  in 1996 in \nconnection with Duke’s compromise negotiations with Defendant Associated Electric \n& Gas Insurance Services Limited (“AEGIS”) and certain London insurers not party \nto this action.  Duke contends the documents are inadmissible and should be excluded \nunder North Carolina Rules of Evidence 408, 402, and 403.  (Mem. Supp. DEC’s Mot. \nStrike Inadmissible Settlement Communications 2, 8–11, ECF No. 787 (under seal), \n824 ( public).)  Arrowood contends in opposition that the exhibits  are properly \nconsidered, although Arrowood acknowledges that consideration of the exhibits is not \n \n10 Arrowood’s additional arguments are premised on Arrowood’s contention that the 2001 \nLetter denied coverage following notice of an “occurrence” that Duke “reasonably concluded” \nwould implicate the Policy .  Given the Court’s determination  that a reasonable factfinder \ncould conclude that Duke had reconsidered and rejected that conclusion and so notified \nArrowood long before Arrowood sent the 2001 Letter, effectively withdrawing Duke’s earlier \n“notice,” Arrowood’s remaining arguments for dismissal under Rule 56 necessarily fail. \nnecessary to the Court’s determination of the Motion.  (Arrowood’s Mem. Law Opp’n \nDEC’s Mot. Strike 4–18, ECF No. 845 (sealed), 867 (public).)  \n47. In considering a motion for summary judgment, our courts have made clear \nthat “the  evidence presented to the trial court must be  admissible at trial [.]”  \nBlackmon v. Tri-Arc Food Sys., Inc., 246 N.C. App. 38, 41 (2016)  (citation omitted).  \n“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”  N.C. R. Evid. 402.  Here, the Court \nhas found it unnecessary to consider or rely upon the exhibits Duke challenges in its \nMotion to Strike in resolving the Motion  because those exhibits are not relevant to \nthe matters at issue on the Motion.  As a result, the Court shall exercise its discretion \nto grant the Motion to Strike on relevance grounds.  See, e.g. , Kingsdown, Inc. v. \nHinshaw, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 15, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 17, 2016)  (“A motion to \nstrike is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.” (citing  Broughton v. \nMcClatchy Newspapers, Inc., 161 N.C. App. 20, 25 (2003))). \n48. Since the Court’s ruling is narrowly focused on the lack of relevance of the \nchallenged exhibits to the current Motion, t he Court’s ruling  shall be  without \nprejudice to any party’s right to seek to use or admit these same materials in \nconnection with a future motion or proceeding and without prejudice to Duke’s right \nto challenge that requested use or admission on any available ground at such time.   \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n49. WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Court hereby ORDERS \nas follows: \na. Arrowood’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the Statute of \nLimitations is DENIED. \nb. In the exercise of the Court’ s discretion, Duke’s Motion to Strike is  \nGRANTED because the challenged materials are irrelevant to the \nmatters at issue on Arrowood’ s Motion.  The Court’ s ruling is without \nprejudice to any party’s right to seek to use or admit the materials at \nissue on the Motion to Strike in connection with a future m otion or \nproceeding and without prejudice to Duke’s right to challenge that \nrequested use or admission on any available ground at such time. \nSO ORDERED, this the 15th day of February, 2021. \n \n/s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III  \n     Chief Business Court Judge \n "
