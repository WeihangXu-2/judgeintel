Whitesides, Jr., \nfor Defendants Jim Manly, Monette Manly, and Metropolitan Ballroom, \nLLC. \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{3} Plaintiffs Michael Krawiec (“Mr. Kr awiec”), Jennifer Krawiec (“Mrs. \nKrawiec”), and Happy Dance, Inc./CMT Danc e, Inc. d/b/a Fred Astaire Franchised \nDance Studios (“Happy Dance”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed their original Verified \nComplaint (the “Original Complaint”) in this action on February 3, 2015.   \n{4} On May 21, 2015, the Metropolitan Defendants and the Dancers filed \nseparate motions to dismiss the Original Complaint (the “Original Motions”), seeking \nthe dismissal of all claims asserted against them in the Original Complaint.  On July \n22, 2015, the Court held a hearing on the Original Motions, at which all parties were \nrepresented by counsel. \n{5} On August 14, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint, \nwhich the Court granted on August 24, 2015.   Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint (the \n“Amended Complaint”), attached to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to Amend, was \ndeemed filed, effective upon entry of the Court’s August 24 Order.  The Court’s August \n24 Order also denied the Original Motions as moot. \n{6} Thereafter, the Metropolitan Defendants and the Dancers filed their \nrespective Motions to Dismiss Plaintiffs ’ Amended Complaint.  The Motions have \nbeen fully briefed, and are now ripe for resolution.\n2 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 Pursuant to Rule 15.4 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure for the North Carolina Business \nCourt, the Court elects to rule on the pending Motions to Dismiss based on the parties’ pleadings, \nbriefs, and supporting documents, and the July 22, 2015 hearing in this matter.   \nII. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n{7} The Court does not make findings of fa ct on motions to dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(6), but only recites th ose facts included in the Amended Complaint that are \nrelevant to the Court’s determination of the Motions.  See, e.g., Concrete Serv. Corp. \nv. Investors Grp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).   \n{8} Mr. and Mrs. Krawiec are the owners of Happy Dance, a dance studio located \nin Clemmons, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1–2.)  Plaintiffs allege that on \nDecember 15, 2009, Happy Dance entered into an employment agreement with \nBogosavac, a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereby Bogosavac was granted an \nextension of an O-1B nonimmigrant work vi sa in exchange for Bogosavac’s promise \nto work exclusively for Happy Dance as a dance instructor.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12.)   \n{9} On July 18, 2011, Happy Dance allegedly entered into a second employment \nagreement with Bogosavac, whereby Bogosa vac was granted a second extension of \nhis O-1B visa in exchange for his promise to work exclusively for Happy Dance.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 13.)  Plaintiffs contend that this second employment agreement is \nmemorialized in an I-129 Petition for an O-1B nonimmigrant work visa prepared by \nPlaintiffs, a copy of which is attached to Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint as Exhibit A.  \n(See Am. Compl. Ex. A.)  This I-129 Petiti on was approved, and Bogosavac was \ngranted an extension of his O-1B visa on August 8, 2011, which extended the visa \nfrom January 31, 2012 to January 30, 2013.  (Am Compl. Ex. A.)  \n \n{10} Plaintiffs allege that also on July  18, 2011, Happy Dance entered into a \nsimilar employment agreement with Divljak, a citizen of Serbia.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 14.)  \nPlaintiffs allege that the employment agr eement with Divljak is memorialized in a \nseparate I-129 petition, a copy of which is attached to Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint \nas Exhibit B.  (\nSee Am. Compl. Ex. B.)  This I-129 Pe tition was also approved, and \nDivljak was granted an O-1B visa on August 17, 2011, with a validity period \nextending from September 1, 2011 until August 31, 2014.  (Am. Compl. Ex. B.)   \n{11} Plaintiffs contend that under Bogosavac’s alleged employment agreement \nwith Happy Dance, Bogosavac agreed to work exclusively for Happy Dance from \nJanuary 31, 2012 until January 3, 2013.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 16.)  Plaintiffs further allege \nthat Bogosavac was not permitted to be e mployed elsewhere for as long as he was \nemployed under the O-1B visa.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 16.)  Plaintiffs also allege that \nBogosavac agreed to reimburse Plaintiffs for all expenses paid by Plaintiffs to secure \nthe O-1B visa and to support Bogosavac, in the event that Bogosavac left Happy \nDance’s employ before January 3, 2013.  (A m. Compl. ¶ 16.)  Plaintiffs attach an \nunexecuted document titled “Employment Agreement” as Exhibit C to Plaintiff’s \nAmended Complaint as evidence of this alleged agreement.  Although neither dated \nnor signed, Plaintiffs allege that a copy of  this form document was executed by both \nDancers.  (\nSee Am. Compl. ¶ 20.) \n{12} Plaintiffs further allege that, pursua nt to Divljak’s alleged employment \nagreement with Happy Dance, Divljak agr eed to work exclusively for Happy Dance \nfrom September 1, 2011 until August 31, 2014, and was not permitted to be employed \nelsewhere for as long as she was employed under the O-1B visa.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 17.)  \nSimilar to Bogosavac’s alleged agreement, Pl aintiffs allege that Divljak agreed to \nreimburse Plaintiffs for expenses paid by Plaintiffs to secure the visa and to support \nDivljak, should Divljak decide to leave Ha ppy Dance’s employ prior to August 31, \n2014.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 17.)   \n{13} In addition to the above agreements, Plaintiffs allege that both Dancers \nentered into written agreements with Happy Dance, whereby both agreed not to: (i) \nwork for another company offering dance instruction, or compete directly with Happy \nDance in Forsyth County and adjacent counties for one year following the expiration \nor termination of their employment with Happy Dance, or (ii) disclose Happy Dance’s \nconfidential information to any person or entity for any purpose other than for the \nbenefit of Happy Dance.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18; see Am. Compl. Ex. C.)  \n{14} Plaintiffs allege that Bogosavac and Divljak began working as dance \ninstructors for Metropolitan on February  7, 2012 while still employed under their \nrespective O-1B visas.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.)  Metropolitan is a dance studio owned by \nthe Manlys and located in Charlotte, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3–4.)  Plaintiffs \nfurther allege that both Dancers were also working as dance instructors at other \ndance studios in Forsyth County and adjacent counties in North Carolina while still \nemployed under their respective visas.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 21.)   \n{15} Plaintiffs contend that after beginni ng to work for Metropolitan, the \nDancers shared with Metropolitan confid ential and trade secret information about \nHappy Dance’s ideas and concepts for dance productions, marketing strategies and \ntactics, and student, client, and customer information.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 25.)  Plaintiffs \nalso allege that, as a result of the Dancers’ disclosure of confidential and trade secret \ninformation, Metropolitan produced and marketed Plaintiffs’ shows as its own \noriginal productions, without Plaintiffs’ permission.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 25.)  \nIII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{16} A motion to dismiss “generally tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint: \nHas the pleader given notice of such facts as  will, if true, support a claim for relief \nunder some legal theory?”  Concrete Serv. Corp., 79 N.C. App. at 681, 340 S.E.2d at \n758 (citing Sutton v. Duke , 277 N.C. 94, 176 S.E.2d 161 (1970)).  “The motion does \nnot present the merits, but only whether the merits may be reached. . . .  The policy \nbehind the Rules of Civil Procedure is to resolve controversies on the merits, not on \ntechnicalities of pleading.”  Id. (internal citations omitted).  In ruling on a motion to \ndismiss, “the allegations of the complaint mu st be viewed as admitted, and on that \nbasis the court must determine as a matte r of law whether the allegations state a \nclaim for which relief may be granted.”  Stanback v. Stanback, 297 N.C. 181, 185, 254 \nS.E.2d 611, 615 (1979).  Ther efore, “a complaint shou ld not be di smissed for \ninsufficiency unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff is entitled to no relief under \nany state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.”  \nSutton, 277 N.C. at \n103, 176 S.E.2d at 166 (emphasis omitted).  \n \n \n \n \n \nIV. \nFEDERAL PREEMPTION \n{17} The Court first considers whether any of Plaintiffs’ claims are preempted by \nthe federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.  If so, any such claims fall outside \nthis Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction.3   \n{18} Section 301(a) of the Copyright Act provides: \n[All] legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive \nrights within the general scope of co pyright as specified in Section 106 \nin works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression \nand come within the subject matter of copyright as specified by sections \n102 and 103 . . . are governed exclusively by [the Copyright Act]. \n17 U.S.C. § 301(a) (2012).   \n{19} As a general rule, “a state law cause of action is preempted by the Copyright \nAct if (1) the cause of action falls within  the subject matter of copyright law; and (2) \nthe rights protected by state law are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights granted \nby the Copyright Act.”  Out of the Box Developers, LLC v. LogicBit Corp., 2012 NCBC \nLEXIS 55, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 30, 2012) (citing Rosciszewski v. Arete Assocs., \nInc., 1 F.3d 225, 229 (4th Cir. 1993)).   \n{20} Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have misappropriated their “original ideas \nand concepts for dance production.”  Se ction 102 of the Copyright Act provides \ncopyright protection for “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium \nof expression, now known or later develope d, from which they can be perceived, \nreproduced or otherwise communicated,” in cluding “dramatic works.”  17 U.S.C. § \n102(a).  “Works of authorship” include “pantomimes and choreographic works.”  Id. § \n102(a)(4).  “Pantomimes and choreographic works” are not defined in the Copyright \nAct, but the Act’s legislative history states that “‘choreographic works’ do not include \nsocial dance steps and simple routines.”  H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 54 (1976).  Further, \n“[i]n no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to \n                                                 \n3 At the July 22, 2015 hearing, the Court raised the issue of federal preemption sua sponte  and \nrequested submission of supplemental briefs regard ing the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction. The \nparties filed supplemental briefs on August 10, 2015. \nany idea, procedure, process, system, method  of operation, concept, principle, or \ndiscovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated or \nembodied in such work.”  17 U.S.C. § 102(b).   \n{21} Significantly for this case, “a work is ‘fixed’ in a tangible medium of \nexpression when its embodime nt in a copy . . . , by or  under the authority of the \nauthor, is sufficiently permanent and stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, \nor otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.”  Id. § 101.  \n“Like other creative works, dances are available for statutory copyright if [they are] \n‘fixed in any tangible medium of expression.’”  Martha Graham Sch. & Dance Found., \nInc. v. Martha Graham Ctr. of Contemporary Dance, Inc., 380 F.3d 624, 632 (2d Cir. \n2004) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) and holding that seventy original dances were eligible \nfor copyright protection because they were filmed or videotaped).  In contrast, courts \nhave held that “unrecorded performances per se are not fixed in tangible form.”  Balt. \nOrioles, Inc. v. MLB Players Ass’n, 805 F.2d. 663, 675 (7th Cir. 1986); see also H.R. \nRep. No. 94-1476, at 131 (excluding from the Act’s copyright protection “choreography \nthat has never been filmed or notated, an extemporaneous speech, ‘original works of \nauthorship’ communicated solely through conversations or live broadcasts, and a \ndramatic sketch or musical composition improvised or developed from memory and \nwithout being recorded or written down”).        \n{22} Plaintiffs here have not alleged that their “original ideas for dance \nproductions” have been commemorated or memorialized in any way or exist in any \ntangible medium of expression, including through film or videographic means.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have simply alleged the \nmisappropriation of their original ideas and concepts—which the Act makes clear are \nnot eligible for copyright protection, \nsee 17 U.S.C. § 102(b)—and  have not otherwise \npleaded that the allegedly misappropriated material constitutes “original works of \nauthorship fixed in any tangible medi um of expression” under the Act.  \nId. § 102(a).  \nSee generally Bikram's Yoga Coll. of India, L.P. v. Evolation Yoga, LLC , 803 F.3d \n1032 (9th Cir. 2015) (no copyright protection for sequence of yoga poses and breathing \nexercises because the sequence was an idea, process, or system designed to improve \nhealth); Horgan v. Macmillan , 789 F.2d 157 (2d Cir. 1986) (observing copyright \nprotection afforded for vi deotaped choreography of Nutcracker ballet).  The Court \ntherefore concludes that none of Plaint iffs’ claims are preempted by the federal \nCopyright Act and thus that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over each of \nPlaintiffs’ claims.   \nV. \nTHE DANCERS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \n{23} Plaintiffs assert various claims in their Amended Complaint, some only \nagainst the Dancers, 4 some only against the Metropolitan Defendants, 5 and some \nagainst all Defendants.6   The Dancers’ Motion seeks to dismiss all claims asserted \nagainst them, each for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and \nbecause the relevant statute of limitations for each claim has expired.   \nA. Breach of Contract  \n{24}  To assert a valid claim for breach of contract, a plaintiff must allege “(1) \nexistence of a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. Hill, \n138 N.C. App. 19, 26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000).  “[W]here the complaint alleges each \nof these elements, it is error to dismis s a breach of contract claim under [Rule \n12(b)(6)].”  McLamb v. T.P. Inc., 173 N.C. App. 586, 588, 619 S.E.2d 577, 580 (2005).   \n{25} Plaintiffs’ operative allegation is that  Plaintiffs procured an extension of \neach Dancer’s O-1B nonimmigrant work visa in exchange for each Dancer’s express \npromise to work exclusively for Plaintiffs  at the Happy Dance studio, which each \nDancer allegedly breached by going to work for the Metropolitan Defendants.   \n{26} Plaintiffs base their breach of contract claims on the alleged breach of four \nseparate contract documents: (i) the I- 129 Petitions for Bogosavac and Divljak, \n                                                 \n4 Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, and equitable estoppel \nagainst the Dancers only. \n \n5 Plaintiffs assert claims for tortious interference with contract, “aiding and abetting,” and unfair and \ndeceptive trade practices under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 against the Metropolitan Defendants only.   \n \n6 Plaintiffs assert claims for civ il conspiracy, misappropriation of trade secrets, intentional infliction \nof emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and unjust enrichment against all \nDefendants. \n \nattached to the Amended Complaint as Exhibits A and B, respectively, and (ii) \nidentical written employment agreemen ts with Bogosavac and Divljak, an \nunexecuted version of which is attached to  the Amended Complaint as Exhibit C.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13, 14, 18, 32, 33).7    \n{27} Exhibits A and B each contain a cover letter from Mr. Krawiec to the USCIS \nOfficer at the United States Department  of Homeland Security in St. Albans, \nVermont followed by an I-129 Petition on behalf of each Dancer signed by Mr. \nKrawiec.  Neither Petition is signed by ei ther Dancer, and neither Dancer is copied \non Mr. Krawiec’s cover letters.  Nonetheless, Plaintiffs allege that each Petition was \nfiled based on each Dancer’s agreement to  work exclusively for Plaintiffs, which \nPlaintiffs argue is evidenced by the language of each Petition.  (\nSee Am. Compl. Ex. \nA (Bogosavac) (“[t]he foreign worker can work for the petitioner, but only as detailed \nin the petition and for the period authorized.  Any change in employment requires a \nnew petition.”)); (Am. Compl. Ex. B (Divljak) (“[c]hanges in employment also require \na new petition.”).)   \n{28} Plaintiffs contend that this agreement is further reflected in the document \ntitled “Employment Agreement” attached to the Amended Complaint as Exhibit C.  \nExhibit C is unsigned and undated, and is pr epared for Divljak’s signature alone.  \nPlaintiffs allege that each Dancer signed identical Exhibit C-style Employment \nAgreements when they began their employ ment at Happy Dance and that Divljak \nremoved the executed originals from Plaintiffs’ files prior to her resignation from \nemployment.  The alleged Employment Agr eement incorporates various aspects of \nthe I-129 Petitions into its terms and purports to restrict each Dancer from “work[ing] \nfor another company offering dance instruct ion and/or compet[ing] directly against \n[Happy Dance] as a direct competitor of [Happy Dance] in Forsyth County, North \n                                                 \n7  The Court may consider these documents to determine whether a contract did, in fact, exist between \nthe parties.  See, e.g., Schlieper v. Johnson, 195 N.C. App. 257, 261, 672 S.E.2d 548, 551 (2009) (“When \ndocuments are attached to and incorporated into a complaint, they become part of the complaint and \nmay be considered in connection with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion without converting it into a motion for \nsummary judgment.”).  The Court may also “may reject allegations that are contradicted by documents \nattached to the [amended] complaint.” \nId. at 265, 672 S.E.2d at 553. \nCarolina and adjacent counties for one year following the expiration or termination \nof this agreement.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. C, ¶ D.)  The alleged Employment Agreement \nfurther provides that each Dancer “must reimburse employer [sic] foreseeable and \nunforeseeable expenses paid by the employer to secure O1-B [sic] visa and to support \nemployee” in the event the Dancer “departs or is terminated before conclusion of \ninitial term of O1-B [sic] visa.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. C, ¶ D.) \n{29} As an initial matter, while the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have alleged \nbreach for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6), “claim s for breach of contract . . . necessarily \nhinge on the threshold issue of whether a valid contract actually existed between [the \nparties].”  Charlotte Motor Speedway, LLC v. Cnty. of Cabarrus , 230 N.C. App. 1, 6, \n748 S.E.2d 171, 175 (2013).  Moreover, “[a]n a llegation that a valid contract exists \nbetween parties is a legal conclusion,” and “[l]egal conclusions . . . are not entitled to \na presumption of validity.” Id.  See Guarascio v. New Hanover Health Network, Inc., \n163 N.C. App 160, 165, 592 S.E.2d 612, 614 (2004) (holding that employee's assertion \nthat valid employment contract existed between employee and defendant was legal \nconclusion \"not entitled to a presumption  of truth\") (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  \n \n{30} Under North Carolina law, a valid contract requires (1) assent; (2) mutuality \nof obligation; and (3) definite terms.  Horton v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 255 N.C. \n675, 679, 122 S.E.2d 716, 719 (1961) .  “It is a well-settled principle of contract law \nthat a valid contract exists only where th ere has been a meeting of the minds as to \nall essential terms of the agreement.\"  Northington v. Michelotti, 121 N.C. App. 180, \n184, 464 S.E.2d 711, 714 (1995).   \n{31} Plaintiffs specifically allege here that the I-129 Petitions and the unsigned \nEmployment Agreements are each separate contracts between Plaintiffs and each \nDancer.  Based on its review of these documents and Plaintiffs’ allegations, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs have adequately  pleaded that a contract exists between \nHappy Dance and each Dancer for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6).  In particular, Plaintiffs \nallege that the Employment Agreements were signed by the Dancers, and the Court \nconcludes that the purported Agreements otherwise evidence mutual assent, \nmutuality of obligation, and definite terms.  While the Court is not persuaded that \nthe I-129 Petitions constitute stand-alone contracts, each Petition is referenced and \nincorporated in substantial part into each  alleged Employment Agreement, and, in \naddition, provides factual support for Plai ntiffs’ allegation that contracts existed \nbetween the parties.  See, e.g., Butterfield v. Williamson, No. COA07-1488, 2008 N.C. \nApp. LEXIS 1463, at *9 (Aug. 5, 2008) (unpublished) (holding that representations in \nH-1B visa petition provided evidence contract existed). 8  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs’ allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs \nand when considered with the I-129 Petitions and the Employment Agreements, \nsufficiently state that a valid contract existed between Happy Dance and each Dancer \nfor purposes of Rule 12(b)(6).   \n{32} The Dancers separately contend that Exhibit C, as an undated and \nunexecuted document, does not meet the re quirements of a non-compete agreement \nunder North Carolina law, and that Plaintiffs ’ claims for breach of the non-compete \nshould therefore be dismissed.9  See New Hanover Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Martinez, 136 \nN.C. App. 642, 644, 525 S.E.2d 487, 489 (2000) (“The requirement that an agreement \nnot to compete be in writing includes a requirement that the writing be signed.”) \n(citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-4).  Because Plaintiffs allege that a document in the style \nof Exhibit C was signed by both Dancers, however, the Court concludes that dismissal \nof Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of the non-competition agreement on this basis is not \nproper at this stage of the litigation.10   \n{33} The Dancers also contend that Plainti ffs’ claims are barred as a matter of \nlaw by the applicable statute of limitations.  “A statute of limitations can be the basis \n                                                 \n8  Plaintiffs cite Butterfield to support their contention that the I-129 Petitions constituted standalone \ncontracts; Butterfield, however, simply held that statements in a visa petition may constitute evidence \nbearing on the parties’ mutual intent in assessing whether a valid contract existed between the parties. \n  \n9  The Dancers have not otherwise challenged the enforceability of the non-compete provision in each \nalleged Employment Agreement on this Motion.  \n \n10  The Court’s ruling is without prejudice to the Dancers’ right to raise this defense again at summary \njudgment and/or at trial.  \n \nfor dismissal on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion if the face of the complaint discloses that \nplaintiff’s claim is so barred.”  Reunion Land Co. v. Village of Marvin, 129 N.C. App. \n249, 250, 497 S.E.2d 446, 447 (1998) (citation omitted).  The statute of limitations for \nbreach of contract claims is three years, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52,  and begins to run \nwhen the alleged breach occurs.  See Silver v. N.C. Bd. of Transp., 47 N.C. App. 261, \n266, 267 S.E.2d 49, 53–54 (1980). \n{34} Plaintiffs filed their Original Complaint on February 3, 2015, shortly before \nthe third anniversary of the Dancers’ resignation from employment on February 7, \n2012.  Although the Dancers seek to introd uce affidavit testimony to establish that \nthe Dancers provided Plaintiffs notice of their resignations on January 30, 2012, thus \ntriggering the statute of limitations on th at date and barring Plaintiffs’ claim, the \nCourt may not consider such testimony on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.   See N.C. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b); see, e.g., Weaver v. St. Joseph of the Pines, Inc., 187 N.C. App. 198, 203, 652 \nS.E.2d 701, 707 (2007) (“As a general prop osition, therefore, matters outside the \ncomplaint are not germane to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Indeed, as N.C.R. Civ. P. 12(b) \nmakes clear, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is co nverted to one for summary judgment if \n‘matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court . . . .’”) \n(citation omitted).11 \n{35} In addition, although Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges that “[w]hile \nstill employed and financially supported by Plaintiffs, [the Dancers] began working \nconcurrently as dance instructors for [the Metropolitan Defendants], as well as other \ncompanies[,]” the Court cannot conclude, fr om the allegations on the face of the \nAmended Complaint, that this alleged conduct occurred before February 3, 2012.  \nThus, the Court cannot conclude that the statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs’ breach \nof contract claim at this stage of the litigation.    \n                                                 \n11  The Court declines to convert the Motion into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56.   \n \n \n \n{36} Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have stated a valid claim \nfor breach of contract against the Dancers and that the Dancers’ Motion to Dismiss \nthis claim should be denied.   \nB. Fraudulent Misrepresentation \n{37} To state a claim for fraud, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant made a \n“(1) false representation or concealment of material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to \ndeceive, (3) made with intent to deceive,  (4) which does in fact deceive, and (5) \nresulting in damage to the injured party.”  Harrold v. Dowd, 149 N.C. App. 777, 782, \n561 S.E.2d 914, 918 (2002) (citing Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. 130, 138, 209 S.E.2d \n494, 500 (1974)).  Additionally, N.C. R. Civ. P. Rule 9(b) requires that all averments \nof fraud must be pled with particularity, including as to the “time, place and content \nof the fraudulent misrepresentation, [t he] identity of the person making the \nrepresentation and what was obtained as a result of the fraudulent act or \nrepresentation.”  Powell v. Wold, 88 N.C. App. 61, 64, 362 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1987).   \n{38} Here, Plaintiffs allege that: \n[o]n or about December 2010, in a conversation at Plaintiffs’ dance \nstudio, Defendant Bogosavac made an intentional false representation \nof material fact when he represented to Plaintiffs that he would continue \nto work exclusively for Plaintiffs’ dance studio in exchange for the \nPlaintiffs’ procurement of a second extension of his O1-B [sic] work visa.   \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 59.)   \n{39} Plaintiffs also allege that “[o]n or about April 2011, in a conversation via \nSkype,” Divljak made the same intentionally false representation.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 60.)  \nPlaintiffs allege that the Dancers “made the foregoing misrepresentations with \nknowledge of the fact they ha d no intention of actually going to work exclusively for \nPlaintiffs, but, instead, were going to  begin working for [the Metropolitan \nDefendants] after Plaintiffs procured their visas” and that the false representations \nwere “reasonably calculated to deceive Plaintiffs” and were made “with the intention \nthat Plaintiffs would act upon their misrep resentations by securing an O1-B [sic] \nwork visa for each of them.”  (Am. Compl . ¶¶ 61–62.)  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that \n“[i]n reliance on Defendant[s] Bogosavac and Divljak’s misrepresentations, Plaintiffs \nincurred significant expenses related to the procurement of Defendants’ visas and the \ntravel accommodations for Defendant Divljak[.]”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 63.)  \n{40}  The Court concludes that these allegations sufficiently state a claim for \nfraud under North Carolina law and are pl eaded with sufficient particularity to \nsatisfy Rule 9(b) in these circumstances.   \n{41} The Dancers further contend that Plai ntiffs’ fraudulent misrepresentation \nclaims are barred by the applicable statute of  limitations.  The three-year statute of \nlimitations for claims based on fraud “‘begins to run from the di scovery of the fraud \nor from the time it should have been di scovered in the exercise of reasonable \ndiligence.’”  Hyde v. Taylor, 70 N.C. App. 523, 528, 320 S.E.2d 904, 908 (1984) (quoting \nB-W Acceptance Corp. v. Spencer, 268 N.C. 1, 7, 149 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1966) and N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 1-52(9)).  Because the Court is unable to conclude from the allegations of \nthe Amended Complaint that Plaintiffs discov ered, or should have discovered in the \nexercise of reasonable diligence, the Dancers’ alleged fraudulent misrepresentations \nprior to February 3, 2012, the Court cannot conclude that the statute of limitations \nbars Plaintiffs’ fraud claims against the Dancers at this stage of the litigation.12  The \nCourt therefore concludes that the Dancers’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ fraudulent \nmisrepresentation claims should be denied.   \nC. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets \n{42} Plaintiffs allege that their “original ideas and concepts for dance production, \nmarketing strategies and tactics, as well as  student, client and customer lists and \ntheir contact information” constitute protectable trade secrets, and claim that the \nDancers have violated the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act (“TSPA”) by \nmisappropriating such information.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 66.)   \n                                                 \n12  Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ fraudulent misrepresentation should survive the \nDancers’ 12(b)(6) motion, the Court also concludes that Plaintiffs’ claim for  punitive damages under \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 1D-15 should not be dismissed at this time.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1D-15 (“Punitive \ndamages may be awarded only if the claimant prov es that the defendant is liable for compensatory \ndamages and that one of the following aggravating factors was present and was related to the injury \nfor which compensatory damages were awarded: (1) [f]raud (2) [m]alice (3) [w]illful or wanton \nconduct.”). \n \n{43} To adequately plead a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, “a \nplaintiff must identify a trade secret with sufficient particularity so as to enable a \ndefendant to delineate that which he is accused of misappropriating and for a court \nto determine whether misappropriation has or is threatened to occur.”  VisionAir, Inc. \nv. James , 167 N.C. App. 504, 510–11, 606 S.E.2d 359, 364 (2004) (citing Analog \nDevices, Inc. v. Michalski , 157 N.C. App. 462, 468, 579 S.E.2d 449, 453 (2003)).  A \nplaintiff must also allege “the acts by which the misappropriation was accomplished.”  \nVeer Right Mgmt. Group, Inc. v. Czarnowski Display Serv. , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 13, \nat *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 4, 2015) (citing Washburn v. Yadkin Valley Bank & Trust \nCo., 190 N.C. App. 315, 327, 660 S.E.2d 577, 585–86 (2008)).  “[A] complaint that \nmakes general allegations in sweeping and conclusory statements, without \nspecifically identifying the trade secrets allegedly misappropriated, is insufficient to \nstate a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.”  \nWashburn, 190 N.C. App. at 327, \n660 S.E.2d at 585–86 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   \n{44} The TSPA defines a “trade secret” as  \nbusiness or technical information . . . that: (a) Derives independent \nactual or potential commercial value from not being generally known or \nreadily ascertainable through independent development or reverse \nengineering by persons who can obtain economic value from its \ndisclosure or use; and (b) is the su bject of efforts that are reasonable \nunder the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.”   \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152(3).  The TSPA defines “misappropriation” as the “acquisition, \ndisclosure, or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied authority or \nconsent, unless such trade secret was arrived at by independent development, reverse \nengineering, or was obtained from another person with a right to disclose the trade \nsecret.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152(1).   \n{45} The Dancers contend that Plaintiffs’ claim for misappropriation of trade \nsecrets fails because Plaintiffs have not id entified their alleged trade secrets with \nsufficient particularity or sufficiently alle ged their reasonable efforts to protect the \nalleged trade secret information.  The Court agrees.   \n{46} First, Plaintiffs’ identification of its alleged trade secret as “original ideas \nand concepts for dance production” is so non-specific and generalized as to be \nmeaningless.  As in Washburn, Plaintiffs’ description here is “broad and vague” as \nwell as “general and conclusory,” 190 N.C. App. at 327, 660 S.E.2d at 586, and does \nnot permit the Dancers “to delineate that which [they are] accused of \nmisappropriating” or the Court “to determine whether misappropriation has or is \nthreatened to occur.”  VisionAir, 167 N.C. App. at 510–11, 606 S.E.2d at 364.  This is \nparticularly true here where Plaintiffs have not alleged that these “ideas and \nconcepts” have been memorialized in any way or that they are capable of objective \nverification of any kind.    \n{47} The Court further concludes that the Plaintiffs’ identification of its \nremaining trade secrets—“marketing strategies  and tactics [and] student, client and \ncustomer lists and their contact information”—is similar to the identifications found \nlacking in Washburn, 190 N.C. App. at 327, 660 S.E.2d  at 586 (“business methods; \nclients, their specific requirements and n eeds; . . . other confidential information \npertaining to [plaintiff’s] business . . . confidential client information and confidential \nbusiness information”); Aecom Tech. Corp. v. Keating , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 9, at *8 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 6, 2012) (“customer lists, customer contract information, pricing \ninformation, and product information”); and Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc. v. Rogers , \n2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *68 (N.C. Super. Ct . Nov. 3, 2011) (“proprietary formulas, \nmethodologies, customer and pricing data and other confidential information”).  At \nthe same time, Plaintiffs’ identification of its remaining trade secrets contains less \ndetail and context than the descriptions found sufficient in  \nS. Fastening Sys. v. Grabber Constr. Prods ., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *11 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Apr. 28, 2015) (“confidential customer information such as customer \ncontact information and customer buying pr eferences and history . . . confidential \nfreight information, sales reports, prices and terms books, sales memos, sales training \nmanuals, commission reports, and informatio n concerning [plaintiff’s] relationship \nwith its vendors”) and the cases upon which Southern Fastening relies.   \n{48} Last, and separately, “the requirement of specificity extends beyond \nidentifying trade secrets to also require specificity as to the acts by which \nmisappropriation was accomplished.”  Velocity Solutions, Inc. v. BSG, LLC , 2015 \nNCBC LEXIS 54, at *23–24 (N.C. Super. Ct . May 26, 2015).  The Court concludes \nthat Plaintiffs’ bare, unsupported allegation that the Dancers “unlawfully disclosed” \nPlaintiffs’ alleged trade secrets does not satisfy this mandatory pleading requirement.  \nSee, e.g., Veer Right, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *15.   \n{49} Because Plaintiffs have neither identified their alleged trade secrets with \nsufficient particularity nor sufficiently alleged the specific acts by which the alleged \nmisappropriation was accomplished, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not \nadequately pleaded a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets under the TSPA and \nthus that Plaintiffs’ misappropriation claim should be dismissed.   \nD. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n{50} To state a valid claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a \nplaintiff must allege that the defendant (1 ) intentionally or recklessly engaged in \nextreme and outrageous conduct, (2) intending to cause or actually causing, (3) severe \nemotional distress.  Dickens v. Puryear, 302 N.C. 437, 452–53, 276 S.E.2d 325, 335 \n(1981).  “[L]iability arises under this tort  when a defendant’s conduct exceeds all \nbounds usually tolerated by a decent society and the conduct causes mental distress \nof a very serious kind.”  Stanback, 297 N.C. at 196, 254 S. E.2d at 622 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).   \n{51} Determining “[w]hether or not conduct constitutes extreme and outrageous \nbehavior is initially a question of law for the court.”  Simmons v. Chemol Corp., 137 \nN.C. App. 319, 325, 528 S.E.2d 368, 371 (2000) (citations omitted).  “To establish the \nessential element of extreme and outrageous conduct, the conduct must go beyond all \npossible bounds of decency and ‘be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a \ncivilized community.’”  Id. (quoting Wagoner v. Elkin City Sch. Bd. of Educ., 113 N.C. \nApp. 579, 586, 440 S.E.2d 119, 123 (1994)).  “[M]ere insults, indignities, threats, \nannoyances, petty oppressions, or other tr ivialities” do not constitute extreme and \noutrageous conduct.  Johnson v. Bollinger , 86 N.C. App. 1, 6,  356 S.E.2d 378, 382 \n(1987).  Moreover, “it is extremely rare to  find conduct in the employment context \nthat will rise to the level of outrageousness necessary to support a claim of intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress.”  Thomas v. N. Telecom, Inc. , 157 F. Supp. 2d 627, \n635 (M.D.N.C. 2000) (applying North Carolina law) (citation omitted).   \n{52} Plaintiffs allege that the Dancers’ extreme and outrageous conduct consists \nof the Dancers “maliciously and fraudulently inducing Plaintiffs to procure O1-B [sic] \nvisas for [the Dancers], misappropriating Pl aintiffs’ trade secrets, and conspiring to \ncripple or eliminate Plaintiffs as a competitor in the dance industry.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ \n80.)  The Court concludes, however, that these conclusory allegations, devoid of \nsupporting facts, do not allege  the sort of “atrocious” conduct that our courts have \nfound actionable as “utterly intolerable in a civilized community.” Simmons, 137 N.C. \nApp. at 325, 528 S.E.2d at 371; see generally, e.g., Briggs v. Rosenthal, 73 N.C. App. \n672, 677, 327 S.E.2d 308, 312 (1985) (“It must be emphasized . . . that major outrage \nis essential to the tort.”) (quoting Restatement of Torts § 46, Comment f); Hogan v. \nForsyth Country Club Co. , 79 N.C. App. 483, 493, 340 S.E.2d 116, 122–23 (1986) \n(extreme and outrageous behavior not found where the defendant yelled and threw \nmenus at plaintiff and interfered with her supervision of employees). \n{53} Accordingly, the Court concludes that  Plaintiffs have not adequately \npleaded a claim for intentional infliction of  emotional distress and that Plaintiffs’ \nclaim should therefore be dismissed. \nE. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress \n{54} The elements of a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress are: “(1) \nthe defendant negligently engaged in conduct, (2) it was reasonably foreseeable that \nsuch conduct would cause the plaintiff seve re emotional distress . . . , and (3) the \nconduct did in fact cause the plaintiff severe emotional distress.”  Wilkerson v. Duke \nUniv., 229 N.C. App. 670, 675, 748 S.E.2d 154, 159 (2013).   \n{55} Plaintiffs allege that the Dancers “negligently engaged in the conduct \ndescribed herein, as they had a legal duty to comply with the terms of their contracts \nwith Plaintiffs; they breached their duty by unlawfully going to work for Plaintiffs’ \ncompetitors, soliciting Plaintiffs’ customers, and disclosing Plaintiffs’ trade secrets[.]”  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 87.)  Although pleaded as a claim sounding in negligence, Plaintiffs’ \nsupporting allegations rest entirely on Dancers’ intentional conduct.  It is axiomatic \nthat “if there is no underlying negligence, there is no claim for [negligent infliction of \nemotional distress].”  Williams v. Altec Indus., No. 5:10-CV-356-BO, 2011 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 86503, at *11–12 (E.D.N.C. Aug. 3,  2011) (applying North Carolina law) \n(citations and quotations omitted).  Plaintiffs’ claim should therefore be dismissed on \nthis basis. \n{56} Moreover, even if Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint could be read as asserting \nnegligent conduct in failing to perform under the alleged contract, “[w]hen the \nplaintiff's complaint alleges acts . . . th at are intentional in nature, and simply \nconcludes that the acts were committed negligently, [the complaint] is insufficient to \nstate a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.” Sasser v. City of \nWhiteville, No. 7:10-CV-95-D, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122678, at *6–7 (E.D.N.C. Nov. \n18, 2010) (applying North Carolina law) (citat ions and quotations omitted).  Indeed, \n“it has long been the law in North Carolina that a tort action cannot lie against a \npromisor ‘for his simple failure to perform his contract, even though such failure was \ndue to negligence or lack of skill.’”  \nArtistic S. v. Lund , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 113, at \n*22–23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 9, 2015) (quoting N.C. Ports Auth. v. Lloyd A. Fry \nRoofing Co., 294 N.C. 73, 83, 240 S.E.2d 345, 351 (1978)).  For this additional reason, \ntherefore, Plaintiffs’ claim for negligent in fliction of emotional distress should be \ndismissed. \nF. Unjust Enrichment \n{57} It is well settled under North Carolina law that a claim for unjust \nenrichment is “a claim in quasi contract or a contract implied in law” and, therefore, \n“[i]f there is a contract between the part ies the contract governs the claim and the \nlaw will not imply a contract.” Booe v. Shadrick, 322 N.C. 567, 570, 369 S.E.2d 554, \n556 (1988).  As a result, our courts have recognized that “the doctrine of unjust \nenrichment is based on ‘quasi-contract’ or contract ‘implied in law’ and thus will not \napply . . . where a contract exists between two parties.”  Atl. & E. Carolina Ry. Co. v. \nWheatly Oil Co., 163 N.C. App. 748, 753, 594 S.E.2d 425, 429 (2004).   \n{58} In addition, where, as here, “the state law claim for breach of contract \nremains viable, it is unnece ssary to address the claim for unjust enrichment [on a \nRule 12(b)(6) motion].”  Forest2Market, Inc. v. Am. Forest Mgmt ., No. 3:05cv423, \n2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33185, at *16–17 (W.D.N.C. Apr. 21, 2008); see also Surratt v. \nBrown, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 75, at *20 (N.C. Supe r. Ct. July 27, 2015) (declining to \naddress or dismiss unjust enrichment claim where breach of contract claim survived \nmotion to dismiss); Shelton v. Duke Univ. Health Sys ., 179 N.C. App. 120, 125, 633 \nS.E.2d 113, 116 (2006) (stating on Rule 12(b )(6) motion: “Because we have not held \nthe contract to be unenforceable, we do not address [plaintiff’s unjust enrichment] \nargument.”). \n{59} Accordingly, based on the above, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claim \nfor unjust enrichment should not be dismissed at this time. \nG. Equitable Estoppel \n{60} Plaintiffs purport to assert an independent cause of action for equitable \nestoppel.  As this Court has recognized, however, the doctrine of equitable estoppel is \nnot a basis for an affirmative claim for relief.  Rather, the doctrine “provides a defense \nto bar enforcement of opposing claims or affirmative defenses.”  Blue Ridge Pediatric \n& Adolescent Med., Inc. v. First Colony Healthcare, LLC , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 52, at \n*38 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 3, 2012); see, e.g., Duke Univ. v. Stainback, 320 N.C. 337, \n341, 357 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1987) (\"Equitable estoppel may be invoked, in a proper case, \nto bar a defendant from relying upon the statute of limitations.\").13  Accordingly, the \nCourt concludes that Plaintiffs’ purported claim for equitable estoppel should be \ndismissed. \nH. Civil Conspiracy \n{61} To state a claim for civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege (1) a conspiracy, \n(2) wrongful acts by the alleged conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (3) \n                                                 \n13 See generally, e.g.,  Parker v. Westat, Inc ., 301 F. Supp. 2d 537, 544 (E.D. Va. 2004) (“‘[E]quitable \nestoppel usually operates as a shield, as opposed to a sword, and it does not of itself create a new right \nor give a cause of action; rather, it serves to prevent losses otherwise inescapable and to preserve rights \nalready acquired.’”) (quoting \nMeriweather Mowing Serv. v. St. Anne's-Belfield, Inc ., 51 Va. Cir. 517, \n519 (Va. Cir. Ct. 2000)) (applying Virginia law). \nresulting injury. State ex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC , 362 N.C. 431, \n444, 666 S.E.2d 107, 115 (2008); Strickland v. Hedrick , 194 N.C. App. 1, 19, 669 \nS.E.2d 61, 72 (2008).  North Carolina does no t recognize a separate civil action for \ncivil conspiracy.  Dove v. Harvey, 168 N.C. App. 687, 690, 608 S.E.2d 798, 800 (2005). \nRather, civil conspiracy is premised  on the underlying wrongful acts.  Id.; Piraino \nBros., LLC v. Atl. Fin. Group, 211 N.C. App. 343, 350, 712 S.E.2d 328, 333 (2011).  A \ncivil conspiracy is essentially an action for damages, and no action lies unless one or \nmore conspirators actually cause damage. See Bradshaw v. Maiden , 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 80, at *46 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2015) (citing Henderson v. LeBauer, 101 \nN.C. App. 255, 260, 399 S.E.2d 142, 145 (1991)); see generally Coleman v. Coleman, \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 114 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 10, 2015).  In short, “civil conspiracy is \npremised on the underlying wrongful acts,” Dove, 168 N.C. App. at  690, 608 S.E.2d \nat 800, and “liability attaches only if one of the conspirators is liable for an underlying \ntort.”  Riley v. Dow Corning Corp., 767 F. Supp. 735, 740 (M.D.N.C. 1991) (applying \nNorth Carolina law).   \n{62} Here, Plaintiffs allege that the Dancers:  \nmade an agreement with [the Metr opolitan Defendants] whereby the \nDancers would unlawfully leave Plaintiffs’ dance studio to come work \nfor [the Metropolitan Defendants],  unlawfully solicit Plaintiffs’ \ncustomers, and unlawfully disclose Plaintiffs’ trade secrets to [the \nMetropolitan Defendants] in order to cripple or eliminate Plaintiffs as a \ncompetitor in the dance industry.   \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 48.)  Plaintiffs further allege  that “[a]s a result of the conspiracy \nbetween the Defendants, made pursuant to a common scheme, Plaintiffs’ business \nand reputation were significantly damaged.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 49.)   \n{63}  Of the claims remaining against the Dancers—breach of contract, \nfraudulent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment—only one, fraudulent \nmisrepresentation, could potentially serve as the requisite underlying tort.  See, e.g., \nKoch Measurement Devices, Inc. v. Armke , 2013 NCBC LEXIS 45, (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 14, 2013) (“any civil conspiracy must necessarily be premised on an underlying \ntort claim.”).  Plaintiffs’ fraudulent misr epresentation claim, however, rests upon \nallegations of fraud by the Dancers in 2010 and 2011, which are completely unrelated \nto the alleged (and much later) agreement between the Dancers and the Metropolitan \nDefendants upon which Plaintiffs’ civil conspiracy claim rests.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiffs’ claim for civil conspiracy against the Dancers should be \ndismissed.  \nVI. \nTHE METROPOLITAN DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \n{64} The Court next turns to the Metropolitan Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  \nLike the Dancers’ Motion, the Metropolitan Defendants’ Motion seeks dismissal of all \nof Plaintiffs’ claims asserted against them.   \nA. Tortious Interference with Contract \n{65} “To establish a claim for tortious interference with contract, a plaintiff must \nshow: (1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third person which confers upon \nthe plaintiff a contractual right against a third person; (2) the defendant knows of the \ncontract; (3) the defendant intentionally induces the third person not to perform the \ncontract; (4) and in doing so acts without justification; (5) resulting in actual damage \nto plaintiff.”  White v. Cross Sales & Eng’g Co., 177 N.C. App. 765, 768–69, 629 S.E.2d \n898, 901 (2006) (citing United Labs., Inc. v. Kuykendall, 322 N.C. 643, 661, 370 S.E.2d \n375, 387 (1988)).  North Carolina courts have held that “competition in business \nconstitutes justifiable interference in another’s business relations and is not \nactionable so long as it is carried on in  furtherance of one’s own interests and by \nmeans that are lawful.”  \nPeoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Hooks , 322 N.C. 216, 222, 367 \nS.E.2d 647, 650 (1988).  A clai m for tortious interference with contract must “allege \nfacts demonstrating that defendants’ actions were not prompted by legitimate \nbusiness purposes.”  Embree Constr. Grp. v. Rafcor, Inc. , 330 N.C. 487, 500, 411 \nS.E.2d 916, 926 (1992) (citation and quotation omitted).   \n{66} Plaintiffs allege that they “had valid contracts with [the Dancers] whereby \nPlaintiffs procured O1-B [sic] nonimmigran t work visas for Defendants in exchange \nfor Defendants’ promises to work exclusively for Plaintiffs at Plaintiffs’ dance studio,” \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 38), and that the Metropolitan Defendants “had knowledge . . . of the \nexisting contracts pursuant to the O1-B [s ic] work visas between Plaintiffs and [the \nDancers].” (Am. Compl. ¶ 39.)  Further, Plaintiffs allege that the Metropolitan \nDefendants “intentionally induc[ed the Dancers] not to perform under their contracts \nwith Plaintiffs.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 40.)  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the Metropolitan \nDefendants’ “conduct was malicious and without justification” and, “[a]s a result of \n[the Metropolitan Defendants’] unjustified interference . . . , Plaintiffs suffered a \nsignificant loss in business revenue, and incurred significant damages and expenses.” \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 44–45.)   \n{67} The Court has previously concluded that the Employment Agreements and \nthe I-129 Petitions, read together in light of the incorporation of portions of the \nPetitions into the Employment Agreements, constitute the contracts on which \nPlaintiffs’ claims for alleged breach of contract rest.  Plaintiffs do not allege, however, \nthat the Metropolitan Defendants had knowledge of either the Employment \nAgreements or the I-129 Petitions and in stead contend that the Metropolitan \nDefendants simply knew that the Dancers had work visas.  Plaintiffs have not alleged \nthat the work visas constituted a contract  between Plaintiffs and the Dancers or, \nmore importantly, that the work visas co ntained the operative provisions of the \nEmployment Agreements, including provisions relating to non-competition, non-\nsolicitation and confidentiality upon which the specific allegations of the tortious \ninterference claim rely.   \n{68} Further, even if the Metropolitan Defendants could be deemed to have had \nknowledge of the I-129 Petitions based on th e existence of the Dancers’ work visas, \nthe Petitions do not represent that the Dancers had agreed not to work for the \nMetropolitan Defendants or others as Plaint iffs contend.  To the contrary, the I-129 \nPetitions simply represented that the Dancers would be required to obtain new work \nvisas to work for an employer other than Happy Dance, not that they were precluded \nfrom working for another employer.  Indeed, the Employment Agreement with each \nDancer allegedly contained the exclusivity provision that Plaintiffs seek to enforce in \nthis action, and Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the Metropolitan Defendants had \nany knowledge of either Dancer’s Employment Agreement.  \n{69} Accordingly, based on the above, the Court concludes that because Plaintiffs \nhave failed to allege facts showing that the Metropolitan Defendants knew of the \ncontracts Plaintiffs have alleged existed with the Dancers, Plaintiffs’ claim for \ntortious interference should be dismissed.14   \nB. Aiding and Abetting \n{70} In its fourth cause of action labeled “Aiding and Abetting,” Plaintiffs allege \nthat the Metropolitan Defendants “had kn owledge of [the Danc ers’] contracts with \nPlaintiffs, and provided substantial assistance towards the breach of said contracts.”  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 53.)  Plaintiffs also allege that the Metropolitan Defendants “acted in \nconcert with and assisted [t he Dancers] with breaching their fiduciary duties to \nPlaintiffs by offering to and then subsequently employing them in violation of their \nemployment contracts with Plaintiffs.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 53.)  Accordingly, it appears \nthat Plaintiffs assert both a claim for aidi ng and abetting breach of contract and a \nclaim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.   \n{71} Plaintiffs have not offered any case support for their purported claim for \naiding and abetting breach of contract.  It appears to the Court that such a claim has \nonly been referenced in a single reported North Carolina decision—\nPete Fortner, \nPLLC v. Koonce Wooten & Haywood, LLP , No. COA10-1260, 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS \n1304 (2011) (unpublished)—and the trial co urt dismissed the claim in that case \nwithout subsequent appellate review.  Id. at *5.  Numerous other states have \nexpressly declined to recognize such a cause of action.  See, e.g., AmTrust N. Am., Inc. \nv. Safebuilt Ins. Servs ., No. 14 Civ. 09494 (CM), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162515, at \n*33 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2015) (“New York law . . . af fords no cause of action for aiding \nand abetting breach of contract.”); Zachman v. Vohra, No. 1:15 CV 5293, 2015 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 157644, at *11 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 23, 2015) (“Illinois law does not recognize \na cause of action for aiding and abetting breach of contract.”); Acclaim Sys. v. Infosys, \nLtd., No. 13-7336, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90937,  at *14–15 (E.D. Pa. July 14, 2015) \n                                                 \n14  In light of the Court’s dismissal of this claim, Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages under N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 1D-15 based on Defendants’ alleged tortious interference with contract should likewise be \ndismissed.  \n \n(noting Pennsylvania law does not recognize claim for aiding and abetting breach of \ncontract); R. Prasad Indus. v. Flat Irons Envtl. Solutions Corp., No. CV 12-8261-PCT-\nJAT, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71074, at *24–25 (D. Ariz. May 20, 2013) (applying \nArizona law and observing “[plaintiff] has provided no authority—and the Court has \nfound none—recognizing a cause of action  for aiding and abetting a breach of \ncontract.”).  The Court therefore declines to recognize a cause of action for aiding and \nabetting a breach of contract under North Carolina law on the facts pleaded here.15   \n{72} As for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, this Court has previously \nrecognized that “[w]hether North Carolina recognizes a claim for aiding and abetting \na breach of fiduciary duty remains an open question.”  Veer Right, 2015 NCBC LEXIS \n13, at *6.  Such a claim must necessarily fail here, however, because Plaintiffs have \nfailed to allege a breach of  a fiduciary duty by the Dancers and have not brought a \nclaim based on such an alleged breach.  See id. at *8 (“[I]f North Carolina recognizes \na claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, the elements would include: \n(1) violation of a fiduciary duty by the primary party . . . .”).   \n{73} Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to state a valid \nclaim for “aiding and abetting” and that Plaintiffs’ purported claim should therefore \nbe dismissed.   \nC. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets \n{74} Because the Court has previously conclu ded in its analysis of the Dancers’ \nMotion that Plaintiffs have neither identified their alleged trade secrets with \nsufficient particularity nor sufficiently alleged the acts by which the alleged \nmisappropriation was accomplished, the Court similarly concludes that the \nMetropolitan Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss this claim should be granted on these \nsame grounds.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claim for \n                                                 \n15 Some courts have noted that “aiding and abetting breach of contract” is akin to a claim for tortious \ninterference with contract.  See, e.g., MacKay v. Donovan, 747 F. Supp. 2d 496, 504 (E.D. Pa. 2010) \n(“Although Plaintiffs do not plead Count V as a tort, but rather as ‘aiding and abetting in breach of \ncontract,’ for the purpose of this Motion the Cour t will construe this claim as a claim for tortious \ninterference with contract.”). \nmisappropriation of trade secrets against the Metropolitan Defendants should be \ndismissed.   \nD. Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \n{75} To state a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices (“UDTP”) under \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1, a pl aintiff must allege: “(1) an  unfair or deceptive act or \npractice, or unfair method of competition, (2) in or affecting commerce, and (3) which \nproximately caused actual injury to the plaintiff or his business.”  Combs & Assocs. \nv. Kennedy, 147 N.C. App. 362, 373–74, 555 S.E.2d 634, 642 (2001).  Moreover, “some \ntype of egregious or aggravating circumstances must be alleged[.]”  Dalton v. Camp, \n353 N.C. 647, 657, 548 S.E.2d 704, 711 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). \n{76} Plaintiffs’ UDTP claim is advanced against only the Metropolitan \nDefendants and relies on the allegations Plaintiffs have pleaded in support of its now-\ndismissed tortious interference with cont ract and misappropriation of trade secrets \nclaims.  Having failed to plead that Plaintiffs have protectable trade secrets that the \nMetropolitan Defendants have misappropria ted, and having failed to allege facts \nshowing that the Metropolitan Defendants  had knowledge of the alleged contracts \nPlaintiffs contend that the Dancers breach ed, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ \nallegations in support of its UDTP claim fail to assert sufficient egregious or \naggravating circumstances to sustain their UDTP claim.  See, e.g. , AmeriGas \nPropane, L.P. v. Coffey, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 98 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 15, 2015) (holding \nthat “dismissal of [defendants’] trade se cret and tortious interference claims \nextinguishes [plaintiff’s] UDTP claim on these grounds”); Combs, 147 N.C. App. at \n374, 555 S.E.2d at 642 (trial court properly dismissed UDTP claim based on tortious \ninterference with contract when court di smissed tortious interference claim).  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ UDTP claim should be dismissed. \nE. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \n{77} The Court has previously concluded th at the Dancers’ alleged extreme and \noutrageous conduct does not rise to the level necessary to state a claim for intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress.  Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleges that the \nMetropolitan Defendants engaged in iden tical conduct.  For the same reasons, \ntherefore, the Court concludes that Plaint iffs’ intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress claim against the Metropolitan Defendants should be dismissed.   \nF. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress \n{78} As stated above, to state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, \nthe plaintiff must allege: “(1) the defendant negligently engaged in conduct, (2) it was \nreasonably foreseeable that such conduct would cause the plaintiff severe emotional \ndistress . . . , and (3) the conduct did in fact cause the plaintiff severe emotional \ndistress.”  Wilkerson, 229 N.C. App. at 675, 748 S.E.2d at 159.  “The first element of \na [negligent infliction of emotional distre ss] claim requires allegations that the \n‘defendant failed to exercise due care in the performance of some legal duty owed to \n[the] plaintiff under the circumstances[.]’”  Horne v. Cumberland Cnty. Hosp. Sys. , \n228 N.C. App. 142, 148, 746 S.E.2d 13, 19 (2013) (quoting Guthrie v. Conroy, 152 N.C. \nApp 15, 25, 567 S.E.2d 403, 410–11 (2002) (emphasis added) (alterations in original).   \n{79} Here, although Plaintiffs allege that the Metropolitan Defendants “had a \nlegal duty to abide by state [and] federal laws,” and breached that duty, Plaintiffs’ \nAmended Complaint contains no allegations supporting that the Metropolitan \nDefendants owed a duty, legal or otherwis e, to Plaintiffs.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 88.)  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not stated a valid claim for \nnegligent infliction of emotional distress against the Metropolitan Defendants and \nthat Plaintiffs’ claim should therefore be dismissed. \nG. Unjust Enrichment \n{80} Although the Court declined to reach Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim \nagainst the Dancers, Plaintiffs’ claim agai nst the Metropolitan Defendants is not \npleaded as an alternative claim to a breach of contract claim against the Metropolitan \nDefendants.  Indeed, Plaintiffs do not alle ge the existence of any contract between \nPlaintiffs and any of the Metropolitan Defe ndants.  Accordingly, the Court properly \nconsiders the dismissal of Plaintiffs’ claim on this Motion.   \n{81} “To state a claim for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must establish ‘(1) a \nmeasureable benefit was conferred on the defendant, (2) the defendant consciously \naccepted that benefit, and (3) the bene fit was not conferred officiously or \ngratuitously.’”  S. Fastening, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *27 (citing cases) (internal \nquotation omitted).  An unjust enrichment cl aim “is neither in tort nor contract but \nis described as a claim in quasi contract or a contract implied in law.”  Booe, 322 N.C. \nat 570, 369 S.E.2d at 556.  “The doctrine of unjust enrichment was devised by equity \nto exact the return of, or payment for, benefits received under circumstances where \nit would be unfair for the recipient to retain them without the contributor being \nrepaid or compensated.  More must be shown than that one party voluntarily \nbenefited another or his property.”  \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Browning , 230 \nN.C. App. 537, 542, 750 S.E.2d 555, 559–60 (2013) (citation omitted).   \n{82} Plaintiffs allege here that the Metropolitan Defendants “received the benefit \nof Plaintiffs’ procurement of the O1-B [sic] work visas for [the Dancers], because they \nwere able to employ [the Dancers], though unlawfully, without paying for their O1-B \n[sic] work visas.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 96.)  Plaintiffs further allege that the Metropolitan \nDefendants “consciously accepted the benefit of employing [the Dancers] without \nproperly obtaining new visas for them” and that Plaintiffs “did not procure the visas \ngratuitously or by an interference in Defendants’ affairs.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 96–97.) \n{83} As pleaded here, however, the purported Employment Agreements require \nthe Dancers to reimburse Plaintiffs for th e costs Plaintiffs incurred “for employee’s \nbenefit” in obtaining the work visas in the event the Dancers did not fulfill their \nobligations under the Agreements.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek through their unjust \nenrichment claim against the Metropolitan Defendants to recover the same alleged \ndamages that they contend they are permi tted to recover through their breach of \ncontract claims against the Dancers.  Our Supreme Court has long held that “[i]t is a \nwell-established principle that an express contract precludes an implied contract with \nreference to the same matter.”  \nVetco Concrete Co. v. Troy Lumber Co., 256 N.C. 709, \n713, 124 S.E.2d 905, 906 (1962) (dismissing  unjust enrichment claim against \ndefendant where benefit to defendant was furnished under an express contract with \nanother); see, e.g., Jefferson Standard Ins. Co. v. Guilford Cnty ., 225 N.C. 293, 300, \n34 S.E.2d 430, 434 (1945) (“The hallmark rule of equity is that it will not apply in any \ncase where the party seeking it has a full and complete remedy at law.”) (quotations \nand citations omitted).  Application of th is principle here requires dismissal of \nPlaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim against the Metropolitan Defendants. \n{84} Separately, our Supreme Court has also made clear that “[n]ot every \nenrichment of one by the voluntary act of another is unjust.”  Wright v. Wright, 305 \nN.C. 345, 351, 289 S.E.2d 347, 350, (1982).  Indeed, “[w]here a person has officiously \nconferred a benefit upon another, the other is enriched but is not considered to be \nunjustly enriched.  The recipient of a benefit voluntarily bestowed without solicitation \nor inducement is not liable for their value.”  Rhyne v. Sheppard, 224 N.C. 734, 737, \n32 S.E. 2d 316, 318 (1944).   Here, Plaintiffs have failed to plead that the Metropolitan \nDefendants took any action to solicit or induce Plaintiffs to incur the expenses they \nnow seek to recover through their unjust enrichment claim.  For this separate reason, \ntherefore, Plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim against the Metropolitan Defendants \nshould be dismissed.  See, e.g., Homeq v. Watkins , 154 N.C. App. 731, 733–34, 572 \nS.E.2d 871, 873 (2002) (holding unsolicited payment of a deed  of trust does not, by \nitself, support an unjust enrichment claim); JP Morgan, 230 N.C. App. at 544, 750 \nS.E.2d at 561 (dismissing unjust enrichme nt claim for lack of solicitation or \ninducement of benefit conferred). \nH. Civil Conspiracy \n{85} The Court has previously dismissed Plaintiffs’ civil conspiracy claim against \nthe Dancers, as well as all of the underly ing tort claims against the Metropolitan \nDefendants.  See generally, e.g., Piraino Bros., 211 N.C. App. at 350, 712 S.E.2d at \n333-34 (“Where this Court has found summa ry judgment on the underlying tort \nclaims to be proper, we have held that a plaintiff's claim for civil conspiracy must also \nfail.”).  For the same reasons, therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claim for \ncivil conspiracy against the Metropolitan Defendants should also be dismissed.    \nI. Piercing the Corporate Veil \n{86} Plaintiffs purport to assert “piercing the corporate veil” as a separate cause \nof action against the Manlys.  The North Carolina Supreme Court has made it clear, \nhowever, that “the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is not a theory of liability.  \nRather, it provides an avenue to pursue legal claims against corporate officers or \ndirectors who would otherwise be shielded by the corporate form.”  Green v. Freeman, \n367 N.C. 136, 146, 749 S.E.2d 262, 271 (2013).  See also Green v. Freeman, 756 S.E.2d \n368, 372 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014) (“[P]iercing the corporate veil . . . is not itself a cause of \naction.”).   \n{87} Moreover, in light of the Court’s dismissal of all of Plaintiffs’ claims against \nthe Metropolitan Defendants, the necessary predicate to the assertion of Plaintiffs’ \npiercing the corporate veil theory of relief is extinguished.  \nSee, e.g., McKee v. James, \n2014 NCBC LEXIS 74, at *43–44 (N.C. Supe r. Ct. Dec. 31, 2014) (dismissing \ncontingent claims based on piercing the corporate veil theory when claims against \nprincipal were dismissed). \n{88} Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ claims against the Manlys \nfor, and based on, piercing the corporate veil should be dismissed.   \nVII. \nCONCLUSION \n{89}   Based on the foregoing, the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES in \npart the Dancers’ Motion to Dismiss as follows:  \nA. The Dancers’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for misappropriation \nof trade secrets, intentional inflicti on of emotional distress, negligent \ninfliction of emotional distress, equi table estoppel, and civil conspiracy \nis GRANTED.  These claims against the Dancers are hereby \nDISMISSED with prejudice. \nB. The Dancers’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract, \nfraudulent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and punitive \ndamages is DENIED. \n{90} The Court hereby GRANTS the Metropolitan Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nand DISMISSES Plaintiffs’ claims against the Metropolitan Defendants with \nprejudice. \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of January, 2016.   \n \n/s/ Louis A.
