This litigation concerns a commercial-real-estate portfolio of five office \nbuildings in Durham, North Carolina (the “Durham Property”).   Plaintiffs are a \ncombination of limited-liability companies (“LLCs”) and members of those LLCs who \nutilized a tax-deferred exchange under section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code to \npurchase fractional tenant -in-common (“TIC”)  interests in  the Durham Property .  \nPlaintiffs claim that they were induced to purchase interests in the Durham Property \nby materially false statements or omissions in a private -placement memorandum \n \n \n(“PPM”) concerning the probability that the Durham Property’s primary credit tenant \nwould renew its leases.  The primary credit tenant’s leases were critical to the \nDurham P roperty’s value , as demonstrated when that tenant  later terminated its \nleases and the Property went into foreclosure.   \n3. In the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit, Plaintiffs bring claims against the entity \nthat issued the PPM and against other related entities allegedly responsible for the \nmisrepresentations in the PPM .  Plaintiffs claim that th ose Defendants are subject \nto primary liability under the North Carolina Securities Act (“Securities Act”).   \n4. In the Highwoods Lawsuit, Plaintiffs bring claims against the Durham \nProperty’s prior owner and the prior owner’s  selling agent.  Plaintiffs contend that \nthose Defendants had material knowledge that they failed to disclose, which led to \nthe misrepresentations in the PPM  and subjects those Defendants to secondary \nliability under the Securities Act.  \n5. All parties in the two lawsuits have moved for summary judgment on \none or more ground.  This Order & Opinion addresses the following motions. \n6. The first m otion is The Highwoods Defendants’ Motion f or Partial \nSummary Judgment that the Transaction at Issue Does Not Constitute a Security \nUnder the North Carolina Securities Act (“Highwoods’ Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment”).  This m otion presents the question whether the TIC interests  that \nPlaintiffs purchased in the Durham Property  are “securities” within the meaning of \nthe Securities Act.  Highwoods’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED, \nand summary judgment is GRANTED for Plaintiffs on this issue. \n \n \n7. The second and third motions are The Highwoods Defendants’ Motion \nfor Judgment on the Pleadings (“Highwoods’ 12(c) Motion”)  and Thomas Linderman \nGraham, Inc.’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (“TLG’s 12(c) Motion”)  \n(collectively the “12(c) Motions”) .  Th e 12(c) Motions present the issue whether any \nclaims under the Securities Act must be restricted to those Plaintiffs who either \nreceived or accepted an offer for the sale of a security in North Carolina.  The 12(c) \nMotions are GRANTED, and any claim under the Securities Act brought by Plaintiffs \nother than NNN Durham Office Portfolio 13, LLC, Fannie B. Blackwelder, NNN \nDurham Office Portfolio 32, LLC, Kenneth Deno McLamb, NNN Durham Office \nPortfolio 33, LLC, and Cynthia McLamb are DISMISSED. \n8. The next five motions are cross-motions for summary judgment on the \nissues of primary and secondary liability under the Securities Act in both lawsuits, \nand on additional claims in the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit.  These motions  include \n(1) Highwoods Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (“Highwoods’ Mo tion for \nSummary Judgment”) , (2) TLG’s M otion for Summary Judgment , (3) Defendants’ \nJoint Motion for Summary Judgment as to All Claims and All Parties (“Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment”) , (4) Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment Pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 56 (“Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment Against Highwoods & TLG”) , and (5) Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment Pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 56 (“Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment Again st the Grubb & Ellis Defendants”) .  As to these \nmotions: \n \n \n Highwoods’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED;  \n TLG’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED;  \n The Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and claims against \nGrubb & Ellis Company (“Grubb & Ellis Co.”) and NNN Realty \nAdvisors, Inc. (“NNN Realty Advisors”) are DISMISSED; \n Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Against \nHighwoods & TLG is DENIED; and  \n Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Against the \nGrubb & Ellis Defendants is DENIED.    \n9. Finally, the Court addresses Plaintiffs’ Motion to Modify the Court’s \nOrder with Respect to Their Claims of Punitive Damages Pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. \n54(b) (“Plaintiffs’ 54(b) Motion”) , filed in the Highwoods Lawsuit .  This motion is \nDENIED AS MOOT. \n10. In summary, the Court determines the following: \n Defendants have not presented adequate evidence for the Court \nto find that  Plaintiffs’ TIC interests, clearly marketed as \nsecurities, reserved a sufficient degree of control to the investors \nto disqualify the investment as an investment contract subject to \nthe Securities Act.  \n Claims under the Securities Act must be restricted to claims \nbrought by Plaintiffs who received or accepted an offer to sell in \n \n \nNorth Carolina, and all other Plaintiffs ’ Securities Act claims \nmust be dismissed.  \n All claims against Grubb & Ellis Co. and NNN Realty Advisors  \nshould be dismissed .  There are material issues of fact as to \nwhether other Defendants in the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit may be \nfound primarily liable under the Securities Act.  \n Even assuming  that Plaintiffs can prove that any of the \nDefendants in the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit are primar ily liable \nunder the Securities Act, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a \nbasis for imposing  secondary liability on Defendants in the \nHighwoods Lawsuit. \n Defendants in the Grubb &  Ellis Lawsuit are not liable as a \nmatter of law on Plaintiffs’ claims of breach of contract, \nnegligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, \nconstructive fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices , civil \nconspiracy, or punitive damages under chapter 1D. \n This Order & Opinion resolves all claims against all parties in the \nHighwoods Lawsuit.  The issues arising from the surviving claims \nin the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit overlap with, and are common to, \nthe issues arising from claims dismissed by this Order & Opinion \nin both the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit and the Highwoods Lawsuit.  \nThus, the Court concludes , pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the North \n \n \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure, that this Order & Opinion shall \nconstitute a final judgment as to all parties and all claims except \nfor the remaining claims brought by the North Carolina Plaintiffs \nin the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit, and there is no just reason for delay \nin entering a final judgment.  To the contrary, a delay in entering \nfinal judgment as to the di smissed parties and claims in the \nGrubb & Ellis Lawsuit would cause substantial injustice to all \nparties. \n \nII. THE PARTIES \nA. Plaintiffs \n11. Plaintiffs in this litigation are thirty LLCs formed under Delaware law, \nand a combination of thirty-one individuals, trusts, and corporations that are the sole \nowners of those LLCs .1  Both the investment device —tenancy in common—and the \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs in this litigation are NNN Durham Office Portfolio 1, LLC; James Osmond; NNN \nDurham Office Portfolio 2, LLC; James Sun Yu Lam; NNN Durham Office Portfolio 3, LLC; \nGary F.

As a prerequisite to investing in the Durham Property, each TIC owner \nqualified as an accredited investor  by meeting certain income and net -worth \nrequirements.  Only three TIC owners—Fannie B. Blackwelder, Kenneth Deno \nMcLamb, and Cynthia McLamb —are North Carolina residents.  Those TIC owners \nand their respective LLCs—NNN Durham Office Portfolio 13, LLC, NNN Durham \nOffice Portfolio 32, LLC, and NNN Durham Office Portfolio 33, LLC—are collectively \nreferred to as the “North Carolina Plaintiffs.”  The other Plaintiffs (the “Out-of-State \nPlaintiffs”) received and accepted offer s to purchase their  TIC interests outside of \nNorth Carolina.   \nB. The Highwoods Defendants \n13. Defendants in the Highwoods Lawsuit are four entities that comprise a \npublicly traded real -estate investment trust: (1)  Highwoods DLF 98/29, LLC, \n(2) Highwoods DLF, LLC, (3) Highwoods Properties, Inc., and (4) Highwoods Realty \nLimited Partnership (collectively “Highwoods”).  Highwoods owns, develops, acquires, \nleases, and manages properties in the Southeast.   \n                                                 \nOffice Portfolio 22, LLC; Jack D. La Flesch, Trustee for the JDL Trust; NNN Durham Office \nPortfolio 24, LLC; James K.

Pista; and Carol E. Pista. \n \n \n14. Highwoods owned the Durham Property from March 15, 1999, to March \n8, 2007.   \nC. Thomas Linderman Graham Inc. \n15. Thomas Linderman Graham Inc. (“TLG”) is a former North Carolina -\nbased commercial -real-estate company .  TLG conducted business under the trade \nname Grubb & Ellis |Thomas Linderman Graham  as a member of  a network of \nindependently owned and operated real -estate brokerage businesses  that grant \npermission to use the Grubb & Ellis brand name. \n16. TLG was Highwoods’ exclusive selling agent for the sale of the Durham \nProperty. \nD. The Grubb & Ellis Defendants \n17. Defendants in the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit are Grubb & Ellis Co., Grubb \n& Ellis Realty Investors, LLC (“GERI”), Grubb & Ellis Securities, Inc. (“Grubb & Ellis \nSecurities”), NNN Durham Office Portfolio, LLC (“NNN Office”), and NNN Realty \nAdvisors (collectively the “Grubb & Ellis Defendants”).  For simplicity, in this Order \n& Opinion, the Court refers to GERI as “Triple Net,” and to Grubb & Ellis Securities \nas “NNN Capital.” \n(1) Grubb & Ellis Co. \n18. Grubb & Ellis Co. is a Delaware corporation that was founded in 1958 , \nand by the mid -1980s, had become the third largest commercial -real-estate firm in \nthe United States. \n \n \n19. Grubb & Ellis Co. was not directly involved with the sale or purchase of \nthe Durham Property.  On December 10, 2007, Grubb & Ellis Co. completed a reverse \ntriangular merger with NNN Realty  Advisors, which caused NNN Realty Advisors \nand its affiliates to become wholly owned subsidiaries of Grubb & Ellis Co.  Through \nthe merger, Grubb & Ellis Co.  acquired NNN Realty  Advisors’ 1031 TIC-managed \nportfolio, which included the portfolio for the Durham Property.  \n20. Plaintiffs now concede that all claims against Grubb & Ellis Co. should \nbe dismissed. \n(2) Triple Net \n21. Founded in 1998, Triple Net Properties, LLC (“Triple Net”) acquired, \nsyndicated, and managed commercial properties for TIC ownership , and sponsored \nmore than 150 TIC programs.  Triple Net was the manager of both NNN Office and \nTriple Net Properties Realty, Inc. (“Triple Net Realty”), the property manager for the \nDurham Property, which is not named as a defendant in this litigation.   \n22. Triple Net’s name changed to GERI in 2007 when NNN Realty Advisors \nmerged with Grubb & Ellis  Co.  The company’s name changed to NNN Realty \nInvestors, LLC in August 2011. \n(3) NNN Capital \n23. NNN Capital Corp. (“NNN Capital”) was the managing broker –dealer \nthat offered TIC interests in the Durham Property  to Plaintiffs.  After the Grubb & \nEllis–NNN Realty Advisors merger in December 2007, NNN Capital’s name changed \nto Grubb & Ellis Securities.  \n \n \n(4) NNN Office \n24. NNN Office is a Delaware LLC formed by Triple Net in 2007 for the sole \npurpose of acquiring the Durham Property.   \n25. After forming NNN Office , Triple Net prepared the PPM that was \nutilized in offering TIC interests in the Durham Property , and issued the PPM \nthrough NNN Office .  NNN Office  owned a 15.773% TIC interest in the Durham \nProperty and is referred to as “TIC 0” in its capacity as a TIC owner.   \n(5) NNN Realty Advisors \n26. NNN Realty Advisors was formed in September 2006  as the parent \ncompany of Triple Net, Triple Net Realty, and NNN Capital.  NNN Realty Advisors \nbecame a subsidiary of Grubb & Ellis Co. when those companies merged in 2007.  \n \nIII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n27. The Court does not make findings of fact when it rules on a motion for \nsummary judgment, but it may summarize the underlying facts to provide context for \nits ruling.  See, e.g., In re Estate of Pope, 192 N.C. App. 321, 329, 666 S.E.2d 140, 147 \n(2008).  Contested facts are construed in favor of the party opposing the motion.   \nDalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001). \nA. The Durham Property \n28. The Durham Property  includes five office buildings in Durham, North \nCarolina, located at 3414 Duke S treet, 4117 North Roxboro Road, 3404 North Duke \nStreet, 4101 North Roxboro Road, and 4020 North Roxboro Road.   \n \n \n29. In 2006, when Highwoods first determined that it would  sell the \nDurham Property, approximately 99% of the office space in the Property was under \nlease.  T wo primary tenants were Duke Pediatrics and Duke ’s Patient Revenue \nManagement Organization (“PRMO”), both which are affiliated with Duke University \nHealth System, Inc. (collectively “Duke”).  Duke leased 52% of the Durham Property.  \nPRMO occupied three of the five buildings in the Property, including a sublease with \nQualex, Inc. in half of one building.  PRMO’s sublease was due to expire in February \n2009, and its leases in the other two buildings were set to expire in June 2010.   \nB. The Confidential Offering Memorandum \n30. In spring 2006, Highwoods approached TLG about selling the Durham \nProperty.  Highwoods and TLG entered into an exclusive listing agreement in October \n2006 for TLG to market and sell the Durham Property.  TLG prepared a Confidential \nOffering Memorandum (“COM”) for prospective buyers, dated December 6, 2006.  (See \nHighwoods’ Dep. Ex. 66  (“COM”).)  The COM targeted  primarily large real -estate \nholding companies and real -estate investment trusts.   There has bee n no assertion \nthat Highwoods or TLG marketed the Durham Property as a security.    \n31. Based on information provided by Highwoods, TLG prepared an ARGUS \nsoftware model to accompany the COM.   (Merklein Dep. vol. II, 364:7 –13.)  An \nARGUS model creates  a future cash flow based on  certain assumptions , such as \nrenewal probabilities for current tenants, market rental rates, and tenant -\nimprovement costs.  (Merklein Dep. vol. II, 363:6–365:12.)  The COM disclosed that \nthe leases for the Durham Property’s tenants were set to expire in 2009 and 2010 and \n \n \ncontained no renewal options.  (COM 34–38.)  The assumptions in TLG’s ARGUS \nmodel showed a tenant-renewal probability of 75% for four buildings in the Durham \nProperty, and a 90% renewal probability for one bu ilding.  (Merklein Dep. vol. II, \n366:12–14.)  Prospective purchasers were able to prepare their own projections based \non modified assumptions.  (Merklein Dep. vol. II, 366:20–367:6, 370:2–16.)    \n32. The record demonstrates that no Plaintiff directly  relied on the \ninformation in the COM to make their investment.  In its Order & Opinion on motions \nto dismiss in the Highwoods Lawsuit in 2013 (“ February 2013 Decision”), the Court \nrejected any claim based on indirect reliance stemming from Triple Net’s reliance on \nthe COM.  See NNN Durham Office Portfolio 1, LLC v. Highwoods Realty Ltd. P’ship, \nNo. 12 CVS 3945, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11, at *62–63 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 19, 2013). \nC. Prior Developments Not Disclosed in the COM \n33. Before the COM  was issued , Duke had taken prel iminary steps to \nprepare for potentially relocating its PRMO operations, including issuing a public  \nrequest for proposal (“RFP”) for a build-to-suit building.  (Selig Dep. vol. II, 212:14–\n213:13, June 4, 2015.)  In September 2006, in response to the RFP, Highwoods made \nan initial informal proposal for a build -to-suit building for Duke to be ready by July \n2008.  (See Selig Dep. Ex. 4, at 2.)  Highwoods made a formal build -to-suit proposal \nfor Duke on December 6, 2006.  (See Selig Dep. Ex. 1289.)  By January  2007, \nHighwoods had offered to pay Duke’s  remaining lease obligations if P RMO chose to \nvacate the Durham Property before its leases expired.   (Massey Dep. Ex. 545.)  The \nCOM did not disclose this information.   \n \n \n34. TLG was aware that Duke saw significant limi tations with PRMO’s \nspace in the Durham Property.  In a November 21, 2006 e -mail from TLG \nrepresentative Jim McMillan to Highwoods’ management, McMillan said that Scott \nSelig, Duke’s associate vice president of capital assets,  had advised him that Duke \nwas looking at potential relocation options, in part because PRMO’s space in the \nDurham Property had significant inefficiencies, including excessive square footage \nper person.  (McMillan Dep. Ex. 773.) \n35. Several days earlier, McMillan had shared with Highwoods a valuation \nthat varied from the ARGUS-based valuation reflected in the COM.  Whereas the \nCOM included a projection based on a 75% probability of Duke renewing its leases in \nfour of the five office buildings, TLG separately shared with Highwoods valuation s \nbased on a 25% and a 0% probability of renewal, using different discount rates to \ncompare those valuations with the 75% valuation.  (See McMillan Dep. Ex. 771.)  In \na cover e-mail, McMillan stated,  \n[b]ottom line is if a buyer does not buy into this Duke renewal then you \nare looking at a higher present value calc and ultimately a valuation \naround $25.6 to $26.6 million.  Most will end up in the middle around \n$28–$29 million with our top and ultimate buyer buy ing into it and \nending up to our pricing we discussed today.   \n \n(McMillan Dep. Ex. 760.)    \n36. In April 2006, McMillan, aware that Duke’s leases would expire in 2009 \nand 2010, had settled on a “fairly conservative” valuation of $30.2 to $31.3 million .  \n(McMillan Dep. Ex. 732.)  McMillan recognized that, “[a]ll in all, a big part of th [e] \n \n \nsale will be the environment the properties sit in and the likelihood an [ ] investor \nbelieves Duke is there for the long run.”  (McMillan Dep. Ex. 732.)   \nD. Triple Net Submits the High Bid on the Durham Property \n37. TLG received eleven initial bids on the Durham Property.  Triple  Net \nsubmitted the winning bid of $34.2 million on December 21, 2006, conditioned on a  \nfifteen-day due-diligence period  that would commence upon Highwoods p roviding \ndue-diligence materials to Triple Net.   (McMillan Dep. Exs. 799, 801.)   The offer \ndisclosed that Triple Net was contemplating a syndicat ion through which it would \noffer fractional interests.  Triple Net was well known for offering TIC syndications. \n38. Highwoods delivered the due-diligence materials to Triple Net on \nJanuary 9, 2007.  (McMillan Dep. Ex. 814.)  Highwoods and Triple Net executed a \nPurchase and Sale Agreement with an effective date of January 24, 2007.  (See Grubb \n& Ellis Defs. ’ Summ. J.  Ex. 2 (“Purchase & Sale Agreement”).)  The Purchase and \nSale Agreement acknowledged Triple Net’s option to structure the sale as a 1031 \nexchange, and recognized that Triple Net could assign the purchase contract to a \npublicly registered company required to make filings with the SEC.  (Purchase & Sale \nAgreement ¶¶ 14, 29.)   \n39. The offer acknowledged Triple Net’s “intention of making and relying \nupon its own investigation of the physical, environmental, economic use, compliance, \nand legal condition of the Property,” with an agreement that Triple Net would “not \nlater rely  . . . upon any representations and warranties made by [Highwoods or \nHighwoods’ agents].”  (Purchase & Sale Agreement ¶ 11.6.)  Triple Net’s obligation to \n \n \nclose was conditioned  on, among other things, no major tenant having defaulted \nunder their lease or giv ing written notice to Highwoods of their intent to default.  \n(Purchase & Sale Agreement ¶ 28.)   \nE. The PPM \n40. Triple Net intended to sell TIC interests as securities pursuant to a \nRegulation D private placement when it made  its offer to purchase the Durham \nProperty.  Triple Net began undertaking efforts necessary to solicit TIC investors to \npurchase the Property in early January 2007 , after it had submitted its purchase \noffer to Highwoods, but before it had completed its due diligence and executed the \nfinal purchase agreement. \n41. On January 5, 2007, Triple Net prepared the PPM and other offering  \nmaterials for prospective investors .  (See Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Summ. J. Ex. 19 \n(“PPM”).) The PPM disclosed  the objectives, risks, and terms associated with \ninvesting in the Durham Property .  The PPM also included the proposed LLC \nAgreement, Subscription Agreement, TIC Agreement, and Management Agreement.  \n(See PPM Exs. A (“LLC Agreement”), B (“Subscription Agreement”), C (“TIC \nAgreement”), D (“Management Agreement”).)  Also on January 5, 2007, NNN Capital \nissued the Soliciting Dealer Agreement to broker–dealers.  (See Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ \nSumm. J. Ex. 40.) \n42. The Court summarizes key provisions of the PPM below. \n \n \n \n \n(1) Limited to accredited investors who were to rely solely on the PPM \n43. To participate in the investment, each investor was required to complete \na TIC purchaser que stionnaire, which cautioned them to carefully read the PPM.   \n(See Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Summ. J. Ex. 18, at 1.)  \n44. The PPM named Triple Net as the manager of NNN Office , Triple Net \nRealty as the property manager for the Durham Property , and NNN Capita l as the \nmanaging broker –dealer.  (PPM i.)  The PPM states that it was to serve as  the \nexclusive basis for any purchase decision , and that a purchaser should not rely on \nany outside information or representations.  (PPM iv.)     \n(2) Risk factors \n45. The PPM contains eighteen pages of  risk factors, including warnings \nthat there was a large dependence on one tenant and that Duke’s leases were set to \nexpire.  (PPM 9.)   \n46. Under the risk factor “Large Dependence on One Tenant,” the PPM \nexplains the following: \nDuke University and its affiliates directly lease approximately 149,078 \nsquare feet in three buildings . . . . This accounts for approximately 54% \nof the available space in the Proper ty.  Of the leased space, 42,080 \nsquare feet expires in 2009 with the remaining 106,998 square feet \nexpiring in 2010.  In addition, the PRMO group has \nsubleased . . . approximately 12% of the entire Property[  ] in the 3404 \nNorth Duke Street building from Qualex, Inc. and occupies most of this \nspace.  Qualex has subleased this space to Duke  at a favorable rental \nrate as an incentive to sublease the entire second floor .  The leasing \nbroker who placed Duke within this space indicated that the PRMO \ngroup intends to grow into this space over time and may stay following \nthe expiration of the Qualex lease.  However, no assurance can be given \nthat the PRMO group will lease this space following the Qualex \nexpiration in 2010.  Additionally, there are no renewal option s on the \n \n \nDuke leases covering the [4117 North Roxboro Road] , 4020 North \nRoxboro Road and 4101 North Roxboro Road buildings.  Based on \nconversations with local leasing brokers, Duke is price-sensitive to their \nspace and may attempt to negotiate for below ma rket rental rates in \nconnection with a potential renewal of the space they currently occupy.  \nConsequently, no assurance can be given that then-market rental rates \ncould be attained should Duke choose to renew their respective leases in \n2009 and 2010.  Any large-scale departure by Duke would significantly \naffect the cash flow and fair market value of the Property and the \neconomic viability of the Property would be jeopardized due to the loss \nof rental revenue and the substantial cost for capital improvements and \nleasing commissions that may be required to retenant the Property.  In \na worst case scenario, the rental income from the Property would not be \nsufficient to make debt service payments on the Loan.  . . . [and] the \nLender would have the ability to exer cise its rights under the Loan \ndocuments, including foreclosure.  If the Lender were to foreclose, the \ninvestors could suffer a complete loss of their investment and certain \nmaterial adverse tax consequences.         \n \n(PPM 9.) \n47. Under the risk factor “Expiration of Leases,” the PPM further states the \nfollowing: \nUnless extended, leases with all of the tenants, representing 100% of the \nProperty, will expire within the next 3 calendar years. . . . The Property \nManager will use its good faith commercially reasonable efforts to retain \nexisting tenants and/or to re-lease and re-tenant vacant premises in the \nProperty.  However, no assurance can be given that the Property \nManager will be able to do so.  . . . [I]f the tenants do not renew their \nleases or downsize the space leased, the Property would suffer vacancy \nwhen the leases expire and no assurance can be given that the Property \nManager would be successful in re -leasing the vacant space.  If the \nProperty Manager were unable to re -lease this space, the Property \nwould not perform as contemplated . . . . \n \n(PPM 9.) \n48. These risks were further reiterated in an addendum to the PPM.  (See \nGrubb & Ellis Defs.’ Summ. J. Ex. 21, at 4–10.) \n \n \n \n(3) The Business Plan \n49. The PPM contains a Business Plan.  (See PPM 39.)  The PPM \nacknowledges that certain background information in the PPM was provided by TLG, \nbut states that the Business Plan “is based solely on [Triple Net’s] investigation of \nthe Prope rty, its location in the Durham, North Carolina office market and the \ntenants,” and is subject to the risk factors listed in the PPM.  (PPM 39.)   \n50. The Business Plan incorporates a financial analysis entitled “Projection \nof Income, Cash Flow and Loan Amortization of the Property,” attached as an exhibit \nto the PPM.  (PPM Ex. F.)   \n51. Regarding Duke’s leases, the Business Plan state s that, “[b]ased on \nDuke’s longevity as a tenant at the Property, [Triple Net] believes that Duke will \ncontinue to renew each of their leases.”  (PPM 40.)  It further states that, \n[b]ased upon the importance of Duke’s tenancy to the Property, [Triple \nNet] intends to engage Duke regarding extending their respective \nleases.  This will help reduce the uncertainty surrounding the expiration \nof their leases over the first three years of the projected five year holding \nperiod.  However, there can be no assurance that Duke  . . . will in fact \nextend their leases at the Property. \n \n(PPM 40.) \n(4) Forward-looking statements \n \n52. The PPM warns that the assumptions and future projections in the PPM \nand the Addendum “may contain forward-looking statements”: \nYou can identify such statements by the use of forward -looking words \nsuch as “may,” “will,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” or \nother such words.  These types of statements discuss future expectations \nor contain projections or estimates.  When considering such forward -\nlooking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors set forth in \n \n \n[the PPM].  These risk factors and other unidentified factors could cause \nactual results to differ materially from those cont ained in any forward-\nlooking statement. \n(PPM 92.)    \n(5) The Management Agreement and management control reserved to the TICs \n \n53. The Management Agreement for the Durham Property gave the TICs \nthe ability to hire and fire the property manager, the leasing agent, and the asset \nmanager.  (Management Agreement §§ 10.1, .2.)  It also allowed the TICs to control \nthe Durham Property’s expenditures by approving budgets.  (Management \nAgreement §§ 2.5.1, 2.9, .10.)    \n54. The TICs were granted the right to terminate the Management \nAgreement in a manner that gave all or any one of the TICs on an annual basi s the \nindividual right to terminate the Management Agreement without cause.  However, \nthe termination right was also conditioned on a separate provision, which states that \nthe exercise of that right would trigger other obligations, such as requiring a TIC who \nexercises the termination right  to pay a pro rata share of a significant setup fee.  \nAdditionally, the exercise of that right would create a default in the loan agreement.  \nThe property manager was granted a right to preclude termination by purchasing a \nTIC’s interest.  (Management Agreement §  10.1.)  A separate provision in the TIC \nAgreement restricts a TIC’s right to act on behalf of the other TICs or bind the other \nTICs.  (TIC Agreement ¶ 1.5.) \n55. The Management Agreement required the TICs’ unanimous consent to \napprove all proposed leases.  (Management Agreement §  2.6.2.)  The Management \n \n \nAgreement provides that the TICs approved all existing leases when they closed on \ntheir purchase.  ( Management Agreement §  2.6.1.)  However, any new lease terms \ngenerally had to  be approv ed by unanimous consent of the TICs,  but would be \nconsidered approved absent an express notice of rejection.  (Management Agreement \n§ 2.6.2.)  If a TIC rejected a proposed new lease , the  new lease would not be \nauthorized, and the property manager would have no authority to execute the \nproposed lease.  (Management Agreement § 2.6.2.) \nF. Triple Net’s Post-Offer Due Diligence \n56. Triple Net continued its due-diligence efforts in the fifteen -day period \nbetween January 9, 2007, when Highwoods provided the due-diligence materials, and \nJanuary 24, 2007, when it executed the final purchase agreement.  Triple Net’s due-\ndiligence efforts included at least  securing a due-diligence report an d an appraisal, \nand interviewing the Durham Property’s tenants.   \n57. Triple Net consultant Joseph D. Steffe prepared a Due Diligence Report, \ndated January 16, 2007.  (Prosky Dep. Ex. 1144 (“Due Diligence Report”).)  Like the \ninitial PPM, t he Due Diligence Report acknowledges that all leases in the Durham \nProperty would expire within three years, and that there was a large dependency on \nDuke as a tenant.  (Due Diligence Report  at G E000167.)  The report states that  \nDuke’s leases “carr[ied] the usual 75% renewal probability.”  (Due Diligence Report \nat GE000167.)    \n58. A few days after the Due Diligence Report was executed , Triple Net \nexecutive Mike Waddell interviewed all tenants in the Durham Property, including \n \n \nSelig, who was in charge of negotiating Duke’s off -campus real -estate leases.  \nMcMillan attended Waddell’s January 19, 2007 meeting with Selig.  Both Waddell \nand Selig prepared contemporaneous memoranda from the interview.  Selig, Waddell, \nand McMillan each provided testimony about the meeting. \n59. Selig recalled advising Waddell that Duke  had issued an RFP for new \nspace and had received several proposals in response, but Waddell did not recall being \nadvised of this information.  ( Compare Selig Dep. 56:19 –57:2, 59:1–4, July 3, 2012, \nwith Waddell Dep. vol. II, 414:11–415:8, 418:13–19.)  Duke retained Corporate Realty \nAssociates (“CRA”) to solicit proposals for a new building as an alternative to \nrenewing its leases  in the Durham Property .  There is no evidence that Waddell \nspecifically learned that Highwoods had submitted a build-to-suit proposal to Duke.  \nIt does not appear that Waddell interviewed CRA.    \n60. Selig further testified that Duke had not made a decision on whether to \nrelocate as of 2007.  (Selig Dep. vol. II, 96:10–11, June 4, 2015.)  An internal January \n16, 2007 Highwoods e-mail quoted Selig as stating that PRMO was uncertain about \nits plans.  (Massey Dep. Ex. 548.)  Selig testified that he told Waddell that Duke had \nnot ultimately decided whether to renew PRMO’s leases.  (Selig Dep. vol. II, 95:20–\n96:5, June 4, 2015; see also Waddell Dep. vol. I, 116:14–16; Merklein Dep. Ex. 193.) \n61. Waddell prepared a memo that summarized his interview with Selig.  \n(Waddell Dep. Ex. 1083.)  He acknowledged that Selig had expressed concerns about \nthe efficiency of PRMO’s space and had retained a firm to conduct a space-utilization \nstudy.  (Waddell Dep. Ex. 1083 ; see also Selig Dep. vol. II, 98:3–18, June 4, 2015 ; \n \n \nWaddell Dep. vol. I, 116:1–25.)  Waddell testified that he ultimately concluded that \nDuke was not ready to address its renewal options in January 2007.  (Waddell Dep. \nvol. I, 116:14–118:4.)  \n62. On January 24, 2007, Triple Net obtained an independent appraisal \nfrom Robert A. Stanger & Co., Inc.  (See Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Summ. J. Ex. 6 (“Stanger \nAppraisal”).)  The appraisal valued the Durham Property at $34.25 million—slightly \nhigher than Triple Net’s purchase price of $34.2 million.  (Stanger Appraisal 10.)  The \nappraisal noted that Duke Pediatrics had already inquired about renewing its lease  \nin the Property.  (Stanger Appraisal E -1.)  The appraisal assigned an overall lease -\nrenewal probability of 80% for all tenants , a 90% renewal rate for Duke, and a 40% \nrenewal rate for the Qualex sublease.  (Stanger Appraisal iii.) \nG. The Final Purchase and Sale Agreement \n63. The final Purchase and Sale Agreement between Highwoods and Triple \nNet went into effect on January 24, 2007.   \n64. Highwoods did not make any warranty as to whether existing leases in \nthe Property would be renewed , but the sale was conditioned on Highwoods having \nnot received notice that any tenant intended to default on their lease.  (Purchase & \nSale Agreement ¶¶ 12.1.7, 28.)   \n65. Triple Net was granted the right to designate up to thirty -five entities \nas grantees of the deed.  (Purchase & Sale Agreement ¶ 22.)  Pursuant to that \nprovision, Highwoods issued deeds directly to the TICs at closing on March 12, 2007.  \nCollectively, the Durham Property’s investors paid Triple Net more than $40 million, \n \n \nincluding roughly $15 million in cash, with a $26 million mortgage to finance the \nremaining balance.  (See Highwoods’ Mot. Compel Produc. Docs. Ex. 7.)   \nH. Supplements to the PPM \n66. After Highwoods and Triple Net executed the final Purchase and Sale \nAgreement, Triple Net issued three PPM supplements detailing information that \nTriple Net learned after it issued the original PPM.     \n67. The first supplement, dated January 26, 2007, gives an updated cash-\nflow projection with assumptions regarding lease -renewal probabilities  that differ \nfrom the assumptions listed in the original PPM.  The first supplement lists a \nprobability of  50% for one building , and a probability of 75% for three buildings.  \n(Waddell Dep. Ex. 1084, at NNN021003.)     \n68. The second supplement, dated February 20, 2007, describes a revision \nto the TIC Agreement  but contains no further discussion of the leases or renewal \nprobabilities.  (Waddell Dep. Ex. 1085.)   \n69. The third supplement, dated April 9, 2007, reflects that Triple Net \nclosed on the Durham Property on March 12, 2007.  (Waddell Dep. Ex. 1086.)   \n70. Aside from the revised cash-flow projection in the first supplement, the \nrisk factors and the Business Plan in the original PPM were unchanged by the PPM \nsupplements. \n71. Triple Net took further actions that evidenced its intent to sell the TIC \ninterests as securities pursuant to a Regulation D private offering.  On February 22, \n2007, between the issuance of the  first and second PPM supplements, NNN Office \n \n \nfiled a Form D for the sale of securities with the SEC.  (Pls.’ Resp. Mem. Opp’n to \nHighwoods’ Mot. Partial Summ. J. Ex. 1.)  That same day, Triple Net’s counsel, \nHirschler Fleischer, sent letter notifications of the anticipated sale of securities to \nregulators in the various states in which the securities were to be offered.  (Pls.’ Resp. \nMem. Opp’n to Highwoods’ Mot. Partial Summ. J. Ex. 1.) \nI. Duke’s Ultimate Decision to Relocate PRMO’s Operations \n72. As noted, Waddell had concluded that Duke was not ready to discuss \nlease renewal in January 2007.  In August 2007, Duke advised that it was prepared \nto discuss lease renewal.  Around that time, Duke’s possible relocation was reported \nin local news stories.  See, e.g., Jack Hagel, RTP Beckons Duke, News & Observer, \nAug. 6, 2007.  As part of lease-renewal negotiations, Plaintiffs hired Little Diversified \nArchitectural Consulting  to consider a space redesign to address Duke’s concerns \nregarding space inefficiencies for PRMO’s operations in the Durham Property.  (See \nMerklein Dep. Ex. 147.) \n73. When lease -renewal negotiations began, cost proposals for PRMO’s \npotential relocation substantially exceeded the rent s for PRMO ’s leases in the \nDurham Property.  In late-October 2007, Hock Development Group (“Hock”) reduced \nthe cost of its relocation proposal to Duke by approximately $1 million.   \n74. In November 2007, Duke  announced its decision not to renew PRMO’s \nleases beyond the expiration date in June 2010.  On December 28, 2007, Duke entered \ninto a new lease with T.W. Alexander Properties, LLC  for a new  office building in \n \n \nSouth Durham that was built by Hock .  PRMO vacated the Durham Property on \nDecember 12, 2008.  \n75. Duke Pediatrics renewed its lease in the  Durham Property for another \nseven years, and is still a tenant in the Property today. \nJ. Triple Net Suspends Dividend Distributions \n76. Part of the TICs’ investment in the Durham Property included monthly \ndividend distributions.  Those distributions were suspended when economic \nconditions worsened in December 2008.  (See Highwoods’ Dep. Ex. 253.)  According \nto Triple Net, it was necessary for the company to suspend distributions “in order to \nbegin conserving cash to mitigate the loss of revenue and to fund future leasing costs \nassociated with the loss of key tenancies in 2009 and 2010.”  (Highwoods’ Dep. Ex. \n253.)  \nK. The TICs’ Control over the Durham Property’s Management \n77. Conflict between the TICs  and the Durham Property ’s management  \nheightened in 2009 , as adverse economic conditions continued .  For instance, in \nAugust 2009, several of the TICs sent a list of demands to the Property’s manager.  \nThose demands included requests to lower the fee structure, fire the onsite manager, \neliminate accounting fees, present proposed capital improvements in  detail for the \nTICs’ approval, and provide monthly reporting instead of quarterly reporting.  ( See \nHighwoods’ Mot. Partial Summ. J. Exs. D, E.)   \n78. Throughout 2009, Triple Net —whose name had changed to GERI by \nthat time—and TLG continued working to find new tenants for the Durham Property.  \n \n \nIn fall 2009, Triple Net asked the TICs to approve a signed eight -year lease with \nDurham Dermatology Associates, LLP .  Plaintiff James Merrill rejected the lease.  \nThat rejection may have been the trigger for TLG’s resignation as leasing broker for \nthe Durham Property.  In its resignation letter on December 16, 2009 , TLG noted \nthat the TICs’ “ability to reject negotiated terms with a prospective tenant place[d] \n[TLG] in a very precarious and reputation -damaging position.”  (Highwoods’ Mot. \nPartial Summ. J. Ex. V.)   \n79. In mid-2009, the TICs contacted National Asset Services, Inc. (“NAS”), \nan outside management company located in California, and began efforts to replace \nTriple Net as asset manager.  The TICs worked together to create a list of TICs who \napproved Triple Net’s  removal.  Their efforts included Mr. Merrill contacting the \nlender to ask that it  become “immediately involved in the termination of Triple Net \nand the hiring of a new asset manager.”  (Highwoods’ Dep. Ex. 899, at 5.)  The TICs \nunanimously approved and delivered a notice of termination to Triple Net  in \nDecember 2009.  Triple Net ultimately agreed to transition management to  NAS in \nJanuary 2010. \nL. Plaintiffs Execute a Settlement Agreement \n80. In March 2010, Plaintiffs entered into a Confidential Mutual Settlement \nAgreement and Mutual Release (“Settlement Agreement”) that allowed NAS to take \nover as asset manager for the Durham Property.  (See Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Summ. J. \nEx. 34 (“Settlement Agreement”), at 1.)   \n \n \n81. Further details of the Settlement Agreement are summarized in the \nanalysis section of this Order & Opinion regarding the Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment, in which the Grubb & Ellis Defendants contend that \nthe Settlement Agreement released all claims in the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit.  \nM. Foreclosure Following Loan Default \n82. From May to July 2010, the TICs voted for several cash distributions \nthat totaled more than $1.5 million.  (See Highwoods’ Mot. Compel Produc. Docs. Exs. \n6, 29, 30.)  The purpose of withdrawing the money was to get it “ out of . . . the reach \nof the lender ” so that the funds would not be applied to the outstanding mortgage \nbalance.  (Kennedy Dep. vol. I, 84:1–2; see also Kennedy Dep. vol. I, 117:9–25.)  The \nTICs knew t hat by withdrawing money, there would be insufficient funds to make \npayments on the mortgage.  (Kennedy Dep. vol. II I, 741:6–9.)  At least some of the \nTICs intended to use the distributions to fund the present litigation.  (See Highwoods’ \nDep. Ex. 340.)   \n83. In April  2011, the lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on the \nDurham Property.  NAS’s role as asset manager ended in July 2011, when a court -\nappointed receiver took over the day-to-day management of the property.  (Kennedy \nDep. vol. I, 76:17 –19.)  The Durham Property was sold by upset bid at a public \nforeclosure sale in October 2011  and conveyed to the high bidder on December 20, \n2011.  Approximately 72% of the TIC ownership sued to recoup their losses.   \n \n \n \n \n \nIV. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nA. The Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit \n84. Plaintiffs commenced the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit on July 1, 2010, by \nfiling a summons pursuant to Rule 3 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nPlaintiffs filed their Complaint on July 21, 2010.  On August 24, 2010, Plaintiffs filed \na notice of designation, and t he case was designated a mandatory complex business \ncase by the Chief Justice that same day.  The case was first assigned to the Honorable \nBen F. Tennille of this Court on August 25, 2010, and then to the unde rsigned in \nMarch 2011 following Judge Tennille’s retirement.     \n85. Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint (“Amended Complaint”) \non March 28, 2011 , alleging claims of (1) breach of contract, (2)  negligence, \n(3) negligent misrepresentation, (4) breach of fiduciary dut y, (5) constructive fraud, \n(6) Securities Act  violations, (7)  unfair and deceptive trade practices, (8) civil \nconspiracy, and (9) punitive damages.    \n86. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) on May 27, \n2011, which the Court denied on August 18, 2011.  \n87. Grubb & Ellis Co. and Grubb & Ellis Securities each filed a voluntary \npetition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 20, 2012.  See Voluntary Petition, In \nre Grubb & Ellis Co., No. 12-10685-MG (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2012), ECF No. 1.  \nLitigation in this Court was automatically stayed as to those Defendants until \nOctober 4, 2012, when the bankruptcy court approved the parties’ stipulation to lift \nthe stay.  See Stipulation & Order Between the Debtor s & NNN Durham Office \n \n \nPortfolio 1, LLC & Certain Other Tenant -in-Common Entities to Lift the Automatic \nStay, In re Grubb & Ellis Co., No. 12-10685-MG (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Oct. 4, 2012), ECF \nNo. 1813.   \n88. The parties filed cross -motions for summary judgment on Au gust 17, \n2015.  Plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on the ir Securities Act claim, \nand the Grubb & Ellis Defendants move for summary judgment on all claims pending \nagainst them. \nB. The Highwoods Lawsuit \n89. Plaintiffs first filed a complaint against Highwoods and TLG on April 1, \n2010.  Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice on July 6, 2011, \nafter the case had been designated a mandatory complex business case and assigned \nto the undersigned.   \n90. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in the Highwoods Lawsuit  on July 6, \n2012, alleging claims of (1) fraud, (2) fraud in the inducement, (3) Securities Act  \nviolations, (4) unfair and deceptive trade practices , (5) negligent misrepresentation, \n(6) civil conspiracy, and (7) punitive damages.  Plaintiffs filed a notice of designation \non July 6, 2012.  The Chief Justice designated the case a mandatory complex business \ncase on July 11, 2012, and  the matter was assigned to the undersigned on July 12, \n2012.   \n91. On February 19, 2013, the Court granted Highwoods’ and TLG’s motions \nto dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims of fraud, fraud in the inducement, unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices, negligent misrepresentation, and punitive damages.  Highwoods, \n \n \n2013 NCBC LEXIS 11 , at *66 .  The Court denied the motions to dismiss as to  \nPlaintiffs’ claims of secondary liability under N.C. Gen. Stat. §  7A-56(c)(2) (2015) of \nthe Securities Act and conspiracy to violate that Act.  Highwoods, 2013 NCBC LEXIS \n11, at *66. \n92. On November 15, 2013, Highwoods moved for partial summary \njudgment on the question whether the TICs’ investment in the Durham Property \nqualifies as a sale of securities under the Securities Act.  The Court deferred ruling \non that motion until after the conclusion of fact discov ery.  See Order, Highwoods, \nNo. 12 CVS 3945 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 27, 2015).   \n93. On May 29, 2015, Highwoods and TLG filed the ir 12(c) Motions for \njudgment on the pleadings as to the claims of the fifty-five Out-of-State Plaintiffs on \nthe grounds that those Plaintiffs have not alleged that they received or accepted an \noffer to sell a security in North Carolina and thus cannot recover under the Securities \nAct.  The Court heard oral argument on the 12(c) Motions on July 16, 2015.   \n94. The parties filed  cross-motions for summary judgment  on August 17, \n2015.  Highwoods and TLG filed motions for summary judgment on all remaining \nclaims pending against them.  Plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on their \nclaim of secondary liability under the Securities Act. \n95. Also on August 17, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their 54(b) Motion, asking the \nCourt to modify its February 2013 Decision to reinstate Plaintiffs’ punitive-damages \nclaim.  \n \n \n96. The Court held a joint hearing  on the summary -judgment motions in \nboth lawsuits and on Plaintiffs’ 54(b) Motion on November 23, 2015.  All motions have \nnow been fully briefed, argued, and are ripe for disposition. \n \nV. ANALYSIS \nA. Summary of the Issues Presented by the Dispositive Motions \n97. Plaintiffs present claims of both primary and secondary liability under \nthe Securities Act, the latter depending on Plaintiffs’ success under the former.  The \nmotions present two threshold issues as to the application of the Securities Act to \nPlaintiffs’ various claims: (1) whether the TIC interests at issue qualify as securities \nunder the Securities Act, and if so, (2) whether claims under the Securities Act must \nbe limited to claims brought by Plaintiffs who received or accepted an offer to sell in \nNorth Carolina.  An additional threshold issue for the Grubb & Ellis Defendants is \nwhether the Settlement Agreement between the TICs  and the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants released claims asserted against the Grubb & Ellis Defendants in this \nlitigation.  Assuming Plaintiffs survive these threshold issues, the Cou rt must then \nconsider the parties’ cross-motions to summarily adjudicate the issue of liability.    \n98. Finally, Plaintiffs move under Rule 54(b) for the Court to reconsider its \nearlier ruling in which it dismissed Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages  against \nHighwoods and TLG.   \nB. Standard of Review \n99. Highwoods and TLG  present motions for judgment on the pleadings \nunder Rule 12(c).  All parties move for summary judgment under Rule 56.   \n \n \n(1) The standard of review for judgment on the pleadings \n100. A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) \n“is . . . proper . . . when all the material allegations of fact are admitted in the \npleadings and only questions of law remain.”  Ragsdale v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, \n137, 209 S.E.2d 494, 499 (1974).  The purpose of Rule 12(c) “is to dispose of baseless \nclaims or defenses when the formal pleadings reveal their lack of merit.”  Id.  When \nthe Court reviews a complaint under Rule 12(c), it “is required to v iew the facts and \npermissible inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Id.  A \nRule 12(c) motion should be granted “when a complaint does not allege ‘facts \nsufficient to state a cause of action or pleads facts which deny the right to any relief.’”  \nReese v. Brooklyn Vill., LLC , 209 N.C. App. 636, 641, 707 S.E.2d 249, 253 (2011) \n(quoting Robertson v. Boyd, 88 N.C. App. 437, 440, 363 S.E.2d 672, 675 (1988)). \n(2) The standard of review for summary judgment \n101. Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2015).  “Summary \njudgment is improper if any material fact is subject to dispute.”  Culler v. Hamlett, \n148 N.C. App. 389, 391, 559 S.E.2d 192, 194 (2002).  The movant bears the burden of \nproving the lack of a triable issue.  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 651, 548 S.E.2d at 707.  Once \nthe movant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce \na forecast of evidence that demonstrates facts showing that it can establish a prima \n \n \nfacie case at trial.  Austin Maint. & Constr., Inc. v. Crowder Constr. Co. , 224 N.C. \nApp. 401, 407, 742 S.E.2d 535, 540 (2012).  The Court must view all the presented \nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 651, \n548 S.E.2d at 707.     \n102. The Court applies these st andards to the pending motions,  and \nconstrues facts and inferences in favor of the party opposing the particular motion \nunder consideration. \nC. Evidence that the TICs Retained Sufficient Control over the  Durham \nProperty’s Management Is Inadequate to Place the TIC Interests Outside the \nScope of the Securities Act. \n \n103. It is clear that Triple Net marketed the TIC interests as securities and \nexpected that Plaintiffs would consider the purchases securities.  In their Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment, Highwoods contends that the TIC interests nevertheless \nare not “securities” as defined by the Securities Act because Plaintiffs retained and \nexercised control over their investment.    \n104. The Court initially addressed the question whether the TIC interests \nqualify as securities in its February 2013 Decision in the context of motions to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6).  See Highwoods, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11, at * 20–24.  The Court \ndiscussed the unsettled question of whether a TIC exchange is a sale of real estate or \na sale of an investment contract within the scope of the Securities Act.  Id. at *21–24.  \nOn this question, the Court denied Highwoods’ and TLG’s Rule 12(b)(6) motions.  \n105. Considering this issue at the summary-judgment posture under Rule 56, \nthe Court rejects Plaintiffs’ contention that the Court’s ruling on the motions to \n \n \ndismiss became the law of the case and precludes it from  now considering on the \ndeveloped record whether the TIC interests qualify as an investment contract  and \nthus as securities.  See Barbour v. Little, 37 N.C. App. 686, 692, 247 S.E.2d 252, 255–\n56 (1978) (recognizing that motions under Rule 12 and Rule 56 are governed by \ndifferent standards).  Likewise, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that  \nHighwoods and TLG  are estopped from now denying that the TIC interests are \nsecurities.  (See Pls.’ Resp. Mem. Opp’n to Highwoods’ Mot. Partial Summ. J. 22–23.)   \n106. Rather, the Court concludes that the manner in which the facts \ndeveloped after the completion of the TIC exchange may bear on the expectations that \nthe TICs  had when  they invested in the Durham Property, and that those \nexpectations are relevant to the final determination of whether the TIC interests are \nproperly considered an investment contract  or a real-estate contract.  Based on the \ndeveloped record, the Court concludes that the re is i nsufficient evidence for it to \ndetermine that Plaintiffs’ TIC interests  do not qualify as securities under the \nSecurities Act.  Accordingly, summary judgment must be denied for Highwoods and \ngranted in favor of Plaintiffs on this issue.   \n107. A prerequisite to liability under the Securities Act is that the \ntransaction must fall within the scope of the Act.  The Securities Act defines “security” \nto include any “investment contract.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 78A-2(11) (2015).   \n108. The Securities Act does not itself define the term “investment contract.”  \nThe North Carolina Administrative Code defines “investment contract” as used in \nsection 78A-2(11) to include the following:  \n \n \n (a) Any investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of \nprofit to be derived through the essential managerial efforts of someone \nother than the investor. . . . “[C]ommon enterprise” means an enterprise \nin which the fortunes of the investor are interwoven with and dependent \nupon the efforts and success of those seeking the investment of a third \nparty; and \n \n (b) Any investment by which an offeree furnishes initial value to an \nofferor, and a portion of this initial value is subjected to the risks of the \nenterprise, and the furnish ing of this initial value is induced by the \nofferor’s promises or representations which give rise to a reasonable \nunderstanding that a valuable benefit of some kind over and above the \ninitial value will accrue to the offeree as a result of the operation of  the \nenterprise, and the offeree does not receive the right to exercise practical \nand actual control over the managerial decisions of the enterprise. \n \n18 N.C. Admin. Code 06A.1104(8)(a)–(b) (2016). \n109. Highwoods relies heavily on Rule 06A.1104(8)(b) when asserting that \nthe record makes clear that the TICs collectively  exercised practical and actual \ncontrol over management decisions for the Durham Property to a degree that defeats \ntheir interests from being classified as  an investment contract .  (See Highwoods’ \nReply Br. Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. 1 (“The parties agree that summary judgment \nis appropriate on a single issue: Did Plaintiffs have the right to exercise practical and \nactual control over the managerial decisions of their investment?”).)   \n110. Plaintiffs counter that Highwoods improperly conflates subsections (a) \nand (b) of Rule 06A.1104(8) .  While not conceding Highwoods’ argument based on \nRule 06A.1104(8)(b), Plaintiffs contend that  Rule 06A.1104(8)(a) ’s definition of \n“investment contract” is less restri ctive and does not demand the same absence of \ncontrol that may be argued under Rule 06A.1104(8)(b), as long as the investment was \na common enterprise and Plaintiffs relied on Triple Net’s essential managerial \n \n \nefforts.  Plaintiffs contend that their ultimate efforts to salvage value in their \ninvestment do not disqualify their interests as an investment contract , when such \nefforts became necessary only because Triple Net’s essential managerial efforts had \nfailed.  \n111. The analysis whether a TIC interest is an “investment contract” begins \nwith a review of the United States Supreme Court’s holding in SEC v. W. J. Howey \nCo., 328 U.S. 293 (1946) .  In Howey, the Supreme Court  held that , under federal \nsecurities law, an investment contract contains four elements: “(1) an investment of \nmoney, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) an expectation of  profits, and (4) the \nexpectation that profits will arise solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third \nparty.”  Highwoods, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11, at * 25 (discussing Howey, 328 U.S. at \n298–99).  The Supreme Court further noted that “investment contract” had not been \nearlier defined either by federal securities law or by the various state blue-sky laws, \neven though the term had been broadly construed in a way that protected investors \nand disregarded form “ for substance and  . . . placed [emphasis] upon economic \nreality.”  Howey, 328 U.S. at 298.  Each of the four elements of the Howey test has \nbeen addressed in subsequent litigation, and some uncertainty remains as to how the \ntest should be applied, particularly as to the fourth element’s use of the term “solely.”   \n112. In SEC v. SG Ltd. , the United States Court of Appeals for the First \nCircuit noted a significant variance in how courts have determined the meaning of  \n“common enterprise.”  265 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 2001).  Some courts require a showing \nof horizontal commonalit y, which “involves  the pooling of assets from multiple \n \n \ninvestors so  that all share in the profits and risks of the enterprise ,” while other \ncourts have emphasized vertical commonality, which focuses on the degree that an \ninvestor depends on the efforts or expertise of the promoter .  Id.  The First Circuit \nfurther distinguished  “broad vertical commonality” from “narrow vertical \ncommonality.”  Id.  Broad vertical commonality requires that the investors’ well-being \nbe dependent on the promoter’s expertise, while narrow vertical commonality \nrequires that the i nvestors’ fortunes be “interwoven with and dependent upon the \nefforts and success of those seeking the investment or of third parties.”  Id. (quoting \nSEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enters., Inc., 474 F.2d 476, 482 n.7 (9th Cir. 1973)).   Some \ncourts allow for only one standard of commonality, while others recognize multiple \ntests for determining commonality.  Id.  \n113. Subsections (a) and (b) of North Carolina’s Rule 06A.1104(8)  reflect \nthese various approaches  and the differing emphasis on  the degree to w hich the \ninvestor is dependent on the efforts of the promoter or third party.   \n114. Rule 06A.1104(8)(a) requires both a “common enterprise” and “the \nexpectation of profit to be derived from the essential managerial efforts of someone \nother than the investor.”  18 N.C. Admin. Code 06A.1104(8)(a)  (emphasis added) .  \n“Essential” management does not necessarily connote “exclusive” management.  Rule \n06A.1104(8)(b) does not expressly require a “common enterprise,” but it contemplates \na scenario where at least a portion of the value provided by the investor is subjected \nto the risk of an enterprise in which the investor “does not receive the right to exercise \npractical and actual control over the managerial decisions of the enterprise.”  18 N.C. \n \n \nAdmin. Code 06A.1104(8)(b).  Rule 06A.1104(8)(a)’s emphasis  on the “essential” \nmanagerial efforts  of a common enterprise reflect s a relaxation of Howey’s fourth \nelement, which directs that profits result “solely from the efforts of the promoter or a \nthird party.”  Howey, 328 U.S. at 299. \n115. The nature in which TIC interests are marketed prevents a bright-line \nrule on whether a TIC interest is a security or a syndicated real -estate interest.  \nHistorically, TIC transactions have been  structured as sale s of securities, in some \ninstances, and as sales of syndicated real-estate interests in others.  See Triple Net \nLeasing, LLC, SEC No-Action Letter, 2000 SEC No-Act. LEXIS 824 (Aug. 23, 2000); \nNat’l Ass’n of Sec. Dealers, Notice to Members No. 05-18, Private Placements of \nTenants-in-Common Interests  3 & n.5 (2005) (explaining that “[w]hen TIC[  ] \n[interests] are offered and sold together with other arrangements, they generally \nwould constitute investment contracts and thus securities ,” but that “TIC interests \nin real property standing alone generally are not securities”); (Hanson Dep. 57:23–25 \n(noting that TIC transactions are structured in “one of two ways . . . . as a real estate \n[transaction] or as a security” transaction).)   \n116. The record here is clear that Triple Net marketed the sale of Plaintiffs’ \nTIC interests as securities.  This is evidenced by the various transactional documents, \nthe PPM, the broker agreements, and the communications with the SEC and various \nstate-enforcement agencies.  Those documents expressly and specifically refer to the \nTIC interests as “securities.”  (See, e.g., PPM ii, iv, 1, 23, 50; Pls.’ Resp. to Highwoods’ \nMot. Partial Summ. J. Exs. 1, 2, 6.)  Of course, that fact does not necessarily end the \n \n \ninquiry, because a TIC interest is not a “security” or an “investment contract” based \nsolely on the label given to it by the promoter.   \n117. Howey focuses on the investor’s expectations at the time of investing, \nand representations that an investment is a security or an investment contract play \ninto those expectations.  Here, in the risk-factors section of the PPM, a subheading \nlabeled “Reliance on Management” cautions purchasers that  \n[a]ll decisions regarding management of the Company’s affairs  . . . and \nthe management of the Property, will be made exclusively by the \nManager, the Property Manager and their Affiliat es, and not by any of \nthe Members or the Purchasers.  Accordingly, no person should \npurchase LLC Units unless that person is willing to entrust all aspects \nof management of the Company to the Manager and management of the \nProperty to the Property Manager.   \n \n(PPM 21.) \n118. Taken alone, this language would suggest that the TIC interests satisfy \nthe definition of an “investment contract” within the meaning of either  Rule \n06A.1104(8)(a) or Rule 06A.1104(8)(b).  But other provisions of the var ious \ntransactional documents and agreements also reserve certain powers to the investors \nand provide that , under certain circumstances , Triple Net did not have exclusive \ncontrol.  For example, the TICs were granted the right to terminate the Management \nAgreement on an annual basis without cause, albeit with the understanding  that \nexercising that right would trigger obligations, such as requiring the TIC s to pay a \npro rata share of a significant setup fee, creating a default in the loan agreement .  \nThat terminat ion right was also conditioned on the property manager’s right to \npurchase any Plaintiff’s TIC interest.  (Management Agreement § 10.1.)   \n \n \n119. The transactional documents also provided for  a degree of  the TIC \nowners’ control over potential future leases.  The Management Agreement addressed \nleasing efforts, and at closing, the TICs approved all existing leases.  ( Management \nAgreement §§  2.6.1, .2.)  However, any new lease  terms “generally [had to] be \napproved by unanimous consent of the [TICs],” but would be con sidered approved, \nabsent an express notice of rejection.  (PPM 74.)  In the event of such a rejection, the \nlease would not be authorized, and the property manager would have no authority to \nexecute the proposed lease.  (Management Agreement §§  1.2, 2.6.2.)  Any unilateral \nright under the Management Agreement to refuse a lease must be read in conjunction \nwith the TIC Agreement, which restricts a TIC’s right to act on behalf of other TICs  \nor to bind other TICs.  (TIC Agreement ¶ 1.5.) \n120. The Management Agreement also provide d for an annual budget that \nwould control capital expenditures and would be deemed approved, absent a notice of \nobjection by a majority of the TICs.  (PPM 74–75; Management Agreement § 2.5.1.)   \n121. The reservation of powers  to the TIC s in the various agreement s does \nnot alone, however, necessarily mandate a conclusion that the purchases do not \nqualify as an investment contract.  Case law recognizes that for control to be relevant, \nthe control must be actual rather than theoretical, and must take economic realities \ninto consideration.  See SEC v. Merch. Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747, 755–65 (11th Cir. \n2007) (citing and adopting Williamson v. Tucker, 645 F.2d 404, 422 (5th Cir. 1981) \n(identifying three instances in which a partnership interest may qualify as an \n“investment contract” because of limitations on control otherwise afforded to a \n \n \ngeneral partner)).  See generally David Rich, Note, Betting the Farm: The TIC Turf \nWar and Why TICs Constitute Investment Contracts Under Federal Securities Laws, \n1 Wm. & Mary Bus. L. Rev. 451, 481 –82 (2010) (noting that potential power can be \n“illusory” and may not defeat a finding that an investment qualifies as an investment \ncontract).   \n122. When restricting its consideration to the pleadings and documents \nattached to or incorporated in th e pleadings, the Court properly denied Highwoods’ \nand TLG’s Rule 12(b)(6) motions in its February 2013 Decision.  It is now appropriate \nfor the Court to further review the effect of the reserved control based on the \ndeveloped record, because the manner in which those reserved powers were exercised \nmay be properly considered in determining the expectations held at the time of \npurchase.     \n123. The securities laws certainly consider the degree of control a relevant \ninquiry to their scope and application.  See, e.g., Tolentino v. Mossman, No. 6:08-cv-\n2027 EJM, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99082, at *12 (N.D. Iowa Oct. 23, 2009); First Fin. \nFed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. E.F. Hutton Mortg. Corp. , 652 F. Supp. 471, 476 (W.D. \nArk.), aff’d, 834 F.2d 685 (8th Cir. 1987); Inforex Corp., N.V. v. MGM/UA Entm’t Co., \n608 F. Supp. 129, 133 (C.D. Cal. 1984) .  The ultimate determination of whether an \ninvestment is a securities transaction cannot be reduced to a rigid formula; rather, in \nmaking that determination, “form should be disregarded for substance [,] and the \nemphasis should be on economic reality.”  United Hous. Found., Inc. v. Forman, 421 \nU.S. 837, 848 (1975) (quoting Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967)).   \n \n \n124. Part of the economic reality here is that Plaintiffs made their investment \nin 2007, at a time when the Durham Property was fully leased through at least 2009, \nand before the economic conditions caused by the Great Recession beginning in 2008 \nhad set in.  As a result of the economic conditions  and Duke’s decision to relocate, \nPlaintiffs sought to minimize their losses by exercising certain rights granted to them \nin the transactional documents .  Highwoods relies upon the TICs’ exercise of those \nrights in contending that the control reserved to the TICs precludes their investment \nfrom being characterized as securities under the Securities Act. \n125. Highwoods contends that for Plaintiffs to claim that they purchased an \ninvestment contract, Plaintiffs could not have been afforded, and would not have been \nallowed to exercise, the degree of control that they exercised.  While Howey measures \na purchaser’s expectations at the time of purchase, cases have recognized that the \nlater exercise of reserved rights is properly considered in assessing the degree of an \ninvestor’s dependency on the control of the promoter at the time of purchase .  See, \ne.g., Rivanna Trawlers Unlimited v. Thompson Trawlers, Inc., 840 F.2d 236, 242 (4th \nCir. 1988) (“[T]he partners not only had the authority under the agreement to manage \nthe business, they exercised this authority and demonstrated that they were not \ndependent on the irreplaceable skills of others.”). \n126. Without c ataloguing every fact that Highwoods contends reflects the \nexercise of control by the TICs, in summary, those actions include forming a special \nTIC member committee whose agenda inc luded efforts to discharge the property \nmanager, and making demands on the property manager to implement cost controls, \n \n \nchange reporting, modify the overall management structure, and terminate TLG as \nthe local leasing agent.  Highwoods points to the success of those efforts, noting that \nthe property manager was in fact removed and a new manager put in place.   \n127. On these facts, the Court finds the decision of the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit  in SEC v. Merch ant Capital, LLC particularly \ninstructive.  483 F.3d 747.  There, the court found that general partnership interests \nwere investment contracts under federal securities laws.  Id. at 755–56.   \n128. In Merchant Capital, two individuals formed Merchant Capital to buy, \ncollect, or resell charged -off consumer debt, and then sold interests in multiple \nregistered limited-liability partnerships (“LLP”).  Id. at 750.  The SEC claimed, and \nthe founding partners denied , that the interests were investment contracts.   Id.  \nThrough tho se interests, purchasers were general partners in one of the various \nLLPs, but were a dvised that their participation was expected to be limited to \n“checking a box” on forms that would be sent to them from time to time.  Id. at 752.  \nPurchasers of a partnership interest in one LLP were not advised that there were \nother LLPs and that funds from the various sales would be pooled.  Id.  While a high \npercentage of purchasers claimed to have significant business experience, none had \nparticular expertise in the debt -collection business.  The selling entity was the sole \nmanaging general partner for all the LLPs.   \n129. The Merchant Capital court acknowledged the presumption that a \ngeneral partnership interest is not an investment contract because a general partner \ntypically takes an active role in management, see Williamson, 645 F.2d at 422, but \n \n \ndeclined to apply that presumption to the facts of the case before it, Merch. Capital, \n483 F.3d at 765.  Instead, the court held that “[a]n interest  . . . does not fall outside \nthe definition of investment contract merely because the purchaser has some nominal \ninvolvement with the operation of the business ,” and that “the focus is on the \ndependency of the investor on the entrepreneurial or managerial skills of a promoter \nor other party.”  Merch. Capital, 483 F.3d at 755 (quoting Gordon v. Terry, 684 F.2d \n736, 741 (11th Cir. 1982)).   Accordingly, even “[a] general partnership interest may \nqualify as an investment contract if the general partner i n fact retains little ability \nto control the profitability of the investment.”  Id.  The court further noted that it \nexamines not only control that might be provided by the legal documents, but also \nrepresentations made to the investor.  Id.  \n130. The Merchant C apital court adopted the Fifth Circuit ’s decision  in \nWilliamson v. Tucker , which held that retained control would not prevent an \ninvestment from qualifying as an investment contract in three situations: (1) where \n“an agreement among the parties leaves so little power in the hands of the partner or \nventurer that the arrangement in fact distributes power as would a limited \npartnership,” (2) where “the partner or venturer is so inexperienced and \nunknowledgeable in business affairs that he is incapable of intel ligently exercising \nhis partnership or venture powers,” or (3) where “the partner or venturer is so \ndependent on some unique entrepreneurial or managerial ability of the promoter or \nmanager that he cannot replace the manager of the enterprise or otherwise exercise \n \n \nmeaningful partnership or venture powers .”  Id. (quoting Williamson, 645 F.2d at \n424).       \n131. Finally, t he Merchant Capital court concluded that other factors \nsupported a finding that the plaintiffs, although nominal general partners, had \npurchased investment contracts that were more in the nature of limited partnership \ninterests.  Id. at 757.  The following factors negated the control adequate to defeat a \nfinding that the plaintiffs purchased investment contracts: (1) the partners’ ability to \nelect the managing general partner was not meaningful , because the vote had to be \nmade at the time of investment, and the promoter was the only nominee; (2) the \nlimitation on removing the managing general  partner for cause by unanimous vote \neffectively meant that the managing general partner could not be removed; (3) the \nvarious investors were geographically diverse and had no meaningful opportunity to \ndevelop relationships; (4) the investors’ potential liability was limited to the amount \nthat each investor invested, with no vicarious liability for the acts of other investors; \n(5) the right to approve expenditures, while facially significant, was diluted by the \nmanaging general partner’s ability to control information; and (6) the investors had \nno particular expertise in the business in which they invested.  Id. at 757–59. \n132. While Merchant Capital is not binding on this Court, the decision is  \ninstructive in fashioning the nature of the factual inquiry that must be made.   \n133. Here, the interests sold were nominally limited partnership interests \nrather than general partnership interests, which creates a  presumption in favor of \nfinding an investment contract.  The promoter, Triple Net, clearly stressed that the \n \n \nTICs were buying securities and investing in reliance on the manager’s efforts.  But \nHighwoods offers evidence that arguably cuts against that presumption and suggests \nthat the TICs retained and ultimately exercised a degree of contractual control over \ntheir investment inconsistent with that of a typical limited partner, which weighs \nagainst finding an investment contract.  See, e.g., Maritan v. Birmingham Props., 875 \nF.2d 1451, 1459 (10th Cir. 1989) (recognizing that, while the inquiry under a Howey-\nbased test focuses on intent at the time of purchase, subsequent facts may “shed[  ] \nlight on how the [plaintiff] regarded [his  or her ] rights and status under the \nagreement all along”).         \n134. The Court concludes that the exercise of control by the TICs after the \ncollapse of the Business Plan is inadequate to prevent their investment from \nqualifying as a securities transaction.  Accordingly, Highwoods’ Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment is DENIED, and summary judgment is GRANTED for Plaintiffs \non this issue. \nD. Claims under the Securities Act Are Limited to Claims Brought by the North \nCarolina Plaintiffs. \n \n135. The Securities Act applies “to persons who sell or offer to sell [securities] \nwhen (i) an offer to sell is made in this State, or (ii) an offer to buy is made or accepted \nin this State.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 78A-63(a) (2015).   \n136. In their 12(c) Motions, Highwoods and TLG move for judgment on the \npleadings to dismiss  the claims of  the fifty-five Out-of-State Plaintiffs in this \nlitigation on the grounds that those Plaintiffs did not receive or accept an offer to sell \nin North Carolina , and because Triple Net is not a North Carolina company.  (See \n \n \nHighwoods’ 12(c) Mot. Ex. 1; TLG’s 12(c) Mot. Ex. 1.)  The Rule 12(c) Motions do not \nchallenge the claims of the six North Carolina Plaintiffs.    \n137. An offer to sell is “made in this State,” regardless of “whether . . . either \nparty is then present in this State, when the offer (i) ori ginates from this State or \n(ii) is directed by the offeror to this State and received at the place to which it is \ndirected (or at any post office in this State in the case of a mailed offer).”  N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 78A-63(c).   \n138. An offer is accepted “when acceptance (i) is communicated to the offeror \nin this State and (ii) has not previously been communicated to the offeror, orally, or \nin writing, outside this State.”  Id. § 78A-63(d).  “[A]cceptance is communicated to the \nofferor in this State, whether or not either party is then presen t in this State when \nthe offeree directs it to the offeror in this State reasonably believing the offeror to be \nin this State and it is received at the place to which it is directed (or at any post office \nin this State in the case of a mailed acceptance).”  Id.   \n139. On the purchase side of the transaction, only three TIC owners allege \nthat they received an offer to purchase in North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶¶ 169, 217, 220.)  \nEach of the other TIC owners who is a Plaintiff in this litigation  alleges that they \nreceived the PPM prior to closing, but they do not allege that they accepted any offer \nin North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶¶ 134–223.)   \n140. On the sale side of the transaction, the offer to sell originated in \nCalifornia, where Triple Net and NNN Capital were located.  (Compl. Ex. F, at 48 –\n49.)  Plaintiffs do not allege that any offer to sell originated in North Carolina.  Other \n \n \nthan the North Carolina Plaintiffs, no Plaintiff alleges that an offer to buy was made \nor accepted in North Carolina.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 134–223.)    \n141. While Plaintiffs do not allege where they communicated acceptance of \ntheir offers to purchase, the Complaint reveals that Triple Net advised the SEC that \nthe offers were accepted in California .  (Compl. ¶ 100 & Ex. M.)  The PPM required \nPlaintiffs to send their acceptances to NNN Capital in California .  (PPM 3, 48, 49.)   \nThere is no allegation to the contrary. \n142. Highwoods and TLG contend that each Plaintiff must independently \nsatisfy the Securities Act’s offer-or-acceptance requirement.  Plaintiffs argue that the \nSecurities Act’s requirement of a North Carolina-based offer or sale is a jurisdictional \nrequirement, and that once that jurisdictional requirement is met for one Plaintiff, it \nis satisfied for all Plaintiffs .  This is because the purpose of section 78A -63, as a \nremedial statute designed to protect the integrity of North Carolina’s marketplace, is \nto ensure only that a nexus exists between North Carolina and the securities \ntransaction at issue.  Plaintiffs con tend that once that nexus is  demonstrated, the \nSecurities Act must be read liberally to afford a statutory claim to any securities \npurchaser in that transaction, even if one or more of the purchasers could potentially \npursue an alternative claim under another state’s securities laws.   \n143. The Court concludes that Defendants correctly construe section 78A -63 \nto limit claims under the Securities Act to those Plaintiffs that received or accepted \nan offer to sell in North Carolina.  \n \n \n144. The Court further concludes that the transfer of title in North Carolina \nfrom Triple Net to the TICs for property located in North Carolina did not itself \nconstitute a sale of securit ies within North Carolina, and was neither the offer nor \nthe acceptance for the sale of a security in North Carolina for any Plaintiff other than \nthe North Carolina Plaintiffs.  \n145. The Court finds little guidance  in case law or legislative history  as to \nlegislative intent regarding whether the scope of the Securities Act should ex tend to \nout-of-state purchasers if the overall transaction has a North Carolina nexus.  The \nCourt must determine that intent from the language  of the statute , considering \nrelevant policies implicated by that language.  The parties each invoke policy \narguments regarding the legislative intent of the Securities Act.   \n146. Plaintiffs draw on a canon of statutory construction that favors a broad \nconstruction of statutes intended to protect against public harm.  They argue that the \nSecurities Act is a remedial statute intended to protect the integrity of North Carolina \nas a marketplace for securities , and that it must follow that a ny securities offeror \nthat enters the North Carolina marketplace must be  exposed to the full brea dth of \nthe Act’s remedial provisions, such that any purchaser in the transaction has a cause \nof action for any misrepresentation , as long as the transaction, as here, has a clear \nnexus to North Carolina.  The argument is similar to one typically made by a plaintiff \nto assert that a defendant should be subject to general as opposed to specific personal \njurisdiction.  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ narrow construction would allow \nfraud with a North Carolina nexus to go without a remedy for any one other than a \n \n \nNorth Carolina resident, and that such a narrow holding does not promote the \nintegrity of North Carolina as a marketplace.     \n147. In making their policy argument, Defendants invoke the canon of \nstatutory construction that a statute should not be presumed to have extraterritorial \neffect without a clear expression of legislative intent.  Defendants respond that \nPlaintiffs’ broad construction of the Securities Act would lead to an absurd burden on \nNorth Carolina courts, because that construction necessarily means  that every \npurchaser from any state involved in a multistate transaction would be granted a \nstatutory claim under the Securities Act, as long as a single offer or purchase was \nmade in North Carolina.  Defendants insist that no such intent is obvious or can be \nreasonably inferred from the statutory language.  They further argue that their \nposition is consistent with the fact that  North Carolina  takes an approach to \nsecondary liability that varies from the approach taken by  other states  and the  \nUniform Securities Act, and that as a result, Plaintiffs’ construction would allow out-\nof-state residents to enjoy a broader remedy than they are given by the securities \nlaws of their respective home states. \n148. Determining the scope of the Securities Act is a n undertaking that is \nseparate from resolving a conflict-of-laws issue.  The parties agree that the securities \nlaws of multiple states may apply to a single transaction.  See Simms Inv. Co. v. E.F. \nHutton & Co., 699 F. Supp. 543, 545 (M.D.N.C. 1988).  An election of remedies may \nbe presented when more than one state’s securities laws apply to a single transaction.  \nId. at 546.  Multiple plaintiffs may be joined in a single lawsuit brought in a state \n \n \nthat has a “sufficient territorial nexus” to the transaction.  Id.  But it does not follow \nthat all purchasers in a transaction that have a nexus to one state are extended a \nremedy under the laws of that state as opposed to the laws of the state where the sale \ntook place.   \n149. Plaintiffs seek to bolster their statutory interpretation by referring to \nthe North Carolina choice-of-law provision that appears in both the TIC Agreement \nand the Management Agreement.  (TIC Agreement § 12.5; Management Agreement \n§ 13.5.)  While a choice -of-law prov ision may control which states ’ laws govern \ncontractual matters , the Court is unwilling to conclude that the parties can \ncontractually create a cause of action under a state ’s statute when the statute does \nnot by its own terms afford such a caus e of action.  If the dispute were  whether the \noverall transaction has  some nexus to North Carolina, the choice -of-law provision \nmight be instructive.  But the question whether each purchaser in a securities \ntransaction has a cause of action under the Securities  Act does not turn on whether \nthe transaction has  a nexus to North Carolina ; rather, it  turns on the statutory \nlanguage that requires the cause of action to be grounded on an offer or acceptance \nin North Carolina.   \n150. In sum, the Court concludes that only the six North Carolina Plaintiffs \nin this litigation may pursue claims under the Securities Act.  Accordingly, the Court \nGRANTS the 12(c) Motions and enters judgment in favor of Defendants in this \nlitigation on the Securities Act claims brought by the fifty-five Out-of-State Plaintiffs. \n \n \n151. At the hearing on the 12(c) Motions, Plaintiffs argued that they should \nbe allowed to amend their pleadings to assert claims under the securities laws of \nother states if the Court grants Highwoods’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.  \nDefendants countered that an amendment should be denied, not only because of the \nprejudice inherent in such a late filing , but because an amendment would be futile \nfor at least two reasons: (1) claims against Highwoods and TLG are limited to claims \nof secondary liability, which would not be recognized under a majority of state \nsecurities laws through which Plaintiffs could bring claims, and (2)  an amendment \nshould not be allowed to relate back, so the various state statutes of limitation would \nbar Plaintiffs’ claims.  Plaintiffs counter that Highwoods and TLG should be estopped \nfrom asserting prejudice because they did not promptly raise their Rule 12(c) \narguments.   \n152. Plaintiffs have not followed with a  formal motion to amend , nor have \nthey tendered an amended pleading to assert claims under other states’ securities \nacts.   \n153. The Court now dismisses with prejudice all claims under the Securities \nAct brought by anyone  other than the North Carolina Plaintiffs.  As to the Out -of-\nState Plaintiffs, the Court is not satisfied that Plaintiffs’ statements at the hearings \nin this matter qualify as an effective motion to amend to assert claims based on the \nsecurities laws of other states.  But out of an abundance of caution, in the event that \nan appellate court were to determine  that the Court is required to consider an \namendment under Rule 15, the Court would then be required to consider a multitude \n \n \nof issues, including but not limited to whether any amendment would be untimely \nand prejudicial, if not futile .  Considering the number of different state securities  \nlaws that could conceivably be involved, the Court will not further consider the issue \nwithout a formal motion and full briefing.  The Court does not here preclude Plaintiffs \nfrom filing a motion to amend, but it certainly intends to express no opinion that leave \nto amend should or will be freely given. \nE. The Settlement Agreement Did Not Release Claims in this Litigation Against \nthe Grubb & Ellis Defendants. \n \n154. The Grubb & Ellis Defendants move for summary judgment in their \nfavor on the basis that Plaintiffs released all claims against them.  Plaintiffs, in turn, \nrequest summary judgment  in their favor on this issue on the ground s that the \nconditional-release provision in the Settlement Agreement is not effective as a matter \nof law. \n155. Plaintiffs and the Grubb & Ellis Defendants entered into the Settlement \nAgreement in March 2010 .  The Settlement Agreement contain s provisions that \nconditionally agreed to release from liability Triple Net and “any related entity that \nhas management responsibilities to [Plaintiffs].”  (Settlement Agreement 1.)   \n156. Assuming those conditions were met, t he Settlement Agreement \nreleased all claims  \nincluding but not limited to, any and al l claims arising from or related \nto the underwriting and acquisition of the [Durham] Property, the \nsecurities offering documents and disclosures for the sale of [TIC] \ninterests in the [Durham] Property, the Management Agreement, the \n[TIC] Agreement, the te rmination of any such agreements, [or] the \nmanagement of the [Durham] Property.   \n \n \n \n(Settlement Agreement ¶ 2.1.) \n157. The release in the Settlement Agreement was conditioned as follows: \n[T]he release . . . [is] subject to and conditioned upon the absence of any \nclaims by [Plaintiffs] asserted against the Grubb & Ellis [Defendants] \nprior to July 2, 2010  (the “Effective Date of Release”).  The [Plaintiffs] \nshall have until the Effective Date of Release to conduct such inquiries \nand investigations as they may deter mine to be necessary or \nappropriate . . . to determine whether  . . . they have a viable claim \nagainst any of the Grubb & Ellis [Defendants].  Should any of the \n[Plaintiffs] discover such a claim, they shall give written notice to Grubb \n& Ellis of such clai m (an “Excluded Claim”) prior to the Effective Date \nof Release , including a description of the basis of such claim in \nreasonable detail, and they shall commence an action or arbitration  \nproceeding with regard to such Excluded Claim  prior to the Effective \nDate of Release .  Should the [Plaintiffs] duly and timely assert an \nExcluded Claim prior to the Effective Date of Release  . . . the [release] \nshall be void and of no force and effect with respect to the  Excluded \nClaim . . . . \n \n(Settlement Agreement ¶ 2.4 (stylistic emphasis omitted).) \n158. Plaintiffs commenced t he Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit on July 1, 2010 , by \nfiling a Rule 3 summons.  (Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Summ. J. Ex. 36.)  However, the Rule \n3 summons was not served on t he Grubb & Ellis Defendants until July 12, 2010.  \n(Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Summ. J. Ex. 35, at 1.)  The Rule 3 summons provided minimal \ndetail about Plaintiffs’ claims, and  Plaintiffs did not provide written notice of their \nclaims to the Grubb & Ellis Defendants prior to serving the summons .  Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint was filed on July 21, 2010.   \n159. The Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment  is \ncontrolled by the Court’s interpretation of paragraph 2.4 of the Settlement \nAgreement.     \n \n \n160. Relying on the first sentence of paragraph 2.4 as an  independent \nstatement, Plaintiffs contend that the filing of the Rule 3 summons was alone \neffective to preclude any release from becoming effective.   The Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants contend that this first sentence cannot be read independently, but that  \nparagraph 2.4 must be read as a whole, and when read as a whole, the release would \nbecome effective on July 2, 2010 , unless each of two things happened before July 2, \n2010: (1) Plaintiffs gave written notice of their intent to file a lawsuit, “including a \ndescription of the basis of such claim[s] in reasonable detail,” and (2) Plaintiffs filed \na lawsuit asserting the identified claims.  (Settlement Agreement ¶ 2.4.)  The Grubb \n& Ellis Defendants urge that the filing of the Rule 3 summons may have satisfied the \nsecond condition, but that it manifestly did not satisfy the first condition. \n161. The Court concludes that it must interpret paragraph 2.4 restrictively, \nand in doing so concludes that the first sentence of that paragraph is an independent \nsentence that effectively precluded the release from becoming effective once Plaintiffs \ninitiated their action on July 1, 2010.  See Johnston County v. R.N. Rouse & Co., 331 \nN.C. 88, 94, 414 S.E.2d 30, 34 (1992) (“[I]t is a fundamental rule of contract \nconstruction that the courts construe an ambiguous contract in a manner that gives \neffect to all of its provisions, if the court is reasonably able to do so.”).    \n162. Accordingly, solely on the issue whether Plaintiffs’ claims against the \nGrubb & Ellis Defendants were release d by the Settlement Agreement, the Court \ndenies the Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ request for summary judgment and instead \ngrants summary judgment for Plaintiffs. \n \n \nF. The North Carolina Plaintiffs’ Claim of Primary Liability under the Securities \nAct Survives as to Some Grubb & Ellis Defendants, but Not to Others. \n \n163. Having determined that the North Carolina Plaintiffs have standing to \npresent claims under the Securities Act, the Court now addresses whether those \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a bas is to further p ursue a claim of  primary liability \nagainst the Grubb & Ellis Defendants.   \n(1) All claims against Grubb & Ellis Co. and NNN Realty Advisors are \ndismissed. \n \n164. To be held primarily liable under the Securities Act, a defendant must \nhave offered or sold a security.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 78A-56(a)(1), (2) (2015).   \n165. Plaintiffs concede that Grubb & Ellis Co. should be dismissed from this \nlitigation.  (Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n to Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 24 (“Plaintiffs \nconcede that they have not discovered evidence in this litigation that Grubb & Ellis \nCompany assumed the liabilities of its subsidiaries or participated in the \ntransaction.”).)  Accordingly, all claims against Grubb & Ellis Co. are DISMISSED. \n166. NNN Realty Advisors contends that it , too, should be dismissed  from \nthis litigation  because it was merely the parent company of Triple Net and NNN \nCapital.   \n167. As a preliminary matter, NNN Realty Advisors filed a petition for \nassignment for the benefit of creditors on August 14, 2015.  See Petition for \nAssignment for Benefit of Creditors, In re NNN Realty Advisors, Inc., No. CACE-15-\n014636 (Fla. Cir. Ct. Aug. 14, 2015).  That case is pre sently pending in the Complex \nCivil Litigation Division of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit for Broward County, \n \n \nFlorida.  At this Court’s November 2015  hearing, counsel advised that the claims in \nthis litigation against NNN Realty Advisors should be stayed  due to  a Chapter 7 \ninvoluntary-bankruptcy filing in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District \nof Delaware.  See Involuntary Petition, In re NNN Realty Advisors, Inc. , No. 15 -\n11873-KJC (Bankr. D. Del. Sept. 8, 2015).  The bankruptcy case was later transferred \nto the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida, where \nthat court granted NNN Realty Advisors’ motion to dismiss and motion for \nabstention.  See In re NNN Realty Advisors, Inc. , No. 15-30508-RBR, slip op. at 7  \n(Bankr. S.D. Fla. Apr. 18, 2016) .  Therefore, it is no longer necessary for this Court \nto stay the litigation against NNN Realty Advisors. \n168. NNN Realty Advisors contends that  claims against it should be \ndismissed because, as the parent company, it  did not play an y substantive role in \nPlaintiffs’ purchases of TIC interests in the Durham Property and thus should not be \nconsidered an offeror or seller of a security purchased by any Plaintiff.  \n169. Plaintiffs contend that NNN Realty  Advisors is subject to liability \nbecause it is a signatory to the Management Agreement, the LLC A greement, and \nthe TIC Agreement , and was the indemnitor that executed  the Indemnity and \nGuarantee Agreement with the lender in connection with the investment .  NNN \nRealty Advisors signed as an authorized representative of NNN Office in those \nagreements.  Plaintiffs further contend that NNN Realty Advisors is liable based on \ncontrol-person liability as the controlling shareholder of Triple Net and NNN Capital.  \n \n \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. §  78A-56(c)(1) (imposing secondary liability on control persons \nwho materially aid in a securities sale).     \n170. The record presents no basis for the Court to conclude that NNN Realty \nAdvisors offered or sold  a security, made any statements to Plaintiffs , entered into \ncontracts with Plaintiffs, or shared contractual privity with Plaintiffs.  Accordingly, \nNNN Realty Advisors’ liability, if any, must depend on control-person liability.   \n171. The Court is not persuaded that Plaintiff s have presented an adequate \nbasis to pursue claims against NNN Realty Advisors based on a theory of control -\nperson liability .  The fact that NNN Realty Advisors affixed its signature to the \nvarious transactional documents is not enough to sustain a claim for control-person \nliability under the Securities Act.  The record reveals no stronger basis to uphold \nPlaintiffs’ claim under a control-person theory of liability—a claim that they raise for \nthe first time in their response brief to the Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment .  Accordingly, all claims against NNN Realty Advisors are \nDISMISSED.   \n(2) Material questions of fact preclude summary adjudication of the North \nCarolina Plaintiffs’ primary-liability claim against the remaining Grubb & \nEllis Defendants. \n \na. The legal standard for liability based on a stated opinion \n \n172. The Court now addresses the North Carolina Plaintiffs’ claim of primary \nliability under the Securities Act against the remaining Grubb & Ellis Defendants—\nTriple Net ,  NNN Capita l, and NNN Office.   Like with NNN Realty Advisors, an \nassignment-for-the-benefit-of-creditors proceeding is pending against Triple Net  \n \n \n(now NNN Realty Investors, LLC) in a Florida state court.  See In re NNN Realty \nInv’rs, LLC, No. CACE-15-014067 (Fla. Cir. Ct. filed Aug. 6, 2015).  In the absence of \na bankruptcy proceeding that would require this action to be stayed, the Court \nproceeds to rule on claims pending against Triple Net. \n173. The Securities Act impose s primary liability for f raud pursuant to  \nsection 78A-56(a)(1), and for materially false statements or omissions in connection \nwith the offer or sale of a security pursuant to section 78A-56(a)(2).  N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 78A-56(a)(1), (2); see also Piazza v. Kirkbride, ___ N.C. App. ___, 785 S.E.2d 695, \n709 (2016), appeal docketed, No. 181A16 (N.C. May 10, 2016).   \n174. Subsection (a)(1) is modeled on section 10(b)(5) of the federal 1934 \nExchange Act and requires proof of scienter and justifiable reliance.  See N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 78A-56(a)(1); see also Piazza, 785 S.E.2d at 709 ; Highwoods, 2013 NCBC \nLEXIS 11, at * 29.  S ubsection (a)(2) is modeled on section 12 of the federal 1933 \nSecurities Act and requires proof of “any untrue statement of a material fact or any \nomission to state a material fact ,” rather than scienter or justifiable reliance .  N.C. \nGen. Stat. §  78A-56(a)(1); see also Piazza, 785 S.E.2d at 709–10; Highwoods, 2013 \nNCBC LEXIS 11, at *29–30.   \n175. North Carolina’s appellate courts have defined an omitted fact as \n“material” when “there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable [investor] would \nconsider [the omitted fact]  important in deciding” whether to invest.  Ehrenhaus v. \nBaker, 216 N.C. App. 59, 88, 717 S.E.2d 9, 28 (2011) (quoting Rosenblatt v. Getty Oil \nCo., 493 A.2d 929, 944 (Del. 1985)).   That is, “there must be a substantial likelihood \n \n \nthat the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable \ninvestor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.”  \nId. at 88, 717 S.E.2d at 28–29 (quoting Rosenblatt, 493 A.2d at 944).       \n176. When a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case under section \n78A-56(a)(2), the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove “that he did not \nknow, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or \nomission.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 78A-56(a)(2); see Piazza, 785 S.E.2d at 711 (holding that \nthe “reasonable care” standard in section 78A-56(a)(2) “appears to be more similar to \na negligence standard than intentional fraud”) ; Highwoods, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11, \nat *30.   \n177. Having thoroughly reviewed the extensive record , and having \nconsidered the arguments and authorities cited, t he Court concludes that Plaintiffs \nhave not demonstrated a basis for any finding of scienter.  Accordingly, any Securities \nAct claim against the Grubb & Ellis Defendants must be based on subsection (a)(2).   \n178. Plaintiffs’ claim concentrates on statements or omissions regarding the \nlikelihood that Duke would renew its leases.  The record is clear that both the TICs \nand Triple Net  considered the income stream from Duke’s lease renewals  to be  a \nsignificant component of the PPM’s projected Business Plan.  Thus, t hat income \nstream was a material component , and any misrepresentation concerning that \nincome stream was also material.   \n179. The parties do not appear to disagree as to the income stream that the \nDuke leases represent.  Rather, the issue of liability turns on whether Plaintiffs have \n \n \ndeveloped or projected evidence on which a conclusion could be made that Triple Net \nmade a misrepresentation concerning the likelihood of Duke’s lease renewal, either \nby affirmatively misstating the likelihood of that renewal or by omitting facts of \nwhich Triple Net was or should have been aware that, when not disclosed, rendered \nthe statements misleading.   \n180. The PPM clearly disclosed that Duke ’s leases would expire and had no \nrenewal provisions, and further clearly disclaimed any warranty that Duke would in \nfact renew the leases.  (PPM 9.)  Liability then turns on whether statements made \nregarding the leases were misleading because other facts regarding those leases and \ncircumstances relevant to the probability of their renewal were not disclosed , \nincluding the expressed opinion that Triple Net itself believed that Duke would renew \nits leases.   \n181. In their claim  against the Grubb & Ellis Defendants,  Plaintiffs \nalternatively contend that Triple Net failed to disclose facts of which it was aware, \nand that Triple Net further failed to discover and subsequently disclose facts that it \nshould have discovered.  As an example of Plaintiffs’ claim that Triple Net failed to \ndisclose material facts that it was aware of, Plaintiffs point to Selig’s testimony that \nhe advised Waddell that Duke had issued a n RFP for an alternative build -to-suit \nbuilding to relocate PRMO’s operations because of Duke’s dissatisfaction  with their \nspace in the Durham Property.  As an example of Plaintiffs’ claim that the Grubb & \nEllis Defendants failed to discover and disclose material facts, Plaintiffs assert  that \nTriple Net failed to conduct adequate due diligence that would have uncovered \n \n \nHighwoods’ build-to-suit proposal.  In their  claim of secondary liability against \nHighwoods and TLG , Plaintiffs  assert that Highwoods and TLG  failed to disclose \nthese facts to Triple Net.  \n182. The Grubb & Ellis  Defendants contend that Triple Net’s  statements \nregarding the probability that Duke would renew its leases in the Durham Property \nare nonactionable forward-looking statements of opinion, and that the additional \nfacts that Triple Net failed to become aware of  are insufficient to make those  \nstatements actionable under the Securities Act. \n183. There is little precedent decided under North Carolina’s Securities Act \nto guide the Court.  Accordingly, the Court properly  looks to federal precedent for \nguidance.  Doing so  begins with considering the Uni ted States Supreme Court ’s \ndecision in Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers District Counsel Construction Industry \nPension Fund, 135 S. Ct. 1318 (2015).  Before Omnicare, at least some federal courts \nof appeals held that a plaintiff could prevail on a misrepresentation claim  grounded \non a defendant’s statement of opinion only if  the plaintiff could prove both that the \nopinion was objectively false and that the defendants did not actually believe the \nstated opinion.  See, e.g., Fait v. Regions Fin. Corp., 655 F.3d 105 , 111–12 (2d Cir. \n2011).  The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has held that this earlier standard was \nmodified by Omnicare, because the Supreme Court now recognizes liability based on \nan opinion that applies facts on which the opinion is based, if the opinion is proven to \nbe objectively false and omits information that renders the opinion misleading, even \n \n \nif the party sincerely held the opinion at the time it was made.  Tongue v. Sanofi (In \nre Sanofi Sec. Litig.), 816 F.3d 199, 210 (2d Cir. 2016). \n184. In Omnicare, the United States Supreme Court addressed the question \nof liability under section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 for statements of opinion \ncontained in a company’s offering documen ts.  Omnicare, a pharmac y-services \ncompany, filed a registration statement in connection with a public offering of \ncommon stock.  Omnicare, 135 S. Ct. at 1323.  The registration statement contained \na statement that expressed Omnicare’s opinion that the company’s registration \nstatement complied with federal and state laws.  Id. at 1323–24.  The respondents \nalleged that Omnicare’s statements of legal compliance  constituted both untrue \nstatements of material fact and omissions of material fact.  Id. at 1324. \n185. The Court’s discussion highlights a distinction between statement s of \npure opinion and mixed statements of fact and opinion.  The Court established a two-\nstep process for analyzing potential securities liability.  Id. at 1325.  First, a court \nshould inquire whether “an opinion itself constitutes a factual misstatement .”  Id.  \nSecond, if so, the court should then determine “when an opinion may be rendered \nmisleading by the omission of discrete factual representations.”  Id.  \n186. As to the first step, the Supreme Court noted that a statement of opinion \ndoes not constitute an “untrue statement of fact” simply because the stated opinion \nultimately proves incorrect.  Id. at 1326 .  Rather, the Court held  that “a sincere \nstatement of pure opinion is not an ‘untrue statement of material fact,’ regardless \nwhether an investor can ultimately prove the belief wrong.”  Id. at 1327.  The Court \n \n \ncarefully explained, however, that “liability under §  11’s false-statement provision \nwould fol low . . . if the speaker did not hold the belief she professed ” or  “if the \nsupporting fact she supplied were untrue.”  Id.  The reach of section 11 is limited in \nthat it “does not allow investors to second-guess inherently subjective and uncertain \nassessments.”  Id.  In other words, the Court explained, section 11’s false -statement \nprovision is not “an invitation to Monday morning quarterback an issuer’s opinion.”  \nId. \n187. As to the second step, the Court explained that statements could be \nmisleading under section 11 if they omitted “material facts about the issuer’s inquiry \ninto or knowledge concerning a statement of opinion, and if those facts conflict with \nwhat a reasonable investor would take from the statement itself .”  Id. at 1329.  The \nCourt expressly rejected the argument that an  opinion can never constitute a \nmisrepresentation.  Id. at 1328.   Rather, the Court explained that “a reasonable \ninvestor may, depending on the circumstances, understand an opinion to convey facts \nabout how the speaker has f ormed the opinion  . . . . [a]nd if the real facts are \notherwise, but not provided, the opinion statement will mislead its audience.”  Id. \n188. The Supreme Court was careful to limit  the scope of  its holding , \nexplaining that an opinion “is not necessarily misleading when an issuer knows, but \nfails to disclose, some fact cutting the other way.”  Id. at 1329.  Indeed, the Court \nexplained, “[r]easonable investors understand that opinions sometimes rest on a \nweighing of competing facts,” and “the presence of such facts is one reason why an \nissuer may frame a statement as an opinion, thus conveying uncertainty.”  Id.    \n \n \n189. Thus, under Omnicare, to state a claim under section 11, the investor \n“must identify particular (and material) facts going to the basis for the issuer’s \nopinion—facts about the inquiry the issuer did or did not conduct or the knowledge it \ndid or did not have—whose omission makes the opinion statement at issue misleading \nto a reasonable person reading the statement fairly and in context.”  Id. at 1332.  As \nthe Supreme Court points out, “[t]hat is no small task for an investor.”  Id.  \n190. The difficulty that a plaintiff faces in meeting the Omnicare standard is \nreflected in the Second Circuit’s opinion in Sanofi.  Issued in March 2016, Sanofi was \nthe first federal appellate-court decision to discuss Omnicare in detail.   \n191. In Sanofi, the plaintiffs alleged that Sanofi, a pharmaceutical company, \nmade materially false or misleading statements regarding its breakthrough drug \nLemtrada and the chances that the drug would receive FDA approval, when the \ncompany was aware that the FDA had expressed concerns with Sanofi’s reliance on \nsingle-blind studies.  Sanofi, 816 F.3d at 202.   \n192. In affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s federal securities \nclaims, the Second Circuit echoed the Supreme Court’s emphasis in Omnicare that \ninvestors must examine the factual context in which an allegedly misleading opinion \nis made.  Id. at 211.  The court was persuaded by the fact that the plaintiffs were \nsophisticated investors who were familiar with the customs and practices of the \nrelevant industry.  Id.; see id. at 211–12 (“While a layperson, unaccustomed to the \nsubtleties and intrica cies of the pharmaceutical industry and registration \nstatements, may have misinterpreted Defendants’ statements as evincing assurance \n \n \nof success, Plaintiffs here can claim no such ignorance.”).  However, the court further \nnoted that the offering materials contained numerous caveats as to the reliability of \nthe projections that a “reasonable investor” would have considered.  Id. at 211.  The \ncourt granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the  plaintiffs’ claim at the pleading \nstage, amplifying Omnicare’s teaching that “[i]ssuers must be forthright with their \ninvestors, but securities law does not impose on them an obligation to disclose every \npiece of information in their possession.”  Id. at 214. \nb. There are issues of material fact as to whether Triple Net’s  opinion \nconstitutes an actionable misstatement. \n \n193. Plaintiffs contend that Triple Net’s statements regarding the probability \nof Duke’s lease renewals, although expressed as an opinion, implied facts upon which \nthe opinions were based, and were misleading because Plaintiffs were not advised of \nfacts known to—or that should have been known to—Triple Net, thereby causing the \nopinions to be misleading.  Particularly, Plaintiffs assert that the stated percentage \nprobabilities in the A RGUS presentation and the stated opinion that Triple Net \nbelieved that Duke would renew based on the lease history were misleading when \nPlaintiffs were not advised that Duke had already expressed reservations about the \nleased space and had take n actions directed at reloc ating when the leases expired.   \nPlaintiffs further claim that the materiality of this information would be even more \nobvious if Triple Net had learned but failed to  disclose that Highwoods had \nparticipated in those efforts by issuing a build -to-suit proposal at the same time it \nwas marketing the Property for sale to Triple Net. \n \n \n194. The Grubb & Ellis Defendants rely heavily on case law developed prior \nto Omnicare holding that liability under securities laws should not rest on forward -\nlooking statements accompanied by cautionary language.  See, e.g., Gasner v. Bd. of \nSupervisors, 103 F.3d 351 , 364 (4th Cir. 1996); Raab v. Gen. Physics Corp. , 4 F.3d \n286, 290 (4th Cir. 1993); In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig.—Taj Mahal Litig., \n7 F.3d 357 , 371–73 (3d Cir. 1993) .  Applying those holdings, the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants highlight that any  statement regarding the probability of Duke’s lease \nrenewal w as necessarily forward -looking and was accompanied by abundant  \ndisclaimers cautioning that Plaintiffs should not invest based on any assurances that \nthe stated assumptions of lease renewal would prove true, and that Duke’s failure to \nrenew would necessarily undercut the success of the Business Plan.  It is important \nto focus on the exact language of the critical opinion.  In addition to using certain \nprobability percentages to project a cash -flow analysis, Triple Net  expressed the \nfollowing opinion: \nBased on Duke’s longevity as a tenant at the Property, the Manager \nbelieves that Duke will continue to renew each of the ir leases for a \nvariety of reasons.  Most notably is the Property’s location to Durham \nRegional Hospital and Duke University.  Durham Regional Hospital is \nlocated approximately one-half mile to the south while Duke University \nis approximately 7 miles away.  The lack of new and existing available \noffice space large enough to handle the square footage needs of the \nPRMO Group and Pediatric group further supports this.   \n \n Based upon the importance of Duke’s tenancy to the Property, the \nManager intends to engage Duke regarding extending their respective \nleases.  This will help reduce the uncertainty surrounding the expiration \nof their leases over the first three years of the projected five year holding \nperiod.  However, there can be no assurance that Duke University \nHealth Systems, Inc. or Duke University will in fact extend their leases \nat the Property. \n \n \n \n(PPM 40.) \n195. This statement is offered neither as a pure opinion nor as a \nrepresentation that Duke would in fact renew.  The language is properly \ncharacterized as an opinion that implies a factual basis.  The opinion is accompanied \nby clear disclaimers that the opi nion was not an assurance, and that if the opinion \nproved wrong in the future, the value of the investment would be undercut \nsubstantially, if not totally lost.  (See, e.g., PPM i, 19.)  While Triple Net committed \nto using “good faith commercially reasonable efforts to retain existing tenants and/or \nto re-lease and re-tenant vacant premises in the Property,” it expressly advised that \n“no assurance can be given that [it would] be able to do so.”  (PPM 9.)      \n196. Because the PP M clearly reveals that Duke’s renewal was uncertain, \nPlaintiffs must contend that the omission o f additional facts rendered Triple Net’s \nopinion misleading, notwithstanding that the opinion was already accompanied by \nthe caution that the opinion could not be considered as providing any assurance, and \nthat Plaintiffs were investing based on a future contingency.  Their argument is that \nadditional facts regarding Duke’s consideration of a possible relocation would have \nbeen material to an investor’s consideration of whether the stated contingency would \nbe more likely to fail.  That is, Plaintiffs’ burden is to show that the omitted additional \nfacts made the expressed opinion  “misleading to a reasonable person reading the \nstatement fairly and in context.”  Omnicare, 135 S. Ct. at 1332.    \n197. Having considered the record, the  Court concludes th at there is no \nadequate basis on which a jury could reasonably conclude that Triple Net \n \n \nmisrepresented that Duke had actually decided to renew.  First, the PPM does not \nmake that statement.  Further, there is no evidentiary basis to reject Selig’s clear \ntestimony that no decision to relocate had been made.     \n198. However, having expressed an affirmative opinion that it believed that \nDuke would renew, Triple Net cannot defend its statement solely on the basis that \nDuke had not decided otherwise and that Triple Net reasonably held its stated belief.  \nLiability can rest on an opinion that implies certain facts if there were other facts of \nwhich the offeror knew but did not disclose , or facts of which the offeror would be \npresumed to have known from the manner in which the opinion was based.  Here, \nPlaintiffs highlight that Selig testified that Triple Net was  specifically advised that \nDuke had begun to consider relocating, evidenced by Duke having issued an RFP—a \nfact that the PPM did not disclos e.  (Selig Dep. vol. I, 56:19–57:2, 59:1–4, July 3, \n2012.)  Plaintiffs further contend that Triple Net’s due diligence was inadequate, as \na result of which Triple Net failed to learn of additional facts that should have been \ndisclosed.  \n199. Admittedly, the burden on an investor who seeks to impose liability \nbased on an issuer’s statement of opinion remains a high one , and the burden is \nparticularly high when a plaintiff relies on an opinion regarding a future occurrence \nthat is accompanied by disclaimers and cautions.  Nonetheless, based on this record, \nthe Court concludes that there are material issues of fact that preclude a grant of \nsummary judgment either to the North Carolina Plaintiffs or to the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants on the issue of primary liability under the Securit ies Act pursuant to \n \n \nsection 78A-56(a)(2).  The Court reserves reconsideration of its holding upon a motion \nfor directed verdict. \nG. The North Carolina Plaintiffs’ Claim of Secondary  Liability Against \nHighwoods and TLG Should Be Dismissed. \n \n200. Having found that the North Carolina Plaintiffs may pursue a primary-\nliability claim under section 78A-56(a)(2), the Court turns to whether those Plaintiffs \nmay proceed with their claim of secondary liability against Highwoods and TLG.   \nAfter due consideration of the record, briefs and authorities, and arguments of \ncounsel, the Court concludes that the secondary -liability claim must be dismissed , \nbecause the evidence of record, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, does \nnot allow for a conclusion that either Highwoods or TLG knew of and then materially \naided or substantially assisted in Triple Net’s expression of the opinion on which the \nNorth Carolina Plaintiffs base their primary-liability claim.    \n201. The Court first rejects Plaintiffs’ argument that the law-of-the-case \ndoctrine precludes it from reviewing the secondary-liability claim because the Court \nallowed that claim to survive Highwoods’ and TLG’s initial Rule 12(b)(6) motions to \ndismiss.  See Highwoods, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11, at * 57.  That doctrine does not \npreclude the Court’s subsequent review of the claim under Rule 56.   \n202. The Court begins its analysis by examining the relevant portion of the \nAct on which the secondary-liability claim is based.  Section 78A-56(c)(2) provides in \npertinent part that \n[u]nless liable under subdivision (1) of this subsection  . . . every other \nperson who materially aids in the transaction giving rise to the liability \nis also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the \n \n \nperson if the employee or other person actually knew of the existence of \nthe facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.   \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 78A-56(c)(2).  The Securities Act imposes two essential elements for \nsecondary liability: (1) the “material aid” requirement, and (2) the “actual knowledge” \nrequirement.  See id.   \n203. In its earlier opinion, the Court determined that “material aid” should \nbe construed to require conduct that rises “to the level of having contributed \nsubstantial assistance to the act or conduct leading to primary liability under the \n[Securities Act].”  Highwoods, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11,  at *49.  The Court also held \nthat the undefined term “substantial assistance” should be narrowly construed.  Id.  \nThe Court finds a narrow construction appropriate, considering the potential breadth \nof secondary liability under section 78A -56(c)(2), which imposes joint and several \nliability on every person who materially aids the primary actor.  N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 78A-56(c)(2).   \n204. Here, Plaintiffs contend that Highwoods and TLG material ly aided \nTriple Net’s violation of the Securities Act in two ways.   \n205. First, Plaintiffs contend that Highwoods’ transfer of fractional interests \nby deed directly to Plaintiffs was itself “material aid.”  The Court concludes that th e \ntransfer by deed  alone did not constitute material aid within the scope of the \nSecurities Act.  \n206. Second, Plaintiffs contend that Highwoods and TLG materially aided \nTriple Net in giving a misleading opinion as to the probability of Duke’s lease renewal \nby failing to advise Triple Net of facts that might have led Triple Net either to express \n \n \na different opinion or to disclose additional facts regarding the basis for the opinion \nthat it d id express.  Even assuming, without deciding, that a person’s failure to \ndisclose facts to an offeror of securities could, under a total mix of information,  \nconstitute material aid or substantial assistance,  under the Securities Act , that \nmaterial aid or substantial assistance must nevertheless be accompanied by proof \nthat the party charged with secondary liability acted with knowledge of the facts on \nwhich the claim of primary liability is based.  Plaintiffs cannot satisfy that \nrequirement here, because there is no evidence of record to show that, at the time  \nHighwoods or TLG allegedly provided material aid or substantial assistance, either \nentity knew that Triple Net intended to make—or use the information sought from \nHighwoods or TLG to make —the opinion on which Plaintiffs base their primary -\nliability claim against Triple Net. \n207. Essentially, Plaintiffs claim that Highwoods and TLG are secondarily \nliable because Triple Net relied on them when it expressed its own opinion in the \nPPM regarding the pr obability that Duke would renew its leases, and that \nHighwoods’ or TLG ’s failure to disclose their  knowledge of certain facts  regarding \nDuke’s consideration  of that renewal supports secondary liability, regardless of \nwhether Highwoods or TLG knew that Triple Net intended to use that information to \nexpress an opinion to a securities purchaser who might be influenced by Triple Net’s \nawareness or lack of awareness of the facts underlying Triple Net’s opinion.  That is, \naccording to Plaintiffs, Highwoods and TL G are secondarily liab le if they misled \nTriple Net, as a result of w hich Triple Net, in turn, misled Plaintiffs, and P laintiffs \n \n \nneed not prove that Highwoods or TLG knew that Triple Net intended to use the \ninformation they provided to mislead Plaintiffs.   \n208. The Court has ea rlier rejected the notion that P laintiffs can assert a \ndirect fraud-based claim against Highwoods or TLG under a theory of “indirect \nreliance,” and that any fraud-based claim fails because neither Highwoods nor TLG \nmade a direct  representation on which any P laintiff relied in purchasing a TIC \ninterest.  See Highwoods, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 11, at  *58–62.  The Court likewise \nconcludes that neither Highwoods nor TLG may be charged with secondary liability, \nbecause there is no proof that they “actually knew of the existence of the facts by \nreason of which the [primary] liability is alleged to exist.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 78A-56(c)(2). \n209. The North Carolina Plaintiffs have offered no evidence that either \nHighwoods or TLG knew that Triple Net intended to express, or in fact had expressed, \nthe opinion on which the primary-liability claim is based.  There is no evidence that \nHighwoods or TLG directly participated in drafting any representation upon which \nany North Carolina Plaintiff relied.  There is no evidence that Triple Net asked \nHighwoods or TLG to review, endorse, or comment on any representation that Triple \nNet intended to make, or in fact made, to the North Carolina Plaintiffs.  As cautioned \nby the United States Supreme Court in Omnicare, allowing a securities-law violation \nto rest on the expression of an opinion should not be read so broadly as to impose a \ngeneral duty of disclosure.  Omnicare, 135 S. Ct. at 1329.  This caution is particularly \nappropriate where , as h ere, the duty of disclosure is asserted not against the \n \n \nsecurities offeror, but against one who expressed a separate opinion to the offeror \nduring the offeror’s own due diligence.  \n210. The Court is not required to  reach a different conclusion based on \nevidence that Triple Net may have directly copied into the PPM some background \ninformation from the COM that TLG had earlier prepared in connection with \nHighwoods’ marketing of the Durham Property.  TLG contends that any such copying \nwas prohibited by the terms of the COM, but that, more significantly, Plaintiffs have \nnot tied any of the reproduced background information to Triple Net’s expression of \nthe opinions  on which the y rely to assert their claim of primary liability.  The \nuncontested evidence is that Triple Net varied its statement of assumptions and \nprobability projections of lease renewals from those that TLG expressed in the COM.  \nMoreover, the PPM expressly advises any potential purchaser that statements in the \nPPM must be assumed to have been based solely on Triple Net’s own due diligence.  \n(See PPM 39.) \n211. Under the facts of this case, the Court concludes that the uncontested \nevidence demonstrates that the North Carolina P laintiffs have failed to offer proof \nthat either Highwo ods or TLG provided material aid with the requisite actual \nknowledge required under the Securities Act.  Accordingly, the Court determines that \nHighwoods’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, TLG’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment is GRANTED, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \nAgainst Highwoods & TLG is DENIED, and any claim of secondary liability against \nHighwoods and TLG should be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \n \n \nH. Plaintiffs’ Remaining Claims Against the Grubb & Ellis Defendants \n \n212. While the various motions have concentrated most heavily on whether \nPlaintiffs’ claims based on the Securities Act survive summary judgment, Plaintiffs \nhave presented other claims on which t he Grubb & Ellis Defendants now request \nsummary judgment, includin g claims of breach of contract, negligence, negligent \nmisrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices, and punitive damages.  The Court separately analyzes each of these \nclaims below. \n(1) Breach of contract \n213. Plaintiffs allege that the Grubb & Ellis Defendants materially breached \nthe Purchase Agreement  and Escrow Instructions  (“Purchase Agreement”) with \nPlaintiffs, “and/or caused Defendant NNN Office to materially breach” the \nagreement, when NNN Office “repres ented that it was the record owner” of the \nDurham Property, having “recently acquired the property,” and that it would deed \nthe Property from itself to each TIC, when NNN Office never in fact acquired title to \nthe Durham Property.  (Am. Compl. ¶  210; Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n to Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ \nMot. Summ. J. 19.)  Plaintiffs allege that the Grubb & Ellis Defendants “committed  \nother breaches in structuring the transaction,” but they do not identify those \nbreaches.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 210(e).)    \n214. The elements of a cla im for breach of contract include (1) the existence \nof a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.  Bob Timberlake \nCollection, Inc. v. Edwards, 176 N.C. App. 33, 43, 626 S.E.2d 315, 323 (2006).   \n \n \n215. The “as is” provision in the Purchase Agreement states that “BUYER \nACKNOWLEDGES THAT SELLER ONLY RECENTLY ACQUIRED THE \nPROPERTY AND HAS LIMITED KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE CONDITION \nOF THE PROPERTY.”   (Purchase Agreement § 7.2.)  The Purchase Agreement did \nnot contain a covenant of s eisin or any other representation that NNN Office held \ntitle to the Durham Property.  The Court agrees with the Grubb & Ellis Defendants \nthat the fact that Highwoods deeded the Durham Property directly to Plaintiffs and \nthe deed was not first given to NNN Office does not support a breach -of-contract \nclaim.  Accordingly, summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants on this claim. \n(2) Negligence and negligent misrepresentation \n216. Plaintiffs allege that the Grubb & Ellis Defendants owed Plaintiffs a \nduty to conduct a proper and thorough due-diligence investigation and breached their \nduty of care when they made representations regarding Duke’s lease -renewal \nprobabilities without first determining  or disclosing that Duke had issued an RFP.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 215–16.)  The Grubb & Ellis Defendants move to dismiss this claim \non the grounds that there is no common -law duty of due diligence distinct from the \nobligations imposed by the Securities Act.  (Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 4.) \n217. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs may recover, if at all, based on their \nclaims under a securities act, and that they are not entitled to proceed separately on \na theory of negligence grounded on Triple Net’s failure to complete adequate due \n \n \ndiligence.  Thus, s ummary judgment is GRANTED in favor of the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants on Plaintiffs’ claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation.     \n(3) Breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud \n218. A claim for breach of fiduciary duty cannot exist in the absence of a \nfiduciary relationship between the parties.  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 651, 548 S.E.2d at \n707.  A fiduciary relationship has been broadly defined by the North Carolina \nSupreme Court as a relat ionship in which “there has been  a special confidence \nreposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and \nwith due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.”  Id. (quoting Abbitt \nv. Gregory, 201 N.C. 577, 598, 1 60 S.E. 896, 906 (1931)).  The definition requires a \nshowing of “confidence reposed on one side, and resulting domination and influence \non the other.”  Id. at 651, 548 S.E.2d at 708 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Abbitt, 201 \nN.C. at 598, 160 S.E. at 906).  \n219. As for NNN Capital’s liability, t he Court finds no case law to support \nthe theory that managing broker–dealers owe fiduciary duties to investors.   Indeed, \nthe North Carolina Supreme Court has declined to find a fiduciary relationship in \narm’s-length borrower–lender transactions.  See Dallaire v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 367 \nN.C. 363, 368, 760 S.E.2d 263, 266 –67 (2014); see also  Berthel Fisher & Co. Fin. \nServs., Inc. v. Larmon , 695 F.3d 749, 753 (8th Cir. 2012) (holding that individual \ninvestors are not the customer s of managing broker –dealers); Fekety v. Gruntal & \nCo., 595 N.Y.S.2d 190, 190–91 (App. Div. 1993) (“[A] broker does not, in the ordinary \ncourse of business, owe a fiduciary duty to a purchaser of securities.”) .  While a \n \n \nfiduciary relationship may, in appropriate circumstances, arise as a matter of fact , \nsee CommScope Credit Union v. Butler & Burke, LLP, ___ N.C. ___, 790 S.E.2d 657, \n660 (2016), here, the Court finds no evidence that NNN Capital owed fiduciary duties \nto Plaintiffs.   \n220. As for Triple Net’s liability, Plaintiffs’ only contention is that Triple Net \n“was a member and/or officer of each Plaintiff LLC at least as of March 12, 2007.”   \n(Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n to Grubb & Ellis Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. 21.)   Plaintiffs cite no case \nlaw or record evidence to explain how this fact supports their claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty.  As the Grubb & Ellis Defendants point out, the addendum to the PPM \nmakes clear that neither NNN Office, Triple Net, Triple Net Rea lty, “nor the other \n[TICs] will have a fiduciary duty to the [TICs], as would be applicable to an \ninvestment in a corporation, limited liability company or partnership.”  (Grubb & \nEllis Defs.’ Summ. J. Ex. 21, at 13.)  Further, the LLC Agreement provides that Triple \nNet was a vice president with limited responsibilities that extended only to executing \ncertain closing costs and loan documents for the TICs.  (See, e.g., LLC Agreement \n§§ 3.1.5, 3.2, .3.)  This limited role does not give rise to fiduciary obligations.   \n221. In the absence of a fiduciary duty, Plaintiffs’ claim of constructive fraud \nalso fails.  See Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 666, 488 S.E.2d 215, \n224 (1997) (holding that the plaintiffs’ constructive-fraud claim failed because there \nwas no “relationship of trust and confidence” ).  Accordingly, summary judgment is \nGRANTED in favor of the Grubb & Ellis Defendants on Plaintiffs’ breach-of-\nfiduciary-duty and constructive-fraud claims. \n \n \n(4) Section 75-1.1 \n222. Plaintiffs plead in the alternative that if the Court holds that the \nSecurities Act does not apply  because the TIC interests are not securities , it should \nfind that the Grubb & Ellis Defendants committed unfair and deceptive trade \npractices in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat.  § 75-1.1 (2015).  The Court concludes that \nPlaintiffs’ investment is beyond the scope of chapter 75.  See Skinner v. E.F. Hutton \n& Co., 314 N.C. 267, 275, 333 S.E.2d 236, 241 (1985)  (“[S]ecurities transactions are \nbeyond the scope of [section] 75-1.1.”); Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. \n52, 62, 554 S.E.2d 840, 848 (2001) (holding that loan agreements and other capital -\nraising devices are not “in or affecting commerce” for purposes of chapter 75); Latigo \nInvs. II, LLC v. Waddell & Reed Fin., Inc., No. 06 CVS 18666, 2007 NCBC LEXIS 17, \nat *49 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 8, 2007) (Diaz, J.) (holding that chapter 75 did not apply \nwhere “the undisputed purpose of the transaction [at issue] . . . was to raise capital”).  \nAccordingly, summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants on Plaintiffs’ section 75-1.1 claim. \n(5) Civil conspiracy \n223. North Carolina does not recognize an independent cause of action for \ncivil conspiracy.  See Shope v. Boyer, 268 N.C. 401, 404–05, 150 S.E.2d 771, 773 –74 \n(1966).  Plaintiffs cannot properly “use the same alleged acts to form both the basis \nof a claim  for conspiracy to commit certain torts and the basis of claims for those \ntorts.”  Jones v. City of Greensboro, 51 N.C. App. 571, 584, 277 S.E.2d 562, 571 (1981), \noverruled on other grounds  by Fowler v. Valencourt , 334 N.C. 345, 435 S.E.2d 530 \n \n \n(1993).  The Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ stand-alone claim for civil conspiracy to \nviolate the Securities Act should be DISMISSED. \n(6) Punitive damages \n224. Plaintiffs claim that the Grubb & Ellis Defendants are liable for punitive \ndamages because their “tortious conduct  . . . involved fraud and willful or wanton \nconduct.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 271.)   \n225. Section 78A-56(j) of the Securities Act allows for the recovery of punitive \ndamages if the proof requirements of chapter 1D are met, meaning that Plaintiffs \nmust prove by clear and convincing evidence that the facts leading to liability were \naccompanied by an aggravating factor.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 1D-15(a), (b) (2015). \n226. As an initial matter, because the Securities Act claims brought by the \nOut-of-State Plaintiffs have been dismissed, the Court likewise dismisses the \npunitive-damages claim brought by the Out-of-State Plaintiffs, because the claim is \npremised on an alleged violation of the Securities Act.  With some doubt  that the \nevidence will ultimately demonstrate the existence of an aggravating factor under \nsection 1D-15(a), the Court defers to the time of trial the determination whether the \nNorth Carolina Plaintiffs may proceed with their claim of punitive damages based on \nan alleged violation of the Securities Act.  \nI. Plaintiffs’ 54(b) Motion Is Denied as Moot. \n227. Plaintiffs ask the Court to modify the 2013 Order with respect to their \npunitive-damages claims against Highwoods and TLG.  See Highwoods, 2013 NCBC \n \n \nLEXIS 11, at  *66.  Having dismissed all claims against Highwoods and TLG, the \nCourt DENIES Plaintiffs’ 54(b) Motion as moot. \n \nVI. CONCLUSION \n228. For the reasons stated in this Order  & Opinion, the Court  holds and \norders as follows: \nA. The Highwoods Lawsuit \n1. Highwoods’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the issue whether \nPlaintiffs’ TIC interests constitute “securities” under the Securities Act \nis DENIED, and summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of Plaintiffs \non this issue. \n2. Highwoods’ 12(c) Motion is GRANTED. \n3. TLG’s 12(c) Motion is GRANTED. \n4. Highwoods’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, and claims \nagainst Highwoods are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \n5. TLG’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, and claims against \nTLG are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \n6. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Against Highwoods & \nTLG on the issue of liability under the Securities Act is DENIED. \n7. Plaintiffs’ 54(b) Motion is DENIED AS MOOT. \n8. These rulings  resolve all claims against all parties in the Highwoods \nLawsuit and therefore constitute a final judgment. \n \n \n \nB. The Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit \n1. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Against the Grubb & \nEllis Defendants on claims brought under the Securities Act is DENIED. \n2. The Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART as follows: \na) On the issue whether Plaintiffs released all claims against the \nGrubb & Ellis Defendants, the Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ request \nfor summary judgment is DENIED , and summary judgment is \nGRANTED for Plaintiffs. \nb) Summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of Grubb & Ellis Co ., \nand all claims against Grubb & Ellis Co. are DISMISSED WITH \nPREJUDICE. \nc) Summary judg ment is GRANTED in favor of NNN Realty \nAdvisors, and all claims against NNN Realty Advisors are \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nd) The Grubb & Ellis Defendants’ request for summary judgment on \nthe North Carolina Plaintiffs’ claim of primary liability under the \nSecurities Act is DENIED. \ne) Summary judgment is GRANTED in favor of the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants on Plaintiffs’ claims of breach of contract, breach of \nfiduciary duty, constructive fraud,  negligence, negligent \nmisrepresentation, civil conspiracy, and unfair and deceptive \n \n \ntrade practices under N.C. Gen. Stat. §  75-1.1, and those claims \nare DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \nf) Claims against the Grubb & Ellis Defendants based on the \nSecurities Act are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as to the \nfifty-five Out -of-State Plaintiffs.  The only remaining claims \nunder the Securities Act are th e claims  brought by the North \nCarolina Plaintiffs : NNN Durham Office Portfolio 13, LLC ; \nFannie B. Blackwelder ; NNN Durham Office Portfolio 32, LLC ; \nKenneth Deno McLamb; NNN Durham Office Portfolio 33, LLC ; \nand Cynthia McLamb. \ng) Summary judgment is GRANTED for the Grubb & Ellis \nDefendants on Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages under \nchapter 1D, and that claim is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  \nAny c laim for  punitive dam ages under the Securities Act \npursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §  78A-56(j) is preserved as to the \nNorth Carolina Plaintiffs, whose claim of primary liability under \nthe Securities Act survives summary judgment. \n3. The Court finds and concludes, pursuant to Rule 54( b), that final \njudgment shall be entered as to all claims dismissed  by this Order & \nOpinion in the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit , because there is no just reason \nfor delay.  To the contrary, all parties in the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit may \nbe prejudiced by a failure to enter final judgment as to the dismissed \n \n \nclaims, because the issues involving the North Carolina Plaintiffs ’ \nsurviving claims overlap with, and are inextricably interrelated to, \nclaims dismissed  by this Orde r & Opinion.  Further,  there are \ncontrolling issues of law common to the Highwoods Lawsuit, in which a \nfinal judgment is being entered, and the Grubb & Ellis Lawsuit. \n \n SO ORDERED, this the 29th day of December, 2016.   \n \n \n \n /s/ James L. Gale \n James L. Gale \n Chief Business Court Judge \n "
