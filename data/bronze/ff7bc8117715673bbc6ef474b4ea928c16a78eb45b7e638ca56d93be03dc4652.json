The cases originally involved two different sites owned by different\ndefendants and supplied by different refiners.\n  \nNot all of the plaintiffs have similar claims or damages.\n \nThey have been impacted in different ways.\n  \nThere are issues that affect some parties and do not affect\nothers.\n  \nFor those reasons, the Court will attempt to identify the undisputed facts and answer the questions\nthat it believes will be of importance to the parties, the public, and the appellate courts.\n \n \nHopf & \nHigley\n, P.A. by \nJames F.

is MTBE and why is it used in the refining of some gasoline?\nII.\n                 \nClean air v. clean water—what are the public policy concerns?\nIII.\n               \nHow does \nNorth Carolina\n address the problem created by leaking Underground Storage\nTanks (\nUSTs\n)?\nIV.\n              \nHow does \nNorth Carolina\n regulate drinking water purity?\nV.\n                 \nWhat is the factual history of well contamination in the Broad Creek Community?\nVI.\n              \nWhat is the factual history of the Ballard Site?\nVII.\n            \nWhat are the additional relevant facts?\nVIII.\n         \nWhat does the record demonstrate as to the involvement of the individual Ballard\nDefendants?\n \nLEGAL QUESTIONS\nI.\n                    \nAre refiners that sell gasoline containing MTBE free from liability when that gasoline is\nreleased from \nUSTs\n as a result of the negligence of others?\nA.\n           \nMay the proximate causation barrier be overcome by finding “\nforseeability\n”\nof negligent conduct by owner/operators of \nUSTs\n?\nB.\n            \nMay the proximate causation barrier be overcome by holding refiners\nstrictly liable for adding MTBE to gasoline?\nC.\n           \nMay the proximate causation barrier be overcome by applying the products\nliability statute?\n  \nIs summary judgment appropriate on the issue of whether\nselling gasoline containing MTBE constitutes negligent conduct?\nII.\n                 \nWhat statutes of limitations and repose apply in this case?\nA.\n           \nDo the statutes of repose apply to sales of gasoline containing MTBE?\nB.\n            \nWhat statutes of limitation apply when gasoline leaks from an UST: (a) as\nto the refiner selling the gas, and (b) as to the tank owner/operator\nresponsible for the leak?\nC.\n           \nIf the statutes of limitation and repose apply, have Plaintiffs raised an issue\nof fact with respect to the question of whether a leak occurred at the Ballard\nSite within a period not barred by the statute of limitations or the statute of\nrepose?\nIII.\n               \nWhich state regulated drinking water standards determine the basis for liability in\ncontamination cases, and what triggers any applicable statute of limitations in those cases?\nIV.\n              \nDo Plaintiffs have a claim that survives summary judgment as to any one of the Ballard\nDefendants?\nV.\n                 \nAre Defendants entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law with respect to the \nres\nipsa\n, fraud, nuisance, trespass, willful and wanton negligence, and OPHSCA claims?\n \nSUMMARY OF DECISIONS\n{5}\n             \nThe Court has concluded that:\n1)\n                  \nRefiners who do not own or control retail or wholesale locations are not responsible for\ninjuries resulting from actions of the owners of the \nUSTs\n located at those sites.\n  \nThe\nintervening negligence of tank owner/operators insulates refiners from liability.\n2)\n                  \nEven if refiners are not insulated from liability, the issue of whether or not refiners are\nnegligent in using MTBE as an oxygenate in gasoline would be an issue upon which neither\nside would be entitled to summary judgment.\n3)\n                  \nThe interrelationship between the level of contamination providing the basis for liability\nand the triggering of the running of the statute of limitations is critical.\n  \nIf the\ncontamination level giving rise to liability were poorly defined, for example by taste or\nodor, and the statute of limitations were to start to run when the poorly defined\ncontamination level is reached, well owners might not get the water tested and might not be\naware of a problem until after the statute of limitations has run.\n  \nIf the level is more\nprecisely defined, for example by the maximum allowable concentration levels as defined\nby state regulations, and confirmed by testing, the statute of limitations should not begin to\nrun until the higher levels are confirmed.\n \n4)\n                  \nThe maximum concentration levels for specific chemicals have been set in health\nstandards and thus should be reliable in protecting users of the well water.\n[1]\n  \nAs a\ncorollary, when a well owner ceases to use her well as a result of perceived contamination\nof any kind from a particular source, the statute of limitations should begin to run at that\npoint.\n5)\n                  \nIf Refiner Defendants were not insulated from liability, the ten-year and six-year statutes\nof repose would apply to product liability claims arising out of the sales of gasoline by the\nRefiner Defendants and begin to run when the refiners transfer title to the product to the\nretailer or wholesaler and bar any claims arising out of sales outside the repose period.\n6)\n                  \nThe ten-year and six-year statutes of repose apply to product liability claims against the\nBallard Defendants and began to run whenever there was a leak which resulted in\ncontamination of Plaintiffs’ wells and bar any claims for product liability arising from leaks\nor spills outside the repose period.\n7)\n                  \nThe three-year statute of limitations applies to the simple negligence claims against the\nBallard Defendants and begins to run when an injury occurs as defined below.\n8)\n                  \nThe three-year statute of limitations applies to the trespass and nuisance claims against the\nBallard Defendants and begins to run when an injury occurs as defined below.\n9)\n                  \nThe state regulations for ground water govern whether a well owner has a claim for\ncontamination.\n  \nA cause of action based upon contamination of well water by a specific\nchemical does not accrue until the well owner becomes aware that the concentration levels\nfor that specific chemical have exceeded state standards.\n  \nAccordingly the plaintiffs whose\nwells have been affected by contamination from MTBE or benzene above the state levels\nhave a cause of action which has accrued and which is maintainable if suit was filed within\nthe applicable statutes of limitation.\n  \nThose plaintiffs who were affected by wells which\nhave not evidenced contamination from MTBE or benzene above state levels do not have a\ncause of action which has yet accrued and those claims are subject to dismissal for that\nreason.\n  \nThose claims could be asserted later if the contamination levels exceed permissible\nlevels.\n \n10)\n              \nRefiner liability, if any, would be limited to those wells which, when tested, showed\nMTBE present at levels higher than 200 parts per billion (“ppb”), the maximum allowable\nconcentration as defined by state regulations.\n  \nThe Ballard Defendants’ liability may extend\nto wells with other contamination (i.e. benzene) in excess of state regulations.\n  \nThe specific\nguidelines for maximum allowable concentration levels for chemicals specified in the state\nregulations are chosen for their certainty and reliability.\n  \nThey provide a bright line test for\ncontamination based on science.\n  \nAt best, only three wells used by Plaintiffs have MTBE\ncontamination in excess of levels permitted by state regulations.\n11)\n              \nThere is insufficient evidence in this record to establish that the Refiner Defendants sold\nproduct containing MTBE to the Ballard Site within the three-, six-, or ten-year periods of\nlimitation and repose, which gasoline leaked or was spilled in a manner causing injury to\nPlaintiffs’ wells.\n \n12)\n              \nThere is sufficient evidence in this record to raise an issue of fact with respect to whether\nthere were leaks or spills on the Ballard Site which continue to cause contamination of\nsome wells in the Broad Creek Community, for which some, but not all, of the Ballard\nDefendants may be liable.\n  \nThe wells that may have been impacted are confined to the\nCentral District as defined herein.\n13)\n              \nAll defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the \nres \nips\na\n and fraud claims.\n14)\n              \nWith respect to the 1987 leak at the Ballard Site, the notice provided to Plaintiffs by\nDENR was in compliance with state regulations and was sufficient notice of the existence\nof a problem to start the statute of limitations running with respect to claims arising out of\nthat incident.\n  \nAccordingly, the statute of limitations has run on claims arising out of that\nleak except for claims associated with the failure of the responsible parties to remediate or\nfor continuing trespass and nuisance.\n \nPARTIES\n{6}\n             \nPlaintiffs are citizens and residents, or former citizens and residents, of the Broad Creek\nCommunity, located in \nNewport\n, \nCarteret County\n, \nNorth \nCarolina\n.\n  \nIt is a close-knit community.\n  \nAlthough\nthe claims are filed individually, Plaintiffs have pursued the litigation jointly.\n  \nEach plaintiff alleges\ncontamination of his or her well or water supply.\n  \nDifferent wells have different levels of contamination\nand different kinds of contamination, and different plaintiffs allegedly suffered different injuries.\n  \nSome\nplaintiffs have connected to other available water supplies.\n  \nSome have not.\n  \nAll claim to have been\nimpacted by the contamination of their water supply by fuel leaks from two sites.\n  \nSome plaintiffs have\nclaims for personal injury, and some are limited to property damage.\n  \nAttached hereto as Appendix A and\nincorporated herein is a schedule showing each plaintiff, the well(s) he or she used, the levels of MTBE\nfound in the well(s), and the levels of benzene found in the well(s).\n \n[2]\n{7}\n             \nDefendant A.J.

Clean Water\n{27}\n         \nThe use of MTBE as an oxygenate in reformulated gasoline has provoked a national debate.\n  \nAs a\nresult, the EPA appointed the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline (the “Blue Ribbon Panel”) in\n1998 to investigate the air quality benefits and water quality concerns associated with oxygenates in\ngasoline.\n  \nThe Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel provides a concise summary of the policy issues posed by\nthe inclusion of MTBE in gasoline products:\nThe Clean Air Act requires that RFG contain 2% oxygen, by weight.\n  \nOver 85% of\nRFG contains the oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and approximately 8%\ncontains ethanol - a domestic fuel-blending stock made from grain and potentially from\nrecycled biomass waste.\n  \nThere is disagreement about the precise role of oxygenates in\nattaining the RFG air quality benefits although there is evidence from the existing program\nthat increased use of oxygenates results in reduced carbon monoxide emissions, and it\nappears that additives contribute to reductions in aromatics in fuels and related air benefits.\n \nIt is possible to formulate gasoline without oxygenates that can attain similar air toxics\nreductions, but less certain that, given current federal RFG requirements, all fuel blends\ncreated without oxygenates could maintain the benefits provided today by oxygenated\nRFG.\nAt the same time, the use of MTBE in the program has resulted in growing\ndetections of MTBE in drinking water, with between 5% and 10% of drinking water\nsupplies in high oxygenate use areas showing at least detectable amounts of MTBE.\n  \nThe\ngreat majority of these detections to date have been well below levels of public health\nconcern, with approximately one percent rising to levels above 20 ppb.\n  \nDetections at lower\nlevels have, however, raised consumer taste and odor concerns that have caused water\nsuppliers to stop using some water supplies and to incur costs of treatment and\nremediation.\n   \nThe contaminated wells include private wells that are less well protected\nthan public drinking water supplies and not monitored for chemical contamination.\n  \nThere\nis also evidence of contamination of surface waters, particularly during summer boating\nseasons.\nThe major source of groundwater contamination appears to be releases from\nunderground gasoline storage systems (UST).\n  \nThese systems have been upgraded over the\nlast decade, likely resulting in reduced risk of leaks.\n  \nHowever, approximately 20% of the\nstorage systems have not yet been upgraded, and there continue to be reports of releases\nfrom some upgraded systems, due to inadequate design, installation, maintenance, and/or\noperation.\n  \nIn addition, many fuel storage systems (e.g. farms, small above-ground tanks)\nare not currently regulated by U.S. EPA.\n  \nBeyond groundwater contamination from UST\nsources, the other major sources of water contamination appear to be small and large\ngasoline spills to ground and surface waters, and recreational water craft - particularly those\nwith older motors - releasing unburned fuel to surface waters.\nBlue Ribbon Panel, Achieving Clean Air and Clean Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on\nOxygenates in Gasoline, at 1-2 (Sept. 15, 1999) (footnote omitted), \navailable at\nhttp://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/fuels/oxypanel/r99021.pdf.\n  \nThe Blue Ribbon Panel summarized its\nfindings as follows:\nBased on its review of the issues, the Panel made the following overall findings:\n·\n                    \nThe distribution, use, and combustion of gasoline poses risks to our\nenvironment and public health.\n \n·\n                    \nRFG provides considerable air quality improvements and benefits for\nmillions of US citizens.\n·\n                    \nThe use of MTBE has raised the issue of the effects of both MTBE alone\nand MTBE in gasoline.\n  \nThis panel was not constituted to perform an\nindependent comprehensive health assessment and has chosen to rely on\nrecent reports by a number of state, national, and international health\nagencies.\n  \nWhat seems clear, however, is that MTBE, due to its persistence\nand mobility in water, is more likely to contaminate ground and surface\nwater than the other components of gasoline.\n·\n                    \nMTBE has been found in a number of water supplies nationwide, primarily\ncausing consumer odor and taste concerns that have led water suppliers to\nreduce use of those supplies. Incidents of MTBE in drinking water supplies\nat levels well above EPA and state guidelines and standards have occurred,\nbut are rare.\n  \nThe Panel believes that the occurrence of MTBE in drinking\nwater supplies can and should be substantially reduced.\n·\n                    \nMTBE is currently an integral component of the \nU.S.\n gasoline supply both\nin terms of volume and octane.\n  \nAs such, changes in its use, with the\nattendant capital construction and infrastructure modifications, must be\nimplemented with sufficient time, certainty, and flexibility to maintain the\nstability of both the complex \nU. S.\n fuel supply system and gasoline prices.\nId\n.\n at 2-3.\n{28}\n         \nThe debate has not subsided or been resolved. During the last session of Congress, the entire\nenergy package of legislation was held up by a debate over the inclusion of a provision which would have\neliminated oil company liability for use of MTBE in reformulated gasoline.\n  \nS\nee \n151 Cong. Rec. H5772\n(daily ed. July 13, 2005) (debate on the motion offered by Congresswoman Capps to instruct the House\nmanagers not to agree to a provision limiting MTBE liability for refiners at the conference meeting on the\nEnergy Policy Act of 2005). That provision was ultimately eliminated from the legislation.\n  \nSee\n Energy\nPolicy Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-58 (2005).\n  \nHad it passed, the claims in this case against the\ndefendant oil companies would have been barred.\n{29}\n         \nNorth Carolina\n also considered an outright ban on gasoline containing MTBE.\n  \nThe General\nAssembly did pass legislation which bans the use of MTBE in gasoline in \nNorth Carolina\n beginning in\n2008.\n[4]\n  \nThe legislation also directs the Department of Natural Resources to investigate how \nNorth\nCarolina\n could ban the use of MTBE without impacting the state’s fuel supply and orders it to work with\nother states in the Southeast in doing so.\n  \nThe legislation provides in pertinent part:\nThe Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources and the Commissioner of Agriculture\nshall jointly study the feasibility and advantages of a coordinated regional approach for the\nphaseout\n of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as an additive to motor fuel in the southeast\nregion of the \nUnited States\n. The study shall consider the potential impacts on fuel supply\nand availability and the potential benefits and costs associated with the use of MTBE. In\nthe course of the study, the Secretary and the Commissioner shall consult with the\nfollowing:\n(1) Other southeastern states, including \nAlabama\n, \nGeorgia\n, \nKentucky\n, \nMississippi\n,\nSouth \nCarolina\n, \nTennessee\n, and \nVirginia\n.\n(2) Refiners, suppliers, distributors, transporters, and retailers of motor fuel and\nliquid fuel pipeline operators.\n(3) Consumer, environmental, and other public interest groups.\n(4) The United States Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant\ngovernmental agencies.\n2005 N.C. \nSess\n. Laws 93.\n{30}\n         \nIn summary, the public policy issues surrounding the use of MTBE are unresolved. The competing\nconcerns of clear air, clean water, and affordable fuel are extraordinarily difficult to reconcile; the data\nsurrounding the benefits and detriments of oxygenates is not clear; and the impact of changes in gasoline\ncomposition on fuel supply and costs remains uncertain. With gasoline prices skyrocketing above three\ndollars a gallon, affordable fuel is not an insignificant concern.\n  \nThe North Carolina General Assembly has\nelected to ban MTBE, but it has done so under a regime that permits its continued use for several years into\nthe future and recognizes the distribution problems created by the ban.\n  \nThe General Assembly has not\nenacted legislation creating liability for the use of MTBE as an oxygenate, nor has it amended the laws\nand regulations governing \nUSTs\n to impose liability on refiners for leaks from \nUSTs\n of gasoline containing\nMTBE.\n  \nWhile the State has adopted the future ban on MTBE in gasoline, it has not altered the regulations\ngoverning drinking water.\n  \nSee infra\n ¶¶ 38-41.\n  \nIt is against this public policy background that the legal\nissues in this case arise.\n \nIII.\n  \n     \nHow NC addresses the problem created by leaking underground storage tanks\n{31}\n         \nAs the implementing agency for the Federal Underground Storage Tank Program, as authorized by\n42 U.S.C. § 6991 \net seq\n., the Underground Storage Tank section of the Waste Management division of the\nNorth Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (“DENR”) regulates most\nunderground storage tanks in the state.\n  \nDENR is authorized to implement federal regulations on behalf of\nthe EPA under the Federal UST program, as promulgated under Part 280, Title 40, of the Code of Federal\nRegulations.\n \n{32}\n         \nIn the event of a spill causing a release of at least 25 gallons of petroleum into the environment\nsurrounding a tank or causing a sheen on nearby water, state regulations for reporting and cleanup are\ntriggered.\n  \nWithin 24 hours, the owner/operator of the UST system is required to contain and clean up any\nspill or overfill and report the incident to DENR.\n  \n15A NCAC 2N. 0604; 15A NCAC 2N. 0702.\n \n{33}\n         \nFollowing the initial response, the owner/operator is required to conduct initial abatement\nmeasures, which include taking corrective measures aimed at preventing further releases as well as\ncontaining the migration and remedying the hazards of released substances.\n  \n15A NCAC 2N .0703 (Jan.\n2002).\n  \nIt must also take further measurements to confirm the presence of a release to the environment and\ninvestigate the possible presence of free product.\n[5]\n  \nId.\n  \nThese initial abatement steps must be\nsummarized in a report submitted to DENR within 14 days of confirmation of the release, and a more\ndetailed report characterizing the site and providing more information on the release must be submitted\nwithin 45 days.\n  \n15A NCAC 2N .0703-.0704.\n \n{34}\n         \nWhenever free product is detected, the UST owner/operators must—“to the maximum extent\npracticable”—remove all free product and submit a free product removal report to DENR within 45 days\nof confirming the release.\n  \n15A NCAC 2N .0703-.0705.\n  \nIf there is evidence that groundwater wells have\nbeen affected or if free product is found to be in need of recovery, state and federal regulations require\nfurther investigation into the full extent of the effects of the spill on nearby groundwater.\n  \n15A NCAC 2N\n.0706.\n  \nA separate report detailing the results of that investigation must then be filed.\n  \nId.\n \n{35}\n         \nUltimately, DENR may require the owner/operator to compile a “corrective action plan,” which\nmay be approved only after DENR has determined that it will “adequately protect human health, safety,\nand the environment.”\n  \n15A NCAC 2N .0707 (adopting 40 CFR § 280.66 by reference).\n  \nThe\nowner/operator is responsible for implementing the plan as modified by DENR.\n  \nId.\n  \nWhenever nearby\ngroundwater quality has been degraded, the goal of any corrective action must be the “restoration to the\nlevel of the standards [as set out in N.C. Admin.

Report, at 51-\n52; \nCornette\n Rebuttal Exp. Report, at 7-8.)\n  \nAlso, Plaintiffs’ expert testified that lower volume releases in\nthe Broad Creek Community occurred from the use of gasoline as an accelerant in fires, lawnmower spills,\nand auto accidents.\n  \n(Dep. of Anthony Brown, at 255-56.)\n[8]\n \n \nVI.\n       \nFactual history of the Ballard Site\n{49}\n         \nPlaintiffs argue in their briefs that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that\ngasoline released from the \nUSTs\n at the Ballard Site caused their properties and drinking wells to become\ncontaminated.\n  \n(Plaintiffs’ Brief in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, at 2 (“Plaintiffs’\nBrief in Support”).)\n  \nThey cite to the following evidence.\n  \nIn April 1984 an Underground Storage Tank\nsystem, owned and operated by Ballard Tire & Oil Co, was installed at the Ballard Site.\n  \n(Plaintiffs’ Brief\nin Support, at 3.)\n  \nThree years later, in August of 1987, contamination in the form of petroleum\nhydrocarbons was discovered at the sight during routine tests by \nCarteret\n \nCounty\n health officials of water\nsupplied by a nearby groundwater well.\n  \n(Plaintiffs’ Brief in Support, at 4, 6-7.)\n  \nThat contamination was\nconfirmed in September 1987 when DENR, which investigated the reported contamination by digging a\nborehole \ndowngradient\n of the \nUSTs\n, detected a petroleum odor.\n  \nId.\n  \nNo evidence of contamination,\nhowever, was revealed by a similar borehole believed to be dug \nupgradient\n of the Ballard Site \nUSTs\n.\n  \n(Aff.\nof Rick Shiver, Ex.

remains that some plaintiffs alleged their wells were contaminated from the Fisher Site.\n{58}\n         \nFor purposes of the pending motions, the Court has accepted certain facts as undisputed or given\nPlaintiffs the benefit of facts alleged as required on a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.\n  \nSee\ninfra\n ¶¶ 60-62.\n  \nThe following appear to be the key facts which the Court believes are undisputed or which\nthe parties are entitled to have accepted as true at this stage:\n1)\n                  \nGasoline contains many contaminants, including benzene, toluene, and others.\n  \nThe\npresence of those contaminants at certain levels constitutes a hazard to health.\n2)\n                  \nMTBE is added to some gasoline as an oxygenate.\n  \nAt levels at or above 200 ppb it\nconstitutes a hazard to health.\n  \nMTBE is more soluble in water than other contaminants\ncontained in gasoline and therefore may migrate farther and faster than other contaminants.\n3)\n                  \nMTBE has a distinct and undesirable odor and taste.\n  \nIts presence in water is easily\ndetectable.\n4)\n                  \nMTBE is not used as an oxygenate in regular leaded gasoline.\n5)\n                  \nIn 1987 a leak occurred in an underground storage tank at the Ballard Site.\n  \nThe regular\nleaded gasoline which leaked from the tank on that occasion did not contain MTBE and\nthus could not be the source of MTBE contamination in the Broad Creek Community.\n  \nIt\ncould be the source of other contamination.\n6)\n                  \nAnother spill, which was discovered in November 1990 by Christopher Ballard, resulted\nfrom overflow during a delivery of gasoline to the Ballard Site.\n  \nOnly 5.6 gallons of\ngasoline was spilled.\n7)\n                  \nOf all the wells tested in the Broad Creek Community only three water supply wells\ncontain levels of MTBE in excess of the levels permitted by state regulation.\n  \nThose are\nwater supply wells 6, 8, and 11.\n  \nThose three wells also contained other contaminants found\nin gasoline, such as benzene, that rendered the water contaminated.\n  \nOther wells in the\ncommunity contained some MTBE but at levels permitted under state regulations.\n  \nSome\nwells showed negligible MTBE contamination but showed other contaminants from\ngasoline in excess of levels permitted under state regulations.\n8)\n                  \nWater Supply Wells 6, 8, and 11 were used by the following families, as delineated by the\nAffidavits filed by Plaintiffs on April

NCNB\n, 85 N.C. App. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).\n  \nIn doing so, the court\nmust treat the allegations in the complaint as true.\n  \nSee\n \nHyde v. Abbott Lab., Inc\n., 123 N.C. App. 572, 575,\n473 S.E.2d 680, 682 (1996).\n  \nThe court must construe the complaint liberally and must not dismiss the\ncomplaint unless it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any set of facts\nwhich could be proved in support of the claim.\n  \nId\n.\n   \nWhen considering a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), the\ncourt is not required to accept as true any conclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact in the\ncomplaint.\n  \nSutter v. Duke\n, 277 N.C. 94, 98, 176 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1970).\n  \nWhere the complaint fails to\nallege the substantive elements of some legally cognizable claim, or where it alleges facts which defeat\nany claim, that claim should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  \nSee Hudson Cole Dev. Corp. v. Beemer\n,\n132 N.C. App. 341, 511 S.E.2d 309 (1999).\n  \nWhen applying this standard, the court must keep in mind\nthat when fraud is alleged, the circumstances constituting fraud must be plead with particularity.\n  \nN.C.

Terry\n, 302 N.C. 71, 273 S.E.2d 674 (1981).\n{62}\n         \nIn deciding the motions for summary judgment the court has followed the guidelines set forth by\nour appellate courts. \n \nA Rule 56 motion for summary judgment should be granted if “the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law.”\n  \nN.C. R. \nCiv\n. P. 56(c).\n  \nA “genuine issue” is one that “can be proven by substantial evidence” and\na “material fact” is one that “would constitute or irrevocably establish any material element of a claim or a\ndefense.”\n  \nLowe v.

P. 56(c); Lowe, 305 N.C. at 369-70, 289 S.E.2d at 366.\n{63}\n         \nThe cases are in the unusual posture of having both motions to dismiss and summary judgment\nmotions pending for several reasons.\n  \nFirst, it appeared at one point that Congress would pass legislation\nrestricting suits against refiners for using MTBE.\n  \nThat legislation stalled and then was abandoned.\n \nSecond, while this court has concluded that there are some bases for granting the Rule 12(b)(6) motions,\nthere are novel questions of law which could result in some change in the law in the appellate courts.\n \nAccordingly, through its case management orders, the Court directed the parties to proceed with a phased\ndiscovery which would focus first on which plaintiffs had been impacted, how they had been impacted,\nand the source of any contamination.\n  \nDiscovery with respect to the medical records of plaintiffs and their\nindividual monetary claims was left for a later date on the premise that such discovery would be expensive\nand time consuming, resulting in waste if there were insurmountable legal barriers to liability.\n  \nIn\nretrospect, that phased discovery has been efficient and has put these cases in a posture where the appellate\ncourts can review them and, if there are issues to be tried, give the parties and the Court guidance on the\napplicable law to be used at trial.\n{64}\n         \nAlso pending are several procedural motions directed to the state of the record and the\nadmissibility of certain evidence.\n  \nThe Court will address those issues as they become pertinent to the\nsubstantive issues discussed below.\n \nANALYSIS\nI.\n \nINTERVENING NEGLIGENCE\n& REFINER LIABILITY\nA.\n{65}\n         \nThe first and perhaps least complex question raised by the pending motions is whether or not\nrefiners, who do not own or control a UST, may nonetheless be held liable for negligence if the UST\nowner causes a spill or leak resulting in contamination of underground water supplies.\n  \nThe Court believes\nthe answer is no.\n{66}\n         \nIt is an unavoidable fact that there would be no injury, no contamination of water, without the\nintervening negligence of a tank owner/operator (in this case the alleged negligence of the Ballard\nDefendants).\n  \nNo court of this state and no legislation enacted by the General Assembly has placed\nliability on refiners for leaks or spills at sites not controlled or owned by the refiners.\n  \nTo the contrary, this\nstate has enacted a very specific statutory scheme to deal with leaks from \nUSTs\n.\n  \nSee\n \nsupra\n ¶¶ 31-37.\n  \nThat\nscheme recognizes that the proximate cause of injury in the leaking UST situation is the negligence, if\nany, of the owner/operator of the tank. Put differently, proximate causation is attributed to the person or\nentity responsible for the discharge of the contaminant into the ground.\n{67}\n         \nGasoline contains contaminants which are hazardous to health if ingested.\n  \nMTBE is but one of\nthose contaminants.\n  \nIt is singled out in this litigation, as it has been in other cases, because it migrates\nfarther and faster than other chemicals in gasoline, thus permitting it to reach underground water supplies\nwith greater frequency than other chemicals.\n  \nOther chemicals migrate and pollute underground water, but\nthey are slower to move and not as soluble in water.\n  \nIf there is to be some litmus test which separates one\nharmful chemical component from another\n  \nthat standard should be determined by the appellate courts\nwhich to date have not created any such distinction.\n  \nNor can this court ascertain what the standard would\nbe that would lead to refiner liability in some cases involving leaks and not in others.\n  \nWhat is clear in this\ncase is that Plaintiffs’ wells all contained benzene at levels substantially higher than state regulations\npermit.\n  \nThis is not a case where MTBE has outrun other contaminants and contaminated wells not\naffected by other components of gasoline.\n{68}\n         \nEven if this were a case where MTBE outran other contaminants, a multitude of questions would\nstill have to be resolved in order to establish a standard for liability.\n  \nIs there a migration rate that would\ntrigger liability?\n  \nIf so, should not that be a part of the liability and clean-up scheme enacted by the\nlegislature?\n  \nWhere is the cutoff?\n  \nWhat would the law dictate be done where, as in this case, there are\nother contaminants present in the water supply?\n  \nHow would the cost of cleanup be assessed as between\nthe negligent owner/operator and the refiner?\n  \nWould the refiner be liable for the entire clean up including\nother contaminants, an outcome not heretofore existent?\n  \nWould the judicially created liability \nsupercede\nthe General Assembly’s statutory solution?\n  \nWhat if the cause of the spread of contamination is the failure\nto remediate?\n{69}\n         \nThe General Assembly could have exacted part of the cost of cleanup from refiners by adding to\nthe fuel tax.\n  \nIn fact, it might even have taxed fuel containing MTBE differently to cover the cost of\ncleanup.\n  \nIt elected to place the burden on the owner/operators who had control over the processes that\ncaused problems, \nie\n., those responsible for filling and maintaining the tanks.\n  \nThe logic of the statutory\nsystem is apparent.\n  \nIf refiners were to be held liable, owner/operators would have little incentive to\nproperly maintain and fill their tanks.\n  \nThe cost of any negligence would be passed on to the refiners who\nhad no control over the operation of hundreds of thousands of service stations and convenience stores.\n \nThat cost would undoubtedly be passed on to consumers.\n  \nThe system is designed to encourage those who\ncan prevent the leaks and spills to do so.\n  \nIt places direct responsibility on owner/operators.\n  \nThey are in\nthe best position to remediate their property.\n  \nBy its assessment against tank owners, the regulations\nattempt to spread the cost of unfunded cleanup among all tank owners.\n  \nSome of those costs undoubtedly\nget passed on to consumers in the form of higher gas prices.\n  \nBy implementing a future ban on the use of\nMTBE, the General Assembly chose a means other than extending liability for leaks to refiners to address\nthe problem.\n  \nIt has not changed the existing statutory scheme, which places liability for leaks on tank\nowner/operators; nor has DENR changed its water quality standards.\n{70}\n         \nThe statutory system is also in accord with the liability decisions of our appellate courts.\n  \nThat is\nnot surprising since both systems place liability on those with the most control over the problem of leaks\nand spills—tank owners.\n  \nThere are no \nNorth Carolina\n cases that have imposed liability on a manufacturer\nof a “defective product” arising out of a spill or release of the product by someone other than the\nmanufacturer.\n  \nPlaintiffs’ theory is novel and contrary to accepted definitions of proximate cause.\n  \nNorth\nCarolina\n courts have defined proximate cause as:\nthat cause, unbroken by any new or independent cause, which produces the result in\ncontinuous sequence and without which it would not have occurred, and one from which\nany man of ordinary prudence would have foreseen that such a result was probable under\nall of the facts then existing.\n  \nForeseeability\n is thus a requisite of proximate cause, which\nis, in turn, a requisite for actionable negligence.\nClodfelter v. Leonard\n, No. 05-890 (N.C. App. June 20, 2006) (quoting \nWilliams v. Smith\n, 68 N.C. App.\n71, 73, 314 S.E.2d 279, 280, cert. denied, 311 N.C. 769, 321 S.E.2d 158 (1984)).\n \n{71}\n         \nPlaintiffs seek to avoid the fundamental requirement of proximate causation by urging the court to\nadopt a theory of causation based upon a remarkably loose definition of \nforseeability\n.\n  \nUnder this theory,\nall refiners of gasoline would be liable for ground and ground water contamination because they have sold\na product that contaminates when leaked or spilled with knowledge that some \nUSTs\n are improperly\nmaintained by service station operators and that some operators would be careless and spill the gasoline.\n \nIt is undeniable that old and leaking \nUSTs\n pose a problem in this country and that gasoline will be\ncarelessly spilled at times.\n  \nHowever, Plaintiffs’ theory would open a Pandora’s box of litigation over the\nnegligence of others based on a mere scintilla of \nforseeability\n.\n  \nClearly, tank owner/operator negligence is\na foreseeable possibility, but that fact alone doesn’t mean that a refiner of ordinary prudence could foresee\nthat a given owner/operator’s negligence is \nprobable\n. A panel of the North Carolina Court of Appeals\nrecently reiterated the language of the North Carolina Supreme Court’s 1972 decision in \nMcNair v.\nBoyette\n, which\n  \nstated:\nIn searching for the proximate cause of an event, the question always is: Was there an\nunbroken connection between the wrongful act and the injury, a continuous operation?\n   \nDo\nthe facts constitute a continuous succession of events, so linked together as to make a\nnatural whole, or was there some new independent cause intervening between the wrong\nand the injury?\nId\n.\n (quoting \nMcNair v. \nBoyette\n, 282 N.C. 230, 192, 237-38 S.E.2d 457, 461-62 (1972)).\n  \nPlaintiffs have\nfailed to satisfy this test.\n  \nThe intervening negligence of the tank owner/operators served as a new\nindependent cause intervening which broke the sequence of event between the alleged wrong and the\ninjury alleged here.\n  \nTo hold refiners liable it must be found not only that the tank owner/operator’s\nintervening negligence was foreseeable but also that it was reasonably foreseeable that the tank\nowner/operators would fail to fulfill their statutory duty to remediate after a release.\n  \nA rule based upon\nPlaintiffs’ theory would put the providers of necessary but potentially harmful products at risks that could\nmake the products unaffordable.\n  \nThe \nNorth Carolina\n statutory scheme for cleanup recognizes that reality.\n \nTank owner/operator failure to remediate as required by statute is not foreseeable.\n  \nThe General Assembly\nhas elected a means to deal with the intervening negligence of UST owner/operators that does not impose\nliability on the manufacturers of the products that are contained in the tanks for the negligent release of\nthose products or the subsequent failure to remediate.\nB.\n{72}\n         \nIn essence, Plaintiffs ask the Court to adopt strict liability in tort for a certain product; in this case\nnot gasoline generally, but only gasoline containing MTBE.\n  \nTo date, our courts have adopted strict\nliability only in blasting cases.\n  \nSee Woodson v. Rowland\n, 329 N.C. 330, 350-51, 407 S.E.2d 222, 234\n(1991).\n  \nThe reluctance to go further is indicative of the appellate courts’ deferral to the legislature in this\narea of public policy as well as a recognition that legislatures, rather than the courts, are better suited to\nbalance the competing interests and public policy issues surrounding such decisions.\n  \nThe cases to which\nPlaintiffs cite in support of a finding of liability against refiners are from \nCalifornia\n and \nNew \nYork\n—both\nstrict liability jurisdictions.\n  \nBoth of those jurisdictions have taken different legislative approaches from\nNorth \nCarolina\n.\n  \nNeither state has a statute of repose, and both recognize strict liability for defective\nproducts.\n  \nIt is also difficult to see that our appellate courts would take the extraordinary step of imposing\nstrict liability in a situation where the federal government has promoted and encouraged the use of MTBE\nfor the purpose of achieving cleaner air goals and where the General Assembly, in choosing to ban the use\nof MTBE, did so only at a future date.\n{73}\n         \nIn summary, Refiner Defendants are entitled to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) because the\nAmended Complaint establishes that those defendants did not proximately cause the injury to Plaintiffs\nand that there was some intervening negligence which was the proximate cause.\n  \nNorth Carolina\n law does\nnot recognize strict liability for use of MTBE nor does it impose liability on a manufacturer for the\nnegligence of a third-party tank owner. If that change is to occur, it should be done by the appellate courts\nor the legislature.\n \nC.\n{74}\n         \nThe Court next addresses Plaintiffs’ argument that this is really a products liability case and that\nthe Refiner Defendants are liable for placing a defective product on the market.\n  \nAdopting this theory\nwould require the Court to ignore proximate causation altogether.\n  \nThe alleged defect in the product\n(gasoline) is the inclusion of MTBE as a component.\n  \nIf plaintiffs could overcome the proximate causation\nbarrier, they would have to prove that the use of MTBE as a component in gasoline to meet mandated\nfederal standards was negligent.\n  \nRefiner Defendants contend that the issue is foreclosed by the\nCongressional mandate to refiners to use oxygenates to help reduce air pollution.\n  \nThe Court is not\nprepared to enter summary judgment for Refiner Defendants on that basis.\n  \nDiscovery is not complete on\nthat issue, and the Court does not believe that, short of a Congressional direction requiring use of MTBE\nas the sole source of oxygenates, there is an absolute defense to the negligence claim.\n  \nThere may well\nexist issues of best available technology to meet the government mandates, but this record is not developed\nsufficiently to decide those issues on summary judgment.\n  \nIt is clear that MTBE is more soluble in water\nand does migrate faster than other contaminants in gasoline.\n  \nThe appellate courts may decide that the\nCongressional mandates were sufficient to relieve the Refiner Defendants from liability for use of MTBE.\n \nCongress itself refused to do so.\n  \nSee\n Energy Policy Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-58 (2005); \nsee also\n 151\nCong. Rec. H5772 (daily ed. July 13, 2005) (debate on the motion offered by Congresswoman Capps to\ninstruct the House managers not to agree to a provision limiting MTBE liability for refiners at the\nconference meeting on the Energy Policy Act of 2005).\n  \nThe detriments of MTBE, upon which Plaintiffs\nrely, and the benefits of MTBE and government regulations, upon which the Refiner Defendants rely, are\nknown and not subject to dispute.\n  \nUltimately, the Court believes that the appellate courts will defer to the\nGeneral Assembly or Congress to make the complex balancing decisions that need to be made as public\npolicy in this area.\n  \nCertainly these cases do not present the clear cut case where MTBE has contaminated\nwells in the absence of other contaminants.\n  \nThe vast majority of the contamination in this case comes\nfrom benzene.\n  \nThe Court denies Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ motions for summary judgment to the extent\nthat they are based upon use of MTBE as a component of gasoline.\nII.\nSTATUTES OF LIMITATIONS & REPOSE\n{75}\n         \nIf the product liability statute were to apply and Plaintiffs survive summary judgment on the\nquestion of whether the Refiner Defendants were negligent in using MTBE, the Court’s work would not\nbe done.\n  \nThe Refiner Defendants assert that the applicable statutes of repose and statutes of limitation\nserve as a bar to all claims brought against them in this action.\n  \nThey have moved both to dismiss the\naction and for summary judgment.\n  \nThe Ballard Defendants have also asserted the statutes of limitation\nand repose in support of their motions with respect to certain of the causes of action asserted against them.\n \nThe Court notes at the outset that the statue of repose need not be pled as an affirmative defense.\n  \nAs the\nN.C. Court of Appeals has recently reiterated, the statute of repose is a “condition precedent to a party’s\nright to maintain a lawsuit.”\n  \nWhittaker v. Todd\n, __ N.C. App. __, 625 S.E.2d 860, 862 (2006) (quoting\nTipton & Young Construction Co. v. Blue Ridge Structure Co\n., 116 N.C. app. 115, 446 S.E.2d 603\n(1994)).\n \n{76}\n         \nPlaintiffs assert that even though this is a products liability case, the various statutes of repose and\nlimitation that normally apply in products liability cases are inapplicable because there has been no sale,\nuse, or consumption of the product causing the injury and thus the statutes have never begun to run.\n  \nSuch\na position is contrary to both the facts of this case and the rationale behind the statutes of repose and\nlimitation.\n{77}\n         \nIt is undisputed that the Refiner Defendants sold gasoline to the Ballard Site.\n  \nTitle changed hands,\nand the Refiner Defendants had no control over the gasoline once it left their facilities.\n  \nIt is equally clear\nthat the gasoline which is the subject of the claims has been consumed.\n  \nIt has leaked or spilled and cannot\nbe put back in the tank and sold.\n  \nIt was not sold to Plaintiffs.\n{78}\n         \nThe Court takes its direction on the application of the statutes of limitation and repose from the\nSupreme Court’s decision in \nWilson v. McLeod Oil Company\n.\n  \n327 N.C. 491, 398 S.E.2d 586 (1990).\n  \nThe\nfacts of that case are complex and will not be set out here.\n  \nThey are stated as clearly as they can be in\nJustice Frye’s opinion.\n  \nThis Court has gleaned several rules governing ground water contamination from\nthe \nWilson\n decision.\n  \nFirst, where a plaintiff landowner adduces proof of an ongoing contamination from a\nprior gasoline leak or spill there is no statute of limitations bar to instituting suit against the allegedly\nresponsible party for the ongoing contamination based upon trespass or nuisance; the plaintiff may only\nrecover damages, however, for the three years preceding the filing of the complaint where the plaintiff’s\nknowledge of the contamination is more than three years old at the time the complaint is filed.\n  \nId\n.\n at 511,\n398 S.E.2d at 596.\n  \nSecond, a plaintiff landowner must file suit within three years of learning of the\ncontamination on a claim for negligence, product liability, or strict liability under GS 143-275 \net seq\n.\n  \nId\n.\nat 511-12, 398 S.E.2d at 596.\n  \nThird, knowledge exists when well water has been tested and shows\ncontamination.\n  \nKnowledge does not exist where well water has been tested and the test results do not\nreveal contamination.\n  \nId\n.\n at 512, 398 S.E.2d at 596-97.\n  \nFourth, a plaintiff landowner must file suit within\nsix years of a leak or spill giving rise to new contamination in order to avoid the bar of the six-year statute\nof repose without regard to when knowledge of the contamination originated.\n  \nId\n.\n at 511-18, 398 S.E.2d at\n596-600.\n  \nFifth, in order to avoid the bar of the six-year statute of repose on a products liability claim\nagainst a refiner defendant, a plaintiff landowner must show both a sale of product by the refiner\ndefendant and a leak or spill of that product within the six years preceding the filing of the complaint\nwithout regard to when knowledge of the contamination originated.\n  \nId\n.\n  \nSixth, the ten year statute of\nrepose bars any products liability claim for a leak or spill occurring more than ten years prior to the filing\nof the complaint.\n  \nId\n.\n at 512-13, 398 S.E.2d at 597.\n \n{79}\n         \nThe Court will apply those principles to the claims in these actions based upon the Courts’ ruling\nbelow that a cause of action for contamination does not arise until the ground water contaminants exceed\nmaximum concentration levels under state regulations.\n  \nThe statute of limitations does not begin to run\nuntil the landowner is aware that contaminants are present in excess of those permissible levels.\nA.\nTEN-YEAR STATUTE OF REPOSE\n{80}\n         \nPlaintiffs’ claims arising out of acts occurring more than ten years prior to the filing of the\ncomplaints in this action are barred by the ten-year statute of repose.\n  \nUnder N.C.G.S. § 1-52(16), a cause\nof action for personal injury or property damage will not accrue unless certain conditions are met.\n \nNonetheless, the statute prohibits the plaintiff from bringing a cause of action more than ten years after\nthe last act or omission from which relief is sought.\n  \nThe provision states:\nUnless otherwise provided by statute, for personal injury or physical damage to\nclaimant’s property, the cause of action, except in causes of actions referred to in G.S.\n1-15(c), shall not accrue until bodily harm to the claimant or physical damage to his\nproperty becomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the\nclaimant, whichever event first occurs\n.\n  \nProvided that no cause of action shall accrue\nmore than 10 years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the\ncause of action.\nId.\n (emphasis added).\n{81}\n         \nTherefore, regardless of the date of accrual of injury, no cause of action may be allowed if “filed\nmore than 10 years after the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action.”\n \nWilson\n v. McLeod Oil Co.\n, 327 N.C. 491, 513, 398 S.E.2d 586, 597 (1990).\n  \nStatutes of repose “set a fixed\nlimit after the time of the product's manufacture, sale, or delivery beyond which a plaintiff's claim will not\nbe recognized.”\n  \nBoudreau v. Baughman\n, 322 N.C. 331, 340, 368 S.E.2d 849, 856 (1988).\n{82}\n         \nPlaintiffs’ original product liability claims are based on a gasoline release from an UST at the\nBallard Site that was discovered on October 30, 1987.\n  \n(\nCompl\n. ¶ 24.)\n  \nAfter noticing an inventory loss of\napproximately 1,000 to 1,500 gallons of gasoline at the Ballard Site, an excavation of the surrounding\ngrounds revealed a leaking flange gasket on the submersible pump.\n  \n(\nCompl\n. ¶ 24.)\n  \nIt is now clear from\nthe record on summary judgment that the tank which leaked did not contain gasoline with MTBE as a\ncomponent.\n  \nTherefore, there could be no liability on the part of the \nRefiner Defendants \nas to that leak.\n{83}\n         \nEven if there were a question as to the presence of MTBE in the tank which leaked in 1987,\nPlaintiffs’ claims against the Refiner Defendants would be barred by the statute of repose.\n  \nUnder\nN.C.G.S. § 1-52(16), “no cause of action shall accrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of\nthe defendant giving rise to the cause of action.”\n  \nIn \nWilson\n, an oil company that supplied gasoline to two\nsites was sued for claims involving the release of gasoline from \nUSTs\n located on the two sites.\n  \nThe oil\ncompany stopped supplying gasoline to the first site on April 5, 1974.\n  \nWilson\n, 327 N.C.\n at 513, 398\nS.E.2d at 597.\n  \nThe oil company stopped supplying gasoline to the second site in March 1973.\n  \nId.\n  \nThe\nplaintiffs in \nWilson\n filed their complaint in July 1986.\n  \nId\n.\n  \nThe Supreme Court held, therefore, that the\nplaintiffs’ claims against the oil company were barred by the ten-year statute of repose.\n  \nThe Supreme\nCourt reasoned that the last act of the oil company “was its last delivery of gasoline” to each site.\n  \nId.\n at\n514, 398 S.E.2d at 598.\n \n{84}\n         \nSimilarly, here the last act or omission giving rise to a cause of action occurred on or before the\ndate of release, October 30, 1987.\n  \nThe last act by Refiner Defendants was the final delivery of gasoline to\nthe Ballard Site preceding the gasoline release, which must have occurred on or before October 30, 1987.\n \nPlaintiffs filed their action in \nAdams\n on November 8, 2001 against the Ballard Defendants and July 30,\n2004 against the Refiner Defendants, and in \nBarnett\n on October 10, 2003.\n  \nOver 16 years elapsed between\nthe last act which would have given rise to a claim against the Refiner Defendants and the filing of the\nclaim against them based on the 1987 leak.\n  \nAll of Plaintiffs’ original claims are based on effects or\nliability from the sale and release of gasoline in 1987.\n  \nTherefore, all of Plaintiffs’ original claims against\nthe Refiner Defendants are barred by the ten-year statute of repose.\n{85}\n         \nThe Ballard Defendants are in a different position than the Refiner Defendants with respect to the\nten-year statute of repose.\n  \nThe statutory scheme places the responsibility on the tank owner to remediate.\n \nSee supra\n ¶¶ 31-37.\n  \nFailure to do so may result in liability arising from the failure to remediate and not\nthe leak itself.\n  \nHere, there is evidence which might place the failure to remediate within both the ten-year\nand six-year statute of repose periods.\n  \nDENR assessed penalties against some defendants for failure to\nremediate as late as 1994, and the tank that leaked and the contaminated soil were not removed until\n2004.\n  \nSee supra\n ¶¶ 42-49.\n  \nIssues of fact exist which prevent summary judgment for either Plaintiffs or\nBallard Tire & Oil on the statutory claims.\n{86}\n         \nPlaintiffs argue that the Complaint need not plead compliance with the statutes of repose.\n  \n(Pl.’s\nResp\n. to Mot. to Dismiss at 45).\n  \nHowever, the Supreme Court has held that “[a] statute of limitation or\nrepose may be the basis of a 12(b)(6) dismissal if on its face the complaint reveals the claim is barred by\nthe statute.”\n  \nCage v. Colonial Bldg. Co., Inc.\n, 337 N.C. 682, 683, 448 S.E.2d 115,116 (1994).\n \n{87}\n         \nIn response to Defendants’ argument regarding the application of the ten-year statute of repose,\nPlaintiff argues only that the ten-year statute of repose should not apply because Defendants also move for\ndismissal based upon the six-year statute of repose in N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6).\n  \n(Pl.’s \nResp\n. to Mot. to Dismiss\nat 45, n.20.)\n  \nPlaintiff cites \nCage\n as precedent disallowing Defendants’ use of the ten-year statute of\nrepose.\n  \nHowever, in \nCage\n, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision which held that the\nsix-year statute of repose in N.C.G.S. § 1-50(5) did not apply.\n  \nAfter holding that the six-year statute of\nrepose did not apply, the Court of Appeals held that the ten-year statute of repose did not bar the plaintiff’s\nclaims.\n  \nThus, although the Supreme Court found that the six-year statute of repose applied and barred the\nplaintiff’s claims, the Supreme Court did not hold that a defendant is prohibited from seeking dismissal\nbased upon both the ten-year and six-year statutes of repose.\n  \nIn fact, in \nBoudreau v. Baughman\n, 86 N.C.\nApp. 165, 172, 356 S.E.2d 907, 911 (1987), \nrev’d\n on other grounds\n, 322 N.C. 331, 368 S.E.2d 849\n(1988), the Court of Appeals found that both N.C.G.S. § 1-52(16) and N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6) applied to\ndismiss the plaintiff’s complaint.\n{88}\n         \nTherefore, all of Plaintiffs’ original product liability claims against all defendants arising solely\nout of the 1987 leak are barred by the ten-year statute of repose set forth in N.C.G.S. § 1-52(16).\n  \nThe\n“last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action” occurred when the gasoline\nmanufacturers delivered the product to the Ballard Site and the Ballard Defendants committed whatever\nacts caused the leak, more than 16 years before the filing of this action.\n  \n“The public policy of this State is\nto protect \nNorth Carolina\n manufacturers and designers as well as the \nNorth Carolina\n courts from stale\nclaims based on injuries occurring long after the purchase of the allegedly defective product and long after\na defendant participated in its manufacture or design.”\n  \nId.\n  \nFurther discussion of the policy surrounding\nthe application of the statutes of repose to Plaintiffs’ claims are found below in paragraphs 93-94.\n  \nThe\nclaims against the Ballard Defendants that are dependant upon a failure to remediate are not necessarily\nbarred by the ten-year statute of repose.\nB.\nSIX-YEAR STATUTE OF REPOSE\n{89}\n         \nAdditionally, Refiner Defendants argue that all of Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the six-year\nstatute of repose.\n  \nUnder N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6), “[n]o action for the recovery of damages for personal injury,\ndeath, or damage to property based upon or arising out of any alleged defect or any failure in relation to a\nproduct shall be brought more than six years after the date of initial purchase for use or consumption.”\n \n{90}\n         \nPlaintiffs’ first and second claims allege negligence and a failure to warn under N.C.G.S. Chapter\n§ 99B—\nNorth Carolina\n’s product liability statute.\n  \nPlaintiffs allege that Refiner Defendants negligently\nproduced, manufactured, and sold gasoline containing MTBE to First Stop and subsequently failed to warn\nPlaintiffs of the alleged risk of water contamination through a release of gasoline containing MTBE.\n  \nAs\nproduct liability claims, Plaintiff’s negligence and failure to warn claims fall under N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6).\n{91}\n         \nPlaintiffs’ remaining claims for gross negligence, unfair and deceptive trade practices, conspiracy,\nfraud, and public nuisance all derive from the product liability claims and are hence subject to the six-year\nstatute of repose of N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6).\n  \nUnder North Carolina law, claims based upon or arising out of an\nalleged defect or product failure will fall under the six-year statute of repose of N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6).\n  \nSee\nColony Hill Condo.

Long Mfg. Co., Inc.\n, 314 N.C. 44, 332\nS.E.2d 67 (1985) (holding that the statute of repose began to run when farmer bought tobacco harvester\nfrom dealer-distributor, rather than when dealer-distributor bought from manufacturer); \nChicopee, Inc. v.\nSims Metal Works, Inc.\n, 98 N.C. App. 423, 391 S.E.2d 211 (1990) (holding that the statute of repose\nbegan to run when plaintiff textile manufacturer bought from dealer-distributor, rather than when dealer-\ndistributor bought from manufacturer).\n  \nConsequently, Plaintiffs contend that the statute of repose of\nN.C.G.S. § 1-50(6) can never be triggered in this case.\n \n{93}\n         \nPlaintiffs’ suggested outcome is untenable in light of the policy and rationale behind N.C.G.S. § 1-\n50(6).\n  \nThe Supreme Court of North Carolina noted that “the obvious intent of the legislature . . . was to\nlimit . . . manufacturers’[] liability after a certain period of years had elapsed from the date of initial\npurchase for use or consumption.”\n  \nTetterton\n v. Long Mfg. Co.\n, 314 N.C. 44, 56, 332 S.E.2d 67, 74\n(1985).\n  \nThe Court of Appeals found that N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6) “is intended to be a substantive definition of\nrights which sets a fixed limit after the time of the product’s manufacture beyond which the seller will not\nbe held liable.\n  \nDavidson v. \nVolkswagenwerk\n,\n 78 N.C. App. 193,195, 336 S.E.2d 714, 716 (1985).\n  \nThe\nCourt of Appeals further described the six-year statute of repose by reasoning that “the public policy of\nthis State is to protect North Carolina manufacturers and designers as well as the North Carolina courts\nfrom stale claims based on injuries occurring long after the purchase of an allegedly defective product and\nlong after a defendant participated in its manufacture or design.”\n  \nBoudreau v.

Supp. 623 (W.D.N.C. 1990).\n{94}\n         \nIn more recent cases, the Court of Appeals has helped further distinguish when the statute of\nrepose of N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6) begins to run.\n  \nIn \nCacha\n v. \nMontaco\n, Inc.\n, 147 N.C. App. 21, 554 S.E.2d 388\n(2001), the plaintiff homebuyers’ claims against a synthetic stucco (EIFS) manufacturer were barred by\nthe six-year statute of repose.\n  \nThe plaintiff homebuyers argued that the statute of repose should begin to\nrun at the time of the purchase of the house.\n  \nIn rejecting the plaintiffs’ argument, the Court of Appeals\nheld that the statute of repose began to run when the EIFS was purchased by the subcontractor.\n  \nThe Court\nof Appeals reasoned that the EIFS was first purchased for use or consumption by the subcontractor who\napplied the product.\n  \nMoreover, the Court of Appeals reasoned that once the subcontractor “applied the\nEIFS, it was ‘consumed,’ that is, utilized in the construction process, which use resulted in its\ntransformation, and the destruction of its original form.\n  \nAt that point, the EIFS could not be returned to its\noriginal consistency and could not be deployed in the construction of another house.”\n  \nId.\n at 26, 554\nS.E.2d at 392 (citations omitted).\n[11]\n \n{95}\n         \nPlaintiffs contend that \nCacha\n should be applied to the present case such that the “initial purchase\nfor use or consumption” would be “when a consumer at a retail outlet purchases gasoline.”\n  \n(Pl.’s \nResp\n.\nMot. Dismiss at 49.)\n  \nPlaintiffs assert that because there was never a purchase of the gasoline by a\nconsumer at a retail outlet, the statute of repose has not begun to run.\n  \n(Pl.’s \nResp\n. Mot. Dismiss at 50.)\n \n{96}\n         \nPlaintiffs’ interpretation of \nCacha\n does not rationally relate to the present facts.\n  \nThe released\ngasoline could never have been purchased at a retail outlet. \n \nThe reasoning of the Court of Appeals in\nCacha\n supports finding that the six-year statute bars Plaintiffs’ claims.\n  \nThe \nCacha\n Court\n found that the\ntransformation or destruction of the product’s original form constituted the moment in time in which the\nproduct was consumed for purposes of N.C.G.S. § 1-50(6).\n  \n147 N.C. App. at 26, 554 S.E.2d at 392.\n \nHere, the release of the gasoline caused the transformation or destruction of the gasoline’s original form.\n \nAfter the release, the gasoline could no longer be sold in the form in which it was delivered by the Refiner\nDefendants to the Ballard Site.\n  \nTherefore, applying the reasoning in \nCacha\n, the last act or omission on\nwhich a cause of action could be based must be the release of gasoline from the Ballard Site.\n  \nThus, the\nsix-year statute of repose bars Plaintiff’s original claims against the Refiner Defendants, which were\nbrought more than 16 years after the release of gasoline in 1987.\nEstoppel\n.\n{97}\n         \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants should be barred from asserting the statute of repose under the\ndoctrine of equitable \nestoppel\n because of Defendants’ alleged fraudulent behavior and concealment with\nrespect to the dangers and hazards of MTBE.\n  \n(Pl.’s \nResp\n. Mot. Dismiss at 50-51.)\n  \nIn order to bar the\nassertion of the statute of repose to dismiss a claim, the complaint must sufficiently allege a claim for\nequitable \nestoppel\n on its face.\n  \nCacha\n, 147 N.C. App. at 28, 554 S.E.2d at 393.\n  \nTo sufficiently allege a\nclaim for equitable \nestoppel\n, a plaintiff must claim elements of “conduct amounting to a false\nrepresentation or concealment of material facts.”\n  \nBryant v. Adams\n, 116 N.C. App. 448, 460, 448 S.E.2d\n832, 838 (1994).\n  \nIn \nBryant\n, the Court of Appeals found that the plaintiff’s complaint contained the\nessential elements of a claim for equitable \nestoppel\n where the defendant’s discovery abuses delayed the\nfiling of a claim thereby subjecting the claim to dismissal by the statute of limitations or repose.\n  \nId.\n at\n460, 448 S.E.2d at 838.\n  \nIn the present case, the statute of repose began when the gasoline was released.\n \nThere is no allegation in the Complaint that Defendants concealed any material facts regarding the release\nof the gasoline.\n  \nTherefore, the doctrine of equitable \nestoppel\n does not prevent the statute of repose from\nbarring Plaintiff’s claims.\nLatent Diseases Exception\n{98}\n         \nPlaintiffs further argue that their claims are shielded from the six-year statute of repose by the\nlatent diseases exception.\n  \nSee Wilder v. \nAmatex\n Corp.\n, 314 N.C. 550, 336 S.E.2d 66 (1985).\n  \nIn \nWilder\n,\nthe Court held that the applicable statute of repose did not bar the plaintiff’s wrongful death claim for\nasbestosis, even though more than 10 years had passed from plaintiff’s last exposure to the defendant\nmanufacturer’s asbestos products.\n  \nId.\n at 551-52, 336 S.E.2d at 72-73.\n  \nHere, Plaintiffs have failed to\nsufficiently plead specific claims of actual latent diseases.\n  \nThus, the exception to the application of the\nsix-year statute of repose for latent diseases does not apply in this case.\nMinority Exception\n{99}\n         \nPlaintiffs argue that those plaintiffs who were minors at the alleged time of injury should have\ntheir claims tolled for statute of repose purposes until they reach majority or a guardian \nad \nlitem\n is\nappointed under N.C.G.S. § 1-17.\n  \n(Pl.’s \nResp\n. Mot. Dismiss at 51, n. 24)\n  \nHowever, the Court of Appeals\nin \nBryant\n clarified the effect of the statute:\nMoreover, G.S. § 1-17 does not completely eviscerate the statute of repose in the case of\nminors and others under disability.\n  \nIf a product is over six years old at the time of injury,\nwhich would be the time that the claim accrues, then the statute of repose operates as a total\nbar on that claim.\n  \nHowever, if a claim accrues before the six year statute of repose has\nexpired, G.S. § 1-17 simply operates to extend the time period within which a minor or\nother with disability may bring suit under Chapter 99B.\n  \nTherefore, claims \naccruing\n after\nsix years will still be barred.\n116 N.C. App. at 458, 448 S.E.2d at 837.\n  \nThus, the six-year statute of repose bars the claims of all minor\nplaintiffs unless they are claiming that they were injured within six years of the release alleged to have\ncaused their injury.\n  \nAny claims arising out of the 1987 leak would be barred..\n \nC.\nAPPLICATION OF THE STATUTES OF REPOSE\n{100}\n     \nThe application of the statutes of repose raise the most contentious issue in this case: Have\nPlaintiffs adequately pled or established factual proof of a leak or spill of MTBE containing gasoline from\nthe Ballard Site within the six- or ten-year period before a statutory bar?\n  \nWhen these cases were first filed\nPlaintiffs alleged that their injuries resulted from tank leaks at the Ballard Site in 1987 and the Fisher Site\nin 1997.\n  \nIt is well established that a large leak occurred at the Ballard Site in 1987. \n \nIt is now clear that\nthe leak did not involve gasoline containing MTBE.\n  \nAccordingly, there can be no claim against the\nRefiner Defendants arising out of the 1987 leak at the Ballard Site.\n  \nIt is incumbent upon Plaintiffs to\nestablish that there was a sale by Refiner Defendants of MTBE gasoline which leaked from the Ballard\nSite less than six years prior to the filing of the complaint against them in 2003.\n  \nThus, 1997 becomes the\ncritical year.\n{101}\n     \nThe Refiner Defendants sold gasoline products containing MTBE to the Ballard Site up until\nsometime in 2002. MTBE is present in some wells in the Broad Creek Community. The missing element\nof clear allegation and proof is the occurrence of a leak or release from the Ballard Site that caused the\ncontamination in the wells during the applicable period.\n{102}\n     \nPlaintiffs’ problems in that regard arise from the failure of their designated expert to render a valid\nopinion that such a leak occurred in 1997 or later. The designated expert, Mr. Brown, originally expressed\nsuch an opinion. However, on cross examination during his deposition he disavowed that opinion stating\nthat he could no longer give that opinion based upon the results of certain studies that had been brought to\nhis attention after his original opinion was formed.\n[12]\n  \nNor is there an allegation in the Amended\nComplaint of a specific incident post-1996 giving rise to a leak or spill.\n[13]\n  \nSimilarly, there is no factual\nevidence in the record of a specific leak or spill at the Ballard Site after 1996.\n  \nThere is no evidence of\nwhen, where, or how a leak or spill occurred after 1996.\n{103}\n     \nHaving lost their expert, Plaintiffs fall back upon three different approaches to establish the\nrequired leak within the safe harbor.\n  \nFirst, they seek to use expert opinions from other reports which were\nnot designated as expert opinions as required by the Case Management Order.\n  \nThose expert opinions\ninclude reports by DENR and consulting company Groundwater Management Associates (GMA), along\nwith affidavits filed by Rick Shiver and Steven Campbell.\n  \nDefendants have objected to the Court’s\nconsideration of those expert opinions and affidavits.\n  \nTheir objections are well founded and their motion\nto strike the other expert reports is granted to the extent those reports contain opinions which were not\ndisclosed as required by the Case Management Order. Defendants had no opportunity to challenge or test\nthose reports.\n  \nAs proven by the deposition of Mr. Brown, such opportunities are critical to the process.\n \nThis ruling is in line with a recent Court of Appeals opinion which affirmed Judge \nSpainhour’s\n decision to\nexclude evidence which was produced in a manner that was in violation of the court’s rules and orders\ngoverning discovery in that case.\n  \nIn re Pedestrian Walkway Failure\n, __ N.C. App. __, 618 S.E.2d 796\n(2005).\n  \nThere, the Court of Appeals noted:\n. . . the record is replete with information which reveals the importance of the deadlines in\neach of the pedestrian walkway cases and with admonitions by Judge \nSpainhour\n that the\nparties should strictly and completely comply with rules and orders governing discovery.\nOn the facts of this case, we are \nunpersuaded\n that Judge \nSpainhour\n was compelled to find\nthat there was good cause to permit Dr. \nBederka\n to testify, and we discern no abuse of\ndiscretion in the decision to exclude Dr. \nBederka's\n testimony.\nId.\n, __ N.C. App. at __, 618 S.E.2d at 804.\n{104}\n     \nThe Court also notes that DENR originally asserted that the 1987 leak was the source of MTBE\ncontamination, while it is now conceded that no MTBE-containing gasoline was involved in that leak.\n  \nTo\nthe extent the reports contain factual information as opposed to conclusions they will be considered by the\nCourt.\n  \nNone of the reports relied upon contain factual accounts of any spill or leak after 1996.\n  \nAt best,\nthey contain the bare expert conclusion that the contamination in the Broad Creek Community must have\ncome from the Ballard Site without any specificity as to when and how the contamination occurred.\n{105}\n     \nSecond, Plaintiffs assert that the Ballard Defendants are guilty of spoliation.\n[14]\n  \nThe Court notes\nat the outset that the spoliation claim is only asserted as to the Ballard Defendants and has no effect with\nrespect to the Refiner Defendants’ motions.\n  \nPlaintiffs conceded that point at oral argument.\n  \nIt is\nundisputed that sometime during 2004, after these lawsuits had been filed, some of the Ballard Defendants\ncaused the tank that was alleged to be the source of the 1987 leak to be removed and also removed a\nsubstantial amount of contaminated soil from the area around the tank.\n  \nPlaintiffs were not notified that the\ntank would be removed or the contaminated soil disposed of.\n  \nThe \nBallards\n did comply with state law by\nnotifying DENR of its proposed remedial action.\n  \nRepresentatives from DENR were present when the\ntank was removed and inspected it.\n  \nThe \nBallards\n also had their own expert present for the removal.\n \nRemediation of the site was one of the remedies sought by Plaintiffs in their claims against the \nBallards\n.\n \nThe \nBallards\n complied with state law and procedures in the removal process and were entitled to remediate\nthe site.\n  \nThe sole question is whether they were required to notify Plaintiffs of the remediation.\n \n{106}\n     \nNo specific discovery requests were pending.\n  \nNo orders were in place restricting the \nBallards\nfrom cleaning up the site.\n  \nThe tank and the contaminated soil, however, could have provided evidence\nrelevant to what had happened at the site.\n  \nIn fact, defendants had their expert there, and he has provided\nopinions based upon what he saw. \n \nWhile representatives from DENR were present, it appears that their\nparticipation in and recordation of the tank and soil removal was woefully inadequate.\n[15]\n  \nThe Court does\nnote that numerous monitoring wells had been placed on the Ballard Site after 1987 and that Plaintiffs\nhave had access to those records.\n   \nNonetheless, the Court is troubled by the removal and destruction of the\ntank and soil without giving Plaintiffs’ counsel the opportunity to inspect them before destruction.\n  \nThe\nCourt is unaware of any similar circumstance in the reported cases, and the government regulations all\naddress notice to the government.\n  \nPrivate plaintiffs should not have to rely on the government to do the\ninspection as this case so amply demonstrates.\n  \nOn the other hand, the Court is also troubled by the fact\nthat although Plaintiffs’ counsel knew within days of the removal of the tank and soil in 2004, no issue\nwas raised with the Court until the response to the motion for summary judgment in 2005 when spoliation\nwas asserted to defeat the summary judgment motion—this after Plaintiffs’ expert had failed to pinpoint a\nleak within the statute of repose period.\n  \nThe Court has concluded that, for purposes of this motion and\ntrial, the Court will give the standard spoliation charge and will let the jury consider the fact that the tanks\nand soil were removed without giving Plaintiffs an opportunity to inspect them.\n  \nThis is but one of the\nissues in this case with which the appellate courts may wrestle and come to a different conclusion.\n  \nIt is\narguable that by complying with state law the Ballard Defendants fulfilled any duty to Plaintiffs and thus\nno spoliation occurred.\n{107}\n     \nFinally, Plaintiffs rely on circumstantial evidence to prove that there was a leak from the Ballard\nSite within the statutes of limitation and repose which impacted their wells.\n  \nSince the Court has ruled that\nthe cause of action does not accrue until the damage is done by contaminating the well above state\nregulated levels, the issue of when the leak occurred as to the \nBallards\n is not as significant as it is with\nrespect to the Refiner Defendants.\n  \nThere need only be some evidence of a leak from the Ballard Site\nwhich could have reached the Plaintiffs in order to defeat summary judgment on some of the claims\nagainst the Ballard Defendants.\n  \nThere is sufficient circumstantial evidence in this record to do so.\nPlaintiffs have raised questions concerning the \nBallards\n’ maintenance of the tanks, the large amount of soil\ncontamination, the lack of other potential sources of contamination, their delay in remediation, and their\naction in removing the tank and soil, the sum of which are sufficient to raise an issue of fact with respect to\nthe source of contamination in Broad Creek.\n  \nSee\n \nWilson\n, 327 N.C. at 520, 398 S.E.2d at 602; \nJames v.\nClark\n, 119 N.C. App. 178, 454 S.E.2d 826 (1995).\n{108}\n     \nThe disparity between proof required to keep the Refiner Defendants in the case and that which\nkeeps the Ballard Defendants in the case seems at first appearance to be inconsistent. In a way it is.\n  \nThe\ndifference arises as a result of the nature of the claims asserted.\n  \nIf the only means of getting around the\ncausation problem for Plaintiffs is invoking the product liability statute, then the statutes of limitation and\nrepose become significant and impose on Plaintiffs the obligation to fit sale of the allegedly defective\nproduct within the timeframe not barred by the statutes.\n  \nThe statutes of repose clearly create a situation in\nwhich a cause of action can be barred before the injury occurs or becomes known.\n  \nThat is what happens\nin this instance.\n  \nIf the 1987 leak had contained MTBE that did not show up in wells until 2000, the statute\nof repose would still bar the product liability claims against the Refiner Defendants.\n  \nBecause the different\ncauses of action asserted against the Ballard Defendants that are not based on products liability do not\ncarry the bar created by the statute of repose, Plaintiffs do not have the same proof and pleading\nrequirements to sustain those causes of action.\n  \nIn summary, there is evidence that the Ballard Site was the\nsource of some contamination of some wells in the Broad Creek Community, but there is no specific\nevidence of a leak containing MTBE within the statutes of limitation and repose.\n  \nIf a cause of action for\nnegligent design against the Refiner Defendants does not accrue until contamination above permitted\nlevels, the statute of repose would be rendered meaningless.\n  \nSince there are claims against the Ballard\nDefendants based on causes of action other than products liability, Plaintiffs do not have to meet the same\nrequirements for specific evidence of the timing of a release.\n \n \nIII.\nNEGLIGENT CONTAMINATION:\nSTANDARD FOR LIABILITY\n{109}\n     \nAlso at issue is which state drinking water standards determine the standard for liability in\nnegligent contamination cases.\n  \nAs discussed above, the North Carolina Administrative Code sets\ngroundwater standards which represent the “maximum allowable . . . concentrations [of contaminants]\nwhich may be tolerated without causing a threat to human health or which would otherwise render the\ngroundwater unsuitable for its intended best usage.”\n  \n15A NCAC 02L .0202 (2006).\n  \nThe Eastern District\nof North Carolina, applying \nNorth Carolina\n law, looked at the issue of whether it was necessary for a\nplaintiff to demonstrate that contamination levels exceeded state water quality standards to make a prima\nfacie claim for negligent contamination.\n  \nIt determined that a plaintiff must establish contamination in\nviolation of \nNorth \nCarolina\n groundwater quality standards to survive a motion for summary judgment.\n \nBrooks v.

Supp. 448, 449 (E.D.N.C. 1996).\n  \nThe court\nexplained that “[t]he General Assembly has apparently determined that levels of contaminants which fall\nbelow the maximum allowable concentration do not pose a threat; rather, such levels pose an acceptable\nrisk.”\n  \nId\n.\n  \nIt therefore held that the maximum allowable concentration levels set by the General Assembly\nestablished the standard for liability in water contamination cases.\n \n{110}\n     \nAdditionally, this Court finds it significant that the statutory scheme requires remediation to\nachieve the minimum standards.\n  \nSee supra\n ¶ 38.\n  \nBy definition, concentration levels that do not reach the\nstandard set by \nNorth Carolina\n regulations do not create a threat to human health or render the\ngroundwater “unsuitable for its intended usage.”\n  \nTherefore, unless each Plaintiff can establish the\nexistence of concentrations of MTBE or other contaminants sufficient to violate the state groundwater\nquality standards, they do not have standing to pursue their claims at trial and their claims must be\ndismissed.\n{111}\n     \nThe maximum allowable concentration of MTBE in \nNorth Carolina\n \ngroundwaters\n is 200 ppb.\n  \n15A\nNCAC 02L .0202(g). \n \nWith three exceptions Plaintiffs’ have failed to demonstrate concentrations of\nMTBE in excess of that standard.\n \n{112}\n     \nPlaintiffs argue that the applicable threshold for contamination is the taste and odor threshold and\nthat it is irrelevant that the threshold for a specific chemical listed in the regulations is not met.\n  \nThe Court\nhas a number of problems with that approach.\n  \nFirst, with respect to the particular chemicals at issue here,\nthe state regulations have made a specific determination of the level of concentration that would render the\nwater unhealthy for use.\n  \nIn the case of benzene, that is an especially low threshold, and one that is\nexceeded by most of the wells in Broad Creek.\n  \nThe statute would make little sense if the taste and odor\nthreshold were to override the specific maximum allowable concentration levels.\n  \nIf that were the case\nwith specific chemicals, the state would set the level that created contamination at the taste and odor level\nwhere that level was less than the specific level designated.\n \n{113}\n     \nIn the case of MTBE, for example, that level would be set at 1.2 ppb according to Plaintiffs’\ntheory, because it is at that level that taste and odor are affected.\n  \nThere are many chemicals that are not\nspecified in the regulations that could affect taste and odor.\n  \nThe state has elected to set specific limits for\ncertain chemicals, and the taste and odor threshold is a catch-all to cover any chemicals that are not\nspecified.\n  \nUnder the canon\n \nlex\n \nspecialis\n \nderogat\n \nlegi\n \ngenerali\n,\n \nwhen interpreting statutes or regulations it\nis a general rule that where there are specific and general terms, the specific overrules the general.\n \nPiedmont \nPubl’g\n Co. v. City of Winston-Salem\n, 334 N.C. 595, 598, 434 S.E.2d 176, 177-178 (1993).\n \nApplying the principle here requires using the specific levels for MTBE and benzene.\n{114}\n     \nSecond, the specific maximum allowable concentration levels for MTBE and benzene form a\nbright line, objective, and easily determinable test.\n  \nTaste and odor are fuzzy and subjective tests, not\nreadily reducible to a clear determination.\n  \nThird, if taste and odor had been an acceptable test, the\nSupreme Court would have adopted it in \nWilson v. \nMcCleod\n Oil\n.\n  \nJustice Frye clearly opted for the\nspecific maximum allowable concentration levels in applying the statute of limitations, holding that even\nin the face of taste and odor problems, the statute did not begin to run until the testing showed a violation\nof state regulations.\n  \nWilson\n, 327 N.C. at 512, 398 S.E.2d at 596-97.\n  \nThe Court believes \nWilson\n to be\ncontrolling law on this issue.\n{115}\n     \nState authorities responsible for protecting the state’s water sources are in a better position than\ncourts to set and reset standards based on new scientific information and changing standards of health.\n \nThey have the expertise, and their guidelines present bright-line objective determinants where specific\nchemicals are involved rather than subjective and ambiguous tests such as taste and odor.\n \n{116}\n     \nThe use of taste and odor as a threshold might be appropriate in some other situations.\n  \nThe claims\nhere are based on specific chemicals being contained in the water, and the \nWilson\n decision makes it clear\nthat the statute of limitations does not begin to run until there exists a test showing contamination above\nthe maximum allowable concentration levels permitted by state regulation for those specific chemicals.\n  \nIf\ntaste and odor had been selected by the Supreme Court in \nWilson\n the claims would have been barred.\n  \nThe\nSupreme Court relied instead upon the validity of the state regulations.\n  \nThis Court should do the same.\n{117}\n     \nIt is clear from Appendix A that only three wells—WCW-6, -8 & -11—exceeded the maximum\nallowable concentration levels of MTBE, so only Plaintiffs using those three wells would have a claim\nbased upon MTBE contamination.\n  \nTherefore, only those families would have a claim against the Refiner\nDefendants if such claims were not otherwise barred.\n  \nThe families who have used those wells include: the\nMorton (\nVirginia\n) family, the Lewis family, the \nBeall\n family, the \nDefeo\n family, and Emma P. O’Neal.\n \nSee supra\n n. 10.\n \n{118}\n     \nAlmost all of Plaintiffs’ wells had benzene contamination above permitted levels.\n  \nTherefore,\nclaims exist for negligent contamination of those wells, but Refiner Defendants are not liable for those\nclaims.\n  \nIssues of fact remain to be decided as to whether any of the Ballard Defendants would be liable\nfor that contamination.\n  \nOnly those plaintiffs whose wells are in the Central District may proceed with\ntheir claims against the Ballard Defendants.\n{119}\n     \nAs a corollary, when a well owner ceases to use her well as a result of perceived contamination\nfrom a particular source, the statute of limitations should begin to run at that point.\n  \nThe \nBeall\n family\nconnected to the public water supply on October 2, 2000, a year before tests indicated contamination\nlevels in excess of state standards.\n  \n(\nAff\n. of Elizabeth \nBeall\n.)\n  \nThe Morton family connected to the public\nwater supply on November 3, 2000, a year before tests discovered contamination levels in excess of state\nstandards.\n  \n(\nAff\n. of Virginia Morton.)\n  \nQuestions of fact remain as to whether the \nBeall\n and Morton\nfamilies were damaged by contamination proximately caused by a release of gasoline from the Ballard\nSite.\n  \nThe Lewis family connected to the public water supply in January, 1992—eight years before tests\nindicated contamination levels in excess of state standards.\n  \n(\nAff\n. of Margaret Lewis.)\n  \nThe family\nmaintains that it continued using the well water for purposes other than for drinking until it learned of the\ncontamination.\n  \nId.\n  \nA question of fact remains as to whether that continued use was sufficient to give rise\nto a claim for damages.\n  \nThe \nDefeo\n family moved away from the Broad Creek Community several years\nbefore contamination was discovered.\n  \n(\nAff\n. of Jennifer \nDefeo\n.)\n  \nThe \nDefeo\n family thus has no standing to\nbring suit and therefore their claims for MTBE contamination should be dismissed along with all other\nPlaintiffs who were not connected to Water Supply Wells 6, 8, or 11.\n \nIV.\nCLAIMS REMAINING AGAINST\nINDIVIDUAL BALLARD DEFENDANTS\n{120}\n     \nAs noted above, A.J. Ballard, Jr. and Joyce Ballard conveyed ownership of the property at the\nBallard Site to Gary Allen Ballard and Joyce Ballard, in her capacity as Trustee for Albert Christopher\nBallard, in 1984.\n  \nSee supra\n ¶ 59.\n  \nThere is no evidence Joyce Ballard has had any dealings with the\nproperty in her individual capacity since that time.\n  \nTherefore, no claims remain against her.\n  \nThroughout\nthe relevant time-period, the property has been leased to Ballard Tire & Oil Co. \n \nThere is not sufficient\nevidence to indicate that Defendants Gary Allen Ballard, Albert Christopher Ballard, or Joyce Ballard in\nher capacity as Trustee, exercised sufficient control over the property for claims against them to remain.\nThere is at least some evidence A.J. Ballard, Jr. continued to exercise some control over the property.\n \nTherefore claims remain against A.J. Ballard, Jr. and Ballard Tire & Oil for those plaintiffs whose wells\nwere contaminated above the maximum allowable concentration levels as discussed above.\n  \nSee supra\n ¶¶\n109-119.\n \n \nV.\nOTHER REMAINING CLAIMS\n{121}\n     \nFinally, the Court must determine whether Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as a\nmatter of law with respect to Plaintiffs’ \nres \nipsa\n, fraud, nuisance and trespass, willful and wanton\nnegligence, and OPHSCA claims.\nRes \nipsa\n \nloquitor\n{122}\n     \nPlaintiffs have asserted a claim against the Ballard Defendants under the doctrine of \nres \nipsa\nloquitor\n.\n  \nThe doctrine of \nres \nipsa\n \nloquitor\n “permits negligence to be inferred from the physical cause of\nan accident, without the aid of circumstances pointing to the responsible human cause”\n  \nHarris v.

Ballard Jr. survive summary judgment, but only\nthose plaintiffs whose wells are in the Central District may proceed with their claims.\n  \nNuisance and\ntrespass claims against all other defendants are dismissed.\n  \nAs discussed above, in accordance with \nWilson\n,\nPlaintiffs may only recover for damages caused by any recurring trespass or an additional spill or release\nat the Ballard Site within three years of the filing of the complaint.\n  \nSee supra\n ¶ 78.\n  \nThat is because\nPlaintiffs had notice of the 1987 leak from DENR more than three years before filing their complaint.\nWillful & Wanton Negligence\n                 \n{127}\n     \nPlaintiffs have also filed a claim for willful and wanton negligence against the Ballard\nDefendants.\n  \nThose claims survive only to the extent they are based on the Ballard Defendants’ failure to\nremediate and only as to Defendant Ballard Tire & Oil and the estate of A.J. Ballard.\n  \nIn all other aspects,\nPlaintiffs’ willful and wanton negligence claims are dismissed.\nOPHSCA\n{128}\n     \nPlaintiffs claim that the Ballard Defendants are strictly liable under the Oil Pollution and\nHazardous Substances Control Act, N.C.G.S. § 143-215.93, \net seq\n. (“OPHSCA”).\n  \nThe OPHSCA holds\nstrictly liable “any person having control over oil or hazardous substances” for “damages from oil and\nhazardous substances that enter the waters of the State.”\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 143-215.93.\n  \nThe OPHSCA claims as\nto Defendants Ballard Tire & Oil and the estate of A.J. Ballard Jr. survive summary judgment, but only\nthose plaintiffs whose wells are in the Central District may proceed with their claims.\n  \nAll other claims\nunder the OPHSCA are dismissed.\n \nCONCLUSION\n{129}\n     \nIn summary, the Court has concluded that the Refiner Defendants are entitled to dismissal of the\nclaims against them on the grounds that: (1) refiners are not responsible for the intervening negligence of\ntank owners/operators; (2) the statutes of repose and limitation bar any claims arising out of the 1987 leak\nat the Ballard Site; (3) the 1987 leak at the Ballard Site did not involve gasoline with MTBE as a\ncomponent; and (4) there is no proof as to the Refiner Defendants that there was a leak at the Ballard Site\nafter 1996 that resulted in MTBE contamination of a plaintiff’s well from a refiner’s product. In addition,\nthere were only three wells which showed levels of contamination by MTBE in excess of permitted levels.\nPlaintiffs whose wells tested below 200 \nppm\n of MTBE do not have a claim for contamination against the\nRefiner Defendants.\n{130}\n     \nWith respect to the Ballard Defendants, the Court has concluded that there are genuine issues of\nmaterial fact which preclude summary judgment for Ballard Tire & Oil and the estate of A.J. Ballard on\nthe First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth and Tenth Causes of Action in the Second Amended\nComplaint.\n  \nThe Fourth Cause of Action is limited to willful and wanton negligence arising out of the\nalleged failure to remediate, and any claim for punitive damages would be limited to that claim.\n  \nThe\nSeventh and Eighth Causes of Action remain based upon the existence of either sufficient evidence to\nshow a renewing trespass and nuisance or a leak or spill at the Ballard Site within three years preceding\nthe filing of the Complaint.\n  \nThe Second, Sixth and Ninth Causes of Action are dismissed.\n  \nThe remaining\nclaims survive based on existing material issues of fact to be determined with respect to whether (1) there\nwas a leak or spill at the Ballard Site after 1996 that caused contamination of some plaintiffs’ wells and\n(2) whether or not there was a failure to remediate the 1987 spill that extended beyond three years prior to\nthe filing of the Complaint.\n  \nPlaintiffs will be required to prove that there was some incident at the Ballard\nSite other than the 1987 leak which contaminated their wells or that a failure to remediate the 1987 leak\nextending into the limitations period caused the contamination of their wells.\n{131}\n     \nThe Court has concluded that liability for well water contamination caused by chemicals\nspecifically addressed in state regulations is dependent upon the existence of levels of contamination in\nexcess of maximum allowable concentration levels for those chemicals under the regulations.\n{132}\n     \nThe Court has concluded that for all claims other than renewing trespass and nuisance, which may\nbe ongoing, the statute of limitations begins to run when there is actual notice, for example from the\npublished notice by DENR, or an actual test showing contamination at levels above those permitted by the\nstate.\n  \nIn any event, where there has been notice, Plaintiffs’ damage claims are limited to the three years\nprior to the filing of the complaint.\n{133}\n     \nThere is no strict liability under \nNorth Carolina\n law for using MTBE as a component in gasoline.\n{134}\n     \nThe critical issue thus becomes whether there was a leak or spill at the Ballard Site from 1997\nforward which impacted a plaintiff’s well water.\n  \nNowhere in the record is there a definitive unconditional\nexpert opinion that a leak or spill occurred at the Ballard Site at any time from 1996 forward.\n  \nNor is there\nany direct evidence that a leak or spill occurred.\n  \nThere is not even a specific allegation that some incident\noccurred at some point in time from 1996 forward that caused a problem.\n  \nThere are no reports to DENR\nof a leak or spill. The monitoring wells in place did not indicate additional or new contamination. It is\nclear that the 1987 spill could not have caused MTBE contamination.\n{135}\n     \nPlaintiffs rely on the fact that there is benzene and other contamination in their wells and that there\nis no other explanation or source for the contamination other than a problem at the Ballard Site.\n  \nThey rely\non the fact that contaminated soil was present when the UST was removed from the Ballard Site in 2004.\n \nThey also rely on evidence that Ballard Tire & Oil and A. J. Ballard, Jr. were not prompt or diligent in\nremediating\n problems at the site.\n  \nThere is evidence of technical violations of state regulations at the site.\n \nWhether or not there were other potential sources for the contamination is disputed. If the Court’s ruling\non spoliation is upheld on appeal, Plaintiffs will be entitled to a favorable charge on that basis.\n  \nExpert\ndiscovery is closed. Plaintiffs’ expert did not provide an opinion with respect to leaks after 1997 which\nwould get Plaintiffs to a jury.\n  \nHe retracted his earlier opinion, which he properly should have done if it\nwas incorrect or unsupportable based on the facts.\n  \nPlaintiffs must convince a jury based upon the factual\nevidence in the record that it is more likely than not that a leak occurred at the Ballard Site from 1997\nforward that contaminated some of the wells in the Broad Creek Community and, specifically, their own\nwells.\n                                                                                                                     \n{136}\n     \nBased upon the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED, that:\n            \n1) \n        \nPlaintiffs’ claims against the Refiner Defendants are dismissed with prejudice.\n2) \n        \nPlaintiffs’ claims against Joyce Ballard, individually and as Trustee, Albert Christopher\nBallard, and Gary Allen Ballard are dismissed with prejudice.\n            \n3)\n         \nThe Second, Sixth, and Ninth Causes of Action are dismissed with prejudice.\n4) \n        \nThe Fourth and Tenth Causes of Action are dismissed except as to the claims arising out of\nfailure to remediate.\n            \n5)\n         \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment is \nDENIED\n.\n6)\n         \nDefendants’ Motion to Exclude Expert Opinions not tendered in a timely manner as\nrequired by the Case Management Order is GRANTED in the Court’s discretion.\n7)\n         \nThe claims of those plaintiffs using wells in the Eastern and Western Districts are\ndismissed.\n \nThis, the 30th day of June, 2006.\n \nLINKS\n:\nAppendix \nA\nAppendix \nB\n \n \n[1]\n       \nThe reliability of testing presents another issue.\n  \nHowever, as the Supreme Court pointed out in \nWilson\n, the statute should\nnot run until there is an accurate test showing contamination.\n  \nWilson\n v.

Trials 1 § 103.\n[9]\n \n      \n \nIn the report, GMA noted that its opinions as to the likelihood that the Ballard Site is the source of the Broad Creek\ncontamination needed to be “better qualified and quantified.”\n  \nPlaintiffs did identify this report as an expert report upon which they\nwould rely—perhaps because of the qualifications.\n \n[10]\n The Morton family includes Plaintiffs Virginia Morton, Deanna \nEchtmann\n, Linda Barnett, \nSamantah\n Barnett, Chris Barnett,\nand Megan Willis.\n  \nThe Lewis family includes Plaintiffs Margaret Lewis, Albert Lewis, and \nChristel\n \nGeier\n.\n  \nThe \nBeall\n family\nincludes Plaintiffs Elizabeth \nBeall\n, \nNatahn\n Golden, and Amber \nEngleby\n.\n  \nThe \nDefeo\n family includes Plaintiffs Jennifer \nDefeo\n,\nFrederick \nDefeo\n, and David \nDefeo\n.\n[11]\n  \nAdditionally, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the “ultimate and intended use” of the EIFS was realized upon the\napplication of the material to the house exterior.\n  \nTherefore, when the EIFS was sold to the subcontractor who applied the material,\nthe statute of repose began to run.\n  \nThe ultimate and intended use of the gasoline was to be sold and used by consumers.\n  \nTherefore,\nthe statute of repose began to run when the product was sold to the First Stop proprietors who intended to sell the gasoline to\nconsumers.\n[12]\n \n    \nThe Court notes here that a specific schedule for disclosure of expert opinions had been set by the Court in order to avoid\nsurprise and shifting expert opinions. Plaintiffs were required by the Case Management Order to identify their experts and the\nexpert opinions upon which they would rely so that defendants could prepare and disclose to Plaintiffs any rebuttal expert opinions.\nThis phase of discovery was specifically intended to produce all the evidence, expert or otherwise, with respect to when and how\nPlaintiffs’ well water supplies had been impacted. \nSee\n Case Management Order (June 10, 2004).\n \n[13]\n \n     \nAccording to the Complaint and the evidence compiled by Plaintiffs thus far, the only alleged incidents involving the\nBallard Defendants giving rise to a leak or spill are the August 1987 release, which resulted from a leaking flange that was quickly\nrepaired, and the release of approximately 5.6 gallons of gasoline that was discovered by Chris Ballard in November 1990.\n  \nSee\nsupra\n at ¶¶ 42-49.\n  \n(\nCompl\n. ¶¶ 127-137.)\n  \nNo specific incidents subsequent to these have been alleged.\n \n \n[14]\n \n    \nRegardless of the outcome of the Court’s ruling on the Ballard Defendants motion \nin \nlimine\n, there are material issues of fact\nto be determined by a jury with respect to whether a leak at the Ballard Site is the cause of contamination of Plaintiffs’ wells,\nwhether the leak, if any, has caused a continuing trespass, and when a leak, if any, occurred.\n  \nNeither side is entitled to summary\njudgment on those issues.\n  \nSee supra\n ¶¶ 42-58 (setting out the parties’ respective positions and evidence).\n \n \n[15]\n The Court notes with some amazement that although DENR had a long running feud with Mr. Ballard and had taken the\npublic position that the Ballard Site was a source of well contamination and that there were monitoring wells on site, the DENR\nrepresentatives present apparently took no pictures or notes and prepared no report with respect to the tank removal or the soil\nconditions around the tank."
