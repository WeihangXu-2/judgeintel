  "raw_text": "SQL Sentry, LLC v. ApexSQL, LLC, 2017 NCBC 105. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 13392 \n \nSQL SENTRY, LLC d/b/a \nSENTRYONE, a Delaware limited \nliability company, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nAPEXSQL, LLC, a North Carolina \nlimited liability company, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION  \nON MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n \n1. Plaintiff SQL Sentry, L LC and Defendant ApexSQL, LLC are competing \nsoftware development companies.  SQL Sentry contends that ApexSQL recently \nreleased a software product that improperly incorporates design elements and code \nfrom SQL Sentry’s software. \n2. ApexSQL’s motion to dismiss is before the Court.  The only issue is whether \nthe complaint adequately states  a claim for conversion .  Having considered the \nparties’ filings and arguments, the Court GRANTS the motion. \nBray & Long, PLLC, by Jeffrey A. Long, for Plaintiff.  \n \nRayburn Cooper & Durham, P.A., by Ross R. Fulton, for Defendant.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion to dismiss under \nRule12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure . The following factual \nsummary is drawn from relevant allegations in the complaint. \n \n \n4. SQL Sentry is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place \nof business in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶  1, ECF No. 1.)  SQL \nSentry “develop[s] and distribut[es] software products for commercial use.”  (Compl. \n¶ 6.)   \n5. One of SQL Sentry’s most successful products is Plan Explorer™.  ( Compl. \n¶ 6.)  Plan Explorer enables users to make “resource intensive T-SQL (Transact-SQL) \nqueries” more efficiently “in the Microsoft® enterprise database platform, SQL \nServer.”  (Compl  ¶¶ 7 –8, 10.)  According to SQL Sentry , the “high quality and \nusefulness of the software” have led the Plan Explorer brand to thrive.  (Compl. ¶ 11; \nsee also Compl. ¶¶  8, 16.)  Today, Plan Explorer is “the industry’s premier query \ntuning tool,” and the Plan Explorer mark and the “distinct design components of the \nsoftware” are “recognized by customers throughout the world.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 11, 16.)   \n6. ApexSQL develops and distributes SQL Server software that competes with \nSQL Sentry and Plan Explorer.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 27–28.)  ApexSQL is a North Carolina \nlimited liability company with its principal place of business in Orange County, North \nCarolina.  (Compl. ¶¶ 2, 29.) \n7. In May 2017, SQL Sentry learned that ApexSQL “was marketing a new \nsoftware product, ApexSQL Plan, using the mark ‘Pla n Explorer.’”  (Compl. ¶  35.)  \nAfter a demand by SQL Sentry, Apex SQL “removed reference to the offensive ‘Plan \nExplorer’ mark.”   (Compl. ¶¶  35–40.)  SQL Sentry alleges that  ApexSQL Plan  \ncontinues to use other elements of SQL Sentry’s software, such as its “design \nelements,” “trade dress,” and “underlying code.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 35–36, 39–40.)   \n \n \n8. SQL Sentry filed this lawsuit on July 24, 2017, bringing claims for common-\nlaw trademark infringement, violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. §  75-1.1, and conversion.  \nApexSQL moved to dismiss SQL Sentry’s conversion claim on September 22, 2017.  \nThe motion has been fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing on November 11, \n2017.  This matter is ripe for determination. \nII. \nANALYSIS \n \n9. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency of the \ncomplaint.”  Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs Grp., Inc. , 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 \nS.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).  “Dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when \none of the following three conditions is satisfied: (1) when the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when the complaint on its face \nreveals the  absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; (3) when some fact \ndisclosed in the  complaint necessarily defeats plaintiff’s claim.”   Jackson v. \nBumgardner, 318 N.C.172, 175, 347 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1986).  \n10. In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must treat the well -pleaded \nallegations of the complaint as true and view the facts and permissible inferences “in \nthe light most favorable to” the non-moving party.  Ford v. Peaches Entm’t Corp., 83 \nN.C. App. 155, 156, 349 S.E.2d 82, 83 (1986); see also Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 98, \n176 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1970).   “[T]he court is not required to accept as true any \nconclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact.”  Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, \n147 N.C. App. 52, 56, 554 S.E.2d 840, 844 (2001). \n \n \n11. ApexSQL contends that SQL Sentry has failed to state a claim for \nconversion, which “is defined as an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right \nof ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration \nof their condition or the exclusion of an owner’s rights. ”  Spinks v. Taylor, 303 N.C. \n256, 264–65, 278 S.E.2d 501, 50 6 (1981) (internal quotation omitted).  “The essence \nof conversion is not the acquisition of property by the wrongdoer, but a wrongful \ndeprivation of it to the owner.”  Bartlett Milling Co. v. Walnut Grove Auction & Realty \nCo., 192 N.C. App. 74, 86, 665 S.E.2d 478, 488 (2008). \n12. SQL Sentry alleges that ApexSQL converted its Plan Explorer trademark \nand Plan Explorer software program , including the program’s design elements.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 61–62.)  ApexSQL counters that “a conversion claim cannot be brought \nfor intangible assets,” such as a trademark.  ( Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 3, \nECF No. 12 .)  It further argues that  there are no allegations “that ApexSQL has \ndenied Plaintiff access to its software program, design elements, or trade dress.”  \n(Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 3.)  The Court agrees with ApexSQL on both points. \n13. ApexSQL is correct that North Carolina does not recognize a claim for \nconversion of intangible interests, such as trademarks.  See Strategic Mgmt. \nDecisions, LLC v. Sales Performance Int’l, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *6 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Aug. 7, 2017); HCW Ret. & Fin. Servs., LLC v. HCW Emp. Benefit Servs., \nLLC, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *57 –58 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 14, 2015) (dismissing \nconversion claim as to trademark rights).  Conversion is limited to “goods or personal \nchattels.”  Spinks, 303 N.C. at 264–65, 278 S.E.2d at 506.  As a result, SQL Sentry’s \n \n \nallegations regarding its trademark and trade dress rights cannot support a claim for \nconversion. \n14. On the other hand, electronically stored information may qualify as personal \nproperty subject to a claim for conversion.  The Court analyzed this issue extensively \nin Addison Whitney, LLC v. Cashion, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 51, at *15–20 (N.C. Super. \nCt. June 9, 2017). \n15. It is a reality of modern life that electronically stored information is “easy to \ncopy” but “hard to destroy.”  Id. at *16, 17.  This is significant because “the essence of \na conversion claim is deprivation to the owner.”  Id. at *18 (citing cases).  Numerous \ndecisions of  this Court  have held that  “making a copy of electronically -stored \ninformation which does not deprive the plaintiff of possession or use of information, \ndoes not support a claim for conversion.”   RCJJ, LLC v. RCWIL Enters., LLC , 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 46, at *53 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 20, 2016); accord New Friendship Used \nClothing Collection, LLC v. Katz , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *37 –40 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nAug. 18, 2017);  Strategic Mgmt. Decisions , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *6; Addison \nWhitney, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 51, at *17. \n16. Here, SQL Sentry does not allege that ApexSQL has deprived it of use of the \nPlan Explorer software.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 19, 22.)  Instead, SQL Sentry alleges that \nApexSQL “blatantly copied design elements ,” “trade dress,” and “underlying code.”  \n(Compl. ¶ 40.)  These allegations of copying, without more, are insufficient to state a \nclaim for conversion of SQL Sentry’s software or other electronically stored \ninformation.  See, e.g., New Friendship, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *37 –40 (granting \n \n \nmotion to dismiss); Strategic Mgmt. Decisions, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *7–8 (same); \nAddison Whitney, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 51, at *17  (same); RCJJ, 2016 NCBC LEXIS \n46, at *53  (same); RoundPoint Mortg. Co. v. Florez , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *55  \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 18, 2016) (same); Horner Int’l Co. v. McKoy, 2014 NCBC LEXIS \n68, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 18, 2014) (same).   \n17. SQL Sentry cites federal district court decisions for the proposition that \ncopying proprietary software may constitute conversion where it denies the plaintiff \n“its sole ownership rights to its proprietary information.”  (Mem. in Opp’n to Def .’s \nMot. to Dismiss 5, ECF No. 14.)  As in Addison Whitney, the Court continues to adhere \nto the reasoning of RCJJ and related decisions , all of which have held that , under \nNorth Carolina law, allegations of mere copying of electronically stored information \nare insufficient to state a claim for conversion .  “In the absence of further guidance \nfrom the North Carolina Supreme Court or Court of Appeals, the Court declines to \nconstrue the law of conversion more broadly.”  Addison Whitney, 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n51, at *18; see also New Friendship, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *39. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n \n18. The Court GRANTS ApexSQL’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion and DISMISSES \nSQL Sentry’s claim for conversion with prejudice.    \n \n  \n \n \nThis the 20th day of November, 2017. \n /s/ Adam M.
