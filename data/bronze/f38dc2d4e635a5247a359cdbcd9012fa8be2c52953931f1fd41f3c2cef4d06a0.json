Segars, for Plaintiff Emrich Enterprises, LLC.  \n \nMoore & Van Allen PLLC by Mark A. Nebrig and Kaitlin Price, for \nDefendant Hornwood, Inc. and Defendant and Nominal Defendant \nTriangle Automotive Components, LLC.  \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n3. Plaintiff Emrich Enterprises, LLC (“ Emrich”) and Defendant Hornwood, \nInc. (“Hornwood”)  are the only members of Defendant Triangle Automotive, LLC \n(“Triangle”).  Emrich brings this action, at least in part, as a derivative suit based on \nHornwood’s alleged breach of Triangle’s governing documents and of Hornwood’s  \nfiduciary duties owed directly to Emrich and derivatively to Triangle.  \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not  make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  “[T]o provide context for its ruling, the Court may state either \nthose facts that it believes are not in material dispute or those facts on which a \nmaterial dispute forecloses summary adjudication.”  Ehmann v. Medflow, Inc., 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 88, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017). \nA. Formation of Triangle  \n5. Emrich is a North Carolina limited liability company  and is the minority \nmember of Triangle.2  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 16, ECF No. 147.17 [“Defs.’ \nEx. 16”]; Second Am. Compl. ¶ 14.)  \n \n2 Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint is verified and therefore was received and treated by \nthe Court as an affidavit.  Page v. Sloan, 281 N.C. 697, 705 (1972) (“A verified complaint may \nbe treated as an affidavit if it (1) is made on personal knowledge, (2) sets forth such facts as \n \n \n6. Hornwood is a North Carolina corporation  and is the majority member of \nTriangle.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 16.)  As members of Triangle, Emrich and Hornwood \nare also managers of Triangle for all purposes.  (Second Am. Compl. Ex. 1, § 3.1, ECF \nNo. 116.1 [“Op. Agreement”].) \n7. Triangle, originally founded in 2006 by Emrich, Hornwood, and non -party \nBondtex, Inc. (“Bondtex”), is a North Carolina limited liability company that supplies \nheadliner fabric to automobile companies.  (Op. Agreement 1, Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n15, 23 –25.)  When Triangle was founded, its three members focused on pursuing \nbusiness opportunities  that involved  supplying automotive headliner fabrics .  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 21.) \n8. Bondtex eventually withdrew from Triangle in 2018.  ( See Second Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 43, 45, 50.) \n9. On 28 February 200 6, Emrich, Hornwood, and Bondtex  entered into an \noperating agreement to govern Triangle’s operations (the “Operating Agreement”).  \n(See Op. Agreement.) \n10. Section 4.4 of the Operating Agreement provides  that “[n]o Member may \nengage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or \ndescription, independently or with others, which are competitive with the activities \nof [Triangle], without first offering an interest in such activities to [Triangle] and \neach other Member.”  (Op. Agreement § 4.4.) \n11. Section 8.1 of the Operating Agreements reads as follows:  \n \nwould be admissible in evidence, and (3) shows affirmatively that the affiant is competent to \ntestify to the matters stated therein.”).  \n \n \nRestrictions on Transfer.  Without the prior written consent of a Majority \nin Interest of the Disinterested Members (which consent may be given \nor withheld in their sole discretion) . . . no Member may voluntari ly or \ninvoluntarily Transfer, or create or suffer to exist any Encumbrance \nagainst, all or any part of such Member’s record or beneficial interest in \nthe Company. \n \n(Op. Agreement § 8.1 (emphasis in original).)  Section 2 of the Operating Agreement \ndefines “Transfer” as to “sell, assign, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of property, \nincluding without limitation, an interest in the Company.”  (Op. Agreement § 2.)  \n12. The Operating Agreement further provides that all decisions with respect \nto the management of the business and affairs of Triangle shall be made by action of \na majority interest of the members.  (Op. Agreement § 3.1.)  The Operating Agreement \ndoes not address, either to create or disclaim, fiduciary duties.  (See Op. Agreement.) \n13. On 28 April 2006, Emrich, Hornwood, and Bondtex entered into a separate \njoint venture agreement (the “Joint Venture Agreement”).  (Second Am. Compl. Ex. \n2, ECF No. 116.2 [“Joint Venture Agreement”].)  \n14. Upon founding Triangle, Emrich , Hornwood, and Bondtex  agreed to a \ndivision of responsibilities  that were then documented in the Joint Venture \nAgreement.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 30; Joint Venture Agree.  § 5(d).)  Hornwood \nassumed responsibility for the manufacturing of fabric , invoicing, and internal \naccounting.  (Joint Venture Agreement § 5(d)1.)  Bondtex assumed responsibility for \nthe lamination, cutting , storage, and distribution of laminated product.  (Joint \nVenture Agreement § 5(d)2.)  Emrich assumed responsibility for the sales and \n \n \nmarketing of Triangle’s products and customer service. 3  (Joint Venture Agreement \n§ 5(d)3.) \n15. Section 3(a) of the Joint Venture Agreement provides that “[e] ither party \nshall invoice the Joint Venture, with terms of 75 days, the cost it incurs in providing \nfabric, laminating, cutting and packaging for the completion of the services.”   (Joint \nVenture Agreement § 3(a).) \nB. Bondtex Withdraws from Triangle \n16. In 2015, Triangle sued one of its former sales agent s, Suminoe Textile \nAmerica (“Suminoe”) for alleged misconduct  (the “Bondtex Lawsuit”) .  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 43.)  Before the initiation of the lawsuit, Suminoe  acquired ownership of \nBondtex.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 43.)   In September 2018, the Bondtex Lawsuit was \nsettled.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 45.)  As part of the settlement, Emrich and Hornwood \nconsented to Bondtex’s withdrawal from Triangle.   (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 50.)   \nTriangle received significant cash proceeds from the settlement.  (Second Am. Compl. \n¶ 205, C. Horne Dep. 14:12–18, ECF No. 147.3.) \n17. After Bondtex withdrew from Triangle, Emrich and Hornwood, as the two \nremaining members of Triangle, hired C.H. Mueller (“Mueller”) as a contract \nlaminator to perform  lamination services  that had previously been perform ed by \nBondtex.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 53.)   Additionally , Hornwood began to perform \n \n3 Although the Joint Venture Agreement made Emrich responsible for Triangle’s customer \nservice, prior to its withdrawal, Bondtex apparently handled customer service for Triangle \nuntil Bondtex’s departure from Triangle.  (See Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 52; C. Horne Dep. \n11:25–12:4, ECF No. 34.1.)     \n \n \nTriangle’s customer-service responsibilities that had previously been performed by  \nBondtex.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 52.) \n18. At Triangle’s formation, the Operating and Joint Venture Agreements \nprovided that Triangle would pay Emrich a commission  of three to five  percent on \nTriangle’s sales.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 131.)  In January 2013, the parties agreed to \nadjust Emrich’s commission to two percent.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 132.) \n19. After the settlement of the Bondtex Lawsuit, John  Emrich, a principal of \nEmrich, suggested to Chuck Horne , Hornwood’s CEO, that Triangle approach \nBorgstena4 regarding a possible joint development, sales, and supply agreement \nbetween the two entities.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 10, 90.)  In September 2018, Chuck \nHorne emailed Borgstena regarding this potential agreement; however, Borgstena \ndeclined the offer.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 90.) \nC. Hornwood’s Involvement with Borgstena \n20. Unbeknownst to Emrich, a year earlier, in September 2017, Borgstena had \ncontacted Chuck Horne to discuss the possibility of Hornwood making seating and \nheadliner fabric in the United States for a major automobile manufacturer.  (Second \nAm. Compl. ¶ 77.)   In pursuit of such a relationship, and without notice to Emrich, \nChuck Horne emailed Borgstena a “company profile” for Hornwood.  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 77.) \n \n4 Borgstena is a foreign manufacturer and seller of automotive textile products for suppliers \nof major automobile manufacturers.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 76.)  Prior to the relevant period, \nBorgstena had no presence in the United States. \n \n \n \n21. In furtherance of a potential relationship, in November 2017, Hornwood \nand Borgstena executed a nondisclosure agreement so that they could negotiate a n \nagreement for joint product development.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 78.)  Hornwood did \nnot alert Emrich about the existence of the nondisclosure agreement  or Hornwood’s \ndiscussions with Borgstena.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 78.) \n22. In February 2018, Chuck Horne and his son Wesley Horne 5 visited \nBorgstena’s manufacturing facility in Portugal.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 83.)  Neither \nthe Hornes, nor Borgstena notified Emrich that such a meeting was taking place, and \nthe Hornes did not invite anyone from Emrich to accompany them on the trip .  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 81.) \n23. After the Hornes’ meeting in Portugal with Borgstena personnel, Hornwood \nand Borgstena represe ntatives engaged in weekly discussions regarding  potential \njoint product-development.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 83.) \n24. In May 2018, Borgstena representatives came to North Carolina and met \nwith the Hornes  at Hornwood’s facility .  (Second Am. Compl ¶ 83.)   Again,  no one \nfrom Hornwood told anyone from Emrich about the meeting prior to or at the time it \noccurred.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 83.) \n25. During their meeting, Hornwood and Borgstena discussed the possibility of \nHornwood manufacturing automotive textile products for two automobile \nmanufacturers with whom Borgstena had a relationship.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 84.)  \nLater, in January 2019, Hornwood told Borgstena about an opportunity for the two \n \n5 Wesley Horne is the President of Hornwood.  (W. Horne Aff. ¶ 1, ECF No 177.) \n \n \nmanufacturers to jointly purchase a textile plant in North Carol ina.  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 93.) \n26. Hornwood’s product-development efforts with Borgstena involved the same \ntypes of fabrics that Hornwood  manufactures for Triangle, including the \nmanufacturing of warp -knit headliner and pillar fabrics.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n101–02.)  Until Hornwood produced discovery to Emrich in this action, Hornwood had \nnot alerted Emrich of Hornwood’s product-development efforts with Borgstena.  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 96.)   \n D.   The Mueller Transition \n27. In the fall of 2018, Triangle began its transition from Bondtex t o Mueller \nfor Triangle’s product lamination.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 53.)  Hornwood employee \nand customer service representative Scott Dutton  (“Dutton”) was selected by \nHornwood to facilitate Triangle’s transition.  (Willis Aff. ¶¶ 19, 21, ECF No. 151.37.)  \nIn November 2018, Hornwood asked  Triangle’s sales agent Norman Willis (“Willis”) \nnot to communicate directly with Mueller and instructed him that Dutton should be \nthe primary contact .  (Willis Aff. ¶  14; Triangle 30(b)(6) Dep. 232:23– 25, ECF No. \n151.7.) \n28. At a 1 November 2018 meeting, Willis and representatives of Mueller \nexpressed concerns to Hornwood regarding Dutton’s ability to handle the transition \nfrom Bondtex to Mueller.  (Willis Aff. ¶ 21.) \n \n \n29. Also on 1 November 2018, Dutton and Willis were informed vi a email that \nDynevor Express ,6 a trucking company  hired to ship Triangle’s product , had not \nreceived necessary customs documents for a pending shipment of Triangle’s product  \nand that Dynevor Express would “need to receive these documents [at] latest by 9:00 \nam EST tomorrow Friday Nov 2nd to process and cross the [b]order[.]”   (Exs. to Br. \nSupp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. 14, 4, ECF No. 151.14 [“Pl.’s Ex. 14”].)    \n30. In email communications the following day, 2 November 2018, Chuck \nHorne informed Emrich that Dutton  timely provided the customs documents after \nreceiving notice of the issue.  (Pl.’s Ex. 14 at 2.)  Chuck Horne also indicated that the \ndelay was not caused by Dutton, but instead  was “totally caused by Bondtex ,” and \ndescribed steps Dutton subsequently took to improve conveyance of shipping \ninformation in the future.  (Pl.’s Ex. 14 at 2.) \n31. During this period, Chuck and Wesley Horne  conversed with Dutton to \nensure he could competently handle his current workload.  (Hornwood 30(b)(6) Dep. \n238:14–25, ECF No. 176.3.)  After December 2018, Chuck and Wesley Horne checked \nin with  Dutton either daily or weekly to assess the status of  Dutton’s work for \nTriangle.  (Hornwood 30(b)(6) Dep. 239:15–23.)  \n \n6 Dynevor Express provides cross -border general freight trucking services throughout \nCanada, Mexico, and the United States .   (Dynevor Express  Profile, \ndynevorexpress.com/en/dynevor-express-profile.php (last visited Feb. 10, 2022).) \n \n \n      E.   The Members Discuss Emrich’s Commissions \n32. From Triangle’s inception until June 2019, Emrich was paid a commission \non all sales.  (Joint Venture Agreement § 3(a); Triangle 30(b)(6) Dep. 114:20 -116:17, \nECF No. 151.7.)   \n33. Following Bondtex’s withdrawal from Triangle, on 25 September 2018, \nChuck Horne informed Emrich  that his understanding was that , given the new \nownership split, Emrich would no longer be receiving a commission.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ \nMot. Summ. J. Ex. 9, ECF No. 147.10 [“Defs.’ Ex. 9”].)  On 27 September 2019, John \nEmrich informed Chuck Horne  that Emrich  still wished to receive commissions, \nwhich could be offset against its share of Triangle’s profits.  (Defs.’ Ex. 9.) \n34. Chuck Horne and John Emrich exchanged emails on the subject of Emrich’s \ncommissions in February 2019.  (Defs.’ Ex. 16.)  An email sent fro m John Emrich to \nChuck Horne on 12 February 2019 referenced a new agreement between the parties \nbeginning on 1 October 2018.  (Defs.’ Ex. 16.)  In this 12 February 2019 email, John \nEmrich described the agreement as changing Triangle’s profit sharing, elimi nating \nEmrich’s two percent commission, and treating any commissions paid from October \nthrough December 2018 as advances.  (Defs.’ Ex. 16.)   \n35. For approximately four months  after 12 February 2019, u ntil at least 11 \nJune 2019, Triangle continued to account f or commissions to Emrich on its books.  \n(Triangle 30(b)(6) Dep. 114:20–116:17.)   \n \n \n F. Hornwood Makes Unilateral Financial Decisions \n36. On 10 June 2019, Hornwood informed Emrich that, due to sustaining losses \nin its business with Triangle,  Hornwood would be increasing the amount it charges \nTriangle for fabric manufacturing.  (Br. Supp. Emrich Enter. Mot. Compel Resp. Doc. \nReq. Ex. 1, ECF No. 98.2 [“Hornwood Letter”].)  Although Hornwood was raising its \nprices, Hornwood contended that it would still be charging Triangle below the market \nrate for its services .  ( Hornwood Letter ¶ 2. )  Three days later, o n 13 June 2019, \nHornwood informed Emrich that Triangle would no longer pay commissions to \nEmrich.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 10.) \n G. Loss of Freightliner and M2 Headliner Programs \n37. One of Triangle’s customers, Commercial Vehicle Group (“CVG”), supplied \nheadliner for Freightliner trucks.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 61.)  Triangle supplied CVG \nwith headliner for certain Freightliner trucks (the “Freightliner program”) and was \nworking toward a new relationship  supplying headliner for Freightliner  M2 trucks \n(the “M2 program”).  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 61.)  However, in late 2018, CVG reported \nquality issues with Triangle’s headliner fabrics.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 62.)  In 2019, \nFreightliner’s parent company, Daimler  Trucks North America  LLC, informed \nTriangle that Triangle would be required to pass quality testing  by CVG (the “CVG \ntrial”) to retain the Freightliner program.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 66–68.)  \n38. The CVG trial required Triangle to submit samples of its laminated fabric \nto CVG for inspection.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 67.)  CVG required that the samples be \nsubmitted in a specific quantity, roll size, foam thickness, and contain fewer than five \n \n \nfabric defects per roll .  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 69.)   CVG communicated these \nspecifications to Hornwood prior to the trial.  (See Fenton Aff. ¶ 23, ECF No. 151.39.)  \nHornwood was tasked with communicating those specifications to Mueller before the \nfabric was submitted to CVG.7  (See Fenton Aff. ¶ 27–28.)    \n39.       In July 2019, CVG informed Triangle that the fabric Triangle submitted \nfor the CVG trial  did not comply with the specifications set by CVG  and \ncommunicated to Triangle .  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 69.)  Specifically, Triangle \nsubmitted less fabric, in smaller rolls, and with thinner foam than required.  (Second \nAm. Compl. ¶ 69.)  In addition, the laminated fabric provided by Triangle to CVG \ncontained an  excessive number of defects per roll.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶  70.)  \nConsequently, f ollowing the testing, Triangle was informed that it lost the  \nFreightliner program to competitor Guilford Performance Textiles  (“Guilford”) and \nthat it was not chosen for the M2 program.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 71.)   \nH. Hornwood Attempts to Withdraw from Triangle \n40. On 4 March 2019, Chuck Horne called a meeting of the members of  \nTriangle.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 105.)  Chuck Horne and Wesley Horne attended the \nmeeting on behalf of Hornwood, and John Emrich and Martha Miller (“Miller”) \nattended the meeting on behalf of Emrich.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 105.)   Before the \nmeeting, Chuck Horne and Wesley Horne presented John Emrich and Miller with a \nproposed new governing document for Triangle.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 107.)  John \n \n7 Whether Hornwood accurately conveyed to Mueller the specifications it received from CVG \nis a contested issue in this litigation.  \n \n \nEmrich and Mill er did not agree to the terms of the proposed governing document  \nand refused to execute it.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 107.) \n41. Also at the 4 March 2019 meeting, Hornwood informed Emrich of its intent \nto do business with Borgstena.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 108.)   Hornwood then offered \nto buy Emrich ’s membership interest  in Triangle , or in the alternative, to sell \nHornwood’s membership interest in Triangle to Emrich.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 109–\n10.) \n42. At the conclusion of the 4 March 2019 meeting, Hornwood provided Emrich \nwritten notice of its intent to withdraw from Triangle in sixty days.  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 111; Second Am. Compl. Ex. 4, ECF No. 116.4 [“Notice to Withdraw”].) \n43. On 25 April 2019, Hornwood sent an email to Emrich stating its intent to \ninform Triangle’s customers of Hornwood’s withdrawal.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 122; \nSecond Am. Compl. Ex. 8, ECF No. 116.8.) \n44. Following the initiation of this litigation, on 31 May 2019, this Court \npreliminarily enjoined Hornwood , during the pendency of this action,  from \nunilaterally withdrawing from Triangle  without properly obtaining the consent of \nEmrich under Triangle’s operating agreement.  ( See Or. Am. Mot. Prelim. Inj. ¶ 75 , \nECF No. 40.) \n45. On 10 June 2019, Hornwood advised Emrich by letter that it was initiating \nan increase in the prices of fabric that Hornwood was then sell ing to Triangle.  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 9.)   The 10 June 2019 letter stated that the price increases \nwere required for Hornwood to remain financially viable.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 141.) \n \n \n46. Hornwood owns  the facilities where Triangle ’s fabric is  manufactured.  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 31.)  Triangle does not own any physical assets other than its \ninventory.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 31.) Emrich  does not have manufacturing \ncapabilities and cannot perform the functions that Hornwood (manufacturing), \nBondtex (lamination), Mueller (lamination) or others performed for Triangle.  (Second \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 114, 118; Joint Venture Agreement § 5(d) 1–3; Dep. of Wesley Horne \nand Chuck Horne 242:11-18, ECF No. 147.6.) \n      I. Triangle’s Cash Shortage \n47. Triangle has experienced  a cash shortage since 1 November 2018.  \n(McCaskill Aff. ¶ 15.)  While Bondtex was a member of  Triangle, Triangle did not \nhave to purchase raw materials or hold inventory  because Bondtex performed these \nfunctions.  After Bondtex withdrew, however, Triangle had to cover th ese expenses.  \n(McCaskill Aff. ¶ 15.)  In 2019, Triangle’s average accounts payable totaled $110,000 \nper month, while Triangle’s average sales totaled $120,000 per month .  (McCaskill \nAff. ¶ 15.)  As of May 2020, Triangle had over $180,000 in past due accounts payable \nand as of November 2020, it was experiencing net losses.  (C. Horne Aff. ¶ 7, ECF No. \n145.)  In November 2 020, Hornwood called for each of Triangle’s members to \ncontribute capital to Triangle to ensure Triangle retained sufficient cash to operate .  \n(C. Horne Aff. ¶ 8.)   \n48. Emrich informed Hornwood that Emrich would not contribute capital, and \nHornwood subsequently loaned $120,000 to Triangle to meet its ongoing expenses.  \n(C. Horne Aff. ¶ 12.) \n \n \n       J. Triangle’s Accounts Receivable  \n49. Triangle’s customers frequently did not pay invoices on time .  (McCaskill \nAff. ¶ 17.)  If Triangle was not paid within sixty days of the invoice due date, \nTriangle’s accountant would work with the appropriate customer contact to collect \npayment.  (McCaskill Aff. ¶ 17.)  In particular,  Triangle customers CVG and \nPlasticoat often fell behind on payments to Triangle .  (See Phipps Dep. 214:14, ECF \nNo. 147.21, W. Horne Aff. ¶ 6, ECF No. 177.)   \n50. Hornwood made efforts to collect the amounts owed approximately “once or \ntwice a month.”  (Phipps Dep. 214:14.)  In February 2019, John Emrich and Donald \nPhipps (“Phipps”), an Emrich employee,  worked with CVG to implement a  new \ninvoicing system for better flow of payments from CVG to Triangle.  (Emrich 13 Aug \n2020 Dep. 238:19–239:25., ECF No. 147.8, Phipps Dep. 214:15–18.)   \n51. By 14 September 2020, Triangle customer Plasticoat owed Triangle $85,000 \nin past-due receivables.  (Emrich Decl. Ex. 8, at 1, ECF No. 151.40.)  On 16 September \n2020, John Emrich contacted Hornwood’s Treasurer, Paula McCaskill, to ask why \nthese past-due receiv ables had not been collected .  (W . Horne Aff. ¶ 6.)  Paula \nMcCaskill worked with Plasticoat and Willis to collect the past -due receivables , \nHornwood informed John Emrich of Hornwood’s ongoing efforts to collect the \nreceivables, and Triangle received the past-due amount of $85,000.00 from Plasticoat \non 30 September 2020.  (W. Horne Aff. ¶ 6, Exs. B–D.)   \n \n \n      K. Triangle’s Accounting and Tax Records  \n52. On 16 October 2018, Triangle’s members agreed to distribute a portion of \nits 2018 third quarter profits , as well as proceeds f rom the Bondtex Lawsuit \nsettlement.  (McCaskill Aff. ¶ 11.)  Triangle distributed $2,010,200.00 to Hornwood \nand $1,789,800.00 to Emrich.  (McCaskill Aff. ¶ 11.)  However, $25,644.96 in advance \ndistributions Emrich received during the third quarter of 2018 was deducted from its \ndistribution reducing the amount it received to $1,764,155.04.  (McCaskill Aff. ¶ 11.) \n53. Hornwood, with Triangle’s a ccountant, coordinated the preparation of \nTriangle’s 2019 tax forms .  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 160.)  During the 2018 –19 \naccounting period, Triangle issued payments to Emrich using checks stating that the \nfunds were for “commissions.”  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 16 1.)  As late as March 2019, \nEmrich still had not received a Form 1099 or other tax form from Triangle.  (Second \nAm. Compl. ¶ 162.)  On 31 March 2019, Triangle’s accountant sent Emrich a Schedule \nK-1 but indicated that Triangle would not be sending Emrich a  Form 1099 form for \nthe period.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 162.)   \n54. Thereafter, for a period of time m onthly payments made to Emrich  \ncontinued to be labeled as commission payments in Triangle’s computer system.  \n(McCaskill Aff. ¶ 13, ECF No. 150.)   However, Hornwood eventually changed t he \nbookkeeping system to c lassify the monthly payments  to Emrich  as advanced \ndistributions.  (McCaskil l Aff. ¶ 13.)  By  17 December 2020, Triangle had begun \nsending revised tax documents to Triangle’s members reflect ing the reclassification.  \n(McCaskill Aff. ¶ 14.) \n \n \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n55. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural histor y \nrelevant to its determination of the Motions. \n56. This action was originally initiated by Emrich on  29 April 2019  with the \nfiling of its Verified Complaint.  (ECF No. 3.) \n57. On 1 May 2019, this Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) \nenjoining Hornwood from, among other things, withdrawing as a member of Triangle.  \n(ECF No. 15.)    \n58. On 21 May 2019, Emrich filed  its Amended Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction seeking to extend the TRO throughout the pendency of this action.  (ECF \nNo. 27.) \n59. As noted previously at ¶ 44, supra, on 31 May 2019, the Cour t granted in \npart Emrich’s Amended Motion for Preliminary Injunction  and enjoined Hornwood \nfrom unilaterally withdrawing from Triangle without consent from  Emrich.  (Order \non Am. Mot. for Prelim. Inj. ¶ 75, ECF No. 40.)  \n60. On 4 August 2020, Emrich filed its Second Amended Verified Complaint  \n(the “Complaint”).  (ECF No. 116.) \n61. Defendants filed their Answer to Second Amended Complaint, Affirmative \nDefenses, and Restated Counterclaim on 8 September 2020 (the “Counterclaim”).  \n(Answer Second Am. Compl., Affirmative Defenses, & Restated Countercl., ECF No. \n127 [“Countercl.”].)  On 8 October 2020, Em rich filed Emrich’s Reply to Triangle’s \nRestated Counterclaim.  (ECF No. 132.) \n \n \n62. On 18 December 2020, Emrich filed its Motion for Summary Judgment and \nsupporting brief.   (Br. Supp. Emrich’s Mot. Summ . J., ECF No. 143 [“Br. Supp. \nEmrich Mot.”].)  Triangle filed its respons ive brief on 20 January 2021.  ( Triangle \nAuto. Components., LLC’s Br. Opp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 169  [“Triangle Br. \nOpp.”].)  Emrich filed its reply brief on 1 February 2021. (ECF No. 175.)   \n63. Also o n 18 December 2020, Defendants filed Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment and supporting brief.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. \n147 [“Br. Supp.”].)  On 20 January 2021, Emrich filed  its response brief , (Emrich \nResp. Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 166 [“ Emrich Resp.”]), and Defendants filed \ntheir Reply Brief on 1 February 2021, (ECF No. 176). \n64. The Court held a hearing on the Motions on 20 April 2021.  ( See ECF No. \n185.)   \n65. The Motions are ripe for resolution.  \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n66. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule 56(c).  “A ‘genuine issue’ is \none that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, \n83 (2000). \n67. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \n \n \nHensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc. , 193 N.C. App. 561, 563 (2008).  The movant \nmay make the required showing by proving that “an essential element of the opposing \nparty’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an \naffirmative defense, or by showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot \nproduce evidence to support an essential element of her claim.”  Dobson, 352 N.C. at \n83 (citations omitted). \n68. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that  he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784−85 \n(2000). \n69. The Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83.  However, the nonmovant “may not rest upo n \nthe mere allegations or denials of their pleading, but their response, by affidavits or \nas otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing  that there is \na genuine issue for trial.  If [the nonmovant] does not so respond, summary judgment, \nif appropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant].”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule \n56(e).       \nV. ANALYSIS \n70. The Court first addresses Plaintiff’s Motion, then turns to Defendants’ \nMotion.  \n \n \nA. Plaintiff’s Motion \n71. Triangle asserts one counterclaim for relief against Emrich alleging that \nEmrich breached a fiduciary duty owed as a member to Triangle by initiating the \nlawsuit.  (Countercl. ¶ 63.)  Emrich contends that it is entitled to summary judgment \non Triangle’s breach of fiduciary duty claim  because: (1) Triangle cannot prove the \nelements of its breach of fiduciary duty claim; and (2) the imposition of liability \nagainst Emrich for a breach of a fiduciary duty based on the filing of this lawsuit \nwould violate the Petition Clause  of the First A mendment to the United States \nConstitution and Article I, Section 12 of the North Carolina Constitution .  (Pl.’s Br. \nSupp. Mot. 3.) \n72. Emrich is a member of Triangle, but members of an LLC generally do not \nowe the LLC a fiduciary duty.  Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469 (2009) \n(“Members of a limited liability company . . . do not owe a fiduciary duty to each other \nor to the company.”).  While there are exceptions to this general rule, none appl y to \nEmrich.  Cf . Fiske v. Kieffer, 2016 NCBC  LEXIS 22, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct . Mar. 9, \n2016) (“[A] holder of a majority interest who exercises control over the LLC owes a \nfiduciary duty to minority interest members .”).  As a result, Hornwood has failed to \ndemonstrate a triable issue of fact that Emrich breached a fiduciary duty to Triangle \nby bringing suit. \n73. Additionally, Triangle’s counterclaim is deficient for another and more \nfundamental reason. The First Amendment prohibits Congress from “ abridging . . . \nthe right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”  \n \n \nU.S. Const. amend. I.  Similarly, Article I, Section 12 of the North Carolina \nConstitution protects the right to petition.  N.C. Const. art. I, § 12.  \n74. The Supreme Court’s decision in Cheryl Lloyd Humphrey Land Inv . Co. v. \nResco Products, Inc. , 377 N.C. 384 (2021), is dispositive here.  There, the Court \nrecognized that the right to petition for redress is a fundamental one, and \n“[p]rotecting the right to petition requires early dismissal of lawsuits that \nimpermissibly seek to infringe on the right and thus chill petitioning activity \noccurring in these political contexts.”   Id. at 389-90.  Accordingly, “[w]hen a lawsuit \nis premised on a party’s petition activity, the First Amendment and Article I, Section \n12 mandate early dismissal.”  Id . at 390.  “[F]iling a complaint in court is a form o f \npetitioning activity .” McDonald v. Smith , 472 U.S. 479, 484 (1985) .  And while \n“baseless litigation is not immunized by the First Amendment right to petition[,]” as \ndetermined below, Plaintiff’s complaint is far from baseless.   Bill Johnson's \nRestaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 743 (1983). \n75. Triangle’s counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty is entirely premised on \nEmrich initiating this lawsuit.  The Court c oncludes that the pursuit by Emrich of \nthis claim is the sort of petitioning activity that is protected by the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 12 of the North Carolina \nConstitution.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED, and Defendants’ breach of \nfiduciary duty claim is DISMISSED with prejudice.\n   \n \n \nB. Defendants’ Motion \nEmrich brings both direct claims against Hornwood and Triangle and claims that \nare derivative in nature on behalf of Triangle against Hornwood that are premised \non Hornwood’s alleged misconduct.  Defendants request that the Court grant \nsummary judgment as to Emrich ’s claims for : (1) breach of contract ag ainst \nHornwood; (2)  breach of fiduciary duty against Hornwood; and (3) breach of \ncontract against Triangle. \n1. Breach of Contract Claims Against Hornwood \n76. Emrich asserts three separate claims for breach of contract against \nHornwood.  A party asserting a breach of contract claim must show “(1) existence of \na valid contract; and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. \nApp. 19, 26 (2000).   “When language of a cont ract is plain and unambiguous its \nconstruction is a matter of law for the court.”  De Torre v. Shell Oil Co., 84 N.C. App. \n501, 504 (1987).   “However, if the court determines that the terms of the contract are \nambiguous and resort to extrinsic evidence is  necessary then the question of \nconstruction of the contract is one for the jury.”  Frye Reg’l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Blue \nCross Blue Shield N.C., Inc., 2020 NCBC LEXIS 51, at *28 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 17, \n2020) (cleaned up).  “An ambiguity exists in a contrac t when either the meaning of \nwords or the effect of provisions is uncertain or capable of several reasonable \ninterpretations.”  Schenkel & Shultz, Inc. v. Hermon F. Fox & Assocs., 362 N.C. 269, \n273 (2008) (citation omitted).  Here, the parties dispute whether Hornwood breached \n \n \nSections 4.4 and 8.1 of the Operating Agreement and Section 3 of the Joint Venture \nAgreement.  \na. Section 4.4 of the Operating Agreement \n77. Emrich’s first claim for relief is asserted against Hornwood , individually \nand derivatively on behalf of Triangle, for breach of Section 4.4 of the Operating \nAgreement.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 167–74.)  Section 4.4 of the Operating Agreement \nstates that “[n]o Member may engage in or possess an interest in other busi ness \nventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, which are \ncompetitive with the activities of [Triangle] without first offering an interest in such \nactivities to [Triangle] and each other Member.”  (Defs.’ Ex. 25; Op. Agreement § 4.4.)  \nThe Operating Agreement  entered into by Emrich and Hornwood, a long with \nBondtex, on 28 February 2006, sets forth that its term lasts “until the Company is \ndissolved and its affairs wound up  in accordance  with the provisions of this \nAgreement or the [North Carolina Limited Liability Company] Act.”  (Op. Agreement \n¶ 1.6.)  The Operating Agreement does not specifically define or elaborate on what \nactivities may be considered “competitive with the activities” of Triangle.   ( See Op. \nAgreement ¶ 4.4.)  \n78. Emrich contends that Hornwood breached Section 4.4 of the Operating \nAgreement by working with Borgstena.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 169 –174.)  \nDefendants counter that “[b]ecause Triangle’s activities within the automotive \nindustry are l imited to supplying and selling finished, laminated products \n \n \n(headliners), it is reasonable to interpret ‘competitive activities’ within Section 4.4 to \nonly encompass those specific activities.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 15.) \n79. The Court concludes , based on th e evidence before it,  that Section 4.4 is \nsusceptible to multiple reasonable interpretations , including the parties’ respective \ninterpretations. \n80. Defendants argue that Triangle’s purpose is to “supply laminated warp knit \nfabrics for use in headliner, pillar and post, visor and package shelf applications.”  \n(Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Ex. 26, ECF No. 147.27.)  It is undisputed that, during Chuck \nHorne’s February 2018 visit to Borgstena’s facilities, Hornwood agreed to duplicate \nfabric Borgstena uses in its automotive products.  (Chuck Horne  Dep. 39:17–21.)  It \nis also undisputed that Hornwood’s product -development efforts with Borgstena \ninvolve the same types of fabrics that Hornwood manufactures for Triangle, including \nthe manufacturing of warp-knit headliner and pillar fabrics. (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n101–02.)  The record indicates that Borgstena considered  building a laminating \nfacility of its own.  (Chuck Horne Dep. 34:11–12.)  However, since neither Hornwood \nnor Borgstena had in- house lamination capabilities, it is not clear from the record \nwhether Hornwood, in collaboration with Borgstena, intended to supply laminated \nwarp knit fabrics for use in headliner, pillar and post, visor and package shelf \napplications.  It is ultimately a question for the jury whether Hornwood’s conduct fell \nwithin the meaning of “competitive activities.”     \n81. In sum, t he Court is unable to determine the intent behind and properly \ninterpret Section 4.4 of the Operating Agreement without consideration of extrinsic \n \n \nevidence which is conflicting , making summary judgment inappropriate  as to this \nclaim.  \n82. Defendants also contend that Emrich ’s “purported interpretation  [of \nOperating Agreement Section 4.4] is an unenforceable restraint on trade.”  (Br. Supp. \nDefs.’ Mot. 18.)   \"The reasonableness of a restraining covenant is a matter of law for \nthe court to decide.\" Jewel Box Stores Corp. v. Morrow, 272 N.C. 659, 663 (1968).  In \narguing that  Plaintiff’s interpretation is a n unenforceable  restraint o n trade, \nDefendants draw support from  cases analyzing post-termination restrictions.  See \nSandhills Home C are, L.L.C., v. Companion Home Care –Unimed, Inc., 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 61, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug 1, 2016) (restricting competitive activities for \none year following termination of employment) ; Outdoor Lighting Perspectives \nFranchising v. Harders, 228 N.C. App. 613, 623 (2013) (restricting com petitive \nactivities for two years  following termination of the franchise agreement); Horner \nInt’l Co. v. McKoy , 232 N.C. App. 559, 565  (2014) (restricting competitive activities \nfor eighteen months after the end of employment).   \n83. Section 4.4 is distinguishable from the provisions at issue in the cases on \nwhich Defendants rely.  First, Section 4.4 contains no post-termination restriction \nand thus  applies only to members while they are still part of Triangle.   Second, \nSection 4.4 is not a n absolute prohibition on competitive activities by members. \nInstead, it permits  members to engage in competitive activities provided that  \nTriangle and each member  of Triangle  are “first offer[ed] an interest  in such \nactivities[.]”  (Op. Agreement § 4.4 .)  In effect, Section 4.4 is better understood as  \n \n \nimposing a limited duty of loyalty on  Triangle’s members , rather tha n a s a  non-\ncompete provision.  \n84. Therefore, the Court DENIES  Defendants’ Motion to the extent \nDefendants request summary judgment as to Emrich’s claim for breach of Section 4.4 \nof the Operating Agreement.     \nb. Section 8.1 of the Operating Agreement \n85. Emrich’s second claim for relief is asserted against Hornwood, individually \nand derivatively on behalf of Triangle, for breach of Section 8.1 of the Operating \nAgreement.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 183 –190.)  It is Emrich ’s position that  the \nOperating Agreement prohibi ts a member from unilaterally withdrawing from \nTriangle.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 184.)   \n86. Section 8.1 of the Operating Agreements reads as follows:  \nRestrictions on Transfer.  Without the prior written consent of a Majority \nin Interest of the Disinterested Members  (which consent may be given \nor withheld in their sole discretion)  . . . no Member may voluntarily or \ninvoluntarily Transfer, or create or suffer to exist any Encumbrance \nagainst, all or any part of such Member’s record or beneficial interest in \nthe Company. \n \n(Operating Agreement § 8.1  (emphasis in original) .)  Section 2 of the Operating \nAgreement defines “Transfer” as to “sell, assign, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose \nof property, including without limitation, an interest in the Company.”  (Operating \nAgreement § 2.)  \n87. Hornwood contends that “Hornwood did not breach Section 8.1 of the \nOperating Agreement because it does not prohibit a member from unilaterally \nwithdrawing.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 20.)  It is Hornwood’s position that “Transfer,” \n \n \nas defined by the Operating Agreement, does not include a member’s withdrawal.  \n(Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 20–22.)  Hornwood’s proposed definition of “Transfer” is “the \nact of giving something to another entity or person.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 21.)  In \nother words, Hornwood contends that its withdrawal from Triangle does not \nconstitute a “Transfer” within the meaning of the Operating Agreement because \nHornwood would only be removing itself from Triangle, not giving its interest to \nanother person or entity.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 21.)   \n88. Hornwood further cites to Section 9 of the Operating Agreement , which \ndefines a “Buy-Sell Event” as “[a]ny purported voluntary or involuntary Transfer or \nEncumbrance of all or any part of a Member’s Membership Interest in a manner not \nexpressly permitted by this Agreement” or “[a]ny withdrawal by a Member from \n[Triangle] other than as may be expressly permitted by this Agreement.”  (Operating \nAgreement § 9.1 (d), (g).)  Hornwood contends that Section 9’s use of the word \n“withdrawal,” separately from its use of the word “ Transfer”, requires the Court to \nreach the conclusion that a Transfer does not include a withdrawal.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ \nMot. 22–23.) \n89. The Court declines to disregard the express choice of the words “dispose of” \nin the Operating Agreement’s definition of “Transfer,” which could reasonably include \nHornwood’s withdrawal from Triangle.   In fact, it is Chuck Horne’s position that \nHornwood’s attempt to withdraw was to “give up,” or otherwise dispose of, \nHornwood’s financial interest in Triangle.  (Chuck Horne Dep. 25:24–26:6.)     \n \n \n90. The Court is in no way concluding that Hornwood’s interpretation is \nunreasonable or incorrect as a matter of law.  However, at best, the terms of the \nOperating Agreement, specifically the use of the word “Transfer” in Section 8.1, are \nsusceptible to multiple reasonable interpretations, making summary judgment \ninappropriate as to this claim. \n91. Defendants then contend that, even if the Court concludes that Hornwood \nbreached Section 8.1 of the Operating Agreement, the remedy Plaintiff seeks violates \npublic policy and is unavailable under the Operating Agreement.  (Br. Supp.  Defs.’ \nMot. 23–24.)  Emrich requests  compensatory damages and “permanent injunctive \nrelief prohibiting Hornwood from unilaterally withdrawing from Triangle[.]”  (Second \nAm. Compl.  ¶ 192.)   It is Hornwood’s interpretation of the Second Amended \nComplaint that Emrich “seeks a judgment requiring Hornwood to remain an active \nmember of Triangle forever.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 20 (emphasis in original).) \n92. As an initial matter, it is unclear to the Court on what basis compensatory \ndamages would violate public policy and Defendants do not cite to any case in support \nof this proposition.  Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendants’ request for summary \njudgment as to any compensatory damages stemming from Hornwood’s alleged \nbreach of Section 8.1 of the Operating Agreement. \n93. As to Defendants’ position  that Emrich seeks injunctive relief prohibiting \nHornwood from withdrawing from Triangle for an indefinite period of time, it is not \nclear to the Court that this is Emrich’s request.  As noted by Emrich, Hornwood may \nseek to withd raw from Triangle in compliance with the terms of the Operating \n \n \nAgreement, as long as it is not in violation of this Court’s orders, or it may seek relief \npursuant to North Carolina statutes.  (See Resp. Br. Defs.’ Mot. 16–7.)   In this regard, \nthe Court notes that the Operating Agreement, voluntarily agreed to by Hornwood at \nthe inception of the venture,  has a defined term and a termination date.  (See Op. \nAgreement ¶ 1.6.) \n94. In any event, based on the record before it, the Court believes it premature \nto analyze the public policy  ramifications of a remedy t o which Emrich may or may \nnot be entitled.    \n95. The Court therefore DENIES Defendants’ Motion to the extent Defendants \nrequest summary judgment as to  Emrich’s claim for breach of Section 8.1 of the \nOperating Agreement.     \nc.   Agreement to Manufacture Fabric for Triangle at Cost \n96. Emrich’s sixth claim for relief is asserted against Hornwood, individually \nand derivatively on behalf of Triangle, for Hornwood’s alleg ed violation of the Joint \nVenture Agreement by refusing to manufacture fabric for Triangle at its cost.  (Second \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 227–35.) \n97. Section 3(a) of the Joint Venture Agreement provides “ [e]ither party shall \ninvoice [Triangle], with terms of 75 days, th e cost it incurs in providing fabrics, \nlaminating, cutting and packaging for the completion of services. . . . All parties shall \nmutually agree upon additional expenses.”  (Joint Venture Agreement § 3(a).) \n98. Defendants contend that  it is undisputed that Horn wood did not breach \nSection 3(a) of the Joint Venture Agreement because Hornwood ’s price increase \n \n \nreflected only the increased costs of general and administrative expenses.  (Br. Supp. \nDefs.’ Mot. 24–25.) \n99. The Joint Venture Agreement neither expressly address es general and \nadministrative expenses in Section 3(a) nor otherwise defines “cost.”  Defendants rely \nin part on the Black’s Law Dictionary definition of “Manufacturing Cost,” which \nincludes the cost of general and administrative activities.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 24.)   \n100. The original arrangement between Hornwood, Bondtex, and Emrich was \nfor Hornwood to manufacture fabric and Bondtex to laminate the fabric with “ no \ngeneral and administrative expenses included[.]”   ( Chuck Horne Dep. 23:2–9, ECF \nNo. 147.3.)  Hornwood did not charge Triangle for general or administrative expenses \nfrom 2010 until 2018.  (Hornwood 30(b)(6) Dep. 80:21–81:2, ECF 147.15.) \n101. The Joint Venture Agreement’s use of the word “cost” could reasonably \nencompass general or administrative expenses associated with Hornwood “providing \nfabric” to Triangle.  On the other hand, the Joint Venture Agreement  could \nreasonably be construed to be limited to the costs directly incurred in the \nmanufacturing process of the fabric.  Based on the record before it, the Court is unable \nto resolve the interpretation of Section 3(a) without consideration of extrinsic \nevidence, making summary judgment inappropriate. \n \n \n102. Accordingly, the Court DENIES  Defendants’ Motion to the extent \nDefendants request summary judgment as to Emrich ’s claim for breach of Section \n3(a) of the Joint Venture Agreement.        \nd. Distribution of Settlement Proceeds \n103. Emrich’s fourth claim for relief is asserted directly against Triangle for \nTriangle’s alleged failure to pay Emrich its portion of settlement proceeds from the \nBondtex Lawsuit.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 205–12.)  Emrich alleges, and Defendants \ndeny, that Emrich and D efendants agreed that  Triangle would distribute \napproximately seventy -eight percent of Emrich ’s share of the settlement proceeds \nfrom the Bondtex lawsuit in October 2018, and the remainder at the end of 2018.  (See \nSecond Am. Compl. ¶ 206.)  It is undisputed that Triangle distributed seventy -eight \npercent of Emrich’s share of the proceeds  to Emrich in October 2018.  (Second Am. \nCompl. ¶ 207.)  However, Emrich contends that Triangle breach ed the agreement \nregarding the payment and distribution of the proceeds by failing to distribute the \nremainder of Emrich’s share at the end of 2018.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 208.)   \n104. It is Defendants’ position that there is no enforceable agreement to \ndistribute the settlement proceeds at the end of 2018.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 25.)  The \nrecord reveals that the parties agreed to “set aside” the remaining twenty-two percent \nof the settlement proceeds when seventy-eight percent was distributed to Emrich and \nHornwood,  (Emrich Dep. 111:1–3, ECF No 147.8, Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Sum. J. Ex. \n17, 2, ECF No. 147.18), and Hornwood contends that the agreement to set aside the \nremainder of the settlement proceeds was made to ensure Triangle retained enough \n \n \ncash to operate.  (See Emrich Dep. 111:6–7.)  There is also evidence that on 16 October \n2018, Chuck Horne and John Emrich “agreed to hold back $200,000 in reserve until \nyear end.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Ex. 11, ECF No. 147.12.)  On 10 April 2019, Chuck \nHorne again affirmed that he and John Emrich previously “agreed to set aside part \nof the settlement money [.]”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 17, 2.).  Thus, the \nagreement to “hold back”  the remaining twenty -two percent of the settlement \nproceeds “until year end” may be reasonably construed as an agreement to distribute \nthe proceeds at year end.   \n105. However, since Triangle’s cash shortage apparently motivated the decision \nto withhold twenty -two percent of the settlement proceeds , the 16 October  2018 \ncommunication may also be reasonabl y construed as a n agreement to revisit \nTriangle’s financial condition at the end of the year , and after doing so, to consider \nthe propriety of making additional cash distributions.  There is record evidence to \nsupport this interpretation. \n106. “[W]hen an agreement is ambiguous and the intention of the parties is \nunclear, interpretation of the contract is for the trier of fact. ”  Schenkel & Schult z, \nInc. v. Hermon F. Fox & Assocs., P.C ., 180 N.C. App. 257, 266 (2006).  Viewing the \nevidence in the light most favorable to Emrich as the non-movant, the record fails to \nestablish the non-existence of an enforceable agreement to distribute the remaining \nsettlement proceeds at the end of 2018.  It is for a jury to determine the meaning of \nthe 16 October 2018 communication.      \n \n \n107. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Defendants’ Motion should be \nDENIED as to  Emrich’s breach of contract claim against Triangle regarding the \ndistribution of settlement proceeds.   \ne. Emrich’s Sales Commission \n108. Emrich’s fifth claim for relief is asserted against  directly Triangle for \nTriangle’s alleged failure to pay Emrich  a sales commission owed to it pursuant to \nthe terms of the Joint Venture Agreement.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 215–23.) \n109. Section 3(a) of the Joint Venture Agreement provides that “[s]elling \nexpenses shall be paid on a commission basis[.]”  (Joint Venture Agreement § 3 (a).)   \nThe record before the Court reflects that, from inception until June 2019, Emrich was \npaid a commission on all sales. ( Joint Venture Agreement § 3(a); Triangle 30(b)(6) \nDep. 114:20–116:17, ECF No. 151.7.) \n110. Following Bondtex’s withdrawal from Triangl e, Chuck Horne and John \nEmrich began negotiating a change in the percentages of their respective ownership \nof Triangle .  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 218.)   O n 25 September 2018, Chuck Horne \nexpressed that his understanding of the  agreement for a  new ownership spl it was \nthat Emrich would no longer receive a commission.  (Defs.’ Ex. 9.)  However, just two \ndays later, on 27 September 2018, John Emrich expressed that Emrich still wanted \nto receive commissions, which could be offset against periodic distributions to Emrich \nof its share of Triangle’s profits.  (Defs.’ Ex. 9.) \n111. Triangle points to a series of emails exchanged between Chuck Horne and \nJohn Emrich in February 2019.  (Defs.’ Ex. 16.)  An email sent from John Emrich to \n \n \nChuck Horne on 12 February 2019 referenc es a new agreement between the parties \nbeginning on 1 October 2018.  (Defs.’ Ex. 16.)  In this 12 February 2019 email, John \nEmrich describes the agreement as chang ing Triangle’s profit sharing , eliminating \nEmrich’s two percent commission, and treating any commissions paid from October \nthrough December 2018 as advances.  (Defs.’ Ex. 16.)   \n112. Emrich responds that, although the parties began negotiating new terms \nrelating to Triangle’s operation following Bondtex’s departure, they  “never \nmemorialized any modification in writing[.]”  (Emrich Enter. LLC’s Resp. to Defs.’ \nMot. for Summ. J. 24, ECF No. 166 [“Emrich Resp.”].) \n113. While Defendants dispute the formation of an agreement as contended by \nEmrich, t he record before the Court indicates that, following  these email \ncommunications, until at least 11 June 2019, Triangle continued to  pay Emrich at \nthe rate of two percent of sales and account for such payments  to Emrich as \ncommissions on its books .  ( Triangle 30(b)(6) Dep. 114:20–116:17.)  Hornwood was \nresponsible for maintaining the financial books and records , including the \nclassification of th e payments to Emrich.  ( See McCaskill Aff. ¶ 3.)   The evidence \nfurther reflects that, on 13 June 2019, Hornwood unilaterally advised Emrich that it \nwould no longer be paid a sales commission.  (Emrich Resp. Ex. 14, ECF No. 166.15.) \n114. The Court concludes that, as to this claim, there are material facts in \ndispute.  Therefore, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion as to Emrich’s fifth claim \nfor relief. \n \n \n2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claims Against Hornwood \n115. Emrich’s third and seventh claims for relief are asserted against Hornwood \nboth directly and derivatively on behalf of Triangle, for breach of fiduciary duty .  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 193 –203; 238 –45.)  In a nutshell, Emrich contends that \nHornwood breached its fiduciary duties owed derivatively to Triangle and directly to \nEmrich in several respects, including  by: ( 1) surreptitiously entering into a joint \nventure agreement with Borgstena to compete directly with Triangle; (2) threatening \nto cease manufacturing and to unilaterally withdraw from Triangle; (3) mismanaging \nthe transition from Bondtex to Mueller for  fabric lamination; (4) failing to properly \naddress quality control issues with the Freightliner program; (5) unjustifia bly \nincreasing the price it charged Triangle for fabric; (6) preventing settlement proceeds \nfrom being paid to Emrich; (7) failing to act reasonably to collect Triangle’s past-due \naccounts receivable; (8) ceasing to make  advanced payments to Emrich; and (9) \nmischaracterizing income in Triangle’s accounting and tax records. \n116. Defendants contend that Hornwood does not owe fiduciary duties  directly \nto Emrich because Hornwood lacks requisite control over Triangle. Hornwood further \ncontends that the b usiness judgment rule, economic loss rule, and proximate cause \nissues bar claims three, four, and seven through nine by Emrich.  The Court will \naddress each of Defendants’ contention in turn.   \na. Hornwood’s Control of Triangle \n117. “The North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act does not create \nfiduciary duties among members.”  Finkel v. Palm Park, Inc., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 38, \n \n \nat *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 11, 2019) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  As a \ngeneral rule, “[m]embers of a limited liability company are like shareholders in a \ncorporation in that members do not owe a fiduciary duty to each other or to the \ncompany.”  Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 473 (2009).  “The rights \nand duties  of LLC members are ordinarily governed by the company’s operating \nagreement, not by general principles of fiduciary relationships.”  Strategic Mgmt. \nDecisions v. Sales Performance Int’l , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *10– 11 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Aug. 7, 2017).   \n118. However, in some circumstances, “a holder of a majority interest who \nexercises control over the LLC owes a fiduciary duty to minority interest members.”  \nVanguard Pai Lung, LLC v. Moody , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *17 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJune 19, 2019).  “Thus, when the operating agreement confers controlling authority \non the majority member, [the majority member] owes a duty not to use its control to \nharm the minority, assuming no other provision disclaims such a duty.”  Id. at *21. \n119. It is undisputed that  Hornwood became the majority member of Triangle \non 1 January 2018 when Bondtex’s withdrawal became effective.  (Defs.’ Ex. 16 at 1.)   \n120. Defendants contend that “[t]here are no facts to demonstrate that \nHornwood had the requisite  control over Triangle[.]”  (Br. Supp. De fs.’ Mot. 32.)   \nEmrich’s position is that “abundant evidence shows that Hornwood controls Triangle, \nand thus owes fiduciary duties directly to Emrich Enterprises.”  (Resp. Defs.’ Mot. \n28.)  The Court agrees with Emrich. \n \n \n121. It is undisputed that Hornwood is the majority member of Triangl e.  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 16.)  Due to its status as a member of Triangle, Hornwood is \n“also a Manager of [Triangle] for all purposes.”  (Op. Agreement § 3.1.)  It is further \nundisputed that Hornwood owned all of the manufacturing facilities where Triangle’s \nproducts were manufactured and Emrich was not capable of manufacturing \nTriangle’s products without Hornwood.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31–32.) \n122. Furthermore, the Operating Agreement provides tha t “all decision s with \nrespect to the management of the business and affairs of [Triangle] shall be made by \naction of a Majority Interest of the Members[.]”   (Op. Agreement § 3.1.)   The \nOperating Agreement does not address or disclaim fiduciary duties.   \n123. The undisputed evidence before the Court indicates that Hornwood acted \nunilaterally to decide financial issues of Triangle, including unilaterally deciding, and \ninforming Emrich without debate, that Hornwood would increase the prices it \ncharged Triangle for its production of fabric and that Emrich would no longer be paid \na sales commission.  Hornwood further controlled the bank account for Triangle. \n124. Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that there is sufficient \nevidence to support Emrich’s claim that Hornwood both served Triangle in a fiduciary \ncapacity and owed fiduciary duties directly to Emrich. \nb.  The Business Judgment Rule  \n125. Defendants additionally contend that Hornwood’s conduct and specifically \nthat conduct that Emrich contends was improper is insulated under the business \njudgment rule.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 3 2.)  Specifically, Defendants contend that a \n \n \npresumption of good faith applies to  Hornwood’s management of (1) the CVG trials, \n(2) Triangle’s transition to Mueller for lamination, (3) Triangle’s accounting and tax \nrecords and (4) cash distributions to Triangle’s members.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 33–\n35.)  In each case, Defendants argue  that there is no evidence that Hornwood acted \nunreasonably or in bad faith in its management decisions and that the record viewed \nin the light most favorable to Emrich  is insufficient to rebut the  business judgment \nrule’s presumption of good faith.   \n126. In some in stances, Managers of an LLC may be entitled to protections \nafforded by the business judgment rule.  Mooring  Capital Fund, LLC v. Comstock \nN.C., LLC, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 32, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 13, 2009).   \n127. In North Carolina,  the business judgment rule creates, first, an evidentiary \npresumption that in making a decision, the managers acted on an informed basis and \nin good faith in the honest bel ief that their decision  was in the best interest of the \nLLC, and second, absent rebuttal of the initial presumption,  the rule creates  a \npowerful substantive presumption that a decision by a loyal and informed manager  \nwill not be overturned by a court unles s it ca nnot be attributed to any rational \nbusiness purpose .  See Adum v. Albemarle Plantation Prop. Owners Ass'n , 2021 \nNCBC LEXIS 6, at *38–39 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 19, 2021).  \n128.  “A plaintiff may overcome the presumption with proof that [ the manager] \nfailed to act (1) in good faith, (2) in the honest belief that the action taken was in the \nbest interest of the company or (3) on an informed basis. ”  Holland v. Warren, 2020 \nNCBC LEXIS 146, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 15, 2020) (cleaned up). Evidence that \n \n \na manager was inattentive, uni nformed, acted in bad faith, or made a decision that \nis unreasonable may be considered in determining that the business judgment rule \ndoes not apply to protect alleged misdeeds .  See Wachovia Capital Partners, LLC v. \nFrank Harvey Inv. Family L.P., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 5, \n2007). \n(1) The CVG Trials   \n129. Based on the evidence of record, the Court concludes that Hornwood’s  \nalleged failure to communicate the correct specifications to Mueller prior to the CVG \ntrials is not the type of conduct protected by the business judgment rule.  The business \njudgment rule recognizes that business decisions are best left in the hands of \ninformed and experienced boards of directors and managers.  Courts “are ill equipped \nto engage in post hoc substantive review of business decisions.” In re The Walt Disney \nCo. Derivative Litig., 907 A.2d 693, 746 (Del. Ch. 2005)  (emphasis added). Business \ndecisions “involve judgments by the board as to whether to enter into a course of \nconduct, generally one that creates new rights or obligations on behalf of the \ncompany. . . [and] involves weighing the risks and rewards of future conduct, which \nis the type of decision -making process the business judgment rule is designed to \nprotect.”  Tindall v. First Solar, 892 F.3d 1043, 1047 (9th Cir. 2018).    \n130. By contrast, a  ministerial act “ involves obedience to instructions, but \ndemands no special discretion, judgment or skill.”  Ministerial , Black’s Law \nDictionary (4th ed. 1951).   \n \n \n131. In the present case, the alleged tortious act by Hornwood through its agents \nregarding communication with Muel ler about CVG’s specifications and overseeing \nthe manufacturing and delivery process was not a “business decision” as \ncontemplated by the  business judgment  rule, but was instead in the nature of a \nministerial act.  Plaintiff’s evidence tends to indicate th at CVG sent Hornwood the \ntrial specifications, and that Hornwood failed to accurately convey that information \nto Mueller, causing Triangle to submit samples to CVG in the wrong quantity with \nfoam of the wrong thickness and with excessive fabric defects.  (Second Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 69–70; see Fenton Aff. ¶¶ 27–28.)  Hornwood’s communication to Mueller of CVG’s \nspecifications was a ministerial act that did not involve either judgment as to whether \nto enter into a course of conduct, or  a weighing of the risks and rewards  of future \nconduct.  Likewise, the alleged failure to properly oversee manufacturing and quality \nassurance is similarly ministerial.  This is not the type of situation where Hornwood’s \ndecisions and conduct are  protected by the business judgment rule from critical \nreview.  Therefore, the Motion is DENIED to the extent it seeks dismissal of Emrich’s \nbreach of duty claim regarding the CVG trials.   \n(2)  Triangle’s Transition to Mueller \n132. Emrich argues that Hornwood ’s reliance on Hornwood customer service \nrepresentative Scott Dutton to perform certain tasks essential to the Mueller \ntransition, and Hornwood’s exclusion of Emrich and Norman  Willis from \ncommunicating with Mueller constituted lack of attention , unreasonable decision-\nmaking, and a breach of loyalty.  (Emrich Resp. 36–37.) \n \n \n133.  The record indicates that , at a 1 November 2018 meeting , Willis and \nrepresentatives of Mueller  expressed concerns  to Hornwood regarding Hornwood \nemployee Dutton’s ability to handle the transition from Bondtex to Mueller, but that \nChuck Horne expressed confidence in Dutton and kept him in charge of handling the \nMueller transition.  (Willis Aff. ¶ 19.)   \n134. The record indicates that Wesley Horne and Chuck Horne  routinely \nchecked-in with Dutton regarding his work for Triangle on the transition to Mueller.  \n(Hornwood 30(b)(6) Dep. 238:14–25.) \n135. There is an apparent dispute of fact over whether a 2 November 2018 \nshipment of Triangle’s product was delayed,  and, if so,  whether it was the fault of \nDutton.  Emrich proffers the affidavit of Willis to state that a shipping delay occurred \nunder the oversight of Dutton.  (Willis Aff. ¶ 21.)  Emails between John Emrich and \nChuck Hornwood indicate that the shipment was not delayed.  (Pl.’s Ex. 14 at 2, ECF \nNo. 151.14.)  However, this  dispute is immaterial because regardless of whether or \nnot a shipping delay occurred, the undisputed record also indicates that Mueller, and \nnot Dutton, was responsible for the product shipments at issue.  (See Pl.’s Ex. 14 at \n2.) \n136. The record indicates that Hornwood was attentive to Dutton’s performance \nin his role for Triangle.  Thus, Emrich has failed to provide sufficient evidence, at this \nstage, to suggest that Hornwood was inattentive, uninformed, acted in bad faith, or \nacted unreasonably.   \n \n \n137. The Court further concludes that the conduct at issue here is in the nature \nof conduct coming within the ambit of the business judgment rule.  Plaintiff has failed \nto come forward with evidence rebutting the presumption arising under the rule.   \nTherefore, except as set forth above in section b.(1), the Motion is GRANTED to the \nextent Defendants seek dismissal of Emrich’s breach of duty claim regarding \nHornwood’s management of Triangle’s transition to Mueller.  \n(3)  Triangle’s Accounting and Tax Records  \n138. Hornwood argues that the business judgment rule protects its management \nof Triangle’s accounts receivable and that, even without application of the rule, there \nis no breach of duty because  Hornwood kept regularly informed regarding the  \naccounts receivable and took reasonable action to collect payment.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. \n35.)  Plaintiff responds that Hornwood failed to  properly collect Triangle’s accounts \nreceivable.  (Emrich Resp. 37.)      \n139. The record contains evidence of  Triangle’s efforts to collect past -due \nreceivables from Triangle customers CV G and Plasticoat.  (See Phipps Dep. 214:14, \nW. Horne Aff.  ¶ 6, ECF No. 177 .)  On several occasions, CVG  fell behind on its \npayments to Triangle  and Hornwood made efforts to collect  the amounts owed  \napproximately “once or twice a month.”  (Phipps Dep. 214:14.)   In February 2019, \nJohn Emrich and Phipps  worked with CVG to establish a better flow of payments \nfrom CVG to Triangle.  (Emrich 13 Aug. 2020 Dep. 238:19–239:25., ECF No. 147.8.)  \nAnother Triangle customer, Plasticoat, owed Triangle $85,000 in past-due receivables \nas of 14 September 2020.   (Emrich Decl. Ex. 8, 1.)  On 16 September 2020, John \n \n \nEmrich contacted Hornwood’s Treasurer, Paula McCaskill , about the past -due \nreceivables, and Triangle received full payment  from Plasticoat two weeks later on \n30 September 2020.  (W. Horne Aff. ¶ 6, Exs. B–D.) \n140. These facts are not sufficient to demonstrate that Defendants’ actions were \noutside the realm of the business judgment rule , were improper, or caused Plaintiff \nharm.  Therefore, the Motion is GRANTED to the extent Defendants seek dismissal \nof Emrich’s breach of duty claim  regarding management of Triangle’s accounts \nreceivable.  \n141. Hornwood also argue s that the business judgment rule protects  its \nmanagement of Triangle’s tax records.   Emrich contends that Hornwood cause d \nEmrich’s tax forms to erron eously classify Emrich’s income by failing to report \ncommission payments by Triangle to Emrich on a Form 10 99.  (Emrich Resp. 37.)  \nThe record indicates that Emrich’s 2018 tax documents, including  Emrich’s Form \n1099, were erroneous due to a clerical mistake in  Triangle’s computer system .  \n(McCaskill Aff. ¶ 13.)  Defendants maintain that discrepancies on Emrich’s Form  \n1099 were clerical errors and that Hornwood has addressed these errors with \nTriangle’s accountant.  ( Defs.’ Br. Supp. 35.)  Indeed, at the time of the briefing on \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment, it appeared from the record that , at \nHornwood’s instruction, revised tax records were  being prepared.  (McCaskill Aff. ¶ \n13–14.)  While these facts could indicate negligence on the part of Defendants, \nPlaintiff has not shown how it was injured by the alleged misconduct.  Therefore, the \n \n \nMotion is GRANTED to the extent Defendants seek dismissal of Emrich’s breach of \nduty claim regarding Triangle’s tax records.               \n(4)   Halting Cash Distributions \n142. Plaintiff claims that Hornwood breached its duty to Triangle and Emrich \nby refusing to distribute available funds to the members of Triangle. \n143. Plaintiff argues that  Hornwood’s decision to cease payments to Emrich, \ntogether with Hornwood’s decision to charge Triangle higher prices for its fabric, both \nbeginning in June 2019, indicate bad faith on the part of Hornwood  and rebuts the \npresumption afforded Defendants by the  business judgment rule.  However, t he \nrecord reflects that, as of May 2020, Triangle had over $180,000 in past due accounts \npayables and as of November 2020, was experiencing net losses.  (C. Horne Aff. ¶ 7.)  \nIn fact, t he record indicates that Hornwood called for Triangle ’s members to \ncontribute capital to Triangle to e nsure Triangle retained sufficient cash to operate, \n(C. Horne Aff. ¶ 8.),  and that when Emrich refused to do so, Hornwood loaned \n$120,000 to Triangle to meet its ongoing expenses.  (C. Horne Aff. ¶ 12.)  Furthermore, \neven though Hornwood increased its prices charged to Triangle, Hornwood continued \nto charge Triangle less than the market rate.  (Hornwood Letter ¶ 2.) \n144. Based on the record before it, the Court determines that Plaintiff has not \nsubmitted sufficient evidence to rebut the presum ption afforded by the business \njudgment rule  that Defendants acted in good faith when deciding to halt cash \ndistributions—particularly when the record reflects  that Triangle faced financial \ndifficulty less than one year later.  Because the business judgment rule applies to the \n \n \nconduct at issue and because Emrich has not rebutted the presumption afforded by \nthe rule, the Motion is therefore GRANTED to the extent Defendants seek dismissal \nof Emrich’s breach of duty claim regarding cash distributions to Triangle’s members. \nc.  The Economic Loss Rule \n145. Defendants seek summary judgment as  to Plaintiff’s claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty regarding Hornwood’s decision to raise the prices it charged Triangle \nfor fabric.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 36.)  Defendants do not argue that the business \njudgment rule insulates this conduct,8 but instead contend solely that the economic \nloss rule bars the claim because the claim is “solely based on Hornwood’s contractual \nobligation in the Joint Venture Agreement and not Hornwood’s fiduciary relationship \nwith Triangle.” (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 36.)   \n146. “The economic loss rule, as it has developed in North Carolina, generally \nbars recovery in tort for damages arising out of a breach of contract[.]”  Rountree v. \nChowan Cty., 252 N.C. App. 155, 159 (2017).   A claimant may not maintain a tort \naction, “against a party to a contract who simply fails to properly perform the  terms \nof the contract, even if that failure to perform was due to the negligent or intentional \nconduct of that party, when the injury resulting from the breach is damage to the \nsubject matter of the contract.”  Lord v. Customized Consulting Specialty, Inc. , 182 \nN.C. App. 635, 639 (2007).  “To state a viable claim in tort for conduct that is also \n \n8 Defendants’ decision to not claim entitlement to  summary judgment on the basis of  the \nbusiness judgment rule is consistent with this Court’s prior decisions.  In selling its fabric to \nTriangle, Hornwood was engaged in a self -interested transaction.  “While it may be \nappropriate for a fiduciary to negotiate in his own interest, it does n ot follow that  he is \nentitled to the business judgment rule when doing so.”  Ehmann v. Medflow, Inc., 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 88, *45–46 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017).   \n \n \nalleged to be a breach of contract, ‘a plaintiff must also allege a duty owed to him by \nthe defendant separate and distinct from any duty owed under a contract.’ ”   Akzo \nNobel Coatings, Inc. v. Rogers, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *48 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 3, \n2011) (quoting Kelly v. Georgia- Pacific LLC , 671 F. Supp. 2d 785, 791 (E.D.N.C. \n2009)).   \n147. This Court has observed that “a contracting party may have fiduciary \nduties to his counterparty that are separate and distinct from his contractual duties \nand thus may be enforceable in tort.”   Kixsports, LLC v. Munn , 2021 NCBC LEXIS \n32, at *17  (N.C. Super. Ct. April 1, 2021) ; see also Perry v. Frigi -Temp Frigeration, \nInc., 2020 NCBC LEXIS 100, at *17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2020).  Here, Emrich’s \nclaims for breach of fiduciary duty against Hornwood arise from the duties Hornwood \nowed as majority member and manager  of Triangle.  Those duties are independent  \nfrom any cont ractual duties the  operating agreement  may require of  Hornwood.  \nThus, the economic loss rule does not bar Emrich’s claims.  \n148. Accordingly, t he Court concludes that  Emrich has come forward with \nsufficient evidence to demonstrate both a breach of fiduciary duty by Hornwood and \nan injury such that summary judgment on this claim would be improper.  \nd. Proximate Cause \n149. Defendants next contend that even if Hornwood breached fiduciary duties \nowed to Emrich concerning the CVG  Trials and its conduct is not insulated by the \nbusiness judgment rule , “there is no evidence Hornwood’s alleged acts proximately \ncaused damage to Triangle.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 36.)   Emrich replies that the \n \n \nrecord contains ample evidence to suggest that Hornwood’s actions in preparation for \nthe CVG trials and Triangle’s subsequent performance in the CVG  Trials were the \ndirect cause of Triangle losing the Freightliner program and failing to obtain the M2 \nprogram.  \n150. Proximate cause is “a cause which in natural and continuous sequence, \nunbroken by any new and independent cause, produced the plaintiff’s injuries, and \nwithout which the injuries would not have occurred.”  Adams v. Mills, 312 N.C. 181, \n192 (1984).  Proximate cause exists only where “the risk of injury . . . is within the \nreasonable foresight of the defendant.”  Williams v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 296 \nN.C. 400, 403 (1979).  “Proximate cause is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury” \nand courts should decide proximate cause as a matter of law “only in exceptional \ncases, in which reasonable minds cannot differ as to the foreseeability of injury.”  Id.   \n151. This is not such a case.  There is evidence in the record indicating that, but \nfor Hornwood’s alleged misconduct, Triangle would have maintained the Freightliner \nprogram.  Emrich has provided  evidence that Triangle, through Hornwood, did not \ninform Mueller of CVG ’s specifications for foam thickness and roll length.  ( Fenton \nAff. ¶¶ 27–28.)  The record also indicates that the CVG Trials were held following a \nseries of quality control issues with Triangle products, and that the outcome of the \nFreightliner Trials “led CVG to conclude that Triangle was not reliable and . . . that \nissues would continue with Triangle if Triangle remained the supplier[.]”  ( Fenton \nAff. ¶ 34.)  On the other hand, Hornwood presents evidence that Hornwood  \ncommunicated CVS’s trial specifications to Mueller.  ( See Defs.’ Ex. 20 , 5, ECF No. \n \n \n151.20.)  Given the  conflicting evidence , reasonable minds can differ as to the \nforeseeability of injury.  As a result, the issue of proximate cause must be determined \nby the jury, and Defendants’ Motion on this point is DENIED.              \ne.  Lost Profits \n152. Defendants contend that Emrich’s breach of fiduciary duty claim s seeking \nlost profits from the Freightliner program and the M2 program should be dismissed \nbecause Emrich has failed to establish lost profits with any reasonable degree of \ncertainty.  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 39–40.) \n153. In support of its claim for lost profits, Emrich relies on Erik Lioy’s (“Lioy”) \nexpert report, which Defendants contend is “based on numerous assumptions that \nare ‘purely speculative in nature[.]’ ”   (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 39.)   Defendants argue \nthat Lioy’s expert report fails to establish lost profits with reasonable certainty  \nbecause it is not based on “economic and financial data, market surveys and analysis, \nor business records of similar enterprises.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 40.)  Defendants \nfurther contend Lioy’s expert report ignores “the Bondtex exit, the Mueller problems, \nthe lack of agreement bet ween Triangle and CVG, Guilford’s efforts, no vertical \nintegration at Triangle, [and] Triangle’s precarious financial position[.]”  (Br. Supp. \nDefs.’ Mot. 40.)   Conversely,  Emrich contends that Lioy’s opinion  is reliable, data -\ndriven, and satisfies the requisite standard to survive summary judgment. \n154. Under North Carolina law, “the party seeking damages bears the burden of \nshowing that the amount of damages is based upon a standard that will allow the \nfinder of fact to calculate the amount of damages with reasonable certainty.”  Olivetti \n \n \nCorp. v. Ames Business Systems, Inc., 319 N.C. 534, 546 (1987).  For parties seeking \nto recover lost profits, “[a]bsolute certainty is not required but evidence of damages \nmust be sufficiently specific and complete to permit the jury to arrive at a reasonable \nconclusion.”  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Godwin Bldg. Supply Co., 292 N.C. 557, 561 (1977).   \n155. Defendants cite language from Iron Steame r, Ltd. v. Trinity Restaurant, \nInc. to support their argument that Lioy’s report is insufficient because it is not based \non “expert testimony, economic and financial data, market surveys and analysis, and \nbusiness records of similar enterprises.”   110 N.C. App. 843 , 849 (1993).  But Iron \nSteamer dealt with an  “unestablished resort restaurant ,” a factual scenario  \nmaterially distinguishable from the facts in this case.  Id.   \n156. Triangle is an established business that has operated since 2006.  Triangle’s \npast dealings with CVG and the Freightliner program enabled Lioy, when preparing \na forecast of lost sales, to “perform an analysis of the historical sales by Triangle and \nGuilford Mills under the CVG/Freightliner Program.” (Exp. Report. Erik C. Lioy ¶ 54, \nECF No. 151.42. [“Lioy Report”].)  Further, Lioy arrived at a discount rate by taking \ninto account “the nature of the cash flow stream, risk, timing, and interest rate \nenvironment.”  (Lioy Report ¶ 66.)  Lioy’s report is sufficiently specific to allow a jury \nto arrive at a reasonable conclusion.  As a result, Defendants’ Motion is DENIED to \nthe extent it seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s claim for lost profits.   \n \n \nVI.     CONCLUSION \n157. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS  Plaintiff’s Motion \nand GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants’ Motion as follows: \nA.
