Pending before the Court is  Defendant GCP Apartment Investors, LLC ’s \n(“GCP”) Motion to Appoint a Receiver.  For the following reasons, the Court DENIES \nthe motion without prejudice. \nShumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP , by Daniel R. Hansen , William H. \nSturges, Megan M. Stacy, and Steven M. Berman, for Plaintiffs.  \n \nJames McElroy & Diehl, P.A. , by John R. Buric and John R. Brickley, \nfor Defendant.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \n2. This litigation arises out of a management dispute between the members of \n759 Ventures, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company  that invests in real \nestate.  (V. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 3, 4, 15, ECF No. 34 [“Compl.”].)  Plaintiff Guardian GC, \nLLC (“Guardian”) owns a two-thirds membership interest in 759 Ventures, and GCP \nowns the other third.  (Compl. ¶ 3.)  At the time 759 Ventures was created  in 2013, \nGuardian and GCP a greed to serve as  equal co-managers, though whether that \ncontinues to be true today is hotly contested.  (Operating Agreement of 759 Ventures \nLLC § 6.1(a), (b), ECF No. 35 [“Op. Agr.”]; see Compl. ¶ 4.) \n3. 759 Ventures does not directly own property but instead holds membership \ninterests “in four single-purpose [entities], each of which owns or did own real estate \nin Charlotte, North Carolina.”  ( Compl. ¶ 15.)  These  subsidiary entities, all North \nCarolina limited liability companies, are: (1) Vyne Residential, LLC (“Vyne”); (2) 28th \nRO Commercial, LLC (“RO Comme rcial”); (3) 28 th RO Land, LLC (“RO Land”); and \n(4) Edgeline Residential, LLC (“Edgeline”) .  (Compl. ¶ 15.)  759 Ventures is the sole \nmanager of each entity.  (Compl. ¶¶ 24, 63, 64, 93.) \n4. The properties owned by the four subsidiaries are in various stages o f \ndevelopment.  Vyne sold its only asset, a condominium complex, for a substantial sum \nin 2016 and currently possesses only a small amount of cash.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 26–27; \nAff. Mazzone ¶ 32, ECF No. 76.1.)  RO Land was originally formed “to develop  more \nthan 135 residential units” in two phases, but development has not begun, and the \nland currently serves as a parking lot for tenants of the adjacent building owned by \nRO Commercial.  ( Aff. Mazzone ¶¶ 9 –10; Compl. ¶ 61.)  Finally, part of Edgeline’s \nproperty is home to thirty-six leased residential units, and the adjacent, undeveloped \nland is approved for sixty-nine additional units.  (Aff. Mazzone ¶ 11.)   \n5. It isn’t clear when Guardian and GCP began to have significant \nmanagement disagreements, but by mid -2016, their relationship was under stress. \nWhen Vyne sold its real property, most of the proceeds were immediately distributed \nto its members, including 759 Ventures.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 25–33.)  It appears, though, \nthat Vyne reserved $1.75 million at the direction of GCP, acting through its principal, \nMax Mazzone.  (See Compl. ¶ 34.)  About six months later, Mazzone sent a letter to \nGuardian stating that Vyne was distributing the reserved funds , that 759 Ventures \nwas making a corresponding distribution to its members, and that Guardian’s share \nof the distribution would be withheld pending certain actions by  Guardian.  ( See \nCompl. ¶ ¶ 36–37, Ex. 7.)  Guardian asserts that  GCP’s actions breached 75 9 \nVentures’ operating a greement, which  authorizes distributions only “upon the \nconsent of those Managers holding a majority” in interest.  (Op. Agr. § 7.3(b); Compl. \n¶ 21.)   \n6. Guardian also alleges that it was locked out of important management \ndecisions for RO Commercial and the other properties.  ( See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 65, 94.)  \nIn late 2016 and early 2017,  for example, RO Commercial began negotiating new \nleases with its commercial tenants, including Amelie’s French Bakery (“Amelie’s”).   \n(Compl. ¶¶ 60, 72–73.)  Correspondence attached to the amended complaint reveals \nsharp disagreements between Guardian and GCP about the length of any lease, \nAmelie’s use of RO Land’s property for parking, and related considerations.  ( See \nCompl. Exs. 18–20.)  Guardian alleges that GCP conducted the negotiations without \nGuardian’s input and did so in a way that harmed the relationship with Amelie’s and \nother tenants.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 65–66, 75, 84–88.)  \n7. Guardian brought this action in March 2017.  (See ECF No. 1.)  Its verified \namended complaint asserts claims, individually and derivatively on behalf of 759 \nVentures, to remove GCP as manager  for breaching 759 Ventures’ operating \nagreement.  (Compl. ¶¶ 103–24, 126–36.)   \n8. GCP responded by filing counterclaims, including a counterclaim for judicial \ndissolution of 759 Ventures.  (Def.’s Aff. Defenses, Answer & Countercl.  ¶¶ 24–26, \nECF No. 53 [“Countercl.”].)  GCP alleges it and Guardian “are deadlocked on \nmanagement decisions” regarding each of the properties ow ned by 759 Ventures’ \nsubsidiaries.  (Countercl. ¶ 11.)   \n9. After exchanging limited discovery, the parties  attempted to resolve their \ndifferences through voluntary mediation.  During that process, the parties considered \nselling the subsidiaries’ real propert ies.  ( See Jt. Mot. Am. Case Mgmt. Order ¶  5, \nECF No. 69.)  They reported an impasse in early January 2018.   \n10. On March 12, 2018, GCP moved to appoint a receiver to take control of 759 \nVentures and its four subsidiaries pending the outcome of the litigation.  (Def.’s Mot. \nto Appt. Rec., ECF No. 76 [“Mot.”].)  GCP asserts that it and Guardian are deadlocked \nas to the management of 759 Ventures and the properties owned by each subsidiary.  \n(Mot. ¶ 1.)  Believing that property values are “currently at a historically high level,” \nGCP would prefer to sell the properties owned by RO Commercial, RO Land, and \nEdgeline.  (Aff. Mazzone ¶¶  20–21.)  GCP also wants to perform an audit of Vyne’s \noperations and then dissolve the company.  (See Aff. Mazzone ¶ 33.)  It contends that \nGuardian is standing in the way, demanding to hold and develop the properties.  (See \nAff. Mazzone ¶¶ 9, 13, 19.) \n11. Guardian opposes the motion, denying that the parties are deadlocked and \narguing that the motion is premature.  According to Guardian, the record is unsettled \nbecause the parties have not yet completed discovery on the alleged management \ndisagreements.  Guardian also asserts that, if it were to prevail on its claim to remove \nGCP as manager,  any management deadlock would be lifted.  Guardian has since \nfiled a motion for summary judgment on its claim to remove GCP as manager, which \nremains pending.  (ECF No. 87.) \n12. The Court heard argument on May 2, 2018.  At the hearing, Guardian \nagreed that it would be appropriate  to dissolve Vyne.  Guardian also stated that it \nwas willing to sell the property owned by RO Land , depending on the outcome of  a \nfeasibility study.  GCP did not object to conducting such a study prior to soliciting or \nentertaining offers. \n13. The motion is ripe for determination. \nII. \nANALYSIS \n \n14. The question before the Court is whether to appoint a receiver to take \npossession of 759 Ventures and manage its assets as a prejudgment remedy.  On this \nrecord, the answer is no. \n15. The appointment of a receiver is “a harsh remedy.”  Neighbors v. Evans, 210 \nN.C. 550, 554, 187 S.E. 796, 798 (1936).  It “takes custody” of the disputed property \nout of the parties’ hands “on an interlocutory order, before the court has had an \nopportunity to hear the merits of the case.”  Woodall v. N.C. Joint Stock Land Bank, \n201 N.C. 428, 432, 160 S.E. 475, 478 (1931) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \nFor that reason, “[t]he right to relief must be clearly shown and also . . . that there is \nno other safe and expedient remedy.”  Neighbors, 210 N.C. at 554, 187 S.E. at 798. \n16. For actions involving claims to dissolve an LLC, our General Assembly has \nauthorized trial courts to “appoint one or more persons to serve as a receiver to \nmanage the business of the LLC pending the court’s decision on dissolution.”  N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 57D-6-04(a).  That does not mean receivership is automatic or routine in \ndissolution disputes.  It is not.  In one of the few opinions addressing section 57D-6-\n04(a), this Court held that the appointment of a receiver “is contingent upon first \nreaching a determination that [the moving party] will likely succeed on the merits of \n[its] claim for judicial dissolution.”  Battles v. Bywater, LLC, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 54, \nat *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 31, 2014) ; see also Witz, Biedler & Co. v. Gray, 116 N.C. \n48, 55, 20 S.E. 1019, 1020 (1895)  (“[P]laintiffs are not entitled to have this ancillary \nrelief [of the appointment of a receiver] unless they are entitled to the main relief \ndemanded in their complaint[.]”). \n17. The premise of GCP’s claim for dissolution and its motion for appointment \nof a receiver is the same: that it and Guardian “are hopelessly deadlocked on how to \nmanage 759 Ventures and, particularly, what to do with and how to maximize the \nvalue of each and every asset of 759 Ventures.”  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. for Appt. Rec. \n2, ECF No. 77 [“Br. Supp.”].)   If true, this would be a valid basis for judicial \ndissolution.   By statute, the Court may dissolve an LLC if the complaining member \nestablishes that “it is not pract icable to conduct the LLC’s business in conformance \nwith the operating agreement and ” governing statutes .  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  57D-6-\n02(2).  This language “embrace[s] .  . . management deadlock as a valid grounds for \ndissolution” and, in appropriate circumstances, provides a basis for the appointment \nof a receiver.  Battles, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 54, at *22, 24–25. \n18. The deadlock in Battles was undeniable.  The LLC’s “member-managers \n[were] unable to reach agreement with respect to even the most basic management \ndecisions,” including “day-to-day operations.”  Id. at * 17, 22.  Coupled with mutual \n“accusations of corporate mismanagement and malfeasance ,” this complete and \n“persisting management deadlock” posed “a constant and imminent threat of \nirreparable damage” t o the LLC.   Id. at *19.   On that basis, the Court  found a \nlikelihood of success on the underlying claim for dissolution and appointed a receiver \npending a final decision.   See id. at *19–20, 24–25 .   \n19. Here, the evidence is far less compelling.  Although the parties undoubtedly \nhave their disagreements, they are neither so deep nor so entrenched as to warrant \nthe appointment of a receiver at this relatively early stage.  \n20. Indeed, at the hearing, counsel acknowledged that the parties are more or \nless on the same page as to two of the four properties.   They now agree that Vyne \nshould first be audited, followed by dissolution and winding up its operations .  (See \nalso Aff. Mazzone ¶  33.)  In addition, both parties wish to sell RO Land’s property \npending the outcome of a feasibility study, which they agree must be conducted.  (See \nalso Aff. Mazzone ¶¶  20–21.)  Although they may not agree on all the details , it is \nclear that Guardian and GCP are not deadlocked as to the appropriate next steps in \nthe management of Vyne and RO Land.   \n21. Disagreements about RO Commercial and Edgeline  run deeper.  GCP has \nreceived several unsolicited offers to purchase the properties, and its desire to accept \nthe best offer appears to be unequivocal.  (See Aff. Mazzone ¶¶ 13, 20, 22.)  Guardian, \non the other hand, is content to hold and develop the property. \n22. Even so, these disagreements have not made it impracticable to operate the \nbusinesses.  The properties owned by RO Commercial and Edgeline are managed by \nthird parties, who handle their day-to-day operations.  (See Aff. Whitley ¶ 3, ECF No. \n76.3.)  There is some evidence that Guardian and GCP’s disagreements  have made \nthings more challenging for the property managers , but the properties continue to \nfunction and generat e income.  ( See Aff. Whitley ¶  5; Aff. Mazzone ¶¶  12, 18.)  \nEdgeline, for example, holds over half a million dollars in cash and generates \nsignificant cash flow from the payment of monthly rents.   (See Aff. Mazzone ¶¶  11, \n12.)  Our case law strongly disfavors the appointment of a receiver “[w]hen a business \nis an active, solvent corporation or LLC.”  Mooring Capital Fund, LLC v. Comstock \nN.C., LLC, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 32, at *31  (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 13, 2009) ; see also \nCamacho v. McCallum, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 81, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 25, 2016) \n(“Appointment of a receiver is a rare and drastic remedy, especially for solvent \ncompanies, and should be used cautiously.”). \n23. It would be a stretch to say Guardian and GCP  agree as much as they \ndisagree about the operation of 759 Ven tures and its subsidiaries.  Their strained \nrelationship is unlikely to produce vigorous and efficient management.   But t he \nrecord does not reflect the type of “persisting management deadlock” with respect to \n“even the most basic management decisions”  that required the appointment of a \nreceiver in Battles.  See 2014 NCBC LEXIS 54 , at *19, 22.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that GCP has not demonstrated  a likelihood of success on its  claim for \njudicial dissolution. \n24. Even if the record demonstrated a clear, present  deadlock, two other \nconsiderations weigh against appointing a receiver.  ( See Pls.’ Resp. Opp’n to Mot. \nAppt. Rec. 3–5, ECF No. 86.)  First, Guardian has asserted a claim to remove GCP as \nmanager of 759 Ventures .  If Guardian prevails , then as a practical matter, that  \nwould resolve most, if not all, management disputes.  To be clear, this does not mean \nthat the mere existence of Guardian’s claim negates GCP’s  ability to seek a  \nreceivership pending a decision on dissolution.  Rather, a measure  of caution is \nwarranted here because remov al of  GCP as a manager is the point of Guardian’s \nlawsuit, the claim has not yet been tested (such as, for example, through a motion to \ndismiss), and Guardian’s motion for summary judgment is now pending.  It would be \npremature to appoint a prejudgment receiver without giving due consideration to  \nGuardian’s claim.   \n25. Second, because the appointment of a receiver  is “a harsh remedy,” courts \nare reluctant to act in the absence of evidence of “fraud or imminent danger that the \nproperty will be, among other things, lost, destroyed, squandered, or wasted.”  \nWilliams v. Liggett, 113 N.C. App. 812, 816, 440 S.E.2d 331, 333 (1994) (citing Lowder \nv. All Star Mills, Inc., 301 N.C. 561, 577, 273 S.E.2d 247, 256 (1981)).  In Battles, for \nexample, this Court held that a management deadlock was sufficient to justify the \nappointment of a receiver “when coupled with” allegations that the members had \n“engaged in misconduct and misappropriated” the LLC’s funds.  2014 NCBC LEXIS \n54, at *24–25. \n26. The allegations of fraud and misconduct in this case are rather muted.  Each \nside’s pleading alludes to questionable activities by the other, but the allegations \nseldom rise above mere suspicion.  Nothing in the record suggests that, in the absence \nof a receiver ship, Guardian would threaten to misappropriate the assets of 759 \nVentures. \n27. Nor is there any concrete evidence that the properties face the threat of \nimminent, irreparable harm.  Vyne’s assets appear to be insubstantial, and t he \nparties have agreed to dissolve the company .  As to RO Land, the parties have \nproposed and agreed to  conduct a feasibility study before selling the property .  If \nanything, the appointment of a receiver may complicate and delay these processes.   \n28. The other two subs idiaries—Edgeline and RO Commercial—hold income-\nproducing properties  in high -value locations .  Edgeline appears to be solvent and \nprofitable.  RO Commercial faces a more challenging situation, but the parties have \ntaken steps to ensure its solvency, at lea st in the short term.   (See Aff. Mazzone \n¶¶ 17–18.)  Although GCP insists that the parties must act now to take advantage of \nhistorically high property values, there is always uncertainty when it comes to \npredicting future market conditions.   These are not the type of rare and drastic \ncircumstances that would “justify the immediate appointment of a receiver pending \nthe final outcome of the case.”  Williams, 113 N.C. App. at 817, 440 S.E.2d at 334; see \nalso Mooring Capital Fund, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 32, at *34; Kazer v. Peterson, No. 14 \nCVS 293 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 10, 2014) (ECF No. 94).   \n* * * \n29. The management of 759 Ventures isn’t perfect.  Its equal co-management \nstructure invites stalemate without the promise of easy resolution.  But appointing a \nreceiver is a drastic remedy—a last resort.  Here, the parties continue to make efforts \nto overcome their differences, albeit grudgingly.  In the absence of more concrete \nevidence of a true management deadlock and accom panying threat of imminent \nharm, the Court is reluctant to take the management of 759 Ventures out of the \nparties’ hands. \n30. That said, the parties have requested Court review as they work out  the \nnext steps for Vyne and RO Land, and the Court remains willing to take appropriate \naction to facilitate their agreement.  The Court is also mindful of the dynamics of both \nlitigation and 759 Ventures’ business operations.  New factual circumstances or the \nresolution of one or more pending claims may warrant revisiting the issue of a \nreceivership in the future. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n \n31. For the se reasons, the Court DENIES the motion to appoint a receiver \nwithout prejudice.   \n32. The Court also ORDERS that, no later than fourteen days after entry of \nthis Order, Guardian and GCP shall meet and confer to develop a plan for auditing, \ndissolving, and winding-up Vyne; to develop a plan for conducting a feasibility study \nfor the prospective sale of RO Land; and to file a stipulation or, if necessary, propose \na consent order to this effect .  If the parties cannot reac h full agreement, they shall \nsubmit to the Court a joint report setting out with specificity their disagreements and \npositions. \n \nThis the 9th day of May, 2018. \n /s/ Adam M.
