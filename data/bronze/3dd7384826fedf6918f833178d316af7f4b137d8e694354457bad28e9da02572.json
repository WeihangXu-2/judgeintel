KEL, LLC, 2021 NCBC 72. \nSharpless McClearn Lester Duffy, PA, by Frederick K. Sharpless and \nPamela S. Duffy, for Defendants Leon L. Rives, II and Rives & \nAssociates, LLP. \nNo counsel appeared for Defendant KEL, LLC or for Nominal Defendant \nSteel Tube, Inc. \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n2. This case arises out of a dispute between the co- owners of Steel Tube, Inc.  \nFrom early 2015 until early 2017, W. Avalon Potts and Leon L. Rives, II were Steel \nTube’s only owners, officers, and directors.  Claiming to have discovered an extensive \nscheme of fraud and self- dealing by Rives , Potts filed suit and asserted several  \nderivative claims on Steel Tube’s behalf.  Potts also named Rives & Associates, LLP—\na tax and accounting firm whose managing partner is Rives—as a defendant.   \n3. Not long after the lawsuit began, Potts ousted Rives from Steel Tube.  This \nwas possible because Rives had defaulted on payments that he owed  to the original \nowner of his shares (one of Steel Tube’s founders), who retained a security interest in \nthe shares.  Potts discovered the default, struck a deal to obtain the security interest, \nrepossessed the shares, and dispos ed of them in a public sale .  Rives objected, \nprompting the parties to add another set of claims related to the reasonableness of \nthe sale. \n4. This litigation has been contentious throughout.  At various times, the \nparties have sought emergency relief, filed both prediscovery and postdiscovery  \ndispositive motions, and pursued two rounds of pretrial motions to exclude evidence.  \nPrevious opinions convey much of the procedural history, as well as  the allegations \nand claims, in more detail .  See Potts v. KEL, LLC  (Potts I), 2018 NCBC LEXIS 24 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 27, 2018) (ECF No. 86); Potts v. KEL, LLC (Potts II), 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 30 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 9, 2019) (ECF No. 131); Potts v. KEL, LLC (Potts III), \n2019 NCBC LEXIS 61 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 27, 2019) (ECF No. 151). \n5. The parties tried the surviving claims and issues  before a jury  over eight \ndays.  Below, the Court summarizes the trial evidence, the verdict, and the pending \nmotions. \nA. Evidence at Trial \n6. Steel Tube is a carbon steel and galvanized steel tube manufacturer.  Its \nfounders, Potts  and Roy Lazenby , began the company in 1990 .  Each held a fifty \npercent ownership interest 1 and served as an officer and director for the next \ntwenty-five years .  (See Joint Stipulation of Facts 2, ECF No. 193 [“Joint \nStipulation”]; Trial Test. of Avalon Potts 8:11–14, ECF No. 257.5 [“Potts”]; Trial Test. \nof Roy Lazenby 4:3–10, ECF No. 257.4 [“Lazenby”].) \n7. Sometime before the events giving rise to this case,  Rives & Associates \nbegan performing tax and accounting services for Steel Tube.  Rives, a certified public \naccountant, was the firm’s managing partner.  His father (also named Leon) and his \nbrothers (Kellan and Evan) worked there  as well.  (See Trial Test. of Leon Rives, II \n4:23–5:19, 9:12–15, 103:19 –104:14, 142:13–143:13, ECF No. 257.6 [“Rives”]; Trial \nTest. of Janice Hatchell 6:17–7:4, ECF No. 257.3 [“Hatchell”].) \n \n1 Lazenby actually split his shares with his wife.  For clarity, the Court refers to Lazenby as \nthe owner of the shares.  \n8. In late 2014, Rives and a business associate  tried to buy Steel Tube.  ( See \nRives 1 2:24–13:3.)  Having become familiar with the company’s  operations and \nfinances, Rives saw profit potential .  He  knew, for example,  that Steel Tube’s \nequipment was essentially debt-free.  (See Rives 13:17–14:12.)  If the price was right, \nRives estimated that he and his fellow investor could quadruple their money simply \nby selling the  equipment.  ( See Rives 14:13 –16:5.)  But Potts and Rives could  not \nsettle on terms, and no deal was reached.  (See Potts 12:11–14; Rives 32:2–11.) \n9. As negotiations with Potts faltered , Rives made a separate deal  with \nLazenby.  In a share purchase agreement dated 15 January 2015, Rives agreed to buy \nLazenby’s interest in Steel Tube for $600,000.   (See Joint Stipulation 3; Rives 17:5–\n9; Lazenby 5:17–6:8.)  Rives paid nothing up front.  Rather, the agreement called for \na $20,000 lump sum payment within sixty days and  $6,000 monthly installments \nafterward, and Lazenby reserved a security interest in the shares until the debt was \npaid.  (See Rives 17:5–22; Lazenby 6:15–22.)  Also as part of the deal, Rives assured \nLazenby that Steel Tube would pay for his insurance going forward and promised to \n“protect” Lazenby’s son, Mike, who worked at Steel Tube.  (Rives 82:17–83:9; see also \nLazenby 8:8–17.) \n10. This left Potts and Rives as equal co-owners of Steel Tube.   At their first \nshareholders’ meeting i n February 2015 , they  elected themselves as officers and \ndirectors.  They also discussed an understanding that neither would spend more than \n$25,000 without first consulting the other .  ( See Potts 14:1 –7; Rives 54:11–24.)  \nAccording to Rives, the conversation did not result in a  binding, written agreement.  \n(See Rives 54:25–57:9, 165:3–10.)  Potts, however, testified that Rives made an oral \npromise.  His testimony was corroborated by Janice Hatchell, a close advisor and \nemployee, who attended the meeting.  (See Potts 13:18–14:13, 15:17–16:15; Hatchell \n13:18–14:11.) \n11. Potts believes that Rives never intended to keep this promise.   At trial, he \npresented testimony and other evidence designed to show that Rives began  looting \nSteel Tube through a series of self-interested transactions, concealed his actions, and \nengaged in a pattern of deception. \n12. To start, Potts offered evidence that  Rives planned to pay his debt  to \nLazenby with Steel Tube’s money, rather than his own.  It is undisputed that Rives \ncut a $20,000 check from Steel Tube to Lazenby  to pay the lump sum.  ( See Rives \n81:22–25.)2  Likewise, on the same day as his first shareholders’ meeting with Potts, \nRives began withdrawing $7,500 per month from  Steel Tube’s bank account , more \nthan covering the $6,000 installments due to Lazenby .  (See Rives 57:15 –58:10, \n61:13–25.)  Potts was unaware of any of this and believes that Rives began secretly \ntaking company funds to pay for a personal debt of $600,000 within hours or days of \npromising not to spend over $25,000 without consultation .  (See Potts 17:1–8, 26:1–\n28:2, 113:23–114:1; Rives 58:2–23, 82:12–16.) \n \n2 Rives testified that this payment was also partly to compensate Roy Lazenby for driving a \ntruck for Steel Tube from time to time after his resignation.  (See Rives 80:4–17 (“As long as \nRoy drove a truck, that was okay with me.  And he did and he loved it.” ).)  Lazenby denied \nthis.  (See Lazenby 6:23–25 (“Q. Did you agree to drive a truck for Steel Tube in exchange for \nthat $20,000?  A. No.”).)  \n13. There was also evidence that, around this time, Rives agreed to give Mike \nLazenby a rai se and a guaranteed bonus of $95,000, thus ful filling the pledge to \nprotect him.  Rives testified that Potts approved the guaranteed bonus, (see Rives \n84:3–8), which was supported by a written employment agreement bearing Potts’s \nsignature.  But Hatchell, who took part in the discussions about the terms of the \nagreement, denied this and testified as to differences appearing in a draft version of \nthe agreement, the supposed final version, and the signature page .  ( See Hatchell \n103:7–107:7, 107:19–21.) \n14. Next, Potts pointed to  Rives’s involvement with Elite Tube & Fab, LLC  \n(“Elite Tube”).  Rives and Todd Berrier (another of Rives’s tax clients) formed Elite \nTube in the spring of 2015 but installed their wives as the company’s nominal owners.  \n(Trial Test . of Todd Berrier 5:2 0–6:8, 10:25 –11:3, ECF No. 257.1 [“Berrier”].)  \nAlthough Elite Tube was really a “50/50 partnership” between Rives and Berrier, \n(Berrier 8:22), vesting ownership in their wives meant that “on paper it would not \nappear to be that way,” (Berrier 11:21).  In Berrier’s words, Rives wanted to hide his \nlinks to Elite Tube due to “his affiliation with Steel Tube.”  ( Berrier 11:7.)  Rives \nconfirmed as much.  (See Rives 90:5–17.) \n15. To get Elite Tube up and running , Rives channeled money and equipment \nfrom Steel Tube.  This began with a $120,000 check that Elite Tube used to buy a \npiece of equipment known as a tube bender .  ( See Rives 95:12–14; Berrier 16:18–\n17:14.)  Rives  then moved another piece of equipment known as a roll former  from \nSteel Tube to Elite Tube.  (See Rives 96:13–16; Berrier 9:9–18.)  Rives also arranged \nit so that Mike  Lazenby would receive a commission from Elite Tube for referrals.  \n(See Rives 100:9–15; see also Berrier 12:17–13:11.)  At no point did Rives tell Potts \nabout any of this.  (See Rives 90:18–91:13, 95:12–18, 96:13–16, 100:9–21.)  Likewise, \nBerrier had never heard of Potts and was under the false impression that Rives was \nSteel Tube’s sole owner.  (See Berrier 4:20–5:1.) \n16. Another issue concerned a $62,875 distribution that Rives took at the end of \n2015 to cover his tax liability.  Rives did not deny taking the distribution; rather, he \nmaintained that Potts approved it.  (See Rives 112:25–114:5, 197:11–198:25; see also \nTrial Test. of Diane Tomlin 25:11–20, ECF No. 257.7 [“Tomlin”].)  Potts testified not \nonly that he had not approved the distribution but also that Rives had agreed not to \ntake one  due to Steel Tube’s weak financial position .  (See Potts 5 3:1–9; see also  \nHatchell 43:9–44:24.)  Potts and Hatchell further testified that, at the time Rives said \nhe would not take a distribution, he  had already done so without telling them.  (See \nPotts 54:19–55:3; Hatchell 45:1–16; see also Rives 114:6–13 (“Q. So the answer is, yes, \nwhen you’re meeting with Mr. Potts about it you had already taken the money?   A. \nYes.”), 116:11–18 (“Q. When you met with him on Monday the 21st, you didn’t tell \nhim that you had already taken the money, did you?  A. I don’t know if I did or not.”).) \n17. During trial, Potts  also questioned a transaction involving KEL, LLC —a \ncompany owned and operated by Rives’s brothers.  In April 2016, Rives helped form \nKEL and, shortly after, engaged it to handle Steel Tube’s trucking needs.  (See Rives \n102:15 (“I’m not saying that I didn’t have any invo lvement .  . . .”); see also Rives \n103:7–18, 186:16–187:4.)  Rives did not tell Potts or Hatchell about his involvement \nor that his brothers owned KEL.  (See Rives 104:14–17; Hatchell 57:3–9.)  Asked why, \nRives said that it was none of their business.  (See Rives 105:11–16 (“Q. And you \ndidn’t mention to Mr. Potts or Ms. Hatchell that your brothers owned KEL because, \nin your words, it was none of their business.  A. I agree with you.”); see also  Rives \n106:21–107:2.)  In addition, there was evidence showing that Rives signed all checks \npaid to KEL  rather than having Potts sign them —a departure from the usual \npractice.  ( See Potts 22:1 –11, 34:12–35:20, 88:17–25; Rives 109:21–110:8; Tomlin \n7:10–19, 9:8–15.) \n18. The deal with KEL raised red flags for Hatchell because  Steel Tube had \nalways handled trucking  operations internally  and had made a profit doing so .  \nAccording to Hatchell, Steel Tube began losing money due to KEL’s commissions and \nlax payment of invoices.  In an e-mail exchange with Rives, she remarked that “KEL \nsounds like a very questionable company”  and suggested consulting  a lawyer.   \n(Hatchell 55:9–19.)  Saying nothing about his involvement with KEL or his brothers’ \nownership, Rives promised to investigate and then assured Hatchell that everything \n“should be fine.”  (Hatchell 55:20–56:16; see also Rives 111:3–21.) \n19. In the summer of 2016, Potts and Hatchell grew suspicious.  Hatchell began \ninvestigating Steel Tube’s records and, according to her testimony, discovered Rives’s \ncash withdrawals, payments to Roy Lazenby, and involvement with Elite Tube.  (See \nHatchell 31:25–36:23.)  She also claimed to have discovered that the financial reports \nshe had received from Rives  did not match what was in the company’s computer \nsystem.  (See Hatchell 23:2–16, 33:20–34:2, 57:23–58:9.)  Convinced that the depletion \nof cash was financially ruinous for Steel Tube, Potts confronted Rives .  ( See Potts \n27:16–28:11.)  Rives left the company and did not return.  (See Rives 77:7–78:20.)  To \nease what he believed to be Steel Tube’s dire  condition, Potts injected $3 million of \nhis own money.  (See Potts 59:6–9.) \n20. Steel Tube hired  an accounting firm  to investigate further .  ( See Hatchell \n60:5–16.)  Michael Borden, a CPA with  Cannon & Company , testified that his firm  \nfound errors in Steel Tube’s tax filings .  Its 2015 tax return, for example, misstated \nits end -of-year stock and loan basis, mistreated Rives’s $ 62,875 distribution, and \nimproperly accounted for goodwill and special depreciation.  ( See Trial Test . of \nThomas Borden 8: 2–10:9, 16:15– 17:14, ECF No. 257.2 [“Borden”].)  In addition, a \nform used to convert Steel Tube into  a subchapter S -corporation erroneously \nidentified Rives as a shareholder as of October 2014 rather than January 2015.  (See \nBorden 12:14–13:11.)3  These errors benefited Rives.  ( See, e.g., Rives 29:21–30:11; \nBorden 9:4 –8, 1 5:25–16:8.)  Steel Tube, on the other hand,  incurred expenses in \namending and correcting the filings.  ( See, e.g., Borden 14:8–15:4, 18:22–19:3; Trial \nTest. of Gregory Reagan 41:10–42:5, ECF No. 217 [“Reagan”].) \n21. The parties offered differing views at trial concerning  who was responsible \nfor the tax filings.  Rives testified that he prepared all the forms and that his firm, \n \n3 Rives testified that he and Roy Lazenby had a deal in place by October 2014 that supported \nthe S-corporation election.  (See, e.g., Rives 19:8–10 (“Q. Isn’t it true, sir, that you told the \nIRS that you bought Mr. Lazenby’s shares on October 1s t of 2014?  A. That’s what me and \nRoy had agreed upon.”).)  Lazenby contradicted that testimony.  (See, e.g., Lazenby 13:12–18 \n(“Q. What date did you sell your shares in Steel Tube to Mr. Rives?  A. January the 15th, \n2015.”), 26:19–21 (“Q. Did you still own your shares of [Steel Tube] on January 14, 2015?  A. \nYes.”).) \nRives & Associates, was not responsible.  (See, e.g., Rives 24:15–17, 26:6–13, 118:10–\n23.)  But other evidence showed that Rives used his firm’s so ftware to prepare the \nforms, that his partners and staff reviewed them, that his father was named as the \npaid preparer for the 2015 tax return, and that the cover letter s received by Steel \nTube carried a Rives & Associates logo  and stated that the firm had  prepared the \ndocuments.  (See, e.g., Rives 21:12–23:10, 118:10–123:8; Reagan 44:3–24.) \n22. Two events that occurred after this suit began were also the subject of \ntestimony.  First, the parties stipulated that Rives defaulted on his payments to Roy \nLazenby.  Through an entity called Avalon1, LLC, Potts acquired Lazenby’s security \ninterest and repossessed the shares.  (See Joint Stipulation 3.)  Later, Avalon1 put \nRives’s shares up for bid at a public auction and, as the only bidder, bought them for \n$200,000 on 5 June 2017.  (See Joint Stipulation 3–4.)  The parties disputed whether \nAvalon1 properly notified Rives of the sale and whether the auction price accurately \nreflected the value of the shares.  (See, e.g., Hatchell 95:10–24.)   \n23. Second, although Elite Tube was once a defendant in this case, the claim s \nagainst it were settled before trial.  (See Berrier 20:13–21:5.)  The parties stipulated \nthat Potts recovered $120,000 and certain equipment from Elite Tube.  ( See Potts \n108:13–24.)  Berrier confirmed the settlement during his testimony.  ( See Berrier \n21:18–23.) \n24. Rounding out the trial evidence, Potts  offered the expert testimony of \nGregory Reagan.  One aspect of his testimony related to the code of conduct and \nprofessional standards for CPAs , including obligations to maintain objectivity, to \nmonitor conflicts of interest , and not to deceive clients .  ( See Reagan 47:18–50:19.)  \nAccording to Reagan, Rives & Associates had no “quality control system” to manage  \nconflicts of interest and avoid harm to clients.  (See Reagan 50:13–19.) \n25. Reagan also testified as to damages.  Among other things, Reagan addressed \nhow much money Rives withdrew from Steel Tube,  the amounts given to Roy and \nMike Lazenby to pay Rives’s debt  and related promises, the tax distribution in \nDecember 2015, and losses from the transaction with KEL.   (See, e.g., Reagan 92:7–\n94:21.)   \n26. Reagan further testified that Rives’s misconduct devast ated Steel Tube’s \nworking capital.  (See Reagan 53:23–56:2.)  Comparing working capital in a company \nto “blood in your body ,” Reagan explained that “[i]f you don’t have working capital \nyou can’t operate.”  (Reagan 54:13–15.)  During Rives’s tenure, Steel Tube’s working \ncapital swung from positive $600,000 to negative $1.6 million —a drop so large that \nSteel Tube “became an unstable business, and actually it became insolvent.”  (Reagan \n55:7–16.)  This, he said, contributed to the diminution of Steel Tube’s value by more \nthan $1.3 million, (see Reagan 98:1–20), as well as nearly $300,000 in interest on \nloans to keep the company afloat, (see Reagan 60:8–22, 97:6–25).  Reagan tallied over \n$2.2 million in total damages.4  (See Reagan 98:21–99:1.) \n \n4 This figure was substantially less than Potts  originally sought.  In a pretrial ruling, the \nCourt excluded several opinions offered by Reagan that involved another $400,000 or so in \npurported damages to Steel Tube.  See Potts III, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *22–25.  At trial, \nthe Court excluded additional amounts  based on challenges by Defendants .  ( See Reagan \n88:21–90:1.)  The Court overruled a number of other objections by Defendants, many of which \nare discussed below in connection with the analysis of the pending motions. \n27. This expert testimony was largely unrebutted.  Although Defendants \nextensively cross-examined Reagan, they presented no expert testimony of their own. \nB. Procedural Posture \n28. At the close of Potts’s evidence, Defendants moved for a directed verdict on \nall claims against them.  The Court granted the motion in part, dismissing Potts’s  \nclaims for conspiracy and facilitation of fraud but deferring a ruling on other claims.  \nAt the close of all evidence, the Court denied Defendants’ renewed motion.  Potts also \nmoved for a directed verdict , which the Court granted, dismissing Rives’s \ncounterclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, declaratory judgment, and quantum \nmeruit.  (See Final Judgment 2, ECF No. 212.) \n29. Ten issues were submitted to the jury.  These included  issues related \nto Potts’s derivative claims  against Rives for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive \nfraud, conversion, and fraud; Potts’s derivative claim against Rives & Associates for \nprofessional negligence; and the dispute over the reasonableness of Avalon1’s sale of \nRives’s shares of Steel Tube.  The jury returned a verdict largely in favor of Potts but \ndid not award the full amount of damages that he had sought .  In short, the jury \nfound Rives liable for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion and \nawarded damages of  $1,285,750 for those three claims .  In addition, the jury found \nRives liable for fraud and  awarded another $390,096 in damages.  With respect to  \nprofessional negligence, the jury found Rives & Associates liable in the amount of \n$40,000.  Finally, the jury found that Avalon1 had provided reasonable notification \nto Rives of the public sale of his shares  and that it had sold the shares in a \ncommercially reasonable manner.  (See Verdict Sheet, ECF No. 209.) \n30. At Defendants’ request, the Court bifurcated  issues related to  punitive \ndamages.  In this second phase, t he jury again returned a verdict  in favor of Potts  \nand awarded punitive damages of $300,000 against Rives and $200,000 against Rives \n& Associates.  (See Suppl. Verdict Sheet, ECF No. 211.) \n31. After the Court entered final judgment , Defendants timely moved for \njudgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial .  (ECF Nos. 213, 215. )  \nThese motions are now ripe for resolution. \nII. \nMOTION FOR JNOV \n32. “When a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is joined with a \nmotion for a new trial, it is the duty of the trial court to rule on both motions.”  Clayton \nv. Branson, 170 N.C. App. 438, 442 (2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  In \nthe interests of judicial economy, courts should consider the motion for judgment \nnotwithstanding the verdict (“JNOV”) before turning to the motion for new trial.  Id. \n33. A motio n for JNOV  under Rule 50(b) “tests the legal sufficiency of the \nevidence to take the case to the jury and support a verdict for the nonmovant.”  \nScarborough v. Dillard’s, Inc., 363 N.C. 715, 720 (2009) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  The motion “i s essentially a renewal of an earlier motion for directed \nverdict.”  Id.  (citation and quotation marks omitted).   Thus, a  party may move for \nJNOV only on the same issues that were raised in the earlier motion for directed \nverdict.  See Shaw v. Gee , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 109, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, \n2018) (citing N.C. R. Civ. P. 50(b)(1)). \n34. The moving party “bears a heavy burden.”  Taylor v. Walker, 320 N.C. 729, \n733 (1987).  Granting JNOV is improper “unless it appears, as a matter of law, that \na recovery cannot be had by the plaintiff upon any view of the facts which the evidence \nreasonably tends to establish.”  Scarborough, 363 N.C. at 720 (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  A motion for JNOV “is cautiously and sparingly granted,” Bryant v. \nNationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 313 N.C. 362, 369 (1985), and should be denied if there \nis “more than a scintilla of evidence” to support the claim, Morris v. Scenera R sch., \nLLC, 368 N.C. 857, 861 (2016) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  A scintilla is \n“very slight evidence” but must “do more than raise a suspicion, conjecture, guess, \nsurmise, or speculation as to the pertinent facts.”  Id. (citations and quotation marks \nomitted).  In ruling on the motion, the Court “must consider the evidence in the light \nmost favorable to the nonmoving party, giving him the benefit of all reasonable \ninferences to be drawn therefrom and resolving all conflicts in the evidence in his \nfavor.”  Taylor, 320 N.C. at 733–34. \n35. Defendants have moved for JNOV on  the fraud claim against Rives, the \npunitive damages award against Rives & Associates  (but not the underlying \nprofessional negligence claim ), and the finding that Avalon1 gave reasonable \nnotification to Rives before disposing of his stock.  ( See Br. in Supp. JNOV 9, 16, 20, \nECF No. 214.) \nA. Fraud \n36. A claim for fraud has five “essential elements”: “(1) False representation or \nconcealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made with \nintent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the injured \nparty.”  Ragsdale v. Kennedy , 286 N.C. 130, 138 (1974).   The plaintiff’s reliance on \nthe fraudulent misrepresentation “must be reasonable.”  Forbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, \n527 (2007).  “Whether each of the elements of actual fraud and reasonable reliance \nare met are ordinarily questions for the jury ‘unless the facts are so clear that they \nsupport only one conclusion.’ ”  Head v. Gould Killian CPA Grp., P.A. , 371 N.C. 2, 9 \n(2018) (quoting Forbis, 361 N.C. at 527). \n37. Potts bases this claim on Rives’s representations that he would not spend \nmore than $ 25,000 without consulting Potts  and that “he would not take any \nmonetary distributions from Steel Tube without Potts’s approval.”  (Jury Instrs. 16, \nECF No. 208; see also Verified Am. Compl. ¶ 59, ECF No. 17.)  In his JNOV motion, \nRives does not address the second representation.  Rather, h e raises three discrete \narguments concerning only the promise not to spend  over $25,000 without Potts’s \napproval. \n1. Date of Misrepresentation \n38. First, Rives argues that Potts did not present enough evidence to show when \nthe mis representation was made .  In support, Rives  contends that  “[t]he plaintiff \nmust show the date [of the alleged misrepresentation] with definiteness and \nspecificity” but that Potts gave conflicting testimony on the subject .  (Br. in Supp. \nJNOV 11–12.) \n39. This argument is rooted in a misunderstanding of the law.  A  \n“misrepresentation must be definite and specific” to support a claim for fraud, “but \nthe specificity required depends upon the tendency of the statements to deceive under \nthe circumstances.”  Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 139.  There is no requirement that a \nplaintiff prove that the misrepresentation was made on a specific date .  It is enough \nto plead and prove the approximate time period and related circumstances.  See, e.g., \nTerry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 80–87 (1981) (addressing allegation that fraud occurred \nin the “two months prior to [plaintiff’s father’s] death”) ; Perkins v. HealthMarkets, \nInc., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 25, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 30, 2007) ( addressing \nallegation that misrepresentation was made “sometime in mid-November 2003”). \n40. More than one witness testified  that Rives made a definite and specific \npromise not to spend over $25,000 unless Potts agreed.  (See, e.g., Potts 14:2–7, 76:17–\n18; Hatchell 13:20–14:11.)  In addition, Potts and Hatchell each testified  that Rives \nmade the promise at the directors’ meeting on 6 February 2015 or around that time.  \n(See Potts 14:2–8, 16:9–15, 113:2–6, 151:4–7; Hatchell 9:9– 12, 13:18–14:11.)  Rives \nlikewise confirmed that he discussed  a spending limit with Potts  in February 2015, \nalthough he  denied that any promise resulted from those discussions .  ( See Rives \n54:8–24.)  That is more than enough evidence to support the jury’s verdict.  See, e.g., \nRagsdale, 286 N.C. at 139; Hudgins v. Wagoner, 204 N.C. App. 480, 490 (2010). \n41. Rives points to other evidence that could be viewed as favorable to his \ndefense.  As an example, the minutes of the directors’ meeting do not refer to limits \non dispositions over $25,000 .  (See Potts 76:9 –14.)  In addition , Potts sometimes \nmisstated the date of the directors’ meeting and at other times testified that he could \nnot recall the exact date of the misrepresentation.   (See Potts 16:9–15, 72:22–25, \n76:19–77:1.)  These discrepancies go to the credibility and weight —not the \nsufficiency—of the evidence and were for the jury to resolve.  Indeed, even discounting \nPotts’s testimony, the jury was entitled to credit Hatchell’s independent testimony \nconcerning the circumstances of the misrepresentation.  See, e.g. , Aldridge v. Hasty, \n240 N.C. 353, 362 (1954)  (stressing that it is up to the jury to “reconcile the \ninconsistent, conflicting, or contradictory testimony”). \n2. Meeting of the Minds \n42. Second, Rives contends that  he and Potts  discussed a limitation on \nexpenditures, acquisitions, and dispositions of property in the context of a draft \nshareholder agreement.  Because the shareholder agreement was never finalized and \nexecuted, he contends, there was no “meeting of the minds,” no valid contract, and no \npromissory misrepresentation.  (Br. in Supp. JNOV 12–14.)   \n43. The Court disagrees.  Viewed in a light most favorable to Potts, the evidence \ntends to show  that there was an  oral agreement concerning expenditures over \n$25,000 and, thus, a meeting of the minds .  ( See, e.g., Potts 14:2 –15, 70:10–72:10; \nHatchell 13: 18–14:11, 146:19– 147:13.)  Whether Potts and Rives did or did not \nmemorialize their agreement in a written contract is irrelevant. \n44. And in any event, Potts had no burden to prove a meeting of the minds.  He \noffered evidence that Rives falsely promised not to spend more than $25,000 without \napproval.  Assuming the other elements of fraud are met, that false promise may \nsupport a claim for fraud even if Potts and Rives did not enter into a binding, written \ncontract.  See, e.g.,  Hudgins, 204 N.C. App. at 486 –92 ( affirming denial of JNOV \nmotion); Leftwich v. Gaines, 134 N.C. App. 502,  507–10 (1999) (affirming denial of \ndirected verdict and JNOV motions); Wood v. Nelson, 5 N.C. App. 407, 409–11 (1969) \n(affirming denial of motion for nonsuit). \n3. Intent to Deceive \n45. Finally, Rives argues  that there was insufficient evidence of intent to \ndeceive.  In his view, the evidence does not show that he made the promise regarding \nexpenditures over $25,000 with no intent to keep it.  (See Br. in Supp. JNOV 14–15.)   \n46. Usually, “an unfilled promise cannot be made the basis for an action for \nfraud.”  Pierce v. Am. Fid. Fire Ins. Co., 240 N.C. 567, 571 (1954).  But “[a] promissory \nmisrepresentation may constitute actionable fraud when it is made with intent to \ndeceive the promis ee, and the promisor, at the time of making it, has no intent to \ncomply.”  Hudgins, 204 N.C. App. at 490–91 (citation and quotation marks omitted); \nsee also Braun v. Glade Valley Sch., Inc. , 77 N.C. App. 83, 87 (1985) .  T hus, there \nmust be evidence from which the “jury may reasonably infer that the defendant did \nnot intend to carry out such representations when they were made.”   Whitley v. \nO’Neal, 5 N.C. App. 136, 139 (1969); see also Hardin v. KCS Int’l, Inc., 199 N.C. App. \n687, 700 (2009). \n47. Direct evidence is not required.  “ Juries often have little access to direct \nevidence of a person’s intent and therefore may infer intent from the totality of the \nproperly admitted evidence.”  Hudgins , 20 4 N.C. App. at 491 .  Circumstantial \nevidence of i ntent may include, among other things, a  motive to deceive,  close \nproximity between the promise and the breach, efforts to conceal nonperform ance \nfrom the promisee, and a broader pattern of deceit.  See, e.g., Calloway v. Wyatt, 246 \nN.C. 129, 133–34 (1957); Jones v. Harrelson & Smith Contractors, LLC, 194 N.C. App. \n203, 214–15 (2008), aff’d per curiam , 363 N.C. 371 (2009); Hunter v. Guardian Life \nIns. Co. of Am. , 162 N.C. App. 477, 481 (2004); Meekins v. B ox, 152 N.C. App. 379, \n386–89 (2002); Carver v. Roberts, 78 N.C. App. 511, 513–14 (1985). \n48. At trial, Potts offered considerable evidence of Rives’s intent to deceive.  The \nevidence showed, for example, that Rives owed $600,000 to Roy Lazenby.  (See Rives \n17:5–11; Lazenby 5:17– 6:14, 7:12 –8:7.)  Rives did not put any of his own money \ntoward that debt.  Rather, he paid for Lazenby’s shares with Steel Tube’s money—a \ndirect transfer of $20,000 to Lazenby as a down payment and additional monthly \npayments taken from withdrawals (another $100,000 or so over time ) that Rives \nmade from company accounts.  (See Rives 17:5–18:10, 79:19–82:11; Hatchell 38:11–\n16; Tomlin 16:8–13, 20:19–21:5.)  Indeed , Rives began making these transfers and \nwithdrawals just after the February 2015 meeting with Potts .  (See Potts 17:1 –8, \nTomlin 14:10– 25, 19:25–21:5.)  This short period between promise and breach \nsuggests that Rives never intended to keep his promise, and the use of company funds \nto pay his sizeable personal debt is strong evidence of motive to deceive .  See, e.g., \nHudgins, 204 N.C. App. at 491. \n49. Furthermore, Potts offered evidence of a pattern of deception and a larger \nscheme of self-dealing.  For example, at the end of 2015, Rives promised not to take \na distribution to cover his tax liability even though he had already done so.  (See Rives \n114:11–13 (“Q. So the answer is, yes, when you’re meeting with Mr. Potts about it you \nhad already taken the money?  A. Yes.”); see also  Potts 53:1–55:3; Hatchell 43:9–17; \nTomlin 25:11–20.)  Likewise, Rives funneled cash and equipment—worth hundreds \nof thousands of dollars—to companies in which he and his family held interests.  (See, \ne.g., Rives 75:7–76:19, 91:10–92:3, 94:10–95:7, 101:22–25.)   \n50. Other evidence suggests that Rives tried to cover up his actions .  When \nconfronted about the monthly withdrawals,  for example, Rives denied taking them \nand then continued to do so.  (See Potts 17:9–17, 18:11–23, 28:7–11; Hatchell 75:19–\n25.)  In addition, Rives named his wife as a straw owner of  Elite Tube to conceal his \ninvolvement with the company.  (See Rives 90:11–17 (“I did not want that to be public \nknowledge necessarily.  I do lots of things that I don’t necessarily want to be public \nknowledge.”); see also Berrier 10:25–11:21.)  Likewise, Rives said nothing about his \nor his brothers’ involvement with KEL, and he made sure to sign checks to KEL even \nthough Potts usually signed  Steel Tube’s checks.  ( See Rives 105:11–107:2, 109:21–\n110:8.)   And there was also evidence that  Rives supplied false information to Potts \nand Hatchell and manipulated the company’s books and financial reports.  (See, e.g., \nHatchell 33:20–34:2, 35:10–36:23, 57:23–25, 60:17–20, 70:9–17, 71:10–72:6, 74:4–11; \nReagan 28:16–24, 29:5–20.) \n51. Taken together, this evidence amply supports the verdict.  Presented with  \n“evidence of concealment, evasion, and ulterior motives ,” the jury could have \nreasonably inferred that  Rives had no  intent to keep his promises not to take \ndistributions or spend over $2 5,000 without Potts’s approval .  Brown v. Secor, 2020 \nNCBC LEXIS 134, at *17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 13, 2020). \n4. Summary \n52. In sum, Rives has not carried his heavy burden to overturn the jury’s verdict \nas to the fraud claim. \nB. Punitive Damages \n53. During the compensatory phase, the jury found both Defendants liable—\nRives for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, constructive fraud, and fraud,  and \nRives & Associates for professional negligence.  ( See Verdict Sheet.)  The jury then \nawarded punitive damages of $300,000 against Rives and $ 200,000 against Rives & \nAssociates.  ( See Suppl. Verdict Sheet , Issue No. 2 .)  Rives & Associates challenges  \nthe punitive damages award against it. \n54. Punitive damages are appropriate “ to punish a  defendant for egregiously \nwrongful acts and to deter the defendant and others from committing similar \nwrongful acts.”  N.C.G.S. §  1D-1.  Punitive damages may be awarded only if an \naggravating factor—fraud, malice, or willful and wanton conduct—“was present and \nwas related to the injury for which compensatory damages were awarded.”   Id. \n§ 1D-15(a). \n55. The Court instructed the jury on willful or wanton conduct and fraud, but \nnot malice.  (See Suppl. Jury Instrs. 3, ECF No. 210.)   By statute, willful or wanton \nconduct is “the conscious and intentional disregard of and indifference to the rights \nand safety of others, which the defendant knows or should know is reasonably likely \nto result in injury, damage, or other harm.”  N.C.G.S. § 1D-5(7).  It means “more than \ngross negligence.”  Id.  Additionally, fraud “does not include constructive fraud unless \nan element of intent is present.”  Id. § 1D-5(4). \n56. A corporate defendant may be held liable for punitive damages in two ways: \n(1) on a theory of direct liability when the “corporation’s acts or policies constitute the \naggravating factor,” Everhart v. O’Charley’s, Inc., 200 N.C. App. 142, 153 (2009), and \n(2) on a theory of vicarious liability when “the officers, directors, or managers of the \ncorporation participated in or condoned the conduct constituting the aggravating \nfactor giving rise to punitive damages,” N.C.G.S. § 1D-15(c).  See also Everhart, 200 \nN.C. App. at 1 52–53 (distinguishing between a corporat e defendant’s  direct and \nvicarious liability fo r punitive damages) .  Here, the jury was instructed only on \nvicarious liability.  (See Suppl. Jury Instrs. 3.) \n1. Professional Negligence as a Basis for Punitive Damages \n57. Rives & Associates begins by arguing that “[a] claim for professional \nnegligence does not support an award of punitive damages . . . .”  (Br. in Supp. JNOV \n16.)  It cites no authority for this position , which is inconsistent with the governing \nstatute and case law .  Although s ection 1D -15 bars punitiv e damages “solely for \nbreach of contract,” it has no similar exclusion for professional negligence or any other \ntype of negligence claim.  N.C.G.S. § 1D-15(d).  Indeed, our Supreme Court has held \nthat a claim for  ordinary negligence may support a demand fo r punitive damages if \nthe plaintiff pleads and proves related willful and wanton conduct.  See Estate of Long \nv. Fowler , 378 N.C. 138 , 150–54 (2021).  Accordingly, a claim for professional \nnegligence may support an award of punitive damages so long as the other \nrequirements of section 1D-15 are met. \n2. Scope of Vicarious Liability for Punitive Damages \n58. Rives & Associates next argues —in a single paragraph —that limited \nliability partnerships may never be held vicariously liable  for punitive damages .  \nSection 1D-15(c) states that punitive damages “shall not be awarded against a person \nsolely on the basis of vicarious liability for the acts or omissions of anot her” except \n“if, in the case of a corporation, the officers, directors, or managers of the corporation \nparticipated in or condoned the conduct constituting the aggravating factor giving \nrise to punitive damages.”  N.C.G.S. § 1D-15(c) (emphases added).  According to Rives \n& Associates, this means that punitive damages may not be awarded “against entities \nother than corporations” —presumably including limited liability partnerships , \nlimited liability companies, and all other entities other than those organized under \nthe North Carolina Business Corporation Act.  (Br. in Supp. JNOV 17.) \n59. No court has interpreted section 1D-15(c) in that fashion.  Indeed, numerous \ncases have applied the statute to partnerships and other entities.  See, e.g., Austin v. \nBald II, L. L.C., 189 N.C. App. 338, 344–45 (2008) (reversing trial court’s refusal to \ninstruct jury as to demand for punitive damages against limited liability company);  \nPhillips v. Rest. Mgmt. of Carolina, L.P., 146 N.C. App. 203, 215–16 (2001) (applying \nstatute to limited partnership but denying punitive damages on other grounds); Abel \nv. Carolina Stalite Co., LP , 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5303, at * 17–19 (M.D.N.C. Mar. \n18, 2004) (denying motion for summary judgment by limited partnership).5  And the \nfederal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  has rejected the position pressed by \nRives & Associates: “Although the statute specifically refers to ‘corporations’ and not \nother business entities with employees, North Carolina courts nonetheless apply the \nstatute to limited liability companies and partnerships.”  Vandevender v. Blue Ridge \nof Raleigh, LLC , 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 24196, at *8 –9 (4th Cir. Aug. 2, 2018)  \n(emphasis added). \n60. The Court sees no reason to find fault in  these decisions.  Because t he \nstatute does not define “corporation ,” the term takes its ordinary meaning .  See  \nMorgan v. Hertford , 70 N.C. App. 725, 728 (1984).  Dictionaries offer various \nformulations,6 but all say roughly the same thing : “a single person or object treated \n \n5 See also, e.g., Slattery v. AppyCity, LLC, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *29–31 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMar. 24, 2021); BDM Invs. v. Lenhil, Inc., 2014 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *50– 51 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMar. 20, 2014), aff’d, 264 N.C. App. 282 (2019); McKiver v. Murphy -Brown, LLC, 980 F.3d \n937, 965–72 (4th Cir. 2020); Pracht v. Saga Freight Logistics , LLC, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n138230, at *12–22 (W.D.N.C. Oct. 9, 2015); Jenkins v. Receivables Performance Mgmt., LLC, \n2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91635, at *4–6 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 1, 2010). \n6 Compare Corporation, Merriam -Webster, https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/\ncorporation (“a body formed and authorized by law to act as a single person although \nconstituted by one or more pers ons and legally endowed with various rights and duties \nincluding the capacity of succession”), with Corporation, Webster’s New W orld Dictionary \n(1967 ed.) (“a group of people who get a charter granting them as a body certain of the legal \nrights and liabilities of a single individual”); compare Corporation, Black’s Law Dictionary \nby the law as having a legal individuality or en tity other than that of a natural \nperson.”  Id. (quoting Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 510 (1968)).  This \nexpansive definition goes beyond entities organized under the North Carolina \nBusiness Corporation Act and is broad enough to apply when, as here, a partnership \nexists as an entity distinct from its members .  See Trujillo v. N.C. Grange Mut. Ins. \nCo., 149 N.C. App. 811, 815 (2002)  (“A partnership is a distinct entity from the \nindividual members constituting it.”  (citation and quotation marks omitted) ); cf. \nGoldstein v. Roxborough Real Estate LLC , 677 Fed. App’x 796, 798 (3d Cir. 2017) \n(“Corporations, including limited partnerships,  may appear in federal court only \nthrough counsel.” (emphasis added)). \n61. For the first time i n its reply brief, Rives & Associates argues that this \ninterpretation conflicts with the nature  of limited liability partnerships  and would \nimproperly render some partners “personally liable” for the conduct of others.  (Reply \nBr. in Supp. JNOV 11, ECF No. 225.)  This is not convincing.  It is the partnership as \nan entity that is liable.  And b y statute, a partner in  a limited liability partnership \n“is not individuall y liable for debts and obligations of the partnership  . . . solely by \nreason of being a partner.”  N.C.G.S. § 59-45(a1).  Just as the partners of Rives & \n \n(10th ed. 2014) (“a group or succession of persons established in accordance with legal rules \ninto a legal or juristic person that has a legal personality distinct from the natural persons \nwho make it up, exists indefinitely apart from them, and has the legal powers that its \nconstitution gives it”), with Corporation, Black’s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) (“An artificial \nor legal entity created by or under the authority of the laws of a state . . . ordinarily consisting \nof an association of numerous individuals, who subsist as a body politic under a special \ndenomination, which is regarded in law as having a personality and existence distinct from \nthat of it s several members  . . . and  . . . acting as a unit or single individual in matters \nrelating to the common purpose of the association”). \nAssociates are not personally liable for compensatory damages awarded against the \nfirm for professional negligence, neither are they personally liable for punitive \ndamages.  Thus, no conflict arises from applying section 1D-15(c) to limited liability \npartnerships.  On the other hand, construing section 1D-15(c) in the narrow fashion \nurged by Rives & Associates would undermine  the statute’s purpose, which is  to \npunish and deter wrongful acts.  See id. § 1D-1; Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., 358 N.C. 160, \n166–67 (2004). \n62. The Court therefore concludes that section 1D-15(c) does not bar an award \nof punitive damages against Rives & Associates on a theory of vicarious liability. \n3. Sufficiency of the Evidence \n63. Rives & Associates also argues that it cannot be held vicariously liable for \nRives’s conduct because there was insufficient evidence that Rives was acting as an \nagent of Rives & Associates rather than Steel Tube.  (See Br. in Supp. JNOV 18–19; \nReply Br. JNOV 11 –14.)  The Court c oncludes that there was sufficient evidence to \nsupport the jury’s verdict.   \n64. First, Rives & Associates has not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence \nas to the underlying professional negligence claim.   The evidence shows  that Rives \nimproperly backdated Steel Tube’s S-corporation election form, voiding the election.  \n(See Rives 28:9–24, 173:13–24; Borden 23:14–24:4; Reagan 41:10–22.)  In preparing \nthe company’s tax returns, Rives miscategorized his $62,875 distribution, improperly \naddressed goodwill and special depreciation, and made other errors.  (See, e.g., Rives \n179:21–180:11; Reagan 27:19– 32:6; Borden 8:2 –10:1, 15:7 –17:14; Hatchell 112:5 –\n113:13.)  Many of these errors were designed to benefit Rives—for example, allowing \nhim to claim Steel Tube’s los ses on his personal tax return —but ultimately harmed \nSteel Tube through tax penalties and other expenses.  (See Reagan 118:15–119:10.) \n65. Second, there was ample evidence that Rives performed this work on behalf \nof Rives & Associates.  (See, e.g., Reagan 42:23–44:24.)  Cover letters received by Steel \nTube carried a Rives & Associates logo and referred to “professional services rendered \nin connection with the preparation of” tax filings that “we” (Rives & Associates) \ncompiled.  (Rives 21:12 –23:10, 11 9:6–123:8.)  In addition, others at Rives & \nAssociates, including partners, reviewed the documents.  (See Rives 27:3–12, 118:10–\n119:5, 138:11–139:15.)  And the documents  identified the firm itself  and a partner \nother than Rives as the  “paid preparer.”  (Rives 24:18 –22, 25:17–26:9, 124:3–8; see \nalso Hatchell 108:13–109:15; Borden 5:11–19.)  According to Hatchell, Steel Tube and \nits employees viewed both Rives and Rives & Associates as responsible for Steel \nTube’s tax filings.  (See Hatchell 27:6–9, 29:20–21; see also Borden 5:11–13.) \n66. Although Rives insists that his duties for Rives & Associates were distinct \nfrom his duties for Steel Tube, the jury was not required to credit his testimony.  Quite \na bit of evidence suggests that the lines were blurred.  Rives & Associates had, after \nall, served as Steel Tube’s accounting firm for several years before Rives acquired an \ninterest in the company.   ( See Rives 9:8 –15; Hatchell 6:1 7–22.)  And when Rives \njoined Steel Tube, he promised that “[he] a nd his firm, Rives and Associates, would \ntake care of  . . . the financial matters” at Steel Tube.  (Hatchell 11:16– 24; see also \nHatchell 27:6–9, 29:20– 21, 84:25– 85:4.)  This is supported by the  documents \nthemselves, which  purport to come from Rives & Assoc iates, and by the fact that \nemployees of the firm, including Rives’s brothers, made themselves available to \nanswer questions about the returns.  (See, e.g., Hatchell 27:10–28:25.) \n67. Third, the jury reasonably found the necessary aggravating factor by clear \nand convincing evidence.  Rives & Associates argues that the evidence of fraud is not \npertinent because the fraud claim is against Rives, not the firm, and is unrelated to \nthe tax filings .  ( See Reply Br. JNO V 8, 10  n.1.)  Not so .  Fraudulent conduct may \nsupport punitive damages even without a claim for fraud.  See Dailey v. Integon Gen. \nIns. Corp. , 75 N.C. App. 387, 395 –96 (1985).  The question is whether there is \nevidence of deceitful conduct related to the professional negligence claim.  See, e.g. , \nBogovich v. Embassy Club of Sedgefield, Inc. , 211 N.C. App. 1,  15–17 (2011).  Here, \nthe conduct is related because there is evidence that Rives falsified the tax documents \nat issue to advance and to conceal his fraud and other wrongdoing.  (See, e.g., Hatchell \n108:14–113:13 ( misidentification of bender); Borden 10:15–11:12 ( treatment of  \ncompensation), 15:7–16:8 (unverified assets).) \n68. Moreover, some evidence suggests that Rives had the support of the firm .  \nOther partners and employees of R ives & Associates reviewed and approved filings \nover an extended period of time.  (See Rives 27:3–12, 118:10–119:5, 138:11–139:15; \nReagan 43:24–44:24.)  There was also evidence, apart from the negligent tax work, to \nshow that the firm’s partners and employees participated in  and benefited from  \nRives’s wrongdoing: his brothers were not only  the undisclosed owners of KEL  but \nalso insiders at Rives & Associates.  (See Rives 142:13–143:13; Hatchell 49:8–50:12.)  \nIn addition, Reagan testified—without rebuttal—that Rives & Associates had a duty \nto implement policies and procedures to identify and monitor conflicts of interest.  No \nsuch policies existed .  ( See Reagan 8:21–9:5, 49:23–50:19.)  In other words , over a \nperiod of about two years, the partners and employees of Rives & Associates reviewed \nand helped prepare negligent tax documents that furthered the fraud of the firm’s \nmanaging partner, all while failing to adopt even the most basic , industry-standard \nguardrails.  From this evidence , the jury could have reasonably found “a repe ated \ncourse of conduct which constituted a callous or intentional indifference ” to the \nplaintiff’s rights.  Patrick v. Williams, 102 N.C. App. 355, 369 (1991). \n4. Constitutional Challenge \n69. Defendants assert that “submission of punitive damages is in violation”  of \nthe Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nand the Law of the Land Clause of the North Carolina Constitution.  (Br. in Supp. \nJNOV 19.)  They advance no argument in support of that assertion, and the Court’s \ninstructions complied with the punitive damages statute.  Therefore, they have not \novercome the presumption of constitutionality.  See Rhyne, 358 N.C. at 167– 68; \nArizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 415 (2012). \n5. Summary \n70. For all these reasons, t he Court denies the  motion for JNOV as to the \npunitive damages award. \nC. Notification of Disposition of Collateral \n71. In his deal with Rives, Roy Lazenby received a security interest in the stock \nthat he was selling.  Avalon1 later acquired the security interest  from Lazenby and, \nwhen Rives defaulted, repossessed the shares and disposed of them through a public \nsale.  (See Joint Stipulation 3–4.)  At trial, the jury rendered a verdict that Avalon1 \ngave Rives reasonable notification of the public sale.   ( See Verdict Sheet, Issue No. \n7(a).)  Rives now seeks JNOV on the ground that this verdict is not supported by the \nevidence.  (See Br. in Supp. JNOV 20–21.) \n72. Before disposing of collateral , a secured party must send the debtor “an \nauthenticated notification of dispos ition.”  N.C.G.S. §  25-9-611(c)(1); see also id.  \n§ 25-9-610(b).  Notice may be sent by mail “addressed to any address reasonable \nunder the circumstances,” id. § 25-9-102(77)(a), and may be valid “whether or not the \nother person actually comes to know of it ,” id. § 25-1-202(d).  Commercial \nreasonableness is “an issue of fact determined in light of the relevant circumstances \nof each case.”  Com. Credit Grp., Inc. v. Barber, 199 N.C. App. 731, 737 (2009) (citation \nand quotation marks omitted). \n73. It is undisputed that Avalon1 sent a notification to a known address for \nRives.  He did not receive the notification, however, because he had separated from \nhis wife and no longer lived at the address .  According to  Rives, it was well known \nthat he had moved to a new address, and the notification was not reasonable as a \nresult. \n74. Viewed in a light most favorable to Avalon1 , the evidence supports the \nverdict.  Hatchell testified that she used the address that appeared in Rives’s K-1 and \ncompany life insurance policy  and that Rives himself had confirmed in his answer 7 \nin this litigation.  (See Hatchell 95:10–24; see also Rives 132:11–133:1.)  She further \ntestified that Rives had not informed her that he had relocated.   (See Hatchell 96:4–\n9; see also Tomlin 50:9 –17 (testimony of Tomlin that she was unaware Rives had \nseparated from his wife).)  Rives maintains that, given the uncertainty over his living \narrangements, Avalon1 sho uld have sent notice to his counsel , but that is not \nrequired by the statute.  Whether notification is reasonable is a fact-intensive inquiry \nthat demands consideration of the circumstances  as a whole .  Weighing all the \nevidence, the jury could have concluded that Avalon1 sent the notification to Rives’s \nlast known address and that it was reasonable to do so.  Rives has not shown that he \nis entitled to JNOV on this issue. \nIII. \nMOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL \n75. Defendants have also moved  for a new trial  under Rule 59.  They assert \nnumerous, scattershot arguments touching on many issues of liability and damages.  \nBefore considering each argument in turn, the Court first summarizes  the legal \nprinciples governing motions for new trial. \n \n7 It is perhaps worth noting that Rives was given a chance to explain why he had admitted \nliving at the address in his answer when, in fact, he had moved.  Instead, he denied having \nmade the admission at all.  Given a copy of the answer to refresh his recollection, Rives simply \ndenied what his pleading said.  (See Rives 134:11–136:6.) \nA. Legal Standards \n76. Under Rule 59, a trial court may order a new trial on various grounds, \nincluding the following: \n(1) Any irregularity by which any party was prevented from having a fair \ntrial; \n. . . \n(6) Excessive or inadequate damages appearing to have been given under the \ninfluence of passion or prejudice; \n(7) Insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or that the v erdict is \ncontrary to law; \n(8) Error in law occurring at the trial and objected to by the party making the  \nmotion, or \n(9) Any other reason heretofore recognized as grounds for new trial. \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 59(a)(1), (6)– (9).  Granting a new trial under Rule 59  is within the \nCourt’s sound discretion.  See Xiong v. Marks, 193 N.C. App. 644, 654 (2008).  The \nexception is Rule 59(a)(8), which can involve questions of law.  See id. \n77. Under Rule 59(a)(1), the Court considers whether there was some \nirregularity or error that prejudiced the moving party.  See Sisk v. Sisk, 221 N.C. App. \n631, 635 (2012). \n78. To determine whether a damages award was excessive or inadequate under \nRule 59(a)(6), the Court “must consider the testimony and evidence presented at \ntrial.”  Guox v. Satterly, 164 N.C. App. 578, 581 (2004).  A new trial will be denied if \nthe movant points to nothing other than the award itself to suggest that the jury \ndisregarded the Court’s instructions or awarded punitive damages under the \ninfluence of passion or prejudice.  See Everhart, 200 N.C. App. at 161.  A new trial is \nnot warranted if the verdict “was consistent with plaintiff’s evidence,” even if “it is \nunclear exactly how the jury reached its overall figure.”  Blakeley v. Town of \nTaylortown, 233 N.C. App. 441, 449 (2014). \n79. Under Rule 59(a)(7), a new trial may be granted  based on insufficiency of \nevidence or a verdict contrary to law.   As to insufficiency of evidence, a new trial is \nproper only if “the verdict was against the greater weight of the evidence.”  Justus v. \nRosner, 371 N.C. 818, 825 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  A new trial \nis improper if the jury’s determination of a “fact-intensive question” was “reasonable” \nand did not “amount to a ‘substantial miscarriage of justice. ’ ”  Chalk v. Braakman , \n2019 N.C. App. LEXIS 263, at *16 (N.C. Ct. App. Mar. 19, 2019) (quoting Justus, 371 \nN.C. at 825). \n80. Under Rule 59(a)(8), the movant must have made a timely objection .  See \nPiazza v. Kirkbride , 372 N.C. 137, 165– 166 (2019).  When the movant takes issue \nwith the failure to provide a jury instruction, including a limiting instruction, he must \nshow (1) that the requested instruction “ was a correct statement of law  and was \nsupported by the evidence ”; (2) that the instruction given by the Court , “considered \nin its entirety, failed to encompass the substance of the law”; and (3) that the failure \nto give the instruction “likely misled the jury.”  Godfrey v. Res- Care, Inc., 165 N.C. \nApp. 68, 78  (2004).  The movant must also show that he  was prejudiced by the \nomission.  See Trang v. L J Wings, Inc., 268 N.C. App. 136, 139 (2019). \n81. Finally, Rule 59 (a)(9) authorizes the Court “ to order a new trial when the \nends of justice will be served.”  Boykin v. Wilson Med. Ctr. , 201 N.C. App. 559, 561 \n(2009) (citation and quotation marks omitted) .  Under this provision, a  new trial is \nproper to prevent a “palpable miscarriage of justice ,” w hen “justice and equity so \nrequire,” or “when it would work an injustice to let the verdict stand.”  Id. (citations \nand quotation marks omitted). \nB. General Mismanagement \n82. According to Defendants, Potts pursued a theory of liability  at trial (based \non mismanagement) that differed from the theory pleaded in his amended complaint \n(based on self- dealing).  Although the ir briefing is somewhat unclear, Defendants \nappear to argue that the Court should have sustained their objections to four \ncategories of damages evidence : loan interest incurred by Steel Tube, diminution in \nthe company’s value, compensation paid to Mike Lazenby, and health insurance \npremiums paid on behalf of  Roy Lazenby and his wife .  Defendants  argue that  \nadmission of this evidence was contrary to the pretrial Daubert ruling and that, based \non this evidence, the jury awarded damages unrelated to the self-dealing transactions \nat issue.  (See Br. in Supp. New Trial 13–16, ECF No. 216.)   \n83. This argument mischaracterizes the pretrial proceedings and the evidence \nat trial.  To start, the Court’s rulings at trial were not inconsistent with the Daubert \norder.  Consider, for example, the evidence related to loan interest.  In their pretrial \nmotion, Defendants moved to exclude Reagan’s opinion  on that issue  on grounds—\nraised for the first time in a reply brief —that had nothing to do with the underlying \ntheory of liability.  The Court concluded that Reagan’s opinion was neither unreliable \nnor speculative and declined to exclude it.  See Potts III, 2019 NCBC LEXIS  61, at \n*20–22.  Likewise, although Defendants objected to Reagan’s opinions about Mike \nLazenby’s compensation and about insurance payments for Roy Lazenby and his wife, \n“their barebones arguments provide[d] no reasoned basis to exclude” those opinions.  \nId. at *15 n.3.  Defendants did not challenge Reagan’s opinion regarding diminution \nin value at all.  See id.  at *20.  In short, the Court either declined to exclude thi s \nevidence before trial or was never asked to do so. \n84. To be sure, the Court agreed with Defendants that several other opinions \noffered by Reagan were irrelevant because they went to  issues outside the amended \ncomplaint.  See id. at * 22–25.  This favorable decision , which  greatly reduced \nDefendants’ damages exposur e, remained effective throughout trial.  The  excluded \nevidence was not introduced, and Defendants do not argue otherwise.   Again, there \nwas no inconsistency between the pretrial and trial rulings. \n85. Furthermore, Defendants have not given  any persuasive reason why  the \ndisputed evidence should have been excluded at trial.  Potts offered substantial  \nevidence to show that each category of damages stemmed from Rives’s self -dealing.  \nThis included expert testimony from Reagan showing that Rives’s self-dealing wiped \nout Steel Tube’s working capital, decimated its value, and necessitated sizeable loans.  \n(See, e.g. , Reagan 23:14– 24:4, 53:23– 56:2, 60:10– 62:2, 171 :10–173:12.)  Likewise, \nother testimony tended to show  that Rives channeled Steel Tube’s  funds to  the \nLazenby family—increased salary, bonus payment, and insurance benefits—as part \nof his personal deal  to buy shares in the company .  (See, e.g. , Rives 82: 17–84:8, \n157:14–17; Lazenby 8:8–24; Reagan 26:21–27:5, 36:11–37:24.)8 \n \n8 Defendants advance additional, overlapping challenges to the sufficiency of this evidence \nelsewhere in their briefs.  The Court addresses those arguments below. \n86. In any event, even if this evidence touched on  mismanagement as well as  \nself-dealing, the result would be the same.  I n response to Potts’s motions in limine, \nDefendants stated their intention to offer evidence th at, in their view, would show \nRives’s sound, good-faith management of Steel Tube.  ( See Order Pl.’s Mots. Limine \n¶ 21, ECF No. 200 [“MIL Order”].)  The Court denied Potts’s motion to exclude such \nevidence for several reasons but warned Rives that if he attempted “to show the value \nof his services by offering evidence of  decisions he made to benefit Steel Tube, that \nwould likely open the door for Potts to introduce evidence of Rives’ s alleged \nmismanagement.”  ( MIL Order ¶ 24.)  That’s exactly what happened.  Defendants \ncross-examined the first witness about Rives’s managerial success, inquiring about \nhis business strategies and efforts to improve sales and profit margins .  ( See, e.g., \nPotts 91:16–93:24, 119:16–120:5, 137:20–146:20.)  Counsel for Defendants also asked \nseveral other witnesses whether Rives’s management benefited Steel Tube.  (See, e.g., \nHatchell 135:7–139:19; Tomlin 33:16–34:12; Reagan 153:17–156:9.)  Having opened \nthe door to evidence of Rives’s mismanagement, Defendants cannot now protest that \nit should have been excluded.  See Middleton v. Russell Grp., Ltd., 126 N.C. App. 1, \n23–24 (1997) (“[W]hen a party first raises an issue, it opens the door to questions in \nresponse to that issue and cannot later object to testimony regarding the subject \nraised.”). \n87. For similar reasons, Defendants’ requested instructions were not \nappropriate.  It would have been in appropriate to instruct the jury not to consider \nwhether Rives’s management  “was reasonable and prudent” when Defendants, not \nPotts, were first to introduce evidence on that subject.  In addition, the Court properly \ninstructed the jury that Potts had “the burden to prove by the greater weight of the \nevidence that Rives entered into one or more conflict -of-interest transactions” and \n“that Rives proximately caused damage to Steel Tube.”  (Jury Instrs. at 10, 12.)  The \nCourt further instructed the jury that, if it found that one or more transactions were \nnot conflict-of-interest transactions, “then Rives is entitled to a presumption that he \nacted with due care and on an informed basis as to those transactions.”  (Jury Instrs. \nat 12.)  These were correct statements of law  that appropriately instructed the jury \nas to the nature of the  disputed issues and the elements of a  claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty.  Defendants have not shown tha t the failure to give their proposed \nlimiting instruction resulted in prejudice or was likely to mislead the jury. \nC. Loan Interest \n88. The evidence of l oan interest discussed in the previous section  is also the \nbasis of Defendants’ second argument.  Defendants argue that the evidence tying the \nloans to Rives’s self- dealing was insufficient and that the Court should have \ninstructed the jury not to consider any evidence relating to payment of interest.  (See \nBr. in Supp. New Trial 16–18.) \n89. Whether there was a causal connection between Rives’s  self-interested \ntransactions and the loans at issue is simply an evidentiary dispute.  The jury heard \nexpert testimony  that Rives’s self- dealing severely impaired Steel Tube’s working \ncapital and that it covered its losses through loans.  (See, e.g. , Reagan 2 3:14–29:7, \n53:18–62:2, 97:6–22, 171:10–173:12.)  Rives points to evidence that Potts knew about \nor approved the loans and that the loans went toward equipment purchases, not \nself-dealing.  (See, e.g., Rives 165:11–169:5.)  But Potts offered competing evidence to \nshow that certain purchases Rives claimed to have made with the loan proceeds were \nfictitious and that Rives covered this up by falsifying information in  Steel Tube’s \nbooks.  (See, e.g. , Hatchell 33:20 –34:2, 39:18– 40:12, 41:13– 42:2.)  Deciding  which \nevidence to believe was for the jury.  Certainly, the verdict is not against the greater \nweight of the evidence. \n90. Defendants also fault Reagan’s analysis.  He failed, they contend, to account \nfor other factors that could have affected Steel Tube’s financial position.  They take \nissue, too, with his supposed reliance on financial data that was not introduced into \nevidence or found in his expert report .  The Court rejected similar arguments when \nit denied Defendants’ pretrial Daubert motion, observing that Defendants had failed \nto identify “any principle of eco nomics in conflict with Reagan’s analysis” and that  \nReagan’s conclusion was based on opinions concerning  capital depletion and \ndiminution in value that Defendants had not challenged.  Potts III, 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 61, at *19–21.  Defendants have offered no reason to revisit that ruling. \n91. What is more, Reagan testified that he did consider other factors and \nalternative explanations .  To understand the decline in working capital, Reagan \nlooked to industry trends in steel prices and financial performance but did not find  a \nreason for Steel Tube’s deteriorating bottom line .  (See Reagan 58:10–60:7.)  And he \nexplained the basis for his opinions, including consideration of original and amended \nfinancial statements prepared by Cannon & Company during its investigation after \nRives’s departure.  ( See Reagan 19:5–20:14, 176:7–177:24.)  Defendants had a full \nand fair opportunity to cross-examine Reagan on these issues.  Whether Reagan had \na convincing factual basis for his opinion goes to the  credibility and weight  of his \ntestimony, not admissibility.  See, e.g. , Kerry Bodenhamer Farms, LLC v. Nature’s \nPearl Corp., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 239, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 27, 2018)  (citing \ncases). \n92. In short, the evidence offered by each side “merely created a question of fact \nfor the jury.”  Cooke v. Cooke, 2005 N.C. App. LEXIS 719, at *12 (N.C. Ct. App. Apr. \n5, 2005).  Its  verdict was “reasonable” and supported by the evidence.   Chalk, 2019 \nN.C. App. LEXIS 263, at *16.  Further, because there was sufficient evidence linking \nthe interest  payments to Rives’s misconduct, there was  no error in refusing \nDefendants’ request to instruct the jury not  to “consider any evidence relating to \npayment of interest” when evaluating damages.  (Br. in Supp. New Trial 18.) \nD. Diminution in Value \n93. Next, Defendants revisit Reagan’s calculation of the diminution in Steel \nTube’s value.  Once more, Defendants contend that there was insufficient evidence \ntying Steel Tube’s decline in value to Rives’s self-dealing.  (See Br. in Supp. New Trial \n18–20.)  But  again, the disputed evidence created a jury question.   Potts’s expert, \nReagan, testified extensively on the subject .  ( See, e.g., Reagan 23:14– 24:4, 53:23–\n55:14, 60:23–62:2, 98:1–20, 99:17–101:11.)  The jury  was free to discount Rives’s \ncompeting explanation, and it had sufficient evidence to support its presumed finding \nthat Rives’s self-dealing caused these losses. \n94. Defendants also contend  that Reagan’s methodology  was faulty  because, \nduring cross-examination, he admitted that his calculation contained an error.  (See \nReagan 194:19–200:5.)  This miscalculation does not call for a  new trial.  For one \nthing, the error and Reagan’s explanation for it go to his credibility—a matter for the \njury.  See Horne v. Trivette, 58 N.C. App. 77, 82 (1982) (holding new trial unwarranted \nwhen “[t]he changes in [the witness’s] testimony  . . . affect[ed] his credibility, and it \nwas for the jury to determine whether they believed his inconsistent testimony”). \n95. For another, Defendants suffered no prejudice .  Through several rounds of \ncross-examination and redirect, Reagan  testified that Steel Tube’s diminution in \nvalue was greater than he had originally calculated .  B ut rather than seek  the \ncorrected, higher amount, Potts asked the jury to award only the lesser amount as \ndamages.  (See Reagan 203:9–21, 211:13–17, 212:24–213:25.)  Thus, the error favored \nDefendants. \n96. It also merits mention  that Defendants did not depose Reagan during \ndiscovery or produce their own expert to rebut his testimony.  Nor did they challenge \nhis calculation of diminution in value or his underlying methodology in their pretrial \nDaubert motion.  See  Potts III, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *20 (observing that \nDefendants had not objected to Reagan’s opinion on diminution in value, “much less \nidentif[ied] any flaw in the methodology used to calculate these figures”).  And at no \npoint have Defendants argued that damages in the form of  diminished value are too \nspeculative, too remote, or otherwise unavailable as a matter of law. \n97. One more argument deserves mention.  In a single paragraph without \ncitations, Defendants contend that the evidence of diminished value led to a double \nrecovery.  (See Br. in Supp. New Trial 20.)  This, too, is unpersuasive.  Defendants do \nnot point to specific evidence of double counting, do not suggest that they  attempted \nto cross-examine Reagan on the issue, and offered no rebuttal expert testimony  to \nsupport their position.  In addition, even if Reagan had double counted, his purported \nerror was not “appare ntly embraced by the jury,” as Defendants contend.  (Br. in \nSupp. New Trial 20.)  T he jury awarded Potts about $500,000 less than he sought , \nand t he Court sees no basis to conclude that the verdict amounted to  a double \nrecovery.  See Dafford v. JP Steakhouse LLC , 210 N.C. App. 678, 687 (2011) \n(“[W]hether plaintiff’s calculation is correct or not is irrelevant since the jury, as the \ntrier of fact, may award damages based on the evidence they find credible and may \ndisregard the evidence they did not find credible.”); Von Pettis Realty, Inc. v. McKoy, \n135 N.C. App. 206, 211 n.4 (1999) (holding that because the jury’s award was \nsubstantially less than the total amount requested, the exact amount of special and \nconsequential damages awarded was “not material”). \nE. Mike Lazenby’s Compensation \n98. Defendants also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence concerning \ndamages resulting from compensation paid to Mike Lazenby.  They  reiterate their \nview that the compensation was unrelated to Rives’s self -dealing and further argue \nthat Rives was not at fault because Potts signed Mike’s employment agreement.  (See \nBr. in Supp. New Trial 21–22.) \n99. The evidence supports the verdict.  Among other things, there was evidence \ntending to show that Mike’s compensation was part of Rives’s scheme of self-dealing.  \nWhen Rives first acquired Roy Lazenby ’s shares, he prom ised to “protect” Mike.  \n(Rives 82:23–83:9.)  This protection took the form of an employment agreement that \nguaranteed Mike a raise and a bonus not dependent on job performance.  ( See Rives \n83:10–16, 84:3–8; Hatchell 103:21 –107:3.)  From this evidence, the jury could have \ninferred that Rives used S teel Tube’s assets to satisfy a personal commitment, just \nas he had used Steel Tube’s assets to pay for his purchase of the shares. \n100. In addition, other evidence suggests that Mike aided Rives with other \nself-interested transactions, including those involving Elite Tube.  Notably, Rives \nensured that Mike received a commission—in addition to the raise and bonus—that \nwas to be paid by Elite Tube.  (See Rives 100:9–19; see also Berrier 12:17–13:6.)  The \njury could have inferred that Rives increased Mike’s pay and gave him a bonus to \ninduce him to assist in a scheme of self-dealing and deception. \n101. Although Defendants argue that Potts knew about and signed the \nemployment agreement, the evidence was contested.   Potts  was unaware , for \nexample, that benefits given to Mike would satisfy a condition of Rives’s  share \npurchase from Roy Lazenby.  ( See Rives 82:23 –83:9.)  Thus, th e jury may have \nconcluded that Rives did not disclose all material facts about the transaction.  See \nN.C.G.S. §  55-8-31(a)(1), (2).  In addition, Hatchell participated in discussions \nconcerning the new employment agreement and testified that it was not to include a \nguaranteed bonus.  ( See Hatchell 103:12–19.)  As further support, Potts introduced  \ninto evidence two versions of th e agreement—an unsigned version allowing a \npotential bonus and a signed version promising a guaranteed bonus—and highlighted \nirregularities with the signature page , contending that there was an implication of \ntampering.  (See Hatchell 104:14–107:7, 107:19–21.)  The jury was entitled to weigh \nthis evidence in connection with the credibility of each witness.   \n102. And because this evidence was properly admitted , there was no error in \nrejecting Defendants’ proposed instruction that the jury should not consider any \nrequest for damages resulting from Mike Lazenby’s employment contract.  Also, given \nthe disputed evidence, Defendants’ description of the agreement as an “employment \ncontract entered into between Avalon Potts and Michael Lazenby”  was \ninappropriately argumentative.  (Br. in Supp. New Trial 22.) \nF. KEL Transactions \n103. At trial, Reagan testified that Steel Tube incurred  almost $ 85,000 in \ndamages due to losses related to the trucking services agreement with KEL.  (See \nReagan 94:2–5.)  Defendants argue that there was insufficient evidence to support \nthese damages.  They say that Reagan failed to consider various factors—for example, \nthe market value of shipping charges, brokerage fees imposed by KEL, and potential \ncost savings to Steel Tube—and that the oversight rendered his  calculations “too \nconjectural” to support the verdict.  (Br. in Supp. New Trial 20–21.) \n104. As Potts correctly observes , Defendants waived any object ion to Reagan’s \ntestimony about KEL.  ( See Opp’n New Trial 13.)  In lieu of objecting a t trial , \nDefendants’ counsel acknowledged that Reagan’s testimony concerning  “[e]xcessive \npayments to KEL . . . will be a subject to  [sic] cross-examination.”  (Reagan 65:4 –6; \nsee also, e.g., Reagan 35:6 –36:10 (no objection to KEL -related testimony).)  It is too \nlate now to contend that Reagan’s testim ony should have been excluded.  See, e.g.,  \nState v. Barton, 335 N.C. 696, 709–10 (1994). \n105. In any event, the evidence supports the verdict.  Reagan testified that , \nbefore engaging  KEL, Steel Tube recovered its shipping costs and earned a profit \nthrough a delivery charge.  Under the KEL contract, however, Steel Tube paid fees \nrather than earning a return.  The switch led to a significant net loss for Steel Tube.  \n(See, e.g., Reagan 35:15–36:10, 146:18–147:15, 150:8–152:22.)  On cross-examination, \nDefendants asked Reagan about the factors identified in their briefing.   Reagan \nanswered those questions and explained how he considered each factor or why, in his \nview, a given factor was irrelevant.  (See, e.g., Reagan 148:24–149:9, 150:21–151:14, \n153:3–156:16.)  Because  Defendants offered n o expert of their own, Reagan’s \ntestimony was unrebutted .  Considering the entire record, t he verdict was not  \n“against the greater weight of the evidence” and does not  threaten a “substantial \nmiscarriage of justice.”  Justus , 371 N.C. at 825 (citations and quotation marks \nomitted); see also Boykin, 201 N.C. App. at 561. \n106. Defendants also object to the jury  instructions as to the law governing \nconflict-of-interest transactions.  They contend that the Court should have instructed \nthe jury that “a familial relationship with another person who is an officer or director \nwith the other party to a corporate transaction does not, by itself, give rise to a conflict \nof interest.”  (Br. in Supp. New Trial 21.) \n107. This argument is unconvincing.  The  Court instructed the  jury that “[a] \nconflict-of-interest transaction is defined as a transaction with the corporation in \nwhich the director or officer of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest.”  (Jury \nInstrs. 10.)  The Court further instructed the jury that “[t]he test of whether a director \nor officer has a direct interest in a transaction is a matter of common sense” and that \nan indirect interest  may exist if , for example,  “another entity in which [he] has a \nmaterial financial interest  is a party to the transaction .”  (Jury Instrs . 11.)  Th ese \ninstructions mirror the governing statute.  See N.C.G.S. § 55-8-31(a), (b) (addressing \nconflicts of interest for directors) .  The statute does not d efine a direct conflict of \ninterest.  But as this Court and leading commentators have observed, what makes a \ndirect conflict  “is left to ‘common sense.’  ”  Battleground Veterinary Hosp. , P.C. v. \nMcGeough, 2007 NCBC LEXIS 33, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, 2007)  (quoting \nRussell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law  15-3 (7th ed. \n2006)).  Thus, the instructions correctly stated the law. \n108. Defendants’ proposed  instruction, on the other hand, does not accurately \nstate the law.   Nothing in the text of the statute states  that a conflict cannot arise \nfrom a familial relationship.   See N.C.G.S. § 55-8-31.  Moreover, section 55 -8-31 is \nbased on a model act , whose drafters clarified in an associated comment  that “ a \ndirector should norm ally be viewed as interested in a transaction if he or the \nimmediate members of his family have a financial interest in the transaction or a \nrelationship with the other parties to the transaction such that the relationship might \nreasonably be expected to affect his judgment  in the particular matter in a manner \nadverse to the corporation.”  Id. § 55-8-31, cmt. 5  (emphasis added) ; see also \nBattleground Veterinary Hosp., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 33, at *27.  Defendants look past \nthe statutory text and related commentary, relying instead solely on dictum in a case \ninvolving a different issue and in a different procedural posture.  See Geitner v. \nMullins, 182 N.C. App. 585, 591 –93 (2007) (addressing director votes, not conflicted \ntransactions with corporation); see also id. at 596 (Geer, J., concurring in the result) \n(noting that majority’s discussion of conflict-of-interest transactions was unnecessary \nto decision). \n109. Had the Court instructed the jury that familial relationships a lways result \nin a conflict, it would have been error.  But that is not what the Court instructed .  \nAnd it was not error to allow the jury to consider familial relationships when deciding \nwhether Rives’s actions presented a conflict of interest.  See Godfrey, 165 N.C. App. \nat 79–80 (holding that trial court did not err in refusing to give defendant’s requested \njury instruction when “the trial court’s instruction, considered in its entirety, \nencompassed the substance of the law”). \nG. Elite Tube Transactions \n110. Next, Defendants object to the admission of evidence involving transfers of \nmoney and equipment from Steel Tube to Elite Tube.  Specifically, Defendants \ncontend that the admission of evidence involving equipment known as a  roll former \nand a tube bender was inconsistent with the pretrial Daubert and summary judgment \ndecisions.  They further contend that the jury should have been instructed not to \nconsider damages related to these transactions.  (See Br. in Supp. New Trial 22–24.)   \n111. These arguments do not merit a new trial.  First, a s Potts points  out, \nevidence related to the equipment was relevant to matters  other than damages —\nincluding at least Rives’s intent, motive, and overall plan.  (See Opp’n New Trial 17.)  \nDefendants do not argue otherwise.  ( See Br. in Supp. New Trial 2 3–24.)  Thus, \nadmitting the evidence was not error. \n112. Second, there was no inconsistency between the pretrial and trial rulings.  \nLong before trial, Potts settled his claims against Elite Tube, and as a result, Steel \nTube recovered $120,000 in funds and equipment that Rives had transferred to Elite \nTube.  ( See Order Approving Voluntary Dismissal ¶  4, ECF No. 95.)  At summary \njudgment, the Court made clear that Potts was not entitled to a double recovery but \nnoted that the record was unsettled and that Potts had forecast evidence of additional \ndamages beyond what had be en recovered.  See Potts II , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 30, at \n*19.  In its pretrial Daubert  order, the Court reinforced that decision by excluding  \nseveral of Reagan’s opinions —without objection by Potts —that related to damages \nalready recovered from Elite Tube.  See Potts III, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 61 , at *17–18.  \nAt trial,  consistent with these decisions,  Reagan gave expert testimony  regarding \ndepletion of working capital, diminution of value, and loans and resulting interest—\nnone of which had been recovered in the settlement with Elite Tube.  (See, e.g.,  \nReagan 53:23–56:2, 60:8– 22.)  The admission of this evidence did not contravene \npretrial rulings, and the jury’s award did not result in a double recovery. \n113. Third, Defendants’ proposed limiting instructions were not appropriate.  \nThey asked the Court to direct  the jury “not to consider any damages arising from” \nthe transfer of equipment to Elite Tube and also “not to consider any damages for the \npurchase of the tube bender that was discussed, namely $120,000.00.”  (Br. in Supp. \nNew Trial 2 3 (emphases added).)  As discussed, nothing barred Potts from seeking \nadditional damages —including damages related to diminution in value and loan \ninterest—that Steel Tube had not recovered through the settlement with Elite Tube. \n114. Fourth, there was little likelihood of jury confusion.   At no point did Potts \nask the jury to award the $120,000 that Steel Tube had received from Elite Tube.  \nAnd in fact , the parties presented the jury with a stipulation that Steel Tube had \nsettled its claims against Elite Tube for $120,000, informing the jury that this amount \nwas no longer at issue .  (See Potts 108:13–24; see also Berrier 21:18–23.)  Thus, the \njury was correctly informed, and it  is presumed to have adhered to its instructions, \nincluding stipulations of evidence.  See State v. Cummings, 352 N.C. 600, 623 (2000).  \nDefendants’ limiting instructions, on the other hand, would not have clarified the \nissues for the jury and would have improperly directed the jury to limit its \nconsideration of damages supported by the evidence.   \nH. Duplicative Damages \n115. The jury returned a verdict with a single damages award for Rives’s breach \nof fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion, and a separate award for Rives’s \nfraud.  (See Verdict Sheet, Issue Nos. 4, 5(b).)   Defendants argue that  all the claims \nare based on the same underlying facts and that,  because the verdict sheet “did not \nseparate the amount of damages under each claim,” the Court cannot determine \n“which claims the verdict was awarded for or how damages were measured.”  (Br. in \nSupp. New Trial 24.)  As a result, they contend , it is unclear whether the damages \nfor fraud are duplicative of the damages for constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary \nduty, and conversion.   \n116. If there was an error, Defendants invited it.  In their proposed verdict sheet, \nDefendants did not include a separate damages issue for each claim.  Rather, t heir \nproposed verdict sheet had the same structure as the one proposed by Potts and the \none adopted by the Court : one line for damages based on breach of fiduciary duty, \nconstructive fraud, and conversion, and a second line for damages based on fraud.  \n(See Defs.’ Proposed Verdict Sheet Issue Nos. 5, 9, ECF No. 175 .)  It is fundamental \nthat “[a] party may not complain of action which he induced.”  Frugard v. Pritchard, \n338 N.C. 508, 512 (1994);  see also Rowan Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 332 \nN.C. 1, 23 (1992) (“Because [defendant] did not object to the verdict form, and indeed \nconsented to it, it will not be heard to complain on appeal.”).   Moreover, lump sum \nawards are acceptable and do not justify a new trial.9 \n \n9 See also, e.g., Abernathy v. Ralph Squires Realty Co., 55 N.C. App. 354, 358 (1982) (“The \nprohibition against double recovery should not be read to mean that  the two theories of \nrecovery cannot be submitted to the jury for its determination of the basis, if any, of \nliability.”); Jastremski v. United States , 737 F.2d 666, 672  (7th Cir. 1984) (“The failure to \ndivide the lump sum award into discrete elements of recovery does not warrant reversal.”) ; \nGreenwood Ranches, Inc. v. Skie Constr. Co. , 629 F.2d 518, 521 (8th Cir. 1980) (noting that \n“a p laintiff is not entitled to a separate compensatory damage award under each legal \ntheory,” but rather “is entitled only to one  . . . award if liability is found on any or all of the \ntheories involved”); Dimensions Med. Ctr., Ltd. v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n5595, at *11 n.1 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 22, 1997) (“Because there was a lump sum verdict in this case, \nhowever, it is impossible to determine to what extent the award was based on any particular \nclaim. . . . This result is a byproduct of the defendant’s failure to submit or request separate \nand/or itemized verdict forms for each claim.  By doing so, defendant took the risk that the \naward would be uninterpretable when contesting individual claims.  Moreover, a lump -sum \naward is not a basis, as defendant urges, for granting a new trial.”). \n117. In their reply brief, Defendants make a different argument: that the Court \nshould have itemized the disputed transactions under each issue.  They contend that \nit was necessary to list each transaction under each claim to avoid the potential for a \ndouble recovery.  ( See Reply Br. New Trial 8 –9, ECF No. 224 .)  This argument is \nuntimely.  As this Court has observed,  “our courts disfavor arguments made for the \nfirst time in a reply brief.”  Brown, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 134, at *25.  In any event, the \nargument makes no sense.  Defendants contend that all claims are based on the same \nunderlying transactions.  Itemizing those transactions for each claim would not have \ngiven any additional guidance to the jury, nor would it have guarded against a double \nrecovery.  Furthermore, the itemized list of transactions proposed by Defendants was \nincomplete and assumed the truth of their view of the evidence .10  As discussed \nelsewhere in this opinion, the evidence supporting the jury’s verdict was broader than \nDefendants contend. \n118. Finally, mere uncertainty about how the jury made its calculation is not a \nbasis for a new trial.  Had the jury awarded more than Potts requested, there might  \nbe grounds for concern.  But the jury awarded far less than Potts sought.  In addition, \nits awards were not identical (which might have suggested duplication) but appear to \nhave been the product of careful consideration of the evidence.  Indeed,  every \nindication is that the jury did not  give a double recovery but instead allocated total \ndamages among the claims.  It may be unclear how the jury made that allocation, but \n \n10 Notably, the Court properly identified the property in dispute for the conversion claim  in \nkeeping with the pattern jury instruction for that claim.  (Compare N.C.P.I.–Civil 806.00, \nwith Jury Instructions 13–14.) \nthe record supports the overall award, and “it is not for th is Court to second -guess \nthe means by which the jury calculated” it.  Lacey v. Kirk , 238 N.C. App. 376, 394  \n(2014) (cleaned up). \nI. Punitive Damages  \n119. Rives & Associates reiterates its view that no evidence supported the jury’s \naward of punitive damages against it.  (See Br. in Supp. New Trial 25–26.)  The Court \ndisagrees.  For the reasons discussed above, the evidence supports the jury’s verdict, \nwhich was not against the greater weight of the evidence.   \n120. Rives & Associates also contends that the Court should have instructed the \njury that the firm “could not be liable for any act or omission of Rives unless it was \nundertaken in his capacity as an employee and partner of [Rives & Associates], rather \nthan in his individual capacity.”  (Br. in Supp. New Trial 26.)  Not so.  Consistent \nwith the pattern instructions, see N.C.P.I.–Civil 810.96, the Court instructed the jury \nregarding an award of punitive damages that, “[a]s to Rives & Associates, the third \nthing Potts must prove is that the officers, directors, or managers of Rives & \nAssociates participated in or condoned the fraud or willful or wanton conduct.”  \n(Suppl. Jury Instrs . 3.)  This instruction correctly made no reference to Rives  and \nfollowed the governing statute.  See N.C.G.S. § 1D-15(c); see also State v. Garcell, 363 \nN.C. 10, 49 (2009)  (“Use of the pattern instructions is encouraged  . . . .”); Henry v. \nKnudsen, 203 N.C. App. 510, 519 (2010) ( observing that use of  the pattern \ninstructions is “the preferred method of jury instruction” ( citation and quotation \nmarks omitted)); Carrington v. Emory, 179 N.C. App. 827, 829 (2006) (same). \n121. Moreover, the Court’s instructions did not permit the jury to f ind Rives & \nAssociates liable for Rives’s activities in his capacity as an officer and director of Steel \nTube.  Rather, as to the claim for professional negligence at the compensatory phase, \nthe Court instructed the jury that Rives & Associates could be held liable for Rives’s \nconduct only if he was acting as an agent of the firm.  (See Jury Instrs. 20.)  The jury \npresumably made that finding, and Rives & Associates has not challenged its liability \nfor professional negligence. \n122. Finally, there was no prejudice .  T he Court ’s instruction was a correct \nstatement of the law and therefore did not “fail[ ] to encompass the substance of the \nlaw” or mislead the jury.  Godfrey, 165 N.C. App. at 78.  Because the jury is presumed \nto have followed the Court’s instructions, there was no risk of confusion or prejudice.  \nSee Cummings, 352 N.C. at 623; State v. Hoffman, 349 N.C. 167, 185 (1998). \nJ. Notification of Disposition of Collateral \n123. Finally, Rives returns to the public sale of his shares by Avalon1.  The issues \nand arguments are the same as those  in the JNOV motion.  ( See Br. in Supp. New \nTrial 26–27.)  Having  already concluded that the  issue of commercially reasonable \nnotice was properly submitted to the jury, the Court further concludes that a new \ntrial is not warranted. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n124. For all these reasons, Defendants’ motions for judgment notwithstanding \nthe verdict and for a new trial are DENIED. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 5th day of November, 2021. \n \n \n  /s/ Adam M.
