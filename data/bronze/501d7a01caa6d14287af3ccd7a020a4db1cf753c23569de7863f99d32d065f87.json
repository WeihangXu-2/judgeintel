  "raw_text": " \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \nWAKE COUNTY \n \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n20 CVS 4896 \nJOHN FORD and CHRISTOPHER \nKISGEN, derivatively on behalf of \nTRIANGLE REAL ESTATE \nINVESTORS ASSOCIATION, INC., \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nCARL ARNOLD JURGENS, JR.; \nKATHIE RUSSELL; TRIANGLE REAL \nESTATE INVESTORS ASSOCIATION \n(TREIA), LLC; and TREIA \nFOUNDATION, INC.,  \n \nDefendants, \n \nv. \n \nTRIANGLE REAL ESTATE \nINVESTORS ASSOCIATION, INC., \n \nNominal Defendant. \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR \nSANCTIONS \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n1. THIS MATTER  is before the Court on Plaintiffs  John Ford and \nChristopher Kisgen’s (together, “Plaintiffs”) Motion for Sanctions (the “Motion”), \n(ECF No. 89), filed pursuant to Rule 11 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure \n(the “Rule(s)”), the inherent powers of the Court, and Rule 8.4 of the North Carolina \nRules of Professional Conduct.  The M otion alleges startling misconduct on the part \nof a litigant, Defendant Kathie Russell (“Russell”) who is also a licensed attorney and \nmember of the North Carolina State Bar.  Plaintiffs contend that Russell created and \nFord v. Jurgens, 2022 NCBC 9. \nproduced in discovery false documents that she fabricated to support her position in \nthis case. \n2. Falsification of evidence is an intolerable and insidious offense that is \ndifficult to uncover.  Consequently, w hen falsification does come to light , the law \ndemands that its perpetrator receive a  severe sanction.  Anything short of such a \nresponse would undermine the integrity of the justice system, a system that first \ndepends on parties telling the truth. \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n3. Plaintiffs filed this Motion on 22 June 202 1.  (ECF No. 89 .)  On 22 \nOctober 2021, in support of the Motion  and after full briefing , Plaintiffs requested \nleave to file the affidavit of their forensic expert, Clark Walton  (“Walton”), the \naffidavit of Clint Morse , and a s upplemental brief.  (ECF No s. 115 –18.)  On 12 \nNovember 2021, Plaintiffs requested further leave to file the Triangle Real Estate \nInvestor’s Association, Inc.’s (“TREIA, Inc.” or the “Association”) revised responses to \nrequests for admission, and the deposition transcript of Frank Gray, formerly counsel \nto the Association.  (ECF No. 125.)   \n4. Following a hearing on the Motion on 18 November 2021, (ECF No. 119), \nthe Court granted Plaintiffs ’ two motions for leave to s upplement the record.  The \nCourt also permitted Defendants the opportunity to conduct a deposition of Walton  \nwith respect to the expert affidavit submitted by Plaintiffs and allowed both parties \nto submit additional briefing specific to Walton’s testimony.  (ECF No. 130.)  \n5. Having considered the parties’ written submissions,  argument at the \nhearing, and the relevant record, the Court finds the facts and makes the conclusions \nbelow. \nIII. FINDINGS OF FACT \n6. The Court finds the following facts based on the evidence presented. \n7. The underlying derivative action was filed on 9 April 2020 by Plaintiffs, \nwho were members of  the Association ’s Board of Directors  at the time .  (Verified \nCompl., ECF No. 3.) \n8. The Association is a nonprofit real estate investment association formed \nin 2003 to provide educational and networking benefits to its membership.  (First Am. \nVerified Compl. ¶¶ 1, 13 [hereinafter “Compl.”], ECF No. 11.)     \n9. On behalf of the Association , Plaintiffs complain that two other \nAssociation board members, Russell and Carl Arnold Jurgens, Jr. (“Jurgens”), \nimproperly redirected control of the Association’s assets, including its membership,  \nto two newly-formed entities:  Triangle Real Estate Investors Association, LLC, a for-\nprofit entity (the “LLC”), and TREIA Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit corporation \nestablished for charitable purposes (collectively , the “New Entities”) .  See Ford v. \nJurgens, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 89, at *2 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 5, 2021) (providing further \ndetail as to the background of this case); (Compl. ¶¶ 2–3.) \n10. Plaintiffs claim, among other things, that Russell and Jurgens wrongly \ntransferred cash and other assets from the Association to the New Entities in \nviolation of the Association’s a rticles of i ncorporation and bylaws, and that they  \nimproperly induced the Association’s membership to switch allegiance to the New \nEntities.  Ford, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 89, at *3; (Compl. ¶¶ 3, 22–30, 57–60.) \n11. Plaintiffs’ Motion asserts two allegations for the imposition of sanctions: \n(i) that Russell fabricated portions of the Association’s bylaws to support her position \nin this litigation, and (ii) that Russell created false emails and then back-dated them \nto use as evidence in this case. \nA.  The Association’s Bylaws \n12. At all relevant times in this litigation, Russell is and has been  an \nattorney licensed to practice in North Carolina and a member of the State Bar.  (Aff. \nKathie L. Russell ¶ 1 [hereinafter “Russell Aff.”], ECF No. 9.) \n13. Prior to the institution of this action , Plaintiffs, through counsel, \ncommunicated to Russell their position that the transfer of assets from the nonprofit \nAssociation to the for -profit LLC violated the law.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 57 –60; Pls.’ Br. \nSupp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 5, ECF No. 90.5.)  Russell responded that the transfer was \nlegal and in compliance with the Association’ s b ylaws.  She  shared a copy of th e \npurported bylaws in PDF format  via email to support her position .  The copy she \nprovided is referenced by the parties and herein as “Scan 03-06”.  (See Pls.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Sanctions Exs. 5 & 5.A, ECF Nos. 90.5–.6.) \n14. Plaintiffs’ counsel compared the Association’s  original bylaws f rom \n2003, (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 2, ECF No. 90.2), with a copy of the bylaws \nhe had received from another board member on 16 March 2020, (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nSanctions Ex. 4, ECF  No. 90.4), and found the two copies to be consistent with one \nanother.  However, neither version contained the language that Russell claimed to be \nin the bylaws.  Instead, Scan 03-06, which was provided by Russell on 16 March 2020, \nwas significantly different, and it alone contained the terms that supported Russell’s \nposition.  (See Aff. Clint S. Morse, ECF No. 109.1; Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. \n5.A.) \n15.   Specifically, among other differences, Article XI, Section 5 of Scan 03-\n06 allowed the bylaws to be amended without notice to the Board of Directors and  \nstated, “In the event of a conflict between the Bylaws and the Articles of \nIncorporation, the Bylaws shall govern.”  ( Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex . 5.A, at \nArt. XI § 5.)  Article XIII, Section 2 of Scan 03-06 contained more permissive language \nfor the Association to “confer benefits upon its members” and to pay its members, \ndirectors or officers “for services rendered or other value received[.]”  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Sanctions Ex. 5.A, at Art. XIII § 2.)  Section 3 of the same Article changed the \nlanguage regarding the distribution of assets upon dissolution of the Association from \n“shall be used or distributed exclusively for one or more exempt purposes  within the \nmeaning of Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code” to “shall be distributed \npursuant to N.C.G.S. § 55A -14-03 with preference for distribution to organizations \nwhich would benefit the Members[.]”  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Exs. 2 & 5.A, at \nArt. XIII § 3.) \n16. The bylaws provided by Russell also contain ed numerous formatting \ninconsistencies when compared to the other versions .  ( See Expert Report Clark C. \nWalton, Esq. [hereinafter “Walton Report ”] Ex. Q., ECF No. 139.52 (describing the \nformatting consistencies); Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions 7, ECF No. 90 (same).) \n17. Plaintiffs therefore contend that the bylaws Russell sent prior to the \nlitigation (Scan 03-06) were not authentic but, in fact, were manipulated in relevant \nplaces by Russell  to corroborate her statements regarding the transfer of the non -\nprofit Association’s assets to the for -profit LLC.  (See Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions  \n5–7.)   \n18. On 1 March 2021, after the litigation had commenced, Defendants \nproduced in discovery yet another version of bylaws (the “1 March 2021 bylaws”) that \nlargely tracked the language of Scan 03 -06.  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 6, \nECF No. 90.8.)   \n19. Russell filed the “Scan 03-06” bylaws with the Court as an attach ment \nto an affidavit in which she testified that this version was “a true and correct copy of \nthe current Bylaws” and that she was “aware of no version of the Bylaws of TR EIA, \nInc. other than th[is] version[.]”   Russell denies that she changed the bylaws to \ncomport with her position in this case.  (Russell Aff. ¶ 31, ECF No. 9; Russell Aff. Ex. \nE, ECF No. 9.6.) \n20. Plaintiffs’ counsel hired Walton as their forensic examiner  to review \nScan 03-06.  (Aff. Clark C. Walton, Esq. ¶ 5 [hereinafter “Walton Aff.”], ECF No. 117.)  \nClark Walton is Managing Director and the principal forensics and cyber security \nexpert for Reliance Forensics, LLC.  He has an undergraduate degree in \nMathematical Sciences from the University of North Carolina and a law degree from \nGeorgetown University.  (Walton Report Ex. A, ECF No. 139.52.) \n21. From 2000 through 2005, Walton worked for the Central Intelligence \nAgency as a cyber threat analyst and technical project manager.  He has taught \ncomputer forensics to U nited States military special operations assets, federal law \nenforcement personnel, judges, law students , and college students.  Over the course \nof his career Walton has conducted or overseen forensic examinations in more than \none thousand (1,000) matters.  (Walton Report Ex. A.) \n22. Walton has been recognized by the North Carolina Court of Appeals as \nan expert in computer forensics.  See Crosmun v. Trs. of Fayetteville Tech. Cmty. Coll., \n266 N.C. App. 424, 429 (2019). \n23. Relying on Walton’s conclusions, Plaintiffs argue that both Scan 03-06, \nwhich was presented to the Court, as well as the 1 March 2021 bylaws later produced \nby Defendants in discovery , were altered by Russell .  ( Walton Aff. ¶¶ 23– 26; see \nWalton Aff. Exs. J –K, ECF Nos. 117.18– .19.)  Ho wever, Walton’s conclusions \nthemselves do not go that far.   \n24.   Specifically, Walton concluded that Scan 03-06 was a PDF  document \nthat had been created from a Word document.  T he “author” identified in Scan 03-\n06’s metadata was someone named “Susan,”1 and “the PDF was both created and last \nmodified on March 6, 2020 at 1:30:04 PM.”  (Walton Aff. ¶¶ 25–26.)   \n \n1 Plaintiffs contend, unchallenged, that “Susan” is one of Russell’s employees.  (Pls.’ Reply \nBr. Supp. Mot. Sanctions 7 n.2, ECF No. 109.) \n25. Walton testified generally that metadata can be altered when a PDF is \nsaved as a new file, ( Dep. Clark C. Walton, Esq. 58:9– 59:13; 68:11–12 [hereinafter \n“Walton Dep.”], ECF No. 143.1), and “wacky formatting” can occur through the optical \ncharacter recognition process used when  either a document is scanned into a Word-\nformatted file or a Word-formatted file is saved as a PDF, (Walton Dep. 80:3–83:11). \n26. Walton could not determine with certainty on which computer Scan 03-\n06 was created, (Walton Report ¶ 44), and although the metadata showed the PDF \ndocument was created from a Word document by someone named “Susan,” he could \nnot discern whether “Susan,” Russell, or someone else made changes to the document \nwhile it was in Word format .  Walton was also not able to locate the document from \nwhich Scan 03-06 originated.  (Walton Report ¶ 44; Walton Dep. 95:10–22.)  \n27. Walton did not review the 1 March 2021 bylaws that Defendants  \nproduced during discovery, but the substantive changes in Scan 03 -06 continued to \nbe present in the 1 March 2021 version Russell produced.  (See generally Walton Aff.; \ncompare Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 5.A, with  Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions \nEx. 6.) \n28. Walton ultimately opines to a reasonable degree of forensic certainty \nthat “[Scan 03- 06] was created on March 6, 2020 from Microsoft W ord 2016 (not a \nscanner).” (Walton Report ¶ 31.)  He does not offer an opinion regarding when and \nwho made the substantive changes to the bylaws, nor can he say whether the changes \nwere authorized. \n29. Russell denies making substantive changes to the bylaws , (see Russell \nAff. ¶ 31), but admits that Plaintiffs’ expert has established that  Scan 03-06 “was \ncreated from a Microsoft Word 2016 file and . . . the pdf file was created and last \nmodified on March 6, 2020 [,]” ( Def. Kathie Russell’s Supp l. Br. Opp ’n Pls.’ Mot. \nSanctions 1–2, ECF No. 143; see Walton Dep. 71:7–9). \n30. The Association has neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of \nScan 03-06 as its bylaws.  It says only that Russell has denied any wrongdoing and \nthat it does not know what happened.  (See Def. TREIA, Inc.’s Resp. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. \nSanctions 2, ECF No. 105 (“[T]he non -party Board members do not have knowledge \nor information as to the explanation for differences . . . between . . . [S]can 03-06 and \nthe [1 March 2021] Bylaws[.]”); see also  Defs. Jurgens & Russell’s Resp. Pls.’ Mot. \nSanctions 10, ECF No. 108 (“Defendant Russe ll has steadfastly denied that she \nfabricated the  TREIA[,] [Inc.] bylaws in any way  . . . .  Defendants are still \ninvestigating the issues and are under no obligation to resp ond to or acknowledge \nPlaintiffs’ unproven ‘theories.’ ”).) \n31. Because the evidence does not establish when the changes were made, \nby whom, or with what authority before their conversion to Scan 03 -06, reasonable \nalternative explanations exist as to why the language of Scan 03-06 varies from that \nof other versions of the Association’s bylaws. \nB.  The Laramie E-Mails  \n32. Sometime in Spring 2019, Defendants Russell  and Jurgens announced \nto the new LLC’s membership that it would be conducting a “TREIA Pilot Real Estate \nRehab Participatory Class ” (the “Pilot Program”) as an educational opportunity  for \nAssociation members who were interested in buying  and selling houses for profit.  \n(Jurgens & Russell’s Mot. Strike, Answer Verified First Am. Compl., Defenses & \nCountercls. & Second Mot. Temp. Restraining Ord. &  Prelim. Inj. &  Expedited Br. \nSchedule ¶ 47 [hereinafter “Countercls.”], ECF No. 14.)   \n33. Meanwhile, A.C. Johnson (“Johnson”), president of Russell’s client \nNuCapital Associates, Inc. (“NuCapital”) , informed Russell that his cousin owned a  \nhouse located on Laramie Court in Cary, North Carolina, that was subject to  two \nmortgages and a  tax lien and was in need of repair.   (Russell Aff. ¶ 42.)   Johnson \nproposed that he and Russell purchase the house  as an investment .  (Russell Aff. \n¶¶ 42–43.)  They agreed to form the entity AK Partners Real Estate (“AK Partners”) \nto purchase the property.  (Russell Aff. ¶ 44.) \n34. In July 2019, Russell decided that the Laramie Court house would be a \nproject better suited for the Pilot Program than for AK Partners.  (Russell Aff. ¶ 45.)  \nRussell presented the possibility to the participants in the Pilot Program , telling \nthem that one  of her clients, NuCapital, would “wholesale” the property to them .  \n(Russell Aff. ¶ 46.) \n35.  The Pilot Program participants agreed to purchase the property subject \nto its tax lien  and contributed an additional $69,718.00 out-of-pocket to buy it .  \n(Russell Aff. ¶ 47.)  Russell testified that the Pilot Program’s participants were fully \ninformed as to “the details of the propert[y], the existing mortgages, the IRS lien, the \nfact that NuCapital would be wholesaling the property, and specifically that \nNuCapital was [her] client.” (Russell Aff. ¶ 46.)  \n36. Russell did not disclose a personal financial interest in the  property \nwhen speaking with the Pilot Program participants .  (Russell Aff. ¶ ¶ 42–51; see \nCompl. ¶¶ 31–33.)  \n37. Ultimately, AK Partners purchased the property from the seller subject \nto its tax lien for $28,676.55.  AK Partners then sold the property, still subject to its \ntax lien, to the Pilot Program participants for $ 69,718.00.  (Russell Aff. ¶¶ 49–50.)  \n38. Russell states that the entire profit on the transaction was paid to \nNuCapital and claims  that she received only the legal fees paid to her law firm.  \n(Russell Aff. ¶ 50; Countercls. ¶¶ 60–61.) \n39. In support of the Motion, Plaintiffs point to  eight drafts of an  email \nexchange between Russell and Johnson in various stages of development (the \n“Laramie Emails”).  They contend that the email exchange was fabricated and that \nRussell created and forwarded her final draft of the fabricated email exchange  to \ndefense counsel to produce in discovery in order to support her denial of self-dealing.2  \n(See Pls.’ Suppl. Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions 4–8, ECF No. 116.) \n40. The Laramie Emails are drafts that, once completed, reflect a fake email \nexchange in which Russell purport ed to “give up [her] half” of AK Partners, the \npartnership she had with Johnson,  so that he , alone,  could then sell the Laramie \n \n2 Plaintiffs also contend that, upon review of Russell’s computer, Walton uncovered more  \nemails relating to the Pilot Program that had been manipulated  prior to being produced in \ndiscovery.  (See Pls.’ Suppl. Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions 6 & Ex. 48, ECF No. 139.47.) \nproperty to the  participants in the Pilot Program , thereby avoiding any conflict of \ninterest.  Russell attempted to change history saying, “I know we made the offer in \nthe name of AK Partners but I can just sign my half of the partnership over to you \nand I will step out of it.  If you are willing . . . .  I would stay out of it to avoid conflicts.”  \nRussell then drafted Johnson’s response, “Call me.  I’m willing.”  (Pls.’ Reply Br. Supp. \nMot. Sanctions Ex. 6, ECF No. 109.3; see also Walton Aff. Exs A–H1, ECF Nos. 117.1–\n.16) \n41. Walton examined the Laramie Emails and made the following findings \nregarding the final draft ultimately produced in discovery “ [b]eyond a  reasonable \ndegree of forensic certainty[,]” (Walton Report ¶ 7): \na. On 28 December 2020, Russell created a previously non -existent \nemail conversation between herself and Johnson discussing the \nLaramie Court property for the Pilot Project. \nb. Defendant Russell backdated the newly-created emails so that it \nwould appear that  they were sent on 10 July 2019, well before \nthis litigation began. \nc. Russell then forwarded the newly-created emails to her counsel \nto be produced in discovery.  (Walton Report ¶¶ 7, 11–21; Walton \nAff. ¶ 22.) \n42.   Through counsel, on 26 February 2021 and again on 15 March 2021, \nRussell produced the newly -created emails  bate-stamped RUSSELL – \nJURGENS000720 through RUSSELL – JURGENS000721 in response to Plaintiffs’ \ndiscovery requests.  (Suppl. Aff. Clint. S. Morse ¶ 6 [hereinafter “Suppl. Morse Aff.”], \nECF No. 118; see Walton Aff. Ex. I, ECF No. 117.17.) \n43. There is no indication in the record that Russell’s lawyers knew the \nLaramie Emails were fabricated when they were produced in discovery pursuant to \nRule 26(g).  (See Suppl. Morse Aff. ¶ 6; Walton Aff. Ex. I.)  \n44. Despite requests  from Plaintiffs’ counsel , Ru ssell did not produce a \nnative copy of the Laramie Emails, and Johnson did not produce the Laramie Emails \nin response to a subpoena.  (Pls.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 3, at 2 –3, ECF \nNo. 109.3). \n45. Nowhere in the record does Russell deny the allegation that she created \nthese fake emails.  (See generally Defs. Carl Arnold Jurgens, Jr. &  Kathie Russell’s \nResp. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Leave File Add. Material & Br. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions, ECF \nNo. 122; Def. Kathie Russell’s Suppl. Br. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions.) \n46. The Court finds that Russell created, and then back -dated, the fake \nLaramie Emails to counter allegations of self-dealing in the Amended Complaint.   \n47. After Russell forwarded t he fabricated Laramie Emails to defense \ncounsel, they were produced to Plaintiffs during discovery in this litigation.3  (Suppl. \nMorse Aff. ¶ 6; Walton Aff. Ex. I.) \n \n3 The record does not contain the signed discovery response referenced by Plaintiffs , but \nDefendants do not contest that they included the Laramie Emails, bate-stamped RUSSELL-\nJURGENS 000720 et seq. with their responses to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests.  (See, e.g., \nDefs. Carl Arnold Jurgens, Jr. & Kathie Russell’s Resp. Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Leave File Add. \nMaterial & Br. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions 8  (admitting that the documents were “produced \nin the extensive ESI discovery Plaintiffs demanded in this action.”).)  Therefore, as discussed \ninfra, the Court concludes that the discovery response s referencing the falsified Laramie \nEmails violate Rule 26(g).  \n48. The Court finds that Russell engaged in this misconduct alone and that \nneither her counsel nor any of the other Defendants were aware that Russell falsified \nthe Laramie E-mails when those documents were produced in discovery. \n49. Plaintiffs, the Association, the New Entities, and Jurgens have incurred \ncosts as a direct result of Russell’s falsification of the Laramie Emails.  These costs \ninclude those associated with Plaintiffs’ Motion, the parties’ related briefs and \nsupplementary materials, the expense of the Plaintiffs’ expert to perform services and \ntestify, and the hearing on this Motion. \nIV. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n50. Trial courts have the inherent authority to sanction parties when faced \nwith misconduct in the litigation process.  See Daniels v. Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co.,  \n320 N.C. 669, 674 (1987) (“Through its inherent power the court has authority to do \nall things that are reasonably necessary for the proper administration of justice.”  \n(citation omitted)); Red Valve, Inc. v. Titan Valve, Inc., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 57, at *39 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2019) (“[T]he power to sanction disobedient parties, even to \nthe point of dismissing their actions or striking their defenses, . . . is longstanding \nand inherent.” (quoting Minor v. Minor, 62 N.C. App. 750, 752 (1983) (alte rations in \noriginal))); see Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 46 (1991) (stating that neither \nstatutes nor court rules “displace[] the inherent power to impose sanctions for . . . bad-\nfaith conduct” because they “are not substitutes for . . . inherent power”). \n51. Separately, the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure require  this \nCourt to impose sanctions against a party who se counsel, acting at the direction of \nhis client,  certifies a discovery response that the party has “interposed for any \nimproper purpose[.]”4  N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(g); see Azalea Garden Bd. & Care, Inc. v. \nVanhoy, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 26, 2009) (explaining that \nRule 26(g) is designed to “make discovery a more cooperative and less adversarial \nsystem[,]” “to reduce, not increase, the cost of litigation [,]” and therefore “mandates \nsanctions when violations of the rule occur”); Turner v. Duke Univ., 325 N.C. 152, 164 \n(1989) (“Violation of Rule 26(g) subjects the attorney or party to mandatory \nsanctions.”) \n52. “When imposing sanctions, ‘ the trial court has discretion to pursue a \nwide range of actions both for the purpose of leveling the evidentiary playing field \nand for sanctioning the improper conduct.  ’ ”  Clark v. Alan Vester Auto Grp. , Inc., \n2009 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 17, 2009) (quoting Vodusek v. \nBayliner Marine Corp., 71 F.3d 148, 156 (4th Cir. 1995)).  The Court is free “to fashion \nan appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.”  Id . \n(quoting Silvestri v. Gen . Motors Corp., 271 F.3d 583 , 593 (4th Cir. 2001) ); see Red \nValve, Inc., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 57, at * 41 (“The imposition of sanctions is left to the \nsound discretion of the trial judge and ‘ will not be overturned absent a showing of \nabuse of discretion.’ ” (quoting Cloer v. Smith, 132 N.C. App. 569, 573 (1999))); Turner \nv. Duke Univ., 101 N.C. App. 276, 280–81 (1991) (“[T]he selection of sanctions remains \n \n4 Plaintiffs argue that sanction s are appropriate under Rule 11.  (See Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nSanctions.)  Because the Laramie Emails were produced in discovery, the Court decides this \nMotion under the analogous provisions of Rule 26(g).  See  G. Gray Wilson, North Carolina \nCivil Procedure, Ch. 26, § 26-15 (Matthew Bender) (citing Brooks v. Giesey, 334 N.C. 303, 318 \n(1993) (“[Rule 26], as opposed to Rule 11, is the proper avenue  for sanctioning misconduct \ninvolving discovery responses.”). \nwithin the discretion of the trial court, and Rule [ ] . . . 26 specifically authorize [s] \nimposition of appropriate sanctions not only against the person who commits \nthe improper act, but also against the perso n on whose behalf the improper act was \ncommitted.”) \n53. The party seeking sanctions bears the burden of proof by the greater \nweight of the evidence.  See Adams v. Bank United of Tex. FSB , 167 N.C. App. 395, \n401 (2004) (stating that under Rule 11, “the burden of proof is by the greater weight \nof the evidence.” (citation omitted)); Brooks, 334 N.C. at 318 (“[S]anctions under Rule \n26(g) may be applied following Rule 11 case law[.]”); Turner, 325 N.C. at 163 –64 \n(interpreting Rules 11 and 26(g) to be analogous).  However, the moving party does \nnot have to demonstrate that it suffered prejudice.   See Stocum v. Oakley, 185 N.C. \nApp. 56, 6 4 (2007)  (noting that Rule 11 sanctions do not require a finding of \nprejudice). \n54. The Court first concludes that Clark Walton is an expert in the field of \ncomputer forensics.  \n55. With respect to the Association’s bylaws, alternative explanations exist \nwith respect to the differences that Plaintiffs believe  to be suspect  in the version \nproduced by Defendants at Russell’s direction.  Walton was unable to opine regarding \nwhen and where the particular changes to the bylaws originated, and there is no \nevidence regarding whether those changes were approved by the Association.  For her \npart, Russell denies manipulating the language and has testified that she is not \naware of any version of the bylaws other than the version she ultimately produced.  \nThe Association was unable to identify its own bylaws.  Therefore, the Court \nconcludes that the evidence is insufficient at this stage for  Plaintiffs to meet their \nburden to prove that Russell fabricated portions of the Association ’s bylaws and \nproduced a falsified document to Plaintiffs during discovery and to the Court with \nher affidavit. \n56. On the other hand, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied \ntheir burden with respect to the Laramie Emails that were created by Russell on 28 \nDecember 2020 and backdated to 10 July 2019.  Walton opined to a reasonable degree \nof certainty that Russell both created and backdated the emails.  It is undisputed that \nshe forwarded the false emails to  her counsel to produce with discovery responses, \nand that counsel, relying on her representation that the emails were authentic , \nproduced them in discovery .5  The Court concludes th at Russell’s egregious and \nintolerable litigation misconduct and violation  of the certification required by  Rule \n26(g) warrants sanctions against her. \n57. But there is no evidence in the  record that either Russell’s counsel or \nany other defendant was aware of the misconduct.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed \nto carry their burden of proving that sanctions are appropriate with respect to counsel \nor any other defendant. Cf. Swisher Hygiene Franchise Corp. v. Clawson, 2019 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 149512, at *19 (D. Ariz. Sept. 3, 2019) (sanctioning corporate entities as \n \n5 Similarly, Walton concludes, as does this Court, that, separately from the Laramie Emails \n(the eight drafts referenced above), Russell also fabricated a second chain of emails regarding \nthe Laramie project that she backdated to June 26– 27.  (See Walton Report ¶  26 (“[T]he \nsubsequent June 26 and June 27 correspondence depicted in the email is completely \nfabricated and was typed out freehand by Russell on the night of December 28, 2020.”).) \nwell as individual wrongdoer when the latter was acting in the course of his duties \nfor the company’s benefit).   \n58. The Court next turns to a  determination of the appropriate sanctions. \nPlaintiffs request, among other thing s, that this Court strike Russell’s answer  and \nenter judgment against her.  (Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions 13.)  To be sure, terminating \nsanctions have been found to be appropriate in cases like this one.  See,  e.g., Garcia \nv. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103953, at *21–22 (D. Colo. Nov. 29, \n2007) (“Without doubt, fabricating evidence and willfully providing false answers \nduring discovery are abusive litigation practices which justify the sanction of \ndismissal with prejudice.”); Asia Pac. Agric. & Forestry Co. v. Sester Farms, 2013 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 125988 , at * 27 (D. Or. July 1 , 2013) (“To permit the fabrication of \nspurious corroborating evidence without the imposition of a harsh responsive \nsanction would constitute an open invitation to ab use of the judicial system of the \nmost egregious kind.”). \n59. Moreover, this Court has inherent authority to strike Russell’s answer \nand default her in this action.  See Garcia, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103953, at *21 \n(“Courts have inherent equitable powers to dismiss actions as a sanction for abusive \nlitigation practices. ” (citing  Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764– 65 \n(1980); TeleVideoSystems, Inc. v. Heidenthal , 826 F.2d 915, 916 (9th Cir. 1987) )); \nLunsford v. JBL Communs., LLC, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. \n3, 2021) (“[E]ven the most severe sanctions, including terminating sanctions, are \nappropriate so long as that sanction is among those expressly authorized by statute \nand there is no specific evidence of injustice.” (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted)). \n60. However, “striking a party’s answer is a severe sanction which should \nonly be imposed where the trial court has considered less severe sanctions and found \nthem to be inappropriate.”  Red Valve, Inc. , 2019 NCB C LEXIS 57, at *62– 63 \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted) ; see Lunsford, 2021 NCBC LEXIS \n17, at *15 (“It is essential to consider ‘less severe sanctions’ before choosing dismissal \nor entry of judgment.” (citing Feeassco, LLC v. Steel Network, Inc., 264 N.C. App. 327, \n337 (2019))); but see Swisher Hygiene Franchise Corp., 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149512, \nat *20–25 (concluding that a sanction for the entity was appropriate when its \nexecutive committed the offending action).   \n61. Furthermore, the “[i]mp osition of sanctions that are directed to the \noutcome of the case, such as dismissals, default judgments, or preclusion \norders, . . . are examined in the light of the general purpose of the Rules to encourage \ntrial on the merits.”  Moore v. Mills, 190 N.C. App. 178, 180–81 (2008) (quoting Am. \nImps., Inc. v. G. E. Emps. W. Region Fed. Credit Union, 37 N.C. App. 121, 124 (1978)); \nsee also Swisher Hygiene Franchise Corp. , 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149512,  at *10 \n(“Due process limits the imposition of the sever e sanctions of dismissal or default to \nextreme circumstances in which the deception relates to the matters in controversy \nand prevents their imposition merely for punishment of an infraction that did not \nthreaten to interfere with the rightful decision of the case.” (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted)). \n62. While a severe sanction is appropriate, t he Court determines that \nstriking Russell’s answer is too blunt a force to use.  The allegations regarding Russell \nare intertwined with the allegations ag ainst other defendants who appear to be \ninnocent of her misdeeds.  Therefore, to default her would be to punish them as well.  \nThe Court determines that a sanction impacting Russell alone is more appropriate \nunder the unique circumstances of this case.   Se e Garcia, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n103953, at *19 (awarding sanctions where “[t]he great significance of [the fabricated \nevidence] is that it demonstrates that the [party’s] willingness to lie knows no \nbounds” and stating that such conduct “is destructive of the justice system and is \nintolerable”).  \n63. Additionally, a default would harm more than it would cure.   The \nfalsified documents pertain only to Plaintiffs’ First Claim for Relief based on a one-\ntime project involving the Laramie Court property.  The gravamen of th is action is  \nwhether Russell and Jurgens duped the Association into transferring its assets—and \nlured its membership—to the New Entities.  A determination of those claims does not \nturn on the Laramie Emails.   Cf. Swisher Hygiene Franchise Corp. , 2019 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 149512, at *20 (determining that default was appropriate because the \nfalsification went to the heart of the case). \n64. That said, Russell’s fabrication of the Laramie Emails unnecessarily \ncomplicated and extended this litigation resulting in significant expense to the other \nparties.   The Court concludes that these costs would not have been incurred but for \nRussell’s actions.  Therefore, the Court, in its discretion, awards to  Plaintiffs, the \nAssociation, the New Entities , and Jurgens the costs associated with Plaintiffs’ \nMotion, the parties’ related briefs and supplementary materials, the expense of the \nPlaintiffs’ expert to perform services and testify, and the hearing on this Motion.   \nThese costs are to be paid personally by Russell. \n65.   In levying this sanction, the Court specifically finds that , in falsifying \nthe Laramie Emails, Russell acted to further her own personal interests and failed to \nact in good faith or with reasonable grounds to believe that her actions were in the \nbest interests of the Association or the New Entities. \n66. Additionally, the Court, in its discretion, concludes that an evidentiary \nsanction is appropriate.  Regardless of , and without forecasting, any determination \nregarding either: (a) the viability of Plaintiffs’ First Claim for Relief  for breach of \nfiduciary duty based o n Russell’s actions with respect to  the Laramie project, (see \nCompl. ¶¶ 76–92), or (b) the substantive evidentiary value of the Laramie Emails, if \nthis action is tried, the Court will allow evidence of Russell’s misconduct with respect \nto the Laramie Email s, including but not limited to the testimony of  Walton,  to be \nadmitted for impeachment purposes, see Garcia v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 2007 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 94420, at *20 (D. Colo. Dec. 27, 2007) (stating that regardless of whether \nthe fabrication implicates matters material to the claims, “credibility is always \nrelevant and material in any case”); Esposito v. Suffolk Cnty. Cmty. Coll., 517 F. Supp. \n3d 126, 136 (E.D.N.Y. 2021) (Courts have “inherent powers, not conferred by rule or \nstatute . . . to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial \nprocess.” (citation omitted) (alteration in original)). \n67. Finally, the Court is constrained to observe that, in this case, Russell is \na litigant.  Had she appeared as a practicing attorney, this Court would be compelled \nto sanction her further for the base violation of professional responsibility that has \noccurred.  It understates the severity of the offense to say that this type of conduct is \ninconsistent with the integrity necessary to be a licensed member of this State’s Bar.   \nTherefore, even though this Court shares jurisdiction with the State Bar in matters \ninvolving attorney discipline, see N.C.G.S. § 84-36, the Court declines to exercise that \njurisdiction here, opting instead to refer this  matter of general impropriety  to the \nState Bar to consider Russell’s transgressions in a manner consistent with the North \nCarolina Rules of Professional Responsibility and its prior decisions , see In re Nw. \nBonding Co., 16 N.C. App. 272, 275 (1972) (“[Q]uestions relating to the propriety and \nethics of an attorney are ordinarily for the consideration of the North Carolina State \nBar.”); Swenson v. Thibaut , 39 N.C. App. 77, 109 (1978) (stating that “while the \ninterests of the [courts and the North Carolina State Bar] having disciplinary \njurisdiction may, and often do, overlap, they are not always identical”). \n68. For these reasons , Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions is GRANTED, and \nthe Court, in the exercise of its discretion, hereby ORDERS as follows: \na. Defendant Russell shall be  personally responsible for paying the cost s, \nincluding reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by Plaintiffs , the \nAssociation, the New Entities , and Jurgens related to this Motion , \nincluding, but not limited to : the costs of filing, briefing (including \nsupplemental filings), and hearing the Plaintiffs’ Motion; and the costs \nassociated with Walton’s services and testimony. \nb. By 8 March 2022,  Plaintiffs and the remaining Defendants  shall each \nfile a petition with supporting materials sufficient to allow the Court to \nmake findings with respect to the amount  and reasonableness  of the \ncosts assessed.  See, e.g., Ge Betz, Inc. v. Conrad, 231 N.C. App. 214, 244 \n(2013); Couch v. Priv. Diagnostic Clinic, 146 N.C. App. 658, 672 (2001). \nc. By 28 March 2022,  Defendant Russe ll may  file her responses to the \npetitions filed. \nd. Evidence of Russell’s misconduct with respect to the Laramie Emails as \ndetermined in this Order may be admitted  at trial  for impeachment \npurposes, notwithstanding whatever substantive evidentiary value it \nmay also have. \ne. Plaintiffs are directed to provide a  copy of thi s Order to  the North \nCarolina State Bar for its review and decision regarding further \ndiscipline under the laws and rules of this State. \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 16th day of February, 2022. \n \n \n /s/ Julianna Theall Earp \n Julianna Theall Earp \n Special Superior Court Judge \n  for Complex Business Cases \n \n \n "
