North Carolina Board \nof Physical Therapy Examiners , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 33 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 26, \n2016) (hereinafter, the “April 26 Opinion”).  In its April 26 Opinion, the Court \ndismissed the Acupuncture Board’s Amended Complaint by granting two motions to \ndismiss (the “Motions to Dismiss”), one brought by Defendant North Carolina Board \nof Physical Therapy Examiners (the “Physical Therapy Board”) and the other \nbrought by Defendants Elizabeth Henr y, Aart Schulenklopper, Cornerstone \nPhysical Therapy, Inc., and Jessan Hager (collectively, the “Private Defendants”). \n{3} The Acupuncture Board’s Amended Complaint sought a declaratory \njudgment from the Court that the practice  known as “dry needling” is a form of \nacupuncture over which the Acupuncture Board has exclusive licensing powers.  \nThe Acupuncture Board further sought a permanent injunction barring the Physical \nTherapy Board and the Private Defendants  from regulating and practicing dry \nneedling, respectively.  April 26 Opinion, at *2.  The Court dismissed the Amended \nComplaint pursuant to North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(2), concluding that this Court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction.  \nApril 26 Opinion at *27.   \n{4} In particular, the Court determined that it lacked subject matter \njurisdiction because the Acupuncture Board had failed to exhaust its administrative \nremedies under North Carolina’s Administra tive Procedure Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. § \n150B-1, \net seq., which is a matter of standing.  April 26 Opinion at *10 (citing Shell \nIsland Homeowners Ass’n v. Tomlinson , 134 N.C. App. 217, 220, 517 S.E.2d 406, \n410 (1999)).  The Physical Therapy Board alleged in its Motion to Dismiss that the \nAcupuncture Board had failed to exhaust administrative remedies because it did \nnot seek a declaratory ruling pursuant to  section 150B-4 or f ile a petition for \nrulemaking pursuant to section 150B-20, either of which remedy the Physical \n \n \nTherapy Board alleged was available to the Acupuncture Board and would have \nentitled the Acupuncture Board to judi cial review under the Administrative \nProcedure Act.  (PT Board’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 12.)  The Court agreed. \n{5} The Acupuncture Board filed the Motion on May 6, 2016, moving the Court \nto clarify whether the Acupuncture Board is required to pursue administrative \nremedies under section 150B-4, 150B-20, or both.  The Motion has been fully briefed \nand is now ripe for resolution.1   \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{6} Rule 59 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party to \nmove the Court to alter or amend a judgment under any of nine enumerated \ngrounds listed in Rule 59(a).  N.C. R. Civ. P. 59.  A Rule 59 motion to alter or amend \na judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.  Hamlin v. Austin, \n49 N.C. App. 196, 197, 270 S. E.2d 558, 558 (1980).  The motion “must ‘state the \ngrounds therefor’ and the grounds stated must be among those listed in Rule 59(a).”  \nSmith v. Johnson, 125 N.C. App. 603, 606, 481 S.E.2d  415, 417 (1997) (quoting N.C. \nR. Civ. P. 7(b)(1)); N.C. Alliance for Transp. Reform, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Transp. , \n183 N.C. App. 466, 470, 645 S. E.2d 105, 108 (2007) (dismissing a Rule 59(e) motion \nas deficient under Rule 7(b)(1) when “the basis of the motion was not apparent from \nthe grounds listed, leaving the trial court and the opposing party to guess what the \nparticular grounds might be”). \n{7} Rule 60(b) permits the Court, if one or more of the enumerated grounds are \nsatisfied, to “relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, \nor proceeding.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 60(b).  Like a Rule 59(e) motion, a Rule 60(b) motion \nis addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.  \nSink v. Easter, 288 N.C. 183, \n198, 217 S.E.2d 532, 541 (1975).  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Pursuant to Business Court Rule 15.4(a), the Court decides the Motion without oral argument. \n \n \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n{8} In its brief supporting the Motion, the Acupuncture Board requests that \nthe Court “alter, amend, or otherwise clarify the [April 26] Opinion to make explicit \nthat the Court’s holding is that the Acupuncture Board can pursue administrative \nremedies under either, but is not required to pursue both, section 150B-4 and 150B-\n20.”  (Pl.’s Br. Supp. Rule 59 and 60 Mot.  3.)  The Acupuncture Board requests this \nrelief because it considers a statement made in Paragraph 37 of the April 26 \nOpinion to be confusing and contradictor y.  The Court finds it appropriate to \nreproduce that paragraph here in its entirety: \nTherefore, because the Acupuncture  Board has brought this suit \nwithout seeking relief from the Phys ical Therapy Board under section \n150B-4 and 150B-20, which are adequate remedies available to it, the \nAcupuncture Board has not exhausted its administrative remedies \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act.  The Court therefore \nconcludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action and \ngrants the Physical Therapy Board’ s Motion to Dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(1).  \nApril 26 Opinion, at *24 (hereafter “Paragraph 37”).  \n{9} The Acupuncture Board claims this language directly contradicts an \nearlier statement in the April 26 Opinion explaining that “a declaratory ruling \n[issued pursuant to section 150B-4] is binding on the agency and the requestor, and \nthe agency’s ruling or its decision not to issue a ruling is immediately subject to \njudicial review,” April 26 Opinion, at *20.  The Acupuncture Board also argues that \nthe statement at issue in Paragraph 37 is contrary to binding North Carolina \nprecedent, specifically\n P o rte r v . N .C . De p’ t o f I n s., 40 N.C. App. 376, 379–80, 253 \nS.E.2d 44, 46–47 (1979), which the Acupuncture Board contends stands for the rule \nthat “when a plaintiff has two available avenues of administrative relief, it can \npursue either and is entitled to judicial review of either if an appeal right is \nafforded for an adverse decision under the Administrative Procedure Act.”  (Pl.’s Br. \nSupp. Rule 59 and 60 Mot.  3.)   \n \n \n{10} The Court finds that the Acupuncture Board’s Motion is without merit \nunder both Rules 59(e) and 60(b) and should be denied.    \n{11} First, the Court concludes that the Acupuncture Board has proceeded \nimproperly under Rule 59(e) because the Acupuncture Board has failed to \n“specifically state which of the nine gro unds in Rule 59(a) supports the motion.”  \n(PT Board’s Mot. Opp. Rule 59 and 60 Mot. 4.)  A trial court acts properly within its \ndiscretion when it denies a Rule 59(e) mo tion for failure to identify under which \ngrounds in Rule 59(a) it seeks relief.  \nN.C. Alliance for Transp. Reform, Inc. , 183 \nN.C. App. at 469–70, 645 S.E.2d at 108.  Although that principle may appear overly \nexacting, it is a logical application of Nort h Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 7(b)(1), \nwhich requires motions to state th eir grounds with particularity.  Id.  The \nAcupuncture Board has not identified the grounds justifying the requested relief, \nand it is not apparent to the Court which, if any, of the justifications would apply.   \n{12} In addition to the specific grounds listed in subparts (1) through (8) of Rule \n59(a), the Court may in its discretion gran t a motion to alter or amend a judgment \nfor “[a]ny other reason heretofore recognized as grounds for new trial.”  N.C. R. Civ. \nP. 59(a)(9).  Even under that expansive provision, however, the Court cannot grant \nthe requested relief because, more broadly, the Acupuncture Board essentially asks \nthe Court to render an impermissible advisory opinion.  The Acupuncture Board \nstates that it seeks clarification from the Court “in the form of an amended or \nsupplemental order so that its path going forward is clear.”  (Pl.’s Br. Supp. Rule 59 \nand 60 Mot.  2.)  To advise on what path a litigant should take in future proceedings \nfalls squarely within the definition of an impermissible advisory opinion.  “The \ncourts have no jurisdiction to determine matters purely speculative, enter \nanticipatory judgments, declare social stat us, deal with theoretical problems, give \nadvisory opinions, answer moot questions,  adjudicate academic matters, provide for \ncontingencies which may hereafter aris e, or give abstract opinions.”  \nLittle v. \nWachovia Bank & Trust Co. , 252 N.C. 229, 243, 113 S.E.2d 689, 700 (1960).  See \nalso Greensboro v. Wall , 247 N.C. 516, 519, 101 S.E.2d 413, 416 (1958) (describing \nan advisory opinion as one which the parties might “put on ice to be used if and \n \n \nwhen occasion might arise”).  The Court therefore denies the Motion under Rule \n59(e).    \n{13} The Acupuncture Board’s Rule 60(b) motion fails for similar reasons.  The \nfirst five subparts of Rule 60(b) identify specific grounds for relief from judgment, \nincluding mistake, newly discovered evid ence, fraud, and a void or satisfied \njudgment.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)–(5).   None of these grounds apply to the \nAcupuncture Board’s Motion, and the Acupuncture Board advances no argument to \nthe contrary.  Subpart (6) allows the Court to grant relief from judgment for “[a]ny \nother reason justifying relief from the operat ion of the judgment.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(6).  Despite its sweeping language, howe ver, this provision “is not a catch-all,” \nand a movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6) must show that extraordinary \ncircumstances exist and that justice demands relief from judgment.  \nGoodwin v. \nCashwell, 102 N.C. App. 275, 278, 401  S.E.2d 840, 842 (1991)  (citation omitted).  \nSee also State ex rel. Envtl. Mgt. Comm’n v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc., 101 N.C. \nApp. 433, 447, 400 S.E.2d 107, 116 (1991) (distinguishing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion for \nrelief from judgment from a motion to amend a judgment).  The Court concludes \nthat the Acupuncture Board has not shown that extraordinary circumstances exist \nhere, as the Acupuncture Board merely seeks clarification of the Court’s April 26 \nOpinion in the event it confronts this same issue in a later proceeding.  Therefore, \nthe Court declines to grant the Motion under Rule 60(b) and its various subparts. \n{14} Despite the above, the Court finds it appropriate to briefly discuss \nParagraph 37.  The Court disa grees that Paragraph 37 stands in contradiction with \nany other portion of the April 26 Opinion or with precedential case law.  \nNevertheless, if quoted out of context, as the Acupuncture Board has done here, \nParagraph 37 could be read, inaccurately, to stand for a proposition which the Court \ndisclaimed in other portions of the Apri l 26 Opinion.  The explanation of that \ncontext provided here does not alter any of  the substantive rights of the parties as \nordered in the April 26 Opinion, nor is th e original meaning of the April 26 Opinion \namended in any way.  \n \n \n{15} Paragraph 37 should be considered in the context of the facts alleged in the \ncase.  The Physical Therapy Board’s Motion to Dismiss argued that the \nAcupuncture Board lacked standing to seek a declaratory judgment because it had \nfailed to exhaust available administrative  remedies.  The Physical Therapy Board \nspecifically argued that relief was avail able under either section 150B-4 or section \n150B-20 of North Carolina’s Administra tive Procedure Act and that the \nAcupuncture Board had pursued neither remedy.  In granting the Physical Therapy \nBoard’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court merely agreed with the Physical Therapy \nBoard’s arguments that by failing to seek  relief under either section 150B-4 or \n150B-20, the Acupuncture Board failed to pursue its available remedies.  The \nposture of the Motions to Dismiss did not require the Court to decide what steps the \nAcupuncture Board must take to obtain judicial review under the Administrative \nProcedure Act or to gain standing to se ek a declaratory judgment, and the Court \ntherefore remained silent on that question .  Here, as in the April 26 Opinion, the \nCourt finds it unnecessary and improper to define what constitutes the exhaustion \nof administrative remedies for the Acupuncture Board given the current posture of \nthis case.   \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{16} Based on the foregoing, the Court hereby DENIES the Acupuncture \nBoard’s Motion.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 24th day of June, 2016. \n \n \n \n      / s /  L o u i s  A .
