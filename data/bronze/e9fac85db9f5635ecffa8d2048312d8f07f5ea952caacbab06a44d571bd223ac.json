On November 5, 2013, Plaintiffs KRG New Hill Place, LLC and Kite Realty \nNew Hill Place, LLC (“Plaintiffs”) initiated this action by filing their Complaint.  Plaintiffs’ \naction was designated as No. 13 CVS 14770 by the Clerk of Superior Court of Wake County. \n2. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs pu rsue the following claims for relief \n(“Claim(s)”): Count I – Breach of Contract; Co unt II – Breach of Implied Covenant of Good \nFaith and Fair Dealing; Count III – Declaratory Judgment; Count IV – Claim for Fraudulent \nTransfer Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23 et seq.; Count V –  Unfair and Deceptive Trade \nPractices; and Count VI – Individual Liability Under N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 57C-3-30 and 57C-3-\n32 (as against the Individual Defendants). \n3. On December 23, 2013, Defendants Springs Investors, LLC (“Springs \nInvestors”), B. Kyle Ward, Michael L. Hunter, and Stephen C. Ward (collectively, “Individual \nDefendants”) filed an Answer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint, and a Counterclaim on behalf of \nSprings Investors.  \n4. On October 30, 2014, this Court granted Defendants’ Motion to Amend Answer \nand Counterclaims, and on November 6, 2014,  Defendants filed their Verified Amended \nAnswer and Counterclaims. The Amended Count erclaim alleges four causes of action \n(“Counterclaim(s)”): First Cause of Action: Br each of the Development Agreement; Second \nCause of Action: Breach of the Covenant of G ood Faith and Fair Dealing; Third Cause of \n \n \nAction: Declaratory Judgment; and Fourth C ause of Action: Tortious Interference with \nProspective Economic Advantage. \n5. On December 3, 2014, Plaintiffs filed Plaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss, seeking \ndismissal of Defendants’ Counterclaim for Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic \nAdvantage pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Pl aintiffs contend that Defendants have not \nsuccessfully alleged that Plaintiffs induced a third party not to ente r into a contract with \nIndividual Defendants, that Plaintiffs acted without justification, or that Individual \nDefendants would have entered into the third party contract but for Plaintiffs’ actions. \n6. On December 15, 2014, Plaintiffs filed the Plaintiffs’ Complaint Motion.  The \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint Motion seeks leave of th e Court to make several amendments to the \nComplaint that primarily fall into two categories: (1) amendments to allegations that \nPlaintiffs ceased work under the disputed co ntract, to allege instead that the work was \n“impeded” due to permitting issues; and (2) am endments to add additional allegations in \nsupport of Plaintiffs’ claim for fraudulent transfer. \n7. On December 22, 2014, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Count IV of \nPlaintiffs’ Claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), on the basis that Plaintiff’s Claim for fraudulent \ntransfer is moot and the complained-of transfer did not result in any harm to Plaintiffs. \n8. On February 18, 2015, the Court held a hearing on the motions. The motions \nhave been fully briefed and argued and are ripe for determination. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n Among other things, the parties allege that: 1 \n9. Plaintiffs are limited liability companies that own a 123 acre parcel of real \nproperty in Holly Springs, North Carolina, that  Plaintiffs are developing into a shopping \ncenter, among other things.  \n10. Springs Investors is a limited liability company that owns a 21 acre parcel of \nproperty (the “Springs Property”) that is adjacent to Plaintiffs’ real property in Holly Springs.  \nThe Individual Defendants are members of Springs Investors.  On February 28, 2013, Springs \nInvestors conveyed the Springs Property to the Individual Defendants.  In January, 2014, \nthe Individual Defendants transferred the property back to Springs Investors. \n11. On July 15, 2008, Plaintiffs and Springs Investors entered into a Post Closing \nDevelopment Agreement (the “Development Ag reement”) to coordinate the development of \ntheir adjacent properties and share the cost of infrastructure work, including improvements \nto existing roadways and the construction of  an internal thoroughfare, necessary to the \ndevelopment of the parties’ respective properties (the “Infrastructure Work”). \n12. Plaintiffs spearheaded contracting for the two phases of the Infrastructure \nWork: Phase I focused on improvements to existing roadways, and Phase II was the \nconstruction of the internal thoroughfare.  Pursuant to the Development Agreement, \nPlaintiffs were to “endeavor to  cause each contract entered into for the performance of the \nInfrastructure Work to require substantial co mpletion of the work thereunder to be \ncompleted such that the entire Infrastructur e Work shall be completed by December 31, \n2010.”2 \n                                                 \n1 Additional allegations relevant to the motions to dismiss are discussed below. \n2 Compl. & Proposed Am. Compl. ¶14; Ex. 1 to Compl. & Proposed Am. Compl. (the “Development \nAgreement”) at § 2. \n \n \n13. Due to the economic downturn that occurred after execution of the \nDevelopment Agreement, the Infrastructure Work was put on hold until early 2012, when \nthe real estate markets showed some improvement.  Phase I was substantially completed on \nor around March 1, 2013. Phase II has not been completed because the parties dispute which \none is responsible for the cost of completing the Infrastructure Work. \nDISCUSSION \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Amend Complaint3 \n14. In their Motion to Amend Complaint, Plaintiffs seek to amend the allegations \ncontained in numbered paragraphs in the or iginal Complaint, and to add new numbered \nparagraphs alleging additional facts in su pport of their claim for fraudulent transfers. 4  For \nthe reasons stated herein, the Court concludes in its discretion that the Plaintiffs’ Motion to \nAmend is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. \n15. In the original Complaint, Plaintiffs  allege that Defendants fraudulently \ntransferred the Springs Property from Spring s Investors to the Individual Defendants. \nPlaintiffs now move to add allegations t hat Defendants engaged in certain financial \ntransactions that violated the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (“UFTA”) in addition to the \ntransaction involving the Springs Property. 5  Plaintiffs contend that they first learned of \nthese transactions in December 2014, when Defendants produced financial records that \n                                                 \n3 At the hearing, Defendants’ counsel asserted that Plaintiffs’ proposed Amended Complaint removes \nall references to the specific amounts of money that Plaintiffs claim they are seeking and, \naccordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to allege that this Court has jurisdiction.  The Court notes that in \nparagraph 12 of the proposed Amended Complaint Plaintiffs allege that the Court has jurisdiction \npursuant to G.S. §7A-243, but erroneously state that the amount in controversy “exceeds $10,000” \nrather than correct amount of $25,000.  In addition, from the record developed in this case it is clear \nthat Plaintiff seeks a sum far greater than $25,000 as damages under their claims in this case.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded the jurisdiction of this Court. \n4 All references herein are to the paragraphs as numbered in the Proposed Amended Complaint filed \nby Plaintiffs with their Motion to Amend. \n5 Plaintiffs allege the transactions consisted primarily of notes receivable for loans Springs Investors \nmade to “sister entities” which Springs Investors forgave and removed from as assets from its \nbalance sheets. \n \n \nPlaintiffs had requested through discovery in  April 2014.  Defendants contend that the \nproposed amendments are futile for reasons discussed below with re gard to Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the UFTA claim. \n16. Rule 15 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”) provides that \n“leave shall be freely given” to amend a pleading “when justice so requires.”  This has been \ninterpreted to mean that an amendment should  be “freely allowed unless some material \nprejudice to the other party is demonstrated.” Mauney v. Morris, 316 N.C. 67, 72 (1986).  A \ncourt may deny a motion to amend for, inter alia, undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice, \nfutility, and failure to cure through previous amendments. See, e.g., Martin v. Hare, 78 N.C. \nApp. 358, 361 (1985).  Ultimately, whether to a llow an amendment rests in the trial judge’s \ndiscretion. House of Raeford Farms, Inc. v. Raeford, 104 N.C. App. 280, 282 (1991). \n17. There is no dispute that Plaintiffs did not receive the records that revealed the \ntransactions upon which they base their amended allegations of violations of the UFTA until \nDecember 2014.  The records consisted of docu ments Plaintiffs had first requested from \nDefendants in April 2014.  Defendants objected to producing the records, but ultimately \nagreed to produce them in December.  Under the circumstances, the Court concludes in its \ndiscretion that Plaintiffs did not unduly delay in seeking these amendments and that justice \nrequires that Plaintiffs be permitted to am end their Complaint to add the allegations \nregarding these transactions. As to these allegations, the Plaintiffs’ Complaint Motion should \nbe GRANTED. \n18. Plaintiffs have also moved to amend their allegations in paragraphs 26 and 27 \nof the original Complaint regarding the reas on that the Infrastructure Work under the \nDevelopment Agreement was put on hold.  In the original Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that \nPlaintiffs and Springs Investors put the project on hold because of the “economic downturn”, \nand renewed work on the project in early 2012.   Plaintiffs seek to amend paragraph 26 to \n \n \nallege that the Infrastructure Work was merely “impeded” and not put on hold. 6  Plaintiffs \nseek to amend paragraph 27 to allege that “construction on the roadway improvement project \ncould not begin until [the parties] secured all necessary permitting” and that Springs \nInvestors was not able to obtain one of the necessary permits until December 6, 2010. 7  \nPlaintiffs contend that this new explanation for why the Infrastructure Work was put on hold \nonly came to light when Plaintiffs’ own Rule  30(b)(6) witness testified in a deposition \nconducted by Defendants on November 17, 2014.  Plaintiffs offer no explanation as to why \nthis information, provided by their own witne ss, would not have been available to them at \nthe time that they commenced this lawsui t.  Defendants argue that the requested \namendment is an eleventh hour attempt by Plai ntiffs to change their position on why the \nInfrastructure Work was not completed by De cember 31, 2010, that Plaintiffs “unduly \ndelayed” in seeking the amendment, and that the amendment would be prejudicial to \nDefendants.8 \n19. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs unduly delayed in seeking the amendments to \nparagraphs 26 and 27.  See Draughton v. Harnett Cnty. Sch. Bd., 166 N.C. App. 464, 467-68 \n(2004) (denying the plaintiff’s motion to amend for undue delay when the motion was filed \nover four years after the event giving rise to the lawsuit, and over two years after the original \ncomplaint was filed); Williams v. Craft Dev., LLC, 199 N.C. App. 500, 509-10 (2009) (denying \na motion to amend when the plaintiff made her motion over a year after she filed the original \ncomplaint, and was based upon deposition testimony elicited two months prior to motion).  In \nthis case, the Infrastructure Work was put on hold in late 2008 or early 2009.  Plaintiffs did \nnot seek amendment of the Complaint to more accurately reflect what they now claim were \n                                                 \n6 Proposed Amend. Compl. ¶ 26. \n7 Id. ¶ 27. \n8 Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Motion to Amend 3. \n \n \nthe reasons they ceased work until over five years later, and more than one year after they \nfiled the original Complaint. The Court, in its discretion, concludes that the proposed \namendments to paragraphs 26 and 27 should be DENIED. \nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss Defendant’s Counterclaim for Intentional Interference with \nProspective Economic Advantage \n \n20. Plaintiffs move the Court pursuant to  Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss Defendants’ \nCounterclaim for tortious inte rference with prospective economic advantage.  The \nCounterclaim9 arises from the Individual Defendant s’ thwarted joint venture with a third \nparty, Kaplan Communities (“Kaplan”), to deve lop the Springs Property for a residential \napartment complex (“the Joint Venture”).  De fendants allege that Plaintiffs’ failure to \ncomplete the Infrastructure Work under the Development Agreement caused Kaplan to back \nout of the Joint Venture.  Plaintiffs’ contend that Defendants’ claim for tortious interference \nshould be dismissed because it fails to allege facts sufficient to show that Plaintiffs induced \nKaplan not to enter into the Joint Venture, that Plaintiffs were without justification in failing \nto complete the Infrastructure Work, or that Kaplan would have completed the Joint Venture \nwith Defendants “but for” Plaintiffs’ failure to complete the Infrastructure Work.10 \n21. In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim, the \ncourt treats the well-pleaded allegations in the counterclaims as true and admitted. However, \nconclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact are not deemed admitted. Sutton v. \nDuke, 277 N.C. 94, 98 (1970). The court views the allegations in the light most favorable to \nthe non-movant. See Ford v. Peaches Entm’t Corp., 83 N.C. App. 155, 156 (1986).  A claim \nshould not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) unless it “affirmatively appears that [claimant] \nis entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be presented in support of the \n                                                 \n9 Defs.’ Am. Answer and Counterclaims ¶¶112-124. \n10 Pls.’ Mot. Dismiss 1. \n \n \nclaim.” Ladd v. Estate of Kellenberger, 314 N.C. 477, 481 (1985) (quoting Presnell v. Pell, 298 \nN.C. 715, 719 (1979)).   \n22. In their Counterclaim, Defendants a llege that from October 2012 through \nFebruary 2013, Defendants negotiated the terms of the Joint Venture with Kaplan. 11  \nPlaintiffs had knowledge of the Joint Ventur e and the crucial relationship between the \ncompletion of the Infrastructure Work and the development of the Springs Property in the \nJoint Venture.12  Plaintiffs were contractually oblig ated by the Development Agreement to \ncomplete the Infrastructure Work by December 10,  2010, but failed to do so in breach of the \nDevelopment Agreement.13 \n23. Defendants allege that Plaintiffs’ failure to complete the Infrastructure Work \nin breach of the Development Agreement “caused the Individual Defendants and Kaplan to \nrefrain from” formally entering into the Joint Venture. 14  Defendants have not alleged that \nPlaintiffs had any contact with or directed any actions towards Kaplan.  Defendants further \nallege that the failure of the Joint Venture caused damages to Defendant.15 \n24. “To establish tortious interference with  prospective economic advantage, a \nplaintiff must show that the defendant, without justification, induced a third party to refrain \nfrom entering into a contract with the plai ntiff, which would have been made absent the \ndefendant's interference.” Alcorn v. Bland , 2012 N.C. App. LEXIS 1416 at *21-22 (2012) \n(quoting MLC Auto., LLC v. Town of S. Pines , 207 N.C. App. 555, 571 (2010)); \nDaimlerchrysler Corp. v. Kirkhart , 148 N.C. App. 572, 585 (2002) (stating that a claim for \ntortious interference with prospective economic advantage must show that the adverse party \n                                                 \n11 Defs.’ Am.

[and] that the contract would have ensued but for [the] interference.\"). \n25. Defendants contend that they have adequately pleaded the inducement \nelement of a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage by alleging \nthat Plaintiffs’ breach of the Development Ag reement caused Kaplan not to enter into the \nJoint Venture.  Defendants argue that they are merely required to allege that that Plaintiffs’ \nconduct caused Kaplan not to enter into the Joint Venture, and not that Plaintiffs \naffirmatively directed any conduct towards Kaplan.16  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants are \nrequired to “allege that [Plaintiffs] acted with the purpose of inducing Kaplan to refrain from” \nentering into the Joint Venture.17 \n26. The Court concludes that the induceme nt required to establish a claim for \nintentional interference with prospective ec onomic advantage requires purposeful conduct \nintended to influence a third party not to enter into a contract with the claimant.  The North \nCarolina Court of Appeals has held: \nThe relevant definition of “induce” is (1) “to move by persuasion or influence[;]” \n(2) “to call forth or bring about by influence or stimulation[;]” and (3) “to cause \nthe formation of[.]” Similarly, Black’s Law Dictionary defines inducement as \n“[t]he act or process of enticing or persuading another person to take a certain \ncourse of action.”  We note that all of the above-cited definitions of  . . . “induce” \nare similar in that they involve active persuasion, request, or petition. \n \nInland Am. Winston Hotels, Inc. v. Crockett , 212 N.C. App. 349, 354 (2011) (citing \nMerriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 637 (11th  ed. 2005) and Black’s Law \nDictionary 845 (8th ed. 2009)).18 \n                                                 \n16 Defs.’ Opp. Mot.

Bland, supra, supports the notion that inducement \nmust have some element of purposefulness to support a claim for intentional interference with \nprospective economic advantage.  In discussing the “without justification” element of the claim, the \ncourt held that a design to injure the plaintiff could be established by “force, threats, or intimidation” \ndirected towards a third party to “sway” the third party not to contract with plaintiff, and that “there \n \n \n27. Although Inland involved interpretation of the word “induce” as used in \na written employment agreement, there is nothing about the court’s analysis of that \nword’s meaning that makes it inapplicable to this case. \n28. Defendants’ position that the word “induced” must be interpreted to simply to \nmean “caused” is untenable.  To equate “induced” with “caused” would mean that any type of \nconduct by a party that caused a third party to  refrain from entering into a contract with a \nclaimant would be grounds for asserting the cl aim.  This would have broad implications for \ncontractual relations in this State as it would make every contracting party potentially liable \nfor the types of damages available for intentional torts, including compensatory and punitive \ndamages, whenever the failure to fulfill a con tract for any reason caused the other party to \nthe contract to lose a prospective business opportunity. \n29. Defendants have not alleged that Plainti ffs took any purposeful action that \nwas intended to influence Kaplan not to enter into the Joint Venture. 19  To the contrary, \nDefendants have alleged only that Plaintiffs “had knowledge of” the Joint Venture and that \nthe breach of the Development Agreement “caused the failure of the Joint Venture.”  \nDefendants have made no allegations of purpos eful conduct by Plaint iffs directed towards \nKaplan, let alone allegations that such conduc t influenced Kaplan.  In addition, Defendants \nallege the breach of the Development Agreement occurred on December 31, 2010, almost two \nyears before Defendants began negotiations with Kaplan for the Joint Venture.  Defendants \ndo not allege that Plaintiffs knew of the Jo int Venture before October 2012.  The Plaintiffs \n                                                 \ncan be no actionable ‘malicious and wanton interference’ without this allegation.”  2012 N.C. App. \nLEXIS at *21-22. \n19 Although Defendants use the word “induced” in their counterclaim, the surrounding factual \nallegations do not support that Plaintiffs induced Kaplan, and this Court is not bound by Plaintiff’s \nconclusory allegation.  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, 577 (2009) (The Court is “not \nrequired . . . to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, \nor unreasonable inferences.”). \n \n \ncould not have intended for their alleged breach of the Development Agreement on December \n31, 2010, to influence Kaplan not to proceed with the Joint Venture when that breach \noccurred before negotiatio ns with Kaplan even started.  A ccordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion to \nDismiss should be GRANTED.   \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Claim for Fraudulent Transfer \n30. Defendants have moved pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Claim \nfor violation of the North Carolina Fraudulent Transfers Act, G.S. § 39-23.1 et seq. (“UFTA”).  \nPlaintiffs allege that Springs Investors fraudulently transferred the Springs Property to the \nIndividual Defendants shortly after Plaintiffs  notified Defendants that Springs Investors \nwould be required to contribute additional  funds under the Development Agreement.\n20  \nPlaintiffs alleged that Springs Investors transferred the property without receiving \nequivalent value in return “with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors of Springs \nInvestors.”21  Defendants contend that the UFTA cl aim is now moot, and the Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction, because the Individual Defendants have transferred the Springs \nProperty back to Springs Investors.  Defendants  argue that this leaves Plaintiffs without a \nremedy under the UFTA.  Defendants acknowledg e that the Court’s decision on Plaintiffs’ \nMotion to Amend could impact their mootness ar gument, but rely upon their opposition to \nthat Motion.22 \n31. The Court has granted Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend regarding the allegations \nthat Springs Investors fraudulently transferred other assets in addition to the Springs \nProperty.  The amendment to the Complaint moots Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nClaim under the UFTA.  \nHouston v. Tillman , __ N.C. App. __, __, 760 S.E.2d 18, 20 (2014) \n                                                 \n20 Proposed Am. Compl. ¶¶ 102-03. \n21 Id. ¶¶ 103-04. \n22 Defs.’ Mem. Supp. Mot.

Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss should be DENIED. \n32. To the extent that Defendants’ Motion  to Dismiss could still be viewed as a \nrequest to dismiss Plaintiffs’ allegation that Springs Investors fraudulently transferred the \nSprings Property separate and apart from any other assets, the Motion also should be denied.  \nThe transfer of the Springs Property from the Individual Defendants back to Springs \nInvestors did not leave Plaintiffs without a potential remedy under the UFTA.  Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiff’s claim is moot becaus e the primary relief Plaintiffs sought was the \nvoiding of the original transfer of the Springs Property.  Plaintiffs, however, broadly allege \nthat they are “entitled to . . . remedies under [G.S.] § 39-23.7” of the UFTA, including, but \nnot limited to, “relief in the form of an injuncti on or receivership to protect the [Springs] \nProperty from further disposition” by Defendants.  23   In addition, section 39-23.7 provides \nthe Court authority to grant “[a]ny other relief the circumstances may require.”  Accordingly, \nthere are still remedies available to Plaintiffs regarding the transfer of the Springs Property, \nand its transfer back to Springs Investors did not moot Plaintiffs’ fraudulent transfer claim.  \nRoberts v.
