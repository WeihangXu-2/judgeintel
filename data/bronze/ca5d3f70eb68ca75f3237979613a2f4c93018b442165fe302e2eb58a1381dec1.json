JACK \nHENDERSON III, and MARLENE \nHENDERSON, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER APPROVING DISMISSAL \n \n \n{1} THIS MATTER is before the Court sua sponte  to review a settlement \nagreement and determine whether the parties are entitled to the dismissal \nstipulated to by all parties in the March 3, 2016 Stipulation for Order of Dismissal.   \n{2} Plaintiffs Amanda Bennett and Ernest  Brooks (collectively, the “Named \nPlaintiffs”) asserted class action claims  against Defendants Commercial College of \nAsheboro, Inc. d/b/a Brookstone College of  Business, F. Jack Henderson, III, and \nMarlene Henderson (collectively, “Defendants”) in their Amended Complaint arising \nout of the closing of Brookstone College of Business.  Defendants sought dismissal of \nsome of the claims, and the Court held a hearing on the Partial Motion to Dismiss \non December 11, 2015.  The parties engaged in a mediated settlement conference on \nJanuary 28, 2016, reached a settlement on all issues, and filed the Stipulated \nDismissal seeking dismissal of all claims with prejudice.\n1   \n{3} For reasons explained below, the Court ordered Plaintiffs to submit certain \ninformation regarding the terms of the settlement before giving effect to the \nstipulated dismissal.  With the Court’s leave, Plaintiffs submitted the requested \n                                                 \n1 The Court does not view as suspect that the parties reached a settlement while the Court’s decision \non a motion to dismiss was pending.  The Partia l Motion to Dismiss soug ht dismissal only of \nPlaintiffs’ tort claims; the case would have moved forward on Plaintiffs’ contract claims regardless of \nthe Court’s decision. \n \n \nmaterials for the Court’s review in camera .  Having reviewed the requested \nmaterials, the Court CONCLUDES that the voluntary dismis sal of this action with \nprejudice is proper. \nThe Googasian Firm, P.C., by Dean Googasian and Thomas Howlett, \nand Mike Lewis Attorneys, by Michael J.

Jack Henderson III, and \nMarlene Henderson. \nBledsoe, Judge. \n{4} With a decision on Defendants’ Part ial Motion to Dismiss pending, the \nparties engaged in a mediated settlement conference, reached a settlement on all \nissues, and filed the Stipulated Dismissal, purporting to dismiss all claims with \nprejudice.  This arrangement is different from most pre-certification settlements of \nclass actions in the Business Court; often,  the Court certifies a class for settlement \npurposes and contemporaneously approves  the terms of the settlement under the \nguidance of N.C. R. Civ. P. 23.  \nSee, e.g., In re PokerTek Merger Litig. , 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 22, 2015); In re Harris Teeter Merger Litig. , 2014 \nNCBC LEXIS 47 (N.C. Super Ct. Sep. 24, 2014).  See also Ehrenhaus v. Baker, 216 \nN.C. App. 59, 717 S.E.2d 9 ( 2011) (affirming in part and reversing in part Business \nCourt’s class certification and settlement approval order, reversing only for further \nfactual findings as to attorney’s fees).   \n{5} Although this matter never reached the class certification stage, at which \npoint Rule 23(c) operates to give notice, and ensure the fairness, of any settlement \nto all class members, our appellate case law nevertheless places certain limits on \nvoluntary dismissals of purported class action complaints.  Because a plaintiff filing \na class action demonstrates a willingness to take on the responsibilities of a class \nrepresentative, “putative class members ma y rely on the named plaintiff’s stated \nintentions to represent the class.  Unde r such circumstances, trial courts have a \nduty to assure that putative class member s will not be prejudiced, procedurally or \n \n \notherwise, by voluntary dismissal of the class-action complaint.”  Moody v. Sears, \nRoebuck & Co. , 191 N.C. App. 256, 269–70, 664 S.E2d 569, 578–79 (2008) (“ Moody \nI”).2  The Court therefore must make a limited inquiry to determine “(a) whether \nthe parties have abused the class-action  mechanism for personal gain, and (b) \nwhether dismissal will prejudice absent putative class members.”  Id.  Plaintiffs will \nbe entitled to a voluntary dismissal if neither of these concerns is present.  Id.  \n{6} In implementing this mandate, this Court (Tennille, J.) has previously set \nforth the “procedures that counsel must follow in pre-certification class actions \nassigned to Special Superior Court Judges for Complex Business Cases when a \nplaintiff who has assumed a fiduciary duty by filing a class action subsequently files \na voluntary dismissal.”  Moody v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. , 2008 NCBC LEXIS 14, at \n*3 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 6, 2008) (“ Moody II”).  See also Thomas Cook Printing Co. \nv. Subtle Impressions, Inc. , 2008 NCBC LEXIS 18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 24, 2008) \n(applying Moody II to a pre-certification voluntary dismissal); Order on Joint \nMotion for Approval of Pre-Certification Voluntary Dismissal, Keister v. Nat’l \nCouncil of the YMCA of the U.S., No. 12 CVS 1137 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 12, 2013).   \n{7} Here, the Court required counsel to submit: \n[A] statement of (1) the reason for dismissal, (2) the personal gain \nreceived by Plaintiffs in any settlement, (3) a statement of any other \nmaterial terms of the settlement, specifically including any terms \nwhich have the potential to impact class members, (4) a statement of \nany counsel fees paid to Plaintiffs’ counsel by Defendants, and (5) a \nstatement of any agreement by Plaintiffs restricting their ability to file \nother litigation against any Defendant.  Plaintiffs’ counsel shall also \nfile a statement either detailing any potential prejudice to putative \nclass members or representing to the Court that no prejudice exists. \n(Order ¶ 5, Mar. 7, 2016) (citing \nMoody II at *4).  In this case, where the factual \nrecord has not been developed beyond the Amended Complaint’s allegations that \nthe class comprised “hundreds of adults” who paid Defendants “millions of dollars,” \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 22, 51), these procedures ar e necessary to “provide the supervision \n                                                 \n2 This duty arises not from N.C. R. Civ. P. 23(c), but from the broad discretion afforded to trial courts \nin matters pertaining to class action lawsuits.  Moody I at 578, 191 N.C. App. at 268.  \n \n \nand transparency encouraged by the Court of Appeals with respect to class action \nlitigation.”  Moody II at *10–11. \n{8} Having reviewed the requested statement and a copy of the settlement \nagreement submitted by Plaintiffs’ counsel, the Court concludes that the parties \nhave not abused the class action process for personal gain and that dismissal will \nnot prejudice putative class members.   \n{9} Abusive practices in class action litigation include defendants avoiding \nclass action certification by buying off named plaintiffs or plaintiffs coercing \nunusually generous individual settlements from defendants.  \nMoody I at 269, 664 \nS.E.2d at 578 (citing 5 Moore’s Federal Practice § 23.64[2 ][a] (3d ed. 2008)).  Those \nscenarios are not present here.  The decisi on to settle was motivated by a lack of \nassets sufficient to create a common fund for a class action.  The terms of the \nsettlement agreement reflect this; Plaintiffs ’ counsel did not receive attorney’s fees \nand the Named Plaintiffs received modest consideration totaling less than $10,000. \n{10} As for the potential impact of the se ttlement agreement on putative class \nmembers, the settlement agreement provid es that the release and the dismissal \nwith prejudice apply only to the Named Plaintiffs.  The claims of other putative \nclass members are neither released nor dismissed.   \n{11} The Court therefore concludes that the parties are entitled to a dismissal. \nNOW THEREFORE, IT IS HERE BY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND \nDECREED THAT: \n{12} The settlement agreement is appropriate and not prejudicial to absent \nputative class members; and \n{13} The Named Plaintiffs’ claims are hereby DISMISSED with prejudice as to \nDefendants, each party to bear their own costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees. \nSO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of March, 2016. \n \n      / s /  L o u i s  A .
