INTRODUCTION \n{2} Plaintiff seeks injunctive and monetary relief against Defendants Thomas \nGallo (“Defendant Gallo”) and I-Minerals USA, Incorporated (“Defendant I-\nMinerals”) (collectively, “Defendants”). \n{3} Plaintiff and Defendant I-Minerals are in the business of mining and \nprocessing quartz and other minerals.2  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant I-Minerals \nhired Defendant Gallo, Plaintiff’s former General Manager, Research and \nDevelopment, in June 2014 with the intent to misappropriate Plaintiff’s trade \nsecrets and thereby compete with Plaintiff in the high purity quartz (“HPQ”) \nmarket.  Plaintiff asserts causes of action against one or both Defendants in its \nVerified Complaint for violation of the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act \n(“NCTSPA”), violation of the North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \nAct (“UDTPA”), breach of contract, conversion, unjust enrichment, breach of implied \nduties of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference with contract. \n{4} The question before the Court is whether Plaintiff has adequately \ndemonstrated both a likelihood of success on its claims and irreparable harm \nsufficient to entitle it to a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from \ndisclosing and using Plaintiff’s confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret \ninformation and Defendant Gallo from working for Defendant I-Minerals in HPQ \ndevelopment. \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{5} Plaintiff filed its Verified Complaint in Mitchell County on July 28, 2014, \naccompanied by a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary \nInjunction (“Motion for TRO”) and a Motion for Leave to Conduct Expedited \nDiscovery (“Motion for Expedited Discovery”).  The case was designated a \nmandatory complex business case on July 29, 2014, and assigned to the \nundersigned on July 31, 2014. \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff competes on a worldwide basis and is a leading company in the mining, processing and \nsale of high purity quartz.  (Compl. ¶ 14.) Defendant I-Minerals is an early-stage company and \ncurrently has five employees. (Def. I-Minerals’ Resp. to P.I. Motion, p. 3.) \n \n \n \n{6} All parties appeared before this Court on August 12, 2014 for a hearing on \nPlaintiff’s Motion for TRO3 and Motion for Expedited Discovery.  On August 13, \n2014, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”), restraining and \nenjoining Defendant Gallo from disclosing certain information regarding Plaintiff’s \nprocesses employed in producing HPQ and ordering Defendant Gallo to return all \nPlaintiff’s documents and files containing such information to the extent such \ninformation remained in his possession or under his control.  Unimin Corp. v. Gallo, \nNo. 14 CVS 141 ¶ 2 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 13, 2014) (“TRO and Expedited Discovery \nOrder”).  The Court also set a schedule for expedited discovery and briefing in \nconnection with Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion.  Id. at ¶ 9. \n{7} The TRO and Expedited Discovery Order permitted the parties to serve \nupon one another written discovery requests and take the deposition of each party \non an expedited basis.  The Order directed that all discovery be narrowly focused on \nthe issues relevant to Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion. \n{8} On August 19, 2014, the parties appeared before the Court for a hearing on \nthe parties’ objections to written discovery served pursuant to the TRO and \nExpedited Discovery Order.  At the hearing, each Defendant contended that \nPlaintiff had not properly answered that Defendant’s interrogatories and had not \nmade a full and complete production of documents in response to that Defendant’s \nrequest for production of documents. \n{9} After considering the written discovery requests and responses of each \nparty and the arguments of counsel at the hearing, the Court ordered Plaintiff to \n“identify with greater specificity the information Plaintiff contends constitutes \nconfidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information as alleged in paragraph 40 \nof Plaintiff’s Verified Complaint” and ordered that the identification be “sufficiently \nparticular so that Defendants will be able to determine the information they are \naccused of misappropriating and the  Court will be able to determine whether \n                                                 \n3 Although Plaintiff filed its P.I. Motion and Motion for TRO in a single document, the Court did not \nconsider Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion at the August 12, 2014 hearing on Plaintiff’s Motions for TRO and for \nExpedited Discovery. \n \n \nmisappropriation has occurred or is threatened to occur.”  The Court ordered \nPlaintiff to supplement this information on or before 5:00 P.M. on August 20, 2014. \nUnimin Corp. v. Gallo, No. 14 CVS 141 ¶ 1 (N.C. Super. Ct. August 20, 2014) (the \n“Order on Written Discovery Objections”).  The Court also ordered Plaintiff to \nproduce at the same time representative documents for each category of information \nPlaintiff claimed constituted its protectable confidential, proprietary and/or trade \nsecret information.  The Court specifically ordered that all such information and \ndocuments be produced as “Attorney’s Eyes Only” information under the parties’ \nconsent protective order and thus not made available to any of the parties, but only \nto their counsel.  In addition, the Court extended the TRO until September 4, 2014.  \nId.   \n{10} On August 22, 2014, Plaintiff emailed to each Defendant nineteen (19) \npages of heavily redacted documents as well as supplemental interrogatory \nresponses purporting to provide greater specificity of its confidential, proprietary \nand/or trade secret information consistent with the Court’s Order.4   \n{11} All parties appeared before this Court on August 26, 2014 for a hearing on \nPlaintiff’s P.I. Motion.5 \n \n \n                                                 \n4 On August 21, Plaintiff reported to the Court that Plaintiff was not able to comply with the August \n20 deadline in the Court’s Order, citing the unavailability of Plaintiff’s chief technical witness, who \nalso served as Plaintiff’s 30(b)(6) designee.  Plaintiff made its required supplementation and \nproduction during the Plaintiff’s 30(b)(6) deposition on August 22, and Defendants were thereafter \nable to examine Plaintiff’s corporate designee concerning Plaintiff’s supplemental discovery \nresponses and production.  Although the Court does not condone Plaintiff’s failure to adhere to the \nCourt’s deadline, the Court recognizes that the expedited discovery schedule created difficult \nscheduling issues for all parties. Given that it does not appear that Defendants were unduly \nprejudiced by Plaintiff’s delay, Defendants have not sought or advised that they intend to seek \nsanctions, and the Court’s resolution of Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion, the Court declines to sanction Plaintiff \nfor its failure to make timely supplementation in this instance. \n \n5 In Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion, brief in support of the P.I. Motion, Supplemental Brief in Support of the \nP.I. Motion, and at all times prior to the August 26, 2014 hearing, Plaintiff sought to enjoin \nDefendant Gallo from working in any capacity for Defendant I-Minerals in addition to enjoining \nDefendant Gallo’s disclosure and use of Plaintiff’s proprietary, confidential and/or trade secret \ninformation.  At the hearing, however, Plaintiff retreated from this position and stated that in \naddition to a non-disclosure and non-use injunction, Plaintiff now seeks to enjoin Defendant Gallo \nfrom working for Defendant I-Minerals only in the HPQ area of its business. \n \n \nIII.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n{12} For purposes of the P.I. Motion, the Court “examines both the pleadings \nand additional evidence submitted to determine whether Plaintiff [has] satisfied its \nburden of securing preliminary injunctive relief.”  Allegis Grp., Inc. v. Zachary Piper \nLLC, 2013 NCBC 13 ¶ 8 (N.C. Super Ct. Feb. 25, 2013), www.ncbusinesscourt.net/ \nopinions/2013_NCBC_13.pdf (denying the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction).  All findings of fact and conclusions of law are solely for purposes of \ndetermining Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion and do not become the law of the case.  Id.; see, \ne.g., Schloss v. Jamison, 258 N.C. 271, 276, 128 S.E.2d 590, 594 (1962) (“The \nfindings of fact and other proceedings of the judge who hears the application for an \ninterlocutory injunction are not binding on the parties at the trial on the merits.”); \nChildress v. Yadkin County, 186 N.C. App. 30, 43, 650 S.E.2d 55, 64–65 (2007) \n(“[F]indings and conclusions made in the grant of an injunction are not \nauthoritative as ‘the law of the case’  for any other purpose, and the judgment or \norder [is] not res adjudicata on final hearings.”) (citations and quotation omitted).  \nA.  The Parties \n{13} Plaintiff is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in \nConnecticut.  Plaintiff mines and processes various minerals, including HPQ, glass \ngrade feldspar, ceramic grade feldspar, filler grade feldspar and melting quartz in \nmultiple locations, including four locations in Mitchell and Avery Counties in the \nNorth Carolina mountains.  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 3.)  Plaintiff mines \nand processes HPQ under the trade names Quartzil, Quintus, and Iota and sells its \nHPQ worldwide for use in a variety of industries, including the semiconductor \nmanufacturing, quartz lighting, and fiber optic cable industries.  Plaintiff alleges \nthat it is the global leader in HPQ and that its processes for creating Quintus and \nIota quartz are confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret.  (Id., at p. 4.)  At the \npresent time, the parties acknowledge that Iota-grade quartz is the highest purity \nquartz yet achieved (i.e., “ultra-high purity” quartz) and is the industry standard.6 \n                                                 \n6 Plaintiff does not consider Quintus to be high purity quartz. (Unimin Dep. 94:1-7, Aug. 22, 2014.) \n \n \n{14} Defendant Gallo was employed by Plaintiff from 1997 until February 2009, \nstarting as Plaintiff’s Senior Research Engineer and retiring as Plaintiff’s General \nManager, Research and Development.  (Id., at p. 3.)  Plaintiff contends that \nDefendant Gallo was the “inventor or key player in the development of each step” of \nthe trade secrets Plaintiff claims have been or are threatened to be \nmisappropriated.  (Pl.’s Reply Mem., p. 6.) \n{15} During his time as Plaintiff’s employee, Defendant Gallo executed three \nagreements: (1) a Confidentiality and Employment-at-Will Agreement on December \n4, 1996 (the “1996 Agreement”); a Confidentiality Agreement on January 2, 1997 \n(the “1997 Agreement”); and a Settlement, Confidentiality, and Non-Compete \nAgreement on March 5, 2009 (the “2009 Agreement”) (collectively, the \n“Agreements”).   \nB.  The Agreements \n{16} The 1996 and 1997 Agreements were executed at the commencement of \nDefendant Gallo’s employment.  The 2009 Agreement was executed in connection \nwith Defendant Gallo’s voluntary termination from employment.  Each Agreement \ncontained non-disclosure provisions prohibiting Defendant Gallo from disclosing \nPlaintiff’s confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information and materials.  \nThe 1996 Agreement contained a five-year, post-employment limitation on \nDefendant Gallo’s non-disclosure obligations.  Neither the 1997 nor 2009 Agreement \ncontained a time limitation on Defendant Gallo’s non-disclosure agreement.  \n(Compl., Exs. 1–3.) \n{17} The 2009 Agreement reaffirmed the 1996 and 1997 Agreements and \nprovided that Defendant Gallo “fully and freely acknowledge[d] and agree[d] that \n[for purposes of his non-disclosure obligations], all of the specialized knowledge and \ninformation relating to High Purity Quartz in [his] possession and/or within his \nknowledge is confidential information belonging to [Plaintiff].”  (Id., Ex. 3.)  The \n2009 Agreement also contained an expansive non-competition covenant that \nprecluded Defendant Gallo from working with any enterprise involved in the HPQ \n \n \nbusiness anywhere in the world for a period of five years.7  All parties agree that the \nnon-competition covenant in the 2009 Agreement expired on February 9, 2014 \nwithout a breach at any time by Defendant Gallo. \n{18} The 1997 and 2009 Agreements each provide that the Agreement “shall be \nconstrued, governed by and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of \nConnecticut.” (Id., Exs. 2–3.)  The 1996 Agreement does not contain a choice of law \nprovision.  (Id., Ex. 1.) \nC.  Defendant I-Minerals’ Employment of Defendant Gallo \n{19} Following the expiration of Defendant Gallo’s non-compete period on \nFebruary 9, 2014, Defendant Gallo began soliciting employment from various \ncompanies in the HPQ industry.  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 6.)  In that \neffort, Defendant Gallo contacted Quartz Corp., one of Plaintiff’s competitors, and \nadvised that he was “a ceramic engineer with a broad background including high \npurity quartz.”  (Gallo Dep., Aug. 21, 2014, Ex. 15.)  In his communications with \nQuartz Corp. about potential employment, Defendant Gallo provided Quartz Corp. a \nlist he created describing different pieces of Plaintiff’s confidential information that \nhe understood he could not disclose. The list included the following statements: \nUnimin has specific technology related to removing [REDACTED] from \nQuartz which is Unimin proprietary information.  It is not believed \nthis process was ever patented. \nUnimin has specific technology related to removing [REDACTED] from \nQuartz, aka Iota processing, which is Unimin proprietary information \n[sic] It is not believed this process was ever patented  \nUnimin has specific technology related reactor designs, “Continuous \nReactor System for Anoxic Purification.”  USP 7 837 955 Nov 23 2010 \nFirst Page Attached \n                                                 \n7 The non-competition provision specifically provided that for a period of five years after the \ntermination of Defendant Gallo’s employment, Defendant Gallo “will not directly or indirectly, \nmanage, operate, control, participate in, accept employment or a consulting position with, or \notherwise advise or assist or be connected with or directly or indirectly own or have any interest \n(except ownership of a less than one-half (1/2) of one percent (1%) of the outstanding shares of a \npublicly traded company) or right with respect to any enterprise which engages in the business of \nmining, producing, processing, testing and/or selling High Purity Quartz anywhere in the world.” \n \n(Compl., Ex. 3 ¶ 9.) \n \n \nUnimin has confidential floatation technology belonging to \n[REDACTED], which Unimin is no longer entitled to use \nUnimin has an extensive database on Quartz deposits and Quartz \nproducts from around the world \n(Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 7.)   Quartz Corp. reviewed the 2009 Agreement \nand determined that it could not “overcome the ‘potential confidential info[rmation]’ \nlimitations that exist.”  (Gallo Dep., Ex. 15.) \n{20} After Quartz Corp. declined to hire him, Defendant Gallo sent inquiries to \nother potential employers in which he highlighted his experience in HPQ.    (Gallo \nDep., Exs. 6, 11.)  On May 2, 2014, Defendant Gallo contacted Defendant I-Minerals \nfor possible employment and referenced his invention of and prior experience with \nPlaintiff’s Iota-8 HPQ product.  (I-Minerals Dep. 112–15, Aug. 20, 2014.)  Soon \nthereafter, Defendant I-Minerals hired Defendant Gallo as a consultant.  (Pl.’s \nSuppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 10; Compl., Ex. 4.) \n{21} Defendant I-Minerals is one of Plaintiff’s competitors in the HPQ markets.  \nOn July 10, 2014, Defendant I-Minerals published a news release that stated it was \n“closer to developing high purity quartz” and announced that Defendant I-Minerals \nhad hired Defendant Gallo as a consultant “to oversee ceramic test work and \nmarket development.”  (Compl., Ex. 4.)  The press release further proclaimed that \n“[w]ith the addition of Thomas Gallo to our team [Defendant I-Minerals is] better \npositioned to compete in the highly competitive quartz markets.”  (Id.) \n{22} Plaintiff alleges that Defendant I-Minerals’ sole purpose in hiring \nDefendant Gallo was to gain knowledge of Plaintiff’s confidential, proprietary, \nand/or trade secret information so that it can produce quartz at Plaintiff’s Iota-\ngrade.  Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant Gallo has and/or threatens to \ndisclose this information to Defendant I-Minerals and points to Defendant I-\nMinerals’ press release statements and recent production of Quintus-grade quartz, \nas well as Defendant Gallo’s disclosures to Quartz Corp. and his repeated reference \nto his work with high purity quartz in seeking employment as evidence of this \nalleged actual and/or threatened misappropriation.   \n \n \n \nD.  Plaintiff’s Description of its Trade Secret Information and Materials \n{23} All parties to this action are subject to a Consent Protective Order, \nwhereby all documents filed in relation to Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion were designated \n“Attorney’s Eyes Only” and filed under seal.  Furthermore, upon request of the \nparties, the Court closed the courtroom pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 66-156 before \ncommencing the hearing on Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion to protect disclosure of any trade \nsecret information of the parties. \n{24} In its Verified Complaint, Plaintiff claims trade secret protection is \nspecifically warranted for the various processes Plaintiff utilizes in mining and \nproducing HPQ, including:  \ntypes of processes used, the se quence of the processes, the \ntemperatures applied in certain processes, the composition and \nquantities of chemical agents applied in certain processes, the \nspecialized materials used in cert ain processes, the design of the \nequipment used during certain processes, the duration of various \nprocesses, the speed of various proce sses, and the feed rate of various \nprocesses. \n(Compl. ¶ 40.) \n{25} In its Supplemental Brief in Support of Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion, Plaintiff \nlists its confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information as including the \nfollowing: \nUnimin’s “mining process control plan.”  The “mining process control \nplan” uses [REDACTED]. \nUnimin’s mining techniques.  This includes the use of Unimin-\ndesigned [REDACTED]. \nThe specifications of Unimin’s first stage processing.  This includes the \nspecifications Unimin developed that are involved in [REDACTED]. \nThe specifications of Unimin’s second-stage processing.  This includes \nthe specifications Unimin developed for [REDACTED].   \n(Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 5.) \n{26} In response to the Court’s Order on Written Discovery Objections, Plaintiff \nproduced 19 pages of heavily redacted documents related to Plaintiff’s processes in \n \n \ndeveloping HPQ.  Plaintiff removed any word, phrase, or reference to any word or \nphrase from those documents that, in its 30(b)(6) designee’s belief, constituted \nconfidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information.  (See Def. Gallo’s Resp. \nP.I. Mot., Ex. 5; Unimin Dep. 186:3–10.) \nIV.  LEGAL STANDARD \n{27} “A preliminary injunction . . . is an extraordinary measure taken by a court \nto preserve the status quo of the parties during litigation.”  Triangle Leasing Co. v. \nMcMahon, 327 N.C. 224, 227, 393 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1990) (quoting Investors, Inc. v. \nBerry, 293 N.C. 688, 701, 239 S.E.2d 566, 574 (1977)).  \n{28} A preliminary injunction should only be issued \n(1) if [Plaintiff] is able to show likelihood of success on the merits of \n[its] case and (2) [Plaintiff] is like ly to sustain irreparable loss unless \nthe injunction is issued, or if, in the opinion of the Court, issuance is \nnecessary for the protection of [Plain tiff’s] rights during the course of \nlitigation. \nA.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. McClure, 308 N.C. 393, 401, 302 S.E.2d 754, 759–60 (1983) \n(citations omitted) (emphasis in original). \n{29} Our Supreme Court has further defined \"irreparable injury\" as not \nnecessarily \"beyond the possibility of repair or possible compensation in damages, \nbut that the injury is one to which the complainant should not be required to submit \nor the other party permitted to inflict, and is of such continuous and frequent \nrecurrence that no reasonable redress can be had in a court of law.\" Barrier v. \nTroutman, 231 N.C. 47, 50, 55 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1949) (citations omitted).  If \nirreparable injury is not shown, the preliminary injunction will be \ndenied. Telephone Co. v. Plastics, Inc., 287 N.C. 232, 236, 214 S.E.2d 49, 52 \n(1975); see Coble Dairy v. State ex rel. Milk Comm'n, 58 N.C. App. 213, 214, 292 \nS.E.2d 750, 751 (1982).  \n{30} Moreover, “[a] court of equity must weigh all relevant facts before resorting \nto the extraordinary remedy of an injunction.” Travenol Laboratories, Inc. v. \nTurner, 30 N.C. App. 686, 694, 228 S.E.2d 478, 484 (1976).  The burden is on the \nmoving party to establish its right to a preliminary injunction, but the remedy \n \n \n\"should not be lightly granted.\" GoRhinoGo, LLC v. Lewis, 2011 NCBC 38 ¶ 29 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 29, 2011), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/ \n2011_NCBC_38%20.pdf (citations omitted); Travenol Labs., 30 N.C. App. at 692, \n228 S.E.2d at 483.  A trial court generally \"should engage in a balancing process, \nweighing potential harm to the plaintiff if the injunction is not issued against the \npotential harm to the defendant if injunctive relief is granted . . . .\" Kaplan v. Prolife \nAction League of Greensboro, 111 N.C. App. 1, 16, 431 S.E.2d 828, 835 (1993) \n(citation and quotation omitted), overruled on other grounds by Sharpe v. Worland, \n351 N.C. 159, 522 S.E.2d 577 (1999). \nV.  ANALYSIS \n1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits8 \nA.  Violation of NCTSPA  \n{31} Under the NCTSPA, “actual or threatened misappropriation of a trade \nsecret may be preliminarily enjoined during the pendency of the action and shall be \npermanently enjoined upon judgment finding misappropriation . . . .”  N.C.G.S. § 66-\n154(a) (2014).  Actual or threatened misappropriation may be established by the \nintroduction of “substantial evidence” that a person against whom relief is sought \n“[k]nows or should have known of the trade secret; and [h]as had a specific \nopportunity to acquire it for disclosure or use or has acquired, disclosed, or used it \nwithout the express or implied consent of the owner [of the trade secret].”  N.C.G.S. \n§ 66-155 (2014).  A defendant may rebut an owner’s claim of misappropriation by \nproving that the defendant acquired the owner’s trade secret information through \nindependent development or reverse engineering, or by proving that the owner’s \n“trade secret” information was received from another person with a right to disclose \nthe information or is generally known in the industry.  N.C.G.S. §§ 66-155, 66-152 \n(2014). \n{32} A trade secret is defined under the NCTSPA as: \n                                                 \n8 Although Plaintiff has alleged eight claims in its Verified Complaint, Plaintiff only argues a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of four claims:  (1) violation of NCTSPA, (2) violation of UDTPA, \n(3) breach of 1997 Agreement, and (4) breach of implied duties of good faith and fair dealing in the \n1997 Agreement.  The Court determines Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion accordingly. \n \n \nbusiness or technical information,  including but not limited to a \nformula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method \ntechnique, or process that \na. [d]erives independent actual or potential commercial \nvalue from not being generally known or readily \nascertainable through independent development or \nreverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic \nvalue from its disclosure or use; and \nb. [i]s the subject of effort s that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy. \nN.C.G.S. § 66-152(3). \n{33} In determining whether processes or information are trade secrets, the \nNorth Carolina courts generally consider six factors: \n(1) the extent to which information is known outside the business; (2) \nthe extent to which it is known to employees and others involved in the \nbusiness; (3) the extent of measures taken to guard secrecy of the \ninformation; (4) the value of information to the business and its \ncompetitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended in developing \nthe information; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the \ninformation could properly be acquired or duplicated by others. \nWilmington Star-News, Inc. v. New Hanover Reg’l Med. Ctr., 125 N.C. App. 174, \n180–81, 480 S.E.2d 53, 56 (1997) (citations omitted).  The factors overlap, and \ncourts considering these factors do not always examine them separately and \nindividually.  SCR-Tech LLC v. Evonik Energy Servs. LLC, 2011 NCBC 26 ¶41 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jul. 22, 2011), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/ \n2011_NCBC_26.pdf. \n{34} Furthermore, in a trade secret misappropriation case, “an applicant for a \npreliminary injunction must do more than merely allege that irreparable injury will \noccur. The applicant is required to set out with particularity facts supporting such \nstatements so the court can decide for itself if irreparable injury will occur.”  North \nCarolina Farm Partnership v. NCF Investments, LLC, 163 N.C. App. 318, 323, 593 \nS.E.2d 126, 130 (2004) (citations and quotations omitted). \n \n \n \n \ni. Whether Defendants Know or Should Know of Plaintiff’s Alleged Trade Secrets \n{35} North Carolina law is clear that “a plaintiff must identify a trade secret \nwith sufficient particularity so as to enable a defendant to delineate that which he \nis accused of misappropriating and a court to determine whether misappropriation \nhas or is threatened to occur.”  Analog Devices, Inc. v. Michalski, 157 N.C. App. 462, \n468, 579 S.E.2d 449, 453 (2003) (citations omitted).  A preliminary injunction is \nappropriately denied when a plaintiff “fail[s] to ‘present evidence of specific trade \nsecrets and processes.’”  Id. (quoting FMC Corp. v. Cyprus Foote Mineral Co., 899 F. \nSupp. 1477, 1484 (W.D.N.C. 1995)). \n{36} Plaintiff contends that Plaintiff “uses trade secrets and confidential and \nproprietary information to produce high purity quartz from mine to finished \nproduct.”  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 4).  Plaintiff further asserts that \nPlaintiff’s “confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information is used at every \nstep from planning the mining, mining the ore, separating the quartz from the \nfeldspar and mica, processing the quartz to Quintus quartz, and further processing \nQuintus quartz to Iota.” (Id.)  Plaintiff has alleged its trade secrets more specifically \nin its Complaint (¶ 40), in its supplemental brief to this motion (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. \nSupp. P.I. Mot., p. 5), and in its written discovery responses (see ¶ 42 infra). \n{37} Defendants argue that Plaintiff has failed to describe its trade secrets with \nthe level of particularity required under North Carolina law.  Defendants contend, \nin particular, that each process Plaintiff identifies as a trade secret is a “standard \nelement of the mining process utilized widely throughout the mining industry” and \nthat Plaintiff has failed to identify with particularity any processes or variations to \nthese processes that are unique to Plaintiff.  (Def. I-Minerals’ Resp. P.I. Mot., p. 7.)  \nFor their support, Defendants principally rely on the North Carolina Court of \nAppeals’ decision in Analog Devices, supra, and an opinion from the United States \nDistrict Court for the Western District of North Carolina, FMC Corp., supra. \n{38} Plaintiff contends in response that it has sufficiently identified its alleged \ntrade secrets under applicable law and points to a recent decision from the North \nCarolina Court of Appeals, \nHorner Int’l. Co. v. McKoy, 754 S.E.2d 852 (N.C. Ct. \n \n \nApp. 2014), as well as the Court of Appeals’ earlier decision in Barr-Mullin, Inc. v. \nBrowning, 108 N.C. App. 590, 424 S.E.2d 226 (1993), as its primary support. \n{39}  The Court has carefully reviewed Analog, FMC Corp., Horner, Barr-\nMullin and other relevant case law and concludes that at this stage of the \nproceedings Plaintiff has not identified its alleged trade secrets with sufficient \nparticularity under North Carolina law to enable Defendants to delineate that \nwhich they are accused of misappropriating and this Court to determine whether \nmisappropriation has or is threatened to occur for purposes of issuing injunctive \nrelief.  See generally Analog, 157 N.C. App. at 468, 579 S.E.2d at 453.   \n{40} In particular, like the plaintiff in Analog, Plaintiff has “asserted trade \nsecrets at almost every stage in the production of [its] products but only offered \ngeneral evidence in support of those assertions.”  Id.  For example, the plaintiff in \nAnalog defined its alleged trade secrets as follows: \nThe circuit designs and solutions developed by Analog Devices . . .  \nWhile each of Analog’s designs and solutions, along with their specific \nimplementations . . .  may contain individual trade secrets, “it’s a \ncombination of all of the aspects which constitute trade secrets that \nmake the device itself a trade secret.” \n. . .  \n“The techniques and the variations and the adjustments that are \nrequired to make . . . successful components . . . .” \n. . . \nTrade secrets can be found in the overall design and implementation \nof Analog’s 94 xx products, even if all the constituent parts of that \ndesign were publicly known. \nAnalog, 157 N.C. App. at 469, 579 S.E.2d at 454. \n{41} In like fashion here, Plaintiff broadly identifies various processes as its \nalleged trade secrets without offering evidence showing that those processes are \nunique to Plaintiff or have been modified by Plaintiff in unique ways.  For example, \nPlaintiff describes its “mining process control plan” as using “[REDACTED] \nmodeling and process simulations” that develop “mineral processing strategies” but \ndoes not offer evidence explaining what those simulations and strategies are or why \n \n \nthose simulations and strategies are unique to Plaintiff.  Similarly, Plaintiff \ndescribes its “mining techniques” as using various materials, equipment and other \nitems designed or developed by Plaintiff, without offering evidence of what those \nmaterials, equipment or items are or how they are unique to Plaintiff.  The same is \ntrue of Plaintiff’s description of its first and second stage processing.  In its \ndescription of each, Plaintiff describes its alleged trade secrets as involving \nspecifications that Plaintiff developed for various processes, which again are not \nidentified or shown by proof to be unique, as well as more general descriptions – for \nexample, “further processing at [REDACTED] temperatures with [REDACTED] of \nvarious combinations and concentration” – that are not sufficiently particular to put \nDefendants on notice of what Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets are and to allow the \nCourt to determine whether misappropriation has occurred.  See, e.g., FMC, 899 F. \nSupp. at 1481 (denying preliminary injunction for violation of NCTSPA where \nplaintiff failed to “come forward with evidence establishing the precise nature of its \ntrade secrets”); Patch Rubber Co. v. Toelke, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84104, *13 \n(E.D.N.C. 2013) (denying preliminary injunction where plaintiff failed to \ndemonstrate “what, if anything, in its strategic plan, formula or customer cost \ninformation is deserving of trade secret protection”). \n{42} Although Plaintiff argues that it has “produced eight single-spaced pages \nof highly detailed identification of [Plaintiff’s] processes, and the constituent parts \nof those processes [Plaintiff] claims to be trade secrets” in its supplemental \ninterrogatory responses (Pl.’s Reply Mem., p. 6), the actual descriptions are again \nbroadly stated and lack particularity.  For example, to describe its claimed trade \nsecret in the sequence of Plaintiff’s processes, Plaintiff identifies “the following \nprocesses in various sequences,” without identifying each sequence that Plaintiff \ncontends is a trade secret or offering evidence explaining why that sequence is \nunique to Plaintiff.  Similarly, to describe its claimed trade secret in “the \ntemperature applied in these processes,” Plaintiff states that “the various \ntemperatures used at particular stages in the processes, which varies from process \nto process and depending on the high purity quartz product are the result of \n \n \n[Plaintiff’s] robust research and development program and is unique in the \nindustry” but nowhere identifies what the temperatures are that Plaintiffs claim \nare trade secrets or shows (rather than declares) that the use of these temperatures \nis unique to Plaintiff. Along these same lines, to describe its claimed trade secret in \n“the design of the equipment used in these processes,” Plaintiff states that the \ndesign of the equipment “includes equipment specifically modified by [Plaintiff] for \nparticular purposes in [Plaintiff’s] unique, proprietary process after it is delivered to \n[Plaintiff] by the manufacturer” but once again does not provide any specific detail \nconcerning Plaintiff’s alleged modifications to the equipment, the process it employs \nafter receipt from the manufacturer, or evidence showing that Plaintiff’s process is \nunique or proprietary. The rest of Plaintiff’s supplemental interrogatory responses \nare to similar effect.\n9 See, e.g., Aeroflow, Inc. v. Arias, 2011 NCBC 20 ¶¶ 43–45 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jul. 4, 2011), \nwww.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2011_NCBC_20.pdf (“[A]llegations that . . . items \nmay be found as trade secrets does not constitute adequate proof that they are, in \nfact, trade secrets.”). \n{43} Plaintiff contends that its identification of its alleged trade secrets are \nnevertheless sufficient when compared to the trade secret identifications recently \nfound sufficient in Horner.  In that case, the Court of Appeals found the trade \nsecrets described in the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the trial court’s \npreliminary injunction to be sufficiently specific under North Carolina law.  Horner, \n754 S.E.2d at 861.  The Court of Appeals asserted that “the verified amendment to \n[p]laintiff’s complaint alleges with great detail and specificity the information \n                                                 \n9 As noted previously, Plaintiff also provided nineteen pages of heavily redacted documents that it \nargues related to the categories of each trade secret it claims. Despite the “Attorney’s Eyes Only” \nrestriction on the disclosure of these documents and the fact that Plaintiff bears the burden of \ncoming forward with specific identification of information it claims is worthy of trade secret \nprotection, \nAnalog, 157 N.C. App. at 469, 579 S.E.2d at 454, Plaintiff’s 30(b)(6) designee testified \nthat he redacted the documents to remove references to Plaintiff’s trade secret information because \nhe was “concerned that they contained trade secrets that could eventually be disclosed regardless of \nwhatever criteria of confidentiality was imposed in this hearing.” (Unimin Dep. 186:3–10.) The Court \nagrees with Defendants that the redacted documents do not assist Defendants or the Court in \nascertaining a specific identification of Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets.  \n \n \n \n[d]efendant has allegedly provided to his new employer, describing, inter alia, \nvarious raw materials and raw materials treatments; extraction, filtration, \nseparation and distillation techniques; and methods for compounding of flavors, \npackaging and plant utility” and further that “these processes and methods were \nused in the production of flavor materials derived from seven specifically identified \nsubstances, such as cocoa, ginseng and chamomile.”  Id., 754 S.E.2d at 859. \n{44} This Court, however, does not find Horner controlling for the purposes of \nPlaintiff’s P.I. Motion.  The defendant in Horner was plaintiff’s former plant \nmanager, and in that role had “drafted, revised, and maintained records, including \nstandard operating procedures, which described in detail each of the steps to be \ntaken in producing the various products [of plaintiff],” all of which the trial court \nconcluded were and contained plaintiff’s trade secrets. The defendant thereafter \nresigned from plaintiff’s employment, immediately joined plaintiff’s competitor, and \nbegan to install, maintain and optimize the competitor’s equipment in connection \nwith the competitor’s expansion and production of new products in competition with \nplaintiff using documents he had removed from plaintiff’s offices prior to his \ndeparture.  Horner, Record on Appeal, at 93–94.10  By his own conduct, therefore, \nthe defendant provided ample evidence of his knowledge of the specific information \nthe plaintiff claimed to be a trade secret, and, in that context, the plaintiff’s specific \nidentifications enabled the defendant to “delineate that which he [was] accused of \nmisappropriating.\" Analog Devices, Inc., 157 N.C. App. at 468, 579 S.E.2d at 453.  \n{45} In sharp contrast, the evidence of record in this case shows that Defendant \nGallo has not worked for Plaintiff, with Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets, or in the \nHPQ industry for over five years, has not taken from Plaintiff any documents or \nother materials containing Plaintiff’s alleged trade secret information, and has not \notherwise evidenced an intent to use Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets.   Based on the \nfacts and circumstances of this case, the trade secret identification offered by \n                                                 \n10 The Court of Appeals’ decision in Horner does not contain the trial court’s findings of fact and \nconclusions of law, but the record on appeal in the case may be accessed at the Court of Appeals’ \nwebsite (www.ncappellatecourts.org). \n \n \nPlaintiff at this stage is not sufficient to put Defendants on notice of the information \nthey are accused of misappropriating.  Horner, 754 S.E.2d at 860–61 (quoting \nTravenol Labs., 30 N.C. App. 694-95, 228 S.E.2d at 485) (“[T]he facts and \ncircumstances of each case dictate the propriety of injunctive relief.”).  \n{46} As a result, the Court concludes that Plaintiff here, like the plaintiff in \nAnalog, has not provided a sufficient description of the alleged trade secrets at issue \nto provide Defendants sufficient notice of those trade secrets and instead has \n“invite[d] this Court to acknowledge the existence of trade secrets in the submitted \ninformation without bearing the burden of identifying those trade secrets.”  Analog, \n157 N.C. App. at 469, 579 S.E.2d at 454.   \n{47} Like the Court of Appeals in Analog, this Court “will not read into \n[Plaintiff’s] claims specific identification of [Plaintiff’s confidential information] \nwhen it is [Plaintiff’s] burden to come forward with evidence of [such information].”  \nId.; see, e.g., Washburn v. Yadkin Valley Bank and Trust Company, 190 N.C. App. \n315, 327. 660 S.E.2d 577, 586 (2008) (denying preliminary injunction where \ndefendant alleged statements such as “[the plaintiffs] ‘acquired knowledge of [the \ndefendant’s] business methods; clients, their specific requirements and needs; and \nother confidential information pertaining to [the defendant’s] business’”); \nVisionAIR, Inc. v. James, 167 N.C. App. 504, 511, 606 S.E.2d 359, 364 (2004) \n(denying preliminary injunction where plaintiff alleged trade secrets by “broad \nproduct and technology categories” with “sweeping and conclusory statements”). \n{48} In addition, Defendants have brought forward evidence suggesting that at \nleast some of Plaintiff’s claimed proprietary information is not a trade secret under \nthe NCTSPA and that Defendant I-Minerals independently developed Quintus-\ngrade quartz before its relationship with Defendant Gallo began.  (Def. I-Minerals’ \nResp. P.I. Mot., p. 8–12, Ex. E; Gallo Aff. ¶ 7); see N.C.G.S. § 66-155 (noting \nindependent development is a defense to a misappropriation claim).  For example, \nDefendant I-Minerals has brought forward evidence suggesting that the process for \npurifying quartz is generally known in the industry, and that, in particular, the \nfloatation process, the design and use of rock crushing equipment, the technique of \n \n \nmagnetic separation, the process of gassing or hot chlorination, proper gassing \ntemperatures and the process of electrodynamic comminution are all generally \nknown in the mining (and HPQ) industry. (Def. I-Minerals’ Resp. P.I. Mot., p. 8–12, \nEx. E; Gallo Aff. ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff’s failure to show its specific, unique modifications to \nthese well-known processes or techniques either unfairly deprives Defendants of an \nopportunity to rebut Plaintiff’s claim of trade secret protection or suggests that \nPlaintiff’s claim for trade secret protection of this information is not well-founded or \nboth.  Defendants’ evidence raises further doubt about Plaintiff’s ability to show \nthat it has a protectable trade secret in this information and cuts against Plaintiff’s \nclaim that it can show a likelihood of success on the merits.  See N.C. Farm P’ship., \n163 N.C. App. at 322, 593 S.E.2d at 129 (denying injunction where plaintiff failed to \nshow “existence of a trade secret”). \n{49} Further, Defendant Gallo has acknowledged that he recalls certain \nconfidential information of Plaintiff relating to Plaintiff’s mining and processes used \nto create Iota 8 and 9 level high purity quartz. (Def. Gallo’s Mem. Opp. P.I. Mot., p. \n7–8.)  At this stage of the proceedings, however, Plaintiff has not brought forward \nsufficient evidence to enable the Court to identify any specific trade secrets involved \nin the mining and development of Iota 8 or 9 level HPQ or the specific information \nthat Plaintiff seeks to protect in connection with the creation of these products.  In \nany event, even if the Court were able to identify Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets \nsufficiently to craft an appropriate injunction tailored to protect Plaintiff’s \nlegitimate trade secrets at this time, as noted below, Plaintiff has failed to show \nactual or threatened misappropriation or use sufficient to justify the extraordinary \nmeasure of a preliminary injunction on the current record. \n{50} Accordingly, based on the evidence before the Court and for purposes of \nthis P.I. Motion only, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not identified its alleged \ntrade secrets with the level of specificity required to enable Defendants to delineate \nthat which they are accused of misappropriating and the Court to determine \nwhether misappropriation has or is threatened to occur.  Analog, 157 N.C. App. at \n469, 579 S.E.2d at 454. \n \n \nii. Actual or Threatened Misappropriation \n{51} A preliminary injunction is an appropriate remedy “where actual \nmisappropriation is demonstrated,” but a court is less likely to grant injunctive \nrelief “solely on the basis of threatened misappropriation without proof of actual \nmisappropriation.”  Allegis Grp., 2013 NCBC 13 at ¶ 52 (citing Analog Devices, 157 \nN.C. App. at 470–71, 579 S.E.2d at 455).  “[O]rdinarily the mere fact that the \nemployee works for a competitor will be inadequate to prove a likelihood of \ndisclosure.”  Id. at ¶ 54.  “An injunction will not be issued merely to allay the fears \nand apprehensions or to soothe the anxieties of a party . . . [n]or will an injunction \nbe issued to restrain one from doing that which he is not attempting to do.”  \nTravenol Labs., 30 N.C. App. at 696, 228 S.E.2d at 486.   \n1.  Actual Misappropriation and Use \n{52} For its proof of Defendants’ actual misappropriation and use, Plaintiff \nrelies on the list Defendant Gallo compiled while seeking employment with Quartz \nCorp., contending that Gallo improperly revealed to Quartz Corp. that Plaintiff \nremoved [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as part of its process to create Iota-grade \nHPQ.  Defendants, however, present evidence from public sources that removal of \n[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] from ore is an industry-wide practice and is \nnecessary to create any form of HPQ.  (Def. I-Minerals’ Reply to Pl.’s Suppl. Br. \nSupp. P.I. Mot., Exs. A–B.)  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff’s \nevidence is insufficient at this stage to show that Defendant Gallo has actually \nmisappropriated and used Plaintiff’s alleged trade secret information. \n2.  Threatened Misappropriation and Use \n{53} Plaintiff contends that Defendant Gallo has had a specific opportunity to \nacquire or use Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets without its consent and therefore \nshould be enjoined.  Horner, 754 S.E.2d at 860–61 (entering preliminary injunction \nwhere “[d]efendant's knowledge of trade secrets and opportunity to use those in his \nwork for his new employer create a threat of misappropriation”); see N.C.G.S. § 65-\n155 (establishing misappropriation if defendant “knows or should have known of the \ntrade secret” and “had a specific opportunity to acquire the trade secret for \n \n \ndisclosure or use”); see also N.C.G.S. § 66-154(a) (permitting preliminary injunction \nfor actual or threatened misappropriation).  \n{54} In particular, Plaintiff claims that because Defendant I-Minerals has \nalready produced Quintus-grade quartz, the only rational reason Defendant I-\nMinerals could have for hiring Defendant Gallo is to acquire and use Plaintiff’s \nconfidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information from Defendant Gallo so it \ncan produce the higher purity, Iota-grade quartz.  For evidentiary support, Plaintiff \npoints to, in addition to Defendant Gallo’s email exchange with Quartz Corp., (i) the \nacknowledgements in Defendant Gallo’s 2009 Agreement that “all of the specialized \nknowledge and information relating to High Purity Quartz in Gallo’s possession \nand/or within his knowledge is confidential information belonging to [Plaintiff], (ii) \nDefendant Gallo’s  repeated representations to potential employers in his job search \nthat he has a background in HPQ and Iota-grade quartz production, (iii) the \nstatements in Defendant I-Minerals’ press release indicating that with the addition \nof Defendant Gallo, Defendant I-Minerals is “better positioned to compete in the \nhighly competitive quartz markets,” and (iv) the deposition statements of Defendant \nI-Minerals’ CEO that the company plans to “set its sights higher than Quintus” and \nproduce the highest grade quartz it can. (Pl.’s Reply Mem., p. 2–3.) \n{55} In opposition, Defendants principally contend that (i) Plaintiff’s alleged \ntrade secret information is “of no use” or is “mostly irrelevant” to Defendants \nbecause Plaintiff’s HPQ is mined and processed from a different ore than the ore \nmined and processed by Defendant I-Minerals, (ii) Defendant I-Minerals has \nindependently developed Quintus-grade quartz and has no need for Plaintiff’s \nalleged trade secret information for further development of its HPQ, (iii) Defendant \nGallo has not engaged in any conduct that shows he is a threat to disclose and use \nPlaintiff’s alleged trade secret information, and (iv) there is no basis in fact or law to \nassume Defendant Gallo will “inevitably disclose” Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets. \n(\nSee Defs.’ various briefs.) \n{56} It is undisputed that Plaintiff’s Spruce Pine mines in North Carolina \ncontain different, [REDACTED] ore than Defendant I-Minerals’ Helmer Bovill mine \n \n \nin Idaho.  Defendants present testimony that the degree of quartz purity that can be \nachieved, and the processes employed to achieve it, are entirely dependent on the \nqualities of the raw ore product.  (I-Minerals Dep. 46:16–48:13; 56:5–18.)  Moreover, \nDefendant Gallo testified by affidavit that Plaintiff’s Spruce Pine mine “produces \nthe highest purity quartz in the world that is produced on a commercial scale” and \nthat Plaintiff “has a monopoly on this market.”  (Gallo Aff. ¶ 7.)  Therefore, \naccording to Defendants, even if Defendant Gallo were to disclose and Defendant I-\nMinerals were to possess Plaintiff’s alleged trade secret information, that \ninformation would be of little or no use to Defendant I-Minerals in producing HPQ.  \nRelying on Analog, Defendants claim Plaintiff thus cannot show a threat of \nmisappropriation.  Analog, 157 N.C. App. at 470, 579 S.E.2d at 454 (denying trade \nsecret protection where the alleged trade secrets were “process dependent so as to \npreclude misappropriation”).  Plaintiff counters by arguing that its alleged trade \nsecrets are transferrable, and while acknowledging that “all parts of the process \ndepend upon the ore blend” that is mined (Unimin Dep. 53:20–23), contends that \n“[r]egardless of the process a competitor may use to initially purify quartz to high \nlevels, [Plaintiff’s] processes can be used to purify I-Minerals’ quartz to the highest \nof quality within the industry while short-cutting years of expensive research and \ndevelopment.”  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 18.) \n{57} Upon a review of the evidence of record at this stage of the proceedings, \nthe Court concludes that Plaintiff has not carried its burden to show through \nsubstantial evidence that Defendants have had a “specific opportunity to acquire \n[Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets] for disclosure or use.”  N.C.G.S. § 66-155.  In \nparticular, the evidence of record to date tends to show that, like the trade secrets \nalleged in Analog and in contrast to those alleged in Horner, the differences in the \nqualities of Plaintiff’s North Carolina ore and Defendant I-Minerals’ Idaho ore \nappear to require sufficiently different processes to mine and develop HPQ to render \nat least some, if not all, of Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets non-transferable.  As \nsuch, Plaintiff has failed to show at this stage through substantial evidence that \nDefendants have had the “specific opportunity” to disclose or use Plaintiff’s alleged \n \n \ntrade secrets that is required under North Carolina law.  See Analog, 157 N.C. App. \nat 465–70, 579 S.E.2d at 451–54 (denying preliminary injunction where trade \nsecrets at issue were “heavily process dependent” and thus “mostly irrelevant” and \nof “no use” to defendant); see also Horner, 754 S.E.2d at 854–60 (issuing \npreliminary injunction and distinguishing Analog where there were “no product \ndesign differences which render ‘non-transferable’ the trade secrets of [the plaintiff] \nwhich [the defendant] possesses”).   \n{58} Moreover, Plaintiff has not brought forward evidence of specific actions \nwhich indicate that Defendants intend to disclose or use Plaintiff’s alleged trade \nsecret information sufficient to justify the entry of preliminary injunctive relief \nbased on a threat of misappropriation.  Such proof has frequently been present \nwhen North Carolina courts have elected to enjoin threatened misappropriation.  \nSee, e.g., Horner, 754 S.E.2d at 854–60 (defendant commenced work for a \ncompetitor immediately after resigning and shortly after sending trade secret \ninformation to defendant’s personal email account); Byrd’s Lawn & Landscaping v. \nSmith, 142 N.C. App. 371, 377, 542 S.E.2d 689, 693 (2001) (defendant immediately \nstarted his own business in competition with former employer after resigning and \nunderbid former employer on eleven of fourteen projects); Barker v. Gould, 146 N.C. \nApp. 561, 562, 553 S.E.2d 227, 228 (2001) (defendant made copies of plaintiff’s \ncustomer, supplier and pricing lists and precise product formulations before \nresigning); Armacell LLC v. Bostic, 2010 N.C. App. LEXIS 1278, *32 (2010) \n(unpublished) (defendant stole plaintiff’s proprietary information using CD burning \nsoftware and an external hard drive); Allegis Grp., 2013 NCBC 13 ¶ 52 (a court is \nless likely to grant injunctive relief “solely on the basis of threatened \nmisappropriation without proof of actual misappropriation”). \n{59} Here, it appears beyond doubt that Defendant Gallo has maintained in \nconfidence Plaintiff’s alleged trade secret information since he left Plaintiff’s \nemployment in February 2009, now five and one-half years ago.  It is equally \nuncontroverted that he did not violate the terms of his non-competition covenant \nduring its five-year term and did not work in the HPQ industry from February 2009 \n \n \nuntil he became a consultant for Defendant I-Minerals on June 1, 2014.  \nAccordingly, Defendant Gallo’s prior, long-term adherence to his contractual \nobligations is persuasive evidence that he is not a threat to violate his contractual \nor other legal commitments to Plaintiff and disclose Plaintiff’s alleged trade secrets \nhereafter.  \nSee, e.g., Aeroflow, 2011 NCBC 20 ¶ 40 (“An injunction will not be issued \nsimply to appease a groundless apprehension on the part of a plaintiff.”). \n{60} Moreover, the fact that Defendant Gallo sought employment from various \nemployers by referencing his prior work history and experience appears \nunremarkable, particularly given that he had been out of the HPQ industry for five \nyears and was no longer subject to a non-competition restriction. The evidence is \nundisputed at this stage that Defendant Gallo did not offer or agree to disclose any \nof Plaintiff’s alleged trade secret information to obtain a job offer from Defendant I-\nMinerals or any other potential employer.  Defendant Gallo has also testified that \nhe has not disclosed, and does not intend to disclose, any of Plaintiff’s alleged trade \nsecret information to Defendant I-Minerals or any other entity or person, and the \nCourt has concluded that Defendant Gallo’s admitted disclosure to Quartz Corp. is \nnot sufficient at this stage to show actual disclosure of Plaintiff’s alleged trade \nsecrets.  See, e.g., Travenol Labs., 30 N.C. App. at 696 (injunction will not be issued \n“to restrain one from doing that which he is not attempting to do”). \n{61} Furthermore, there is no evidence of record at this time that Defendant I-\nMinerals attempted to lure Defendant Gallo away from Plaintiff’s employment or \nthat Defendant I-Minerals has sought or received any confidential information of \nPlaintiff from Defendant Gallo or from any other source.  Plaintiff has not brought \nforward evidence suggesting this is a situation where the defendant has taken \nconfidential information and gone to work soon thereafter for a competitor like in \nHorner, Byrd’s Lawn & Landscaping, or Barker, where the courts found threats of \nmisappropriation on such facts entitling the plaintiffs to injunctions.  \n{62} In addition, the statements in Defendant I-Minerals’ press release and the \ncompany’s apparent plan to develop HPQ in the future do not, in context and \nwithout more, establish a threat to Plaintiff from Defendant I-Minerals’ hiring of \n \n \nDefendant Gallo sufficient to justify injunctive relief.  Defendant I-Minerals has \ntestified that it does not intend to acquire or use any of Plaintiff’s alleged trade \nsecret information in the development of its HPQ products and has provided \nundisputed evidence that it relies on third party laboratories, such as the MRL lab \nin Asheville and the Dorfner lab in Germany, to purify its quartz with widely-\nknown and long-used floatation and acid-leaching techniques. (Def. I-Minerals \nResp. P.I. Mot., p. 8–9.) 11 \n{63} Accordingly, on balance and viewing the entirety of the record at this stage \nof the proceedings, the Court is not satisfied that Plaintiff has met its burden to \npresent evidence of actual or threatened misappropriation of a nature that would \nentitle it to injunctive relief and, therefore, cannot conclude that Plaintiff has shown \nfacts adequate to justify entry of a preliminary injunction based on an alleged \nviolation of the NCTSPA.  \nSee generally Milgrim on Trade Secrets § 15.01 (2014) \n(“[C]ourts are not apt to enjoin on mere suspicion of the threat of wrongful use or \ndisclosure”); FMC Corp., 899 F. Supp. at 1481 (denying motion for preliminary \ninjunction where plaintiff “has established a mere possibility of misappropriation \nthat is insufficient to justify an injunction”). \nB.  Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \n{64} To prevail on a claim for violation of the Unfair and Deceptive Trade \nPractices Act (“UDTPA”), N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 (2014), Plaintiff must show “(1) an \nunfair or deceptive act or practice, or an unfair method of competition, (2) in or \naffecting commerce, and (3) which proximately caused actual injury to [Plaintiff] or \n[its] business.”  \nMurray v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 123 N.C. App. 1, 9, 472 S.E.2d \n358, 362 (1996) (citations omitted). \n                                                 \n11 The Court notes that although Defendants have interpreted Plaintiff’s contentions as advancing a \ntheory of “inevitable disclosure,” Plaintiff has advised that it is not proceeding under this theory. \n(Pl.’s Post-Hearing Brief, p. 4.)  Accordingly, the Court will not address Defendant’s arguments \nconcerning the inapplicability of the doctrine here, except to note that the doctrine has not yet been \nfirmly adopted by the North Carolina appellate courts.  See Analog, 157 N.C. App. at 470, 579 S.E.2d \nat 454–55; Allegis, 2013 NCBC 13 ¶ 53. \n \n \n \n{65} Plaintiff hinges its claim under the UDTPA on Defendants’ alleged \nviolation of the NCTSPA.  Because the Court is not satisfied that Plaintiff has \nshown a likelihood of success on its claim under the NCTSPA, the Court therefore \nsimilarly concludes that Plaintiff has not presented sufficient evidence of \nDefendants’ violation of the UDTPA to justify entry of a preliminary injunction. \nC.  Breach of the 1997 Agreement \n{66} Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Gallo breached the 1997 Agreement by \ndisclosing Plaintiff’s confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information or \nmaterials “relating to any Product at any stage of its mining or processing, or in \nfinal form . . . .”   (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 20.)  All parties agree that the \n1997 Agreement is governed by Connecticut law.  A successful claim for breach of \ncontract under Connecticut law requires “the formation of an agreement, \nperformance by one party, breach of the agreement by the other party and \ndamages.”  \nRosato v. Mascardo, 844 A.2d 893, 902 (Conn. App. Ct. 2004) (citation \nomitted).  A valid contract requires consideration. State Nat’l Bank v. Dick, 325 \nA.2d 235, 238 (Conn. 1973) (citation omitted).  \n{67} As a preliminary matter, Defendant Gallo contends that the 1997 \nAgreement is not valid due to a lack of consideration.  Specifically, Defendant Gallo \ncontends that there was no new consideration for the 1997 Agreement because he \nwas already employed by Plaintiff when he signed the 1997 Agreement and received \nno further benefit from signing.  Plaintiff contends in response that the 1997 \nAgreement was executed by Gallo on the day he actually began his employment and \nhence was supported by consideration.  For purposes of deciding the P.I. Motion, the \nCourt will assume without deciding that the 1997 Agreement is supported by \nconsideration.   \n{68}     Plaintiff’s evidence in support of its contract claim is largely the same as \nthe evidence Plaintiff relied upon to show actual or threatened misappropriation \nunder its NCTSPA claim.  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 21–22; Pl.’s Br. Supp. \nP.I. Mot., p. 15.)  Plaintiff’s only evidence of actual breach is Defendant Gallo’s \nemail to Quartz Corp. referencing Plaintiff’s removal of [REDACTED] and \n \n \n[REDACTED] in the process of creating Iota-grade HPQ.  As the Court concluded in \nassessing actual disclosure under the NCTSPA, however, the Court concludes that \nthis information is not sufficient to show that Plaintiff is likely to prevail on its \nbreach of contract claim in light of the public information Defendant I-Minerals has \nbrought forward tending to show that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are \nroutinely removed by all competitors in creating HPQ of all grades.  (Def. I-\nMinerals’ Resp. P.I. Mot., Exs. A–B.)  See, e.g., Town & Country House & Homes \nService, Inc. v. Evans, 189 A.2d 390, 393 (Conn. 1963) (“Matters of public knowledge \nor of general knowledge in an industry cannot be appropriated by one as his \nsecret.”).  \n{69} Moreover, Plaintiff’s evidence of threatened harm is speculative at best to \nshow that Plaintiff otherwise has a likelihood of success on its breach of contract \nclaim.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to show that it has \na likelihood of success on its claim for breach of the 1997 Agreement and, thus, that \na preliminary injunction on this basis is not justified.   \nD.  Breach of Implied Duties of Good Faith and Fair Dealing in the 1997 Agreement  \n{70} Under Connecticut law, “every contract carries an implied duty requiring \nthat neither party do anything that will injure the right of the other to receive the \nbenefits of the agreement.”  Capstone Bldg. Corp. v. Am. Motorists Ins. Co., 67 A.3d \n961, 986 (Conn. 2013) (citations omitted).  The covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing “presupposes that the terms and purpose of the contract are agreed upon by \nthe parties and that what is in dispute is a party’s discretionary application or \ninterpretation of a contract term.”  Id.  To breach the covenant, “the acts by which a \ndefendant allegedly impedes the plaintiff's right to receive benefits that he or she \nreasonably expected to receive under the contract must have been taken in bad \nfaith.”  De La Concha of Hartford, Inc. v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 849 A.2d 382, 388 \n(Conn. 2004). \n{71} Plaintiff contends that it is likely to prevail on its claim for breach of the \nimplied duties of good faith and fair dealing in the 1997 Agreement “because \n[Defendant] Gallo is working for [Defendant] I-Minerals in the identical field in \n \n \nwhich he gained [Plaintiff’s] confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information.”  \n(Pl.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. P.I. Mot., p. 22.) \n{72} For the reasons stated in section V(1)(C) above, however, the Court \nconcludes that Plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of success on its claim for alleged \nbreach of the implied duties of good faith and fair dealing and that therefore entry \nof a preliminary injunction on this basis is not proper. \nE. Other Equitable Considerations. \n{73} The Court notes that certain equitable considerations also weigh against \nentry of a preliminary injunction here.  In particular, the fact that Plaintiff has \nalready enjoyed the benefits of a lengthy five-year non-compete provision is a factor \nmilitating against an injunction enjoining Defendant Gallo from working for \nDefendant I-Minerals in these circumstances.  Although North Carolina law is clear \nthat a perpetual non-disclosure provision such as those contained in the 1997 and \n2009 Agreements may be enforceable to protect a legitimate business interest of a \nformer employer, see Chemimetals Processing, Inc. v. McEneny, 124 N.C. App. 194, \n197, 476 S.E.2d 374, 376 (1996), the Court observes that some courts have found \nrelevant in denying injunctive relief for alleged misappropriation the fact that, \nunlike here, the former employer did not obtain a non-competition agreement from \nthe departing employee to protect its confidential information.  See, e.g., Analog \nDevices, 157 N.C. App. at 471, 579 S.E.2d at 455 (“While [plaintiff] might have \nprevented [defendants] from working in the field of HSHR ADC design and \ndevelopment in the event they ceased working for [plaintiff] by making a non-\ncompete clause part of their employment contract, no such clause has been \npresented.”); FMC Corp., 899 F. Supp. at 1479 (“[Plaintiff] never asked defendant to \nsign a covenant not to compete, and [defendant] never did so.”).12 \n \n \n                                                 \n12 Even where an enforceable non-disclosure agreement is present, North Carolina law permits a \nformer employee to “take with him, at the termination of his employment, general skills and \nknowledge acquired during his tenure with his former employer,” Engineering Associates, Inc. v. \nPankow, 268 N.C. 137, 140, 150 S.E.2d 56, 58–59 (1966).     \n \n \n2.  Irreparable Harm \n{74} In light of the Court’s determination of Plaintiff’s likelihood of success on \nthe merits, Plaintiff cannot show at this stage that denial of a preliminary \ninjunction will result in an irreparable injury to it or its business. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n{75} On balance, upon a review of the entire record before the Court at this \ntime, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to show \nthat it is likely that it will succeed on the merits of its claims or that Plaintiff will \nsuffer immediate and irreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is not granted. \n{76} Accordingly, the Court concludes that a preliminary injunction should not \nissue and hereby DENIES Plaintiff’s P.I. Motion and DISSOLVES the TRO entered \non August 13, 2014.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 4th day of September 2014. \n \n \n  \n "
