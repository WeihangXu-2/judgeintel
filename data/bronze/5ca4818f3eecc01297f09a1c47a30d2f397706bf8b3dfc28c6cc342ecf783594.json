The themes involved in this lawsuit are all too familiar to the Business \nCourt.  The plaintiff company alleges that a disgruntled employee, prior to resigning, \nschemed to start a competing business, but shortcut the usual processes for building \nthat business by stealing plaintiff’s “trade secrets,” poaching plaintiff’s key employees \nfor the new venture, and soliciting plaintiff’s best customers.  These types of so-called \nSunbelt Rental cases make up a not insignificant portion of the Court’s docket.\n1 \n2. The minor variation on the theme in this case is that the disgruntled \nemployee, Defendant John Michael Glover (“John Michael”) , is the grandson of \nPlaintiff Glover Construction Company, Inc.’s (“GCC”) founder and president, John \nM. Glover (“J.M.”), and was the heir apparent to take over leadership of GCC, but not \nquickly enough to satisfy John Michael.  GCC claims that i nstead of being patient, \nJohn Michael secretly created a competing company, Defendant Sequoia Services, \nLLC (“Sequoia”), with the assistance of his brother -in-law, Defendant Christopher \nJames Colangelo (“Colangelo”), and John Michael’s father, Defendant J. Mark Glover \n                                                 \n1 Indeed, Plaintiff contends that the facts in this case compare favorably to those in Sunbelt \nRentals, Inc. v. Head & Engquist Equip., L.L.C., 2003 NCBC LEXIS 6 (N.C. Super. Ct. May \n2, 2003), aff’d, 174 N.C. App. 49, 620 S.E.2d 222 (2005). \n \n \n(“Mark”), a GCC vice president.  GCC contends that John Michael breached fiduciary \nduties to GCC, misappropriated GCC’s trade secrets, solicited away GCC’s key \nemployees, and interfered with GCC’s customer relationships  to create Sequoia and \ndirectly compete for work from GCC’s customers.   John Michael left a trail of text \nmessages and emails upon which GCC relies in pursuing its claims. \n3. Defendants, of course, deny that John Michael, Mark, or Colangelo did \nanything more than lawfully prepare to compete with GCC through Sequoia, and that \nthis lawsuit is motivated solely by J.M.’s desire to exact revenge on  Defendants.  \nAccordingly, the parties bitterly dispute many of the facts underlying this matter. \nII. FACTS \n4. “The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling upon a motion for \nsummary judgment.  But to provide context for its ruling, the Court may state either \nthose facts that it believes are not in material dispute or those facts on which a \nmaterial dispute forecloses summary adjudication.”  Ehm ann v. Medflow, Inc., 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 88, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017).   \nA. GCC and John Michael’s Employment \n \n5. GCC is a family -owned North Carolina corporation that specializes in \nmass excavation and other construction projects.  GCC was founded in the 1950s and \nis now one of the largest mass excavation ( “earth-moving”) firms on the East Coast.  \nGCC performs projects in various operational areas, including commercial \ndistribution centers, residential, airports, dams, highway and infrastructure, energy, \nand landfills .  GCC’s  services include site preparation, grading, soil stabilization, \n \n \ncompaction, topsoil removal a nd replacement, landfill construction, landfill closure, \ngrading, utility relocation, and coal ash excavations. \n6. J.M. is the president of GCC.  At all relevant times, J.M.’s two sons, \nMark and Matt hew Glover (“Matt”), served as GCC v ice presidents.  Mark’s \nemployment was terminated on February 15, 2018, but he remains a 20% shareholder \nof GCC and a member of its board of directors.   \n7. John Michael is J.M.’s grandson and Mark’s son.  John Michael began \nfull-time employment with GCC in 2012 as the Director of E ngineering and \nConstruction, and resigned on April 3, 2017.  John Michael was also Secretary of GCC \nduring his employment .  The parties dispute when John Michael resigned as \nSecretary.  (Complaint, ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 38, 64; John Michael Answer, ECF No. 19, \nat ¶¶ 38, 64.) \n8. Among his achievements, John Michael built customer relationships \nwith Duke Energy (“Duke”) and Dominion Energy (“Dominion”) and secured several \nlucrative contracts with Duke and Dominion for coal ash clean -up services.  At the \ntime John Michael resigned, GCC had two active projects for Dominion at the Possum \nPoint Power Station in Prince William County, Virginia and at the Bremo Power \nStation in Fluvanna County, Virginia.  GCC also had two ongoing projects with Duke \nin New Hanover County , North Carolina.  Through the projects with Duke and \nDominion, John Michael gained valuable experience and expertise in coal ash clean-\nup and developed business relationships with key customer contacts.  (ECF No. 3, at \n¶ 14.) \n \n \n9. Plaintiff contends that through his employment with GCC, John \nMichael \nhad access to, [and] intimate knowledge of GCC ’s \n[b]usiness [r]elationships and [e]xpectancies and its \nconfidential and proprietary information (such as the \nnames, contacts, addresses and phone numbers of GCC ’s \nemployees, customers and vendors; the equipment and \nproject needs of GCC ’s customers; GCC ’s costs, bidding, \nand pricing strategies; GCC ’s marketing practices and \nmaterials; GCC’s hiring and allocation of human resources; \nemployee compensation; specific project  billing data; \nequipment and personnel T&M rates; profit and loss data \nand other financial information; GCC ’s bond capacity, \ninsurance and workers compensation coverage; company \nsoftware information; and other confidential business \ninformation (GCC’s “Trade Secrets”)). \n \n(Id. at ¶ 16.)\n2  Defendants dispute that GCC’s information was a trade secret.  (Defs.’ \nBr. in Supp., ECF No. 48, at pp. 10–11.)  \n10. It is undisputed that during his  employment with GCC, John Michael \nbecame the “face” of GCC to its customers and employees.  J.M. admittedly saw John \nMichael as his successor and was grooming him to take over leadership of GCC.  From \nMay 2016 through early 2017, J.M., John Michael, Mark, and Matt negotiated over a \npotential succession plan for John Michael to become president of and a shareholder \nin GCC.  (See ECF No. 80, at pp. 6–7 and the record citations therein for a discussion \nof the negotiations .)  Ultimately, the parties were not able to reac h an agreement.  \n(John Michael Dep., ECF No. 50 at Ex. 5, 103:8–105:22.) \n \n \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff alleges that Mark had access to and knowledge of the same information. \n \n \nB. Colangelo and the Creation of Sequoia  \n11. Colangelo is married to Mark’s daughter,  and John Michael’s sister,  \nRachel Glover.  Colangelo was not employed with GCC. \n12. In April 2015, John Michael and Colangelo began discussing the \nformation of a business entity through which John Michael and Colangelo could make \nmoney from GCC’s contract with Dominion.  On April 24, 2015, they excha nged the \nfollowing text messages: \nJohn Michael: What if I set up a LLC as a 3rd member of \nthe contract to buy materials? \n \nColangelo: I don ’t think it’ s necessary.  In the end the \nmaterials will need to be paid for by one of the two parties \nanyway [.] \n \nColangelo: Or both [.] \n  \nJohn Michael: Your missing my point... I would be the sole \nowner of the LLC? I just would have to figure out how to \nhide ownership [.] \n \nJohn Michael: Then I could get my cut [.] \n \n(ECF No. 76, at p. 1.) \n \n13. In September 2015, John Mich ael and Colangelo formed Sequoia  as a \nDelaware limited liability company with headquarters in Greensboro, North \nCarolina.  The Statement of Organization for Sequoia lists Colangelo and John \nMichael as “the Managing Member(s) of [Sequoia] until their succes sors are elected \nand qualify.”  (ECF No. 49.15.)  However, the parties dispute whether John Michael \nhas an ownership interest in Sequoia.  GCC points to evidence, inter alia, showing \nthat a credit application to a Ford Motors dealership in May 2016 lists John Michael \n \n \nand Colangelo as each 50% owners of Sequoia (ECF No. 72.3, at p. 3) and that John \nMichael signed documents to be added as a “member” to Sequoia’s bank account (Id. \nat p. 5).  Defendants, however, argue that John Michael has never received a K-1 from \nSequoia and has never reported himself as an owner on tax returns or personal \nfinancial statements.  (2016, 2017, and 2018 Schedule K -1 for Sequoia, ECF Nos . \n62.3–62.5.)  In addition, John Michael and Colangelo claimed  in their respective \ndepositions that John Michael is no longer a member of Sequoia (John Michael Dep., \nECF No. 49.6, at 77:24– 25; Colangelo Dep., ECF No. 50  at Ex. 8, 57:10–58:9), but \nthere are no documents in the record that show that John Michael formally withdrew \nhis membership interest in Sequoia. \n14. In February 2016, GCC entered into a $4.4 million subcontract with \nSequoia for dewatering work at Dominion’s Possum Point Power Station .  (ECF No. \n49.18; ECF No. 49.19.)  GCC subsequently entered into additional subcontracts with \nSequoia for dewatering services on other GCC projects.  ( Denise T. Dauphin Dep., \nECF No. 68.7, at 167:14–168:4; Denise T. Dauphin Expert Report, ECF No. 61.2, at \nEx. D-4.1.)  From 2015 to 2018, Sequoia invoiced GCC over $14 million for dewatering \nsubcontracts.  (Id.) \n15. J.M. and Matt were aware of Colangelo’s involvement in Sequoia and \nthe GCC subcontracts awarded to Sequoia.  ( GCC 30(b)(6) Dep., ECF No.  50 at Ex. \n13, 154:3–23; ECF No. 50, at Ex. 28 .)  However, John Michael never disclosed his \ninvolvement in Sequoia to J.M. or Matt.  (John Michael Dep., ECF No. 49.6, at 76:17–\n77:15.) \n \n \nC. John Michael’s Efforts on Behalf of Sequoia Prior to His \nResignation from GCC \n \n16. During the period in which John Michael was negotiating over his future \nstatus with GCC, he also had discussions with Colangelo about building up Sequoia’s \nbusiness in the event John Michael need ed to leave GCC.  In  May 2016, when J.M. \nrebuffed John Michael’s initial suggestion that he immediately be made president of \nGCC during a hunting trip to Argentina, John Michael texted Colangelo: \nI’m just not going to bring it up down here anymore and \ntalk to dad [Mark] and see what he wants to do.  I would \nsay [S]equoia may be getting ready to go on a hiring spree[.] \n \n(ECF No. 49.12, at p. 13.)  In another text message sent during the same trip, John \nMichael told Colangelo: \nWhere I am now is when I get back I will talk to my dad \n[Mark] and let him make the call if he wants to fight it now \nthen I will go to my grandpa and Matt and say either I’m \npresident or me and everyone else leaves or if my dad \nwants to play it out [w]e will start feeding work to [S]equoia \nand build that and in 3 years walk away and that will be \nbetter than [GCC] ever was and Matt will be left with \nabsolutely nothing.  \n \n(Id. at p. 14.) \n \n17. After returning from Argentina, John Michael t exted Colangelo that \n“Dad [Mark] wants to make the stand so be ready to start hiring [if] things go south.”  \n(ECF No. 76, at p. 70.) \n18. Throughout late 2016 and early 2017, John Michael sent numerous GCC \ndocuments to Colangelo, including GCC’s Time & Material rates (“T&M Rates”) (ECF \n \n \nNo. 79, at pp. 3–7), GCC’s equipment rates (Id. at p. 51), and a GCC work plan for a \nconstruction project in Asheville (Id. at pp. 15–16).   \n19. On March 19, 2017, John Michael t exted Colangelo: “Had a real good \nconversation with dad [Mark] today.  He said we could use his resum[é] on anything \nwe wanted he just doesn’t want to leave the same t ime as me.”  (ECF No. 76 , at p. \n158.) \n20. It is undisputed that, during March and April 2017, John Michael made \na copy of all the emails and other files on his GCC-issued laptop computer for his own \nfuture use, sought out assistance with and deleted the hard d rive on his laptop \ncomputer, communicated regularly with Colangelo about his efforts to save and store \nhis GCC files and emails prior to resigning, and assisted at least one other GCC \nemployee, Merit Cross (“Cross”), a  GCC project manager  who was planning to join \nSequoia, in deleting the hard drive on his company-issued computer.  (John Michael \nDep., ECF No. 49.6, at 128:17 –129:13, 131:2 –133:4, 134:4– 10.)  There is also  no \ndispute that John Michael did not save the emails and files on his laptop to a network \nserver or anywhere else accessible to GCC.  (See ECF No. 46, at pp. 6–11 and the \nrecord citations therein for a discussion of the steps John Michael took in deleting his \nGCC emails and files on his GCC computer.) \n21. John Michael resigned from GCC on April 3, 2017 and accepted \nColangelo’s offer to serve as Sequoia’s vice president that evening.3  (ECF No. 49.27.)  \nOver the two-year period after John Michael joined Sequoia, twenty -four other GCC \n                                                 \n3 Defendants contend that John Michael did not begin to work for Sequoia until June 2017.  \n(John Michael Dep., ECF No. 49.6, at 112:2–22.) \n \n \nemployees also left GCC and started working for Sequoia.  (Denise T. Dauphin Dep., \nECF No. 50 at Ex. 9, 287:7–21.)  GCC alleges that most of these individuals were key, \nlong-term employees of GCC.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 40 , 45.)  Cross announced his \nresignation from GCC the day after  John Michael resigned , and he also began \nworking with Sequoia.  Shortly after he was terminated from GCC in February 2018, \nMark began working for Sequoia as well.  (Denise T. Dauphin Expert Report, ECF \nNo. 61.2, at Ex. D-7.) \n22. GCC was able to recover the emails that John Michael had deleted from \nhis GCC email account within five days after John Michael’s resignation .  (ECF No. \n49.26; Catherine Glover Frazier Dep., ECF No. 68.3, at 291:5–292:5.)  However, GCC \nwas not able to recover the other  data or files th at were wiped from John Michael ’s \ncomputer.  ( Glover 30(b)(6) Dep., ECF No. 49.8, at 300:25– 303:14.)  Nevertheless, \nduring the litigation , John Michael’s external hard drive was imaged and he  \nultimately provided GCC with all of the files.  (Defs.’ Br. in Opp., ECF No. 80, at p. 9; \nJohn Michael Aff., ECF No. 68.2, at ¶¶ 12–16.) \n23. During John Michael’s employment with GCC, GCC did not have an \nemployee handbook, did not require employees to sign confidentiality or noncompete \nagreements, and did not ha ve any written policies—formal or informal —related to \ndocument retention or the handling and dissemination of confidential information.  \n(Catherine Glover Frazier Dep., ECF No. 68.3, at 36:8 –20, 290:10–17; John Michael \nAff., ECF No. 68.2, at ¶ 3.)  GCC did , however, provide laptop computers to \nmanagement and supervisory personnel that were password protected,  and limited \n \n \naccess to certain information to  those involved in preparing estimates or billing.  \n(Catherine Glover Frazier Dep., ECF No. 50 at Ex. 14, 157:8–160:21.)   \n24. After John Michael left GCC and went to work for Sequoia, GCC claims \nthat Sequoia began competing with GCC  and interfered with GCC’s business \nrelationship with Dominion.  GCC contends that Sequoia won bids for contracts on \nfour projects by Dominion on which both GCC and Sequoia bid: Yorktown, Greenville, \nPossum Point, and Chesterfield.4  (Denise T. Dauphin Expert Report, ECF No. 61.2, \nat pp. 13–15.)  Sequoia’s bids for those projects were lower than GCC’s bids.  (Id.)   \n25. GCC contends that Defendants ’ wrongful conduct has caused damages \nto GCC.  (See ECF No. 74, at pp. 21–25 for a discussion of GCC’s damages.) \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n26. GCC filed the Complaint in this action on February 15, 2018.  (ECF No. \n3.)  On February 19, 2018, this case was designated to the North Carolina Business \nCourt and assigned to the undersigned.  (Designation Order, ECF No. 1; Assignment \nOrder, ECF No. 2.)  \n27. In the Complaint, GCC alleges, inter alia, that: \n \na. “[D]uring his employment and while a fiduciary of GCC, [John \nMichael] used his relationships with GCC employees, particularly \nkey employees at important coal ash projects, and GCC Trade \n                                                 \n4 It is undisputed that GCC withdrew its bid on the Chesterfield project before the bids were \nconsidered and the contract awarded.   There is no evidence in the record that this contract \nwas awarded to Sequoia. \n \n \nSecrets, for his personal and Sequoia’s use to the detriment of GCC” \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶ 49); \nb. John Michael has misappropriated “GCC’s [b]usiness [r]elationships \nand [e]xpectancies and Trade Secrets for his own benefit and the \nbenefit of Sequoia” (Id. at ¶ 51); \nc. “John Michael, Colangelo, and Sequoia have systematically raided \nGCC of its employees,” which “has depleted key management \nthroughout the [c]ompany” and “severely impacted GCC ’s ability to \nservice customers, to maintain GCC ’s hard- earned [b]usiness \n[r]elationships and [e]xpectancies, and has caused disclosure of \nGCC’s Trade Secrets”  (Id. at ¶¶ 45–46); and \nd. John Michael and Mark conspired wit h Colangelo and Sequoia in \nthis unlawful conduct with the “inten[t] to cause GCC to lose \nbusiness and to divert that business to Sequoia.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 58–60.) \n28. In the Complaint, GCC alleges claims against John Michael for: breach \nof fiduciary duty (First Cl aim); constructive fraud (Fourth Claim); and conversion \n(Tenth Claim).  Additionally, GCC alleges a claim against Mark for  breach of \nfiduciary duty (Second Claim), and claims against John Michael, Colangelo, and \nSequoia for misappropriation and threatened misappropriation of trade secrets \n(Seventh Claim) , and computer trespass in violation of N.C.G.S. § 14-458 (Ninth \nClaim).  GCC alleges a claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against \nSequoia and Colangelo (Third Claim), and an aiding and abetting constructive fraud \n \n \nclaim against Mark, Sequoia, and Colangelo (Fifth Claim).  Lastly, GCC alleges \nclaims against a ll Defendants for: tortious interference with contract and business \nrelations (Sixth Claim); unfair methods of competition under N.C.G.S. § 75 -1.1 \n(Eighth Claim); civil conspiracy (Eleventh Claim); and punitive damages (Twelfth \nClaim). \n29. On September 6, 2019 , GCC filed Plaintiff’s Motion seeking partial \nsummary judgment on its computer trespass claim, but only as it relates to liability  \nand not as to damages, and on certain of Defendants’ affirmative defenses: statute of \nlimitations; equitable doctrines of wa iver, estoppel, and laches; failure to mitigate \ndamages; and unclean hands.  (ECF No. 45.)   GCC also submitted a brief  (ECF No. \n46) and evidentiary materials in support of Plaintiff’s Motion (ECF Nos. 49.1–49.30, \n64.1).  On the same date, Defendants filed Defendants’ Motion seeking summary \njudgment on all claims asserted against Defendants  by GCC.  (ECF No. 47.)  \nDefendants also submitted a brief in support of Defendants’  Motion ( ECF No. 56 \n[SEALED], ECF No. 48) and supporting materials (ECF No. 50).   \n30. On October 17, 2019, GCC filed its brief in opposition to Defendants’  \nMotion (ECF No. 71  [SEALED], ECF No. 74 ), and multiple materials in opposition \n(ECF Nos. 72.1–72.22).  On the same day, Defendants filed their brief in opposition \nto Plaintiff’s Motion (ECF No. 70 [SEALED], ECF No. 80), and multiple materials in \nopposition (ECF Nos. 68.1–68.10).  On October 30, 2019, GCC filed its reply brief in \nsupport of Plaintiff’s Motion (ECF No. 81), and multiple materials in reply (ECF Nos. \n \n \n82.1–82.9).  On the same day, Defendants filed their  reply brief ( ECF No. 85 \n[SEALED], ECF No. 83), and multiple materials in reply (ECF Nos. 84.1–84.8). \n31. The Motions came before the Court for a hearing and are n ow ripe for \ndecision.  \nIV. ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review \n32. “Summary judgment  is appropriate ‘if the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any  material fact and that any party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.’”  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics \nTraffic Servs., LLC, 365 N.C. 520, 523, 723 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2012) (quoting N.C.G.S. \n§ 1A-1, Rule 56(c)).  The moving party bears the burden of presenting evidence which \nshows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.  Hensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc., 193 N.C. App. \n561, 563, 668 S.E.2d 349, 351 (2008).  The moving party may meet this burden by \n“proving an essential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be \nproven at trial, or would be  barred by an affirmative defense.”  Variety Wholesalers, \nInc., 365 N.C. at 523, 723 S.E.2d at 747.  An issue is “material” if “resolution of the \nissue is so essential that the party  against whom it is resolved may not prevail.”  \nMcNair v. Boyette, 282 N.C. 230, 235, 192 S.E.2d 457, 460 (1972).  “A ‘genuine issue’ \nis one that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. \n77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 (2000).   \n \n \n33. Once the movant presents evidence in support of the  motion, the \nnonmovant “cannot rely on the allegations or denials set forth in her pleading [ ] and \nmust, instead, forecast sufficient evidence to show the existence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact in order to preclude an award of summary judgment.”  Steele v. Bowden, \n238 N.C. App. 566, 577, 768 S.E.2d 47, 57 (2014) (internal citation omitted).  In \nconducting its analysis, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable \nto the nonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83, 530 S.E.2d at 835. \n34. Since both GCC and Defendants seek summary judgment in their favor \non GCC’s claim for computer trespass, t he Court will first address the computer \ntrespass claim.  The Court will then turn to Plaintiff’s Motion, and lastly will address \nDefendants’ Motion. \nB. Computer Trespass Claim  \n35. GCC and Defendants both seek summary judgment in their favor on \nGCC’s claim against John Michael, Colangelo, and Sequoia for computer trespass in \nviolation of N.C.G.S. § 14-458.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 113–22.)   \n36. Section 14-458 provides, in relevant part, that “it shall be unlawful for \nany person to use a computer or computer network without authority and with the \nintent to do any of the following”:  \n(1) Temporarily or permanently remove, halt, or \notherwise disable any computer data, computer \nprograms, or computer software from a computer or \ncomputer network. \n(2) Cause a computer to malfunction, regardless of how \nlong the malfunction persists. \n(3) Alter or erase a ny computer data, computer \nprograms, or computer software.  \n \n \n(4) Cause physical injury to the property of another.  \n(5) Make or cause to be made an unauthorized copy, in \nany form, including, but not limited to, any printed \nor electronic form of computer data, computer \nprograms, or computer software residing in, \ncommunicated by, or produced by a computer or \ncomputer network.  \n. . . . \n \nId. \n37. Section 14-458(a) further provides, in relevant part: “a person is ‘without \nauthority’ when (i) the person has no right or permission of the owner to use a \ncomputer, or the person uses a computer in a manner exceeding the right or \npermission . . . .”  N.C.G.S. § 14-458(a). \n38. There is no dispute that John Michael made a copy of his GCC emails \nand the files on his GCC laptop computer and then deleted or removed the GCC \nemails and GCC computer files  from the laptop .  However , the parties dispute \nwhether: (1) John Michael had authority to delete files ; (2) GCC suffered an injury ; \nand (3) Colangelo and Sequoia  are liable for computer trespass because they  \nconspired with John Michael.  (ECF No. 46, at pp. 12–14; ECF No. 80, at pp. 13 –17; \nECF No. 81, at pp. 2–5; ECF No. 48, at pp. 19–20; ECF No. 74, at p. 20; ECF No. 83, \nat pp. 9–10.) \n39. GCC argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on its computer \ntrespass claim because although it did not have a written policy prohibiting deletion \nof company data,  “[n]o reasonable person —much less a fiduciary —could have  \nbelieved they had the authority to erase a hard drive or 21,000 emails that contained \nbusiness information not stored elsewhere.”  (ECF No. 46, at p. 13 (emphasis in \n \n \noriginal).)  Although John Michael subsequently returned  the deleted data, GCC \nargues that there is sufficient evidence in the record to show that GCC suffered actual \ndamages resulting from the deletions.  (ECF No. 81, at p. 2.)  GCC hired a third-party \nvendor to examine and attempt to recover data from John Mi chael’s computer (GCC \n30(b)(6) Dep., ECF No. 72.19, at 299:2–302:13; ECF No. 82.1) and incurred attorneys’ \nfees in asking John Michael to return the documents he copied and deleted.  \nAdditionally, GCC asserts that  Colangelo’s text messages with John before and \nduring the process of deleting GCC’s data shows that Colangelo  and Sequoia knew \nand conspired with John Michael to commit computer trespass.  ( ECF No. 46, at pp. \n13–14.) \n40. Defendants argue that  there is a dispute of fact as to whether John \nMichael had authority when he deleted the electronic files because GCC had no \npolicies in place related to document retention or the handling of confidential \ninformation.  (ECF No. 80, at pp. 15–16.)  Defendants also argue that they are entitled \nto summary judgment bec ause GCC cannot show that it suffered an injury —“GCC \nhas been unable to articulate any damages that it suffered as a result of the brief \nperiod of time in which it did not have access to this information or identify any \nmaterials it believes have not been returned.”  (ECF No. 48, at p. 20 ; ECF No. 80, at \np. 14.)  As to Colangelo and Sequoia’s liability, Defendants assert that Colangelo and \nSequoia never used or accessed GCC’s computers or computer network and that GCC \ndoes not expressly allege in its Complaint that Colangelo and Sequoia conspir ed to \ncommit computer trespass.  (ECF No. 80, at p. 16 (citing ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 128–29).) \n \n \n41. The Court has thoroughly reviewed the evidence regarding the claim for \ncomputer trespass and finds that genuine disputes exist as to whether John Michael \nhad authority to copy and delete his GCC emails and the files on his company-issued \nlaptop and as to whether GCC suffered damages as a result of John Michael’s acts.  \nTherefore, the Court cannot grant summary judgment on the computer trespass \nclaim against John Michael. \n42. There are no allegations of direct liability for computer trespass against \nColangelo and Sequoia in the Complaint.  However, GCC alleges that Colangelo and \nSequoia were “aware of and assisted or colluded” with John Michael in the deletion \nof GCC emails and files on his GCC computer.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 117.)  GCC includes \nmany text messages and emails in the record in which  John Michael discusses with \nColangelo his plans to delete GCC emails and files from the GCC computer.  (ECF \nNo. 49.12 , at pp. 16 –43.)  The Court concludes that there are issues of fact that \npreclude summary judgment on the claim that Colangelo and Sequoia conspired with \nJohn Michael to violate N.C.G.S. § 14-458. \n43. Therefore, because genuine disputes of material fact exist, to the extent \nthe Motions seek summary judgment as to GCC’s claim for computer trespass, the \nMotions should be DENIED.  \nC. Plaintiff’s Motion \n44. GCC also seeks summary judgment as to four affirmative defenses \nraised by each of the four Defendants : statute of limitations  (SECOND \nAFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE) ; equitable doctrines of waiver , estoppel, and laches  \n \n \n(THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE) ; failure to mitigate damage s (FOURTH \nAFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE) ; and unclean hands  (FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE \nDEFENSE).  (ECF No. 46, at p. 15.) \ni. Estoppel and Unclean Hands \n45. Defendants do not respond to Plaintiff’s argument s regarding estoppel \nor unclean hands in their response brief, and have not directed the Court to any \nevidence supporting these defenses.  Therefore, the Court treats Plaintiff’s Motion as \nuncontested on th ese issues, and Plaintiff’s Motion seeking summary judgment on \nDefendants’ estoppel and unclean hands affirmative defenses should be GRANTED. \nii. Statute of Limitations \n46. With the exception of Plaintiff’s claim for computer trespass, which has \na limitations period of one year, each of Plaintiff’s claims has a limitations period of \nthree years or more.  See N.C.G.S. § 1 -539.2A(b) (adopting a one -year statute of \nlimitations period for computer trespass claims); Trillium Ridge Condo. Ass’n, Inc. v. \nTrillium Links & Vill., LLC, 236 N.C. App. 478, 501, 764 S.E.2d 203, 219 (2014) (three \nyears for breach of fiduciary duty);  Toomer v. Bank Branch & Trust Co. , 171 N.C. \nApp. 58, 67, 614 S.E.2d 328, 335 (2005) ( ten years for constructive fraud based on \nbreach of fiduciary duty);  Glynne v. Wilson Med. Ctr. , 236 N.C. App. 42, 48– 49, 762 \nS.E.2d 645, 649 (2014) ( three years for tortious interference with contract or \nprospective business relations);  Sunbelt Rentals, Inc.  v. Head & Engquist Equip., \nL.L.C., 174 N.C. App. 49, 63, 620 S.E.2d 222, 232 (2005) (citing N.C.G.S. § 66-157) \n(three years for misappropriation of trade secrets); N.C.G.S. § 75-16.2 (four years for \n \n \nunfair methods of competition); N.C.G.S. § 1-52 (three years for conversion); Carlisle \nv. Keith, 169 N.C. App. 674, 685, 614 S.E.2d 542, 549 (2005)  (three years for civil \nconspiracy); Tillery v. Tillery, No. COA15-506, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 689, at *9 (N.C. \nCt. App. July 5, 2016) (statute of limitations period f or punitive damages claim tied \nto underlying tort claim). \n47. GCC filed the Complaint on February 15, 2018.  John Michael contacted \nGoogle support on March 22, 2017 regarding erasing his GCC e-mail data, which falls \nwithin the one-year time frame for computer trespass.  Regarding GCC’s other claims, \nthe earliest acts giving rise to the claims occurred on April 24, 2015, when John \nMichael and Colangelo exchanged text messages discussing ways that John Michael \ncould “get [his] cut” and “hide ownership” in an LLC.   (ECF No. 76, at p. 1 .)  This \noccurred less than three years before GCC filed the Complaint.   Additionally, \nDefendants acknowledge in their brief in opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion that “[t]o the \nextent that GCC is not seeking damages that fall outside of the applicable statutes of \nlimitation, Defendants agree that the statute of limitations defense would not apply.”  \n(ECF No. 80, at p. 17 n.6.) \n48. Therefore, Plaintiff’s claims are not barred by any statute of limitations \nperiod, and Plaintiff’s Motion  seeking summary judgment on Defendants’ statute of \nlimitations affirmative defense should be GRANTED. \niii. Waiver \n49. “The essential elements of waiver are the existence at the time of the \nalleged waiver of a right, advantage or benefit, the knowledge, actual or constructive, \n \n \nof the existence thereof, and an intention to reli nquish such right, advantage or \nbenefit.”  Long Drive Apartments v. Parker, 107 N.C. App. 724, 729, 421 S.E.2d 631, \n633 (1992) (emphasis omitted) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  \n50. Defendants argue that  their waiver defense applies to some of the \ndamages that GCC seeks.  (ECF No. 80, at p. 22.)  In December 2017, Dominion \nexercised audit provisions in its contract with GCC and, as a result,  sought to have \ncertain amounts for water treatment work that Sequoia performed  credited back.  \nAlthough GCC disagreed with Dominion’s assessment, GCC gave Dominion a $1.3 \nmillion credit  and stated that GCC could not enforce such a credit against its \nsubcontractors.  (ECF No. 80, at p. 22; ECF No. 62.9.)  GCC now seeks to recover that \namount from Sequoia.   Defendants argue that by crediting the amount in dispute \nback to Dominion, GCC has waived its right to seek those damages from Sequoia.   \n(ECF No. 80, at p. 22.) \n51. The Court is unpersuaded by  Defendants’ argument.  There is nothing \nabout Plaintiff’s credit to Dominion that suggests it intended to relinquish all of its \nrights to seek damages from Sequoia.  Therefore, to the extent Plaintiff’s Motion seeks \nsummary judgment on Defendants’ waiver affirmative defense, Plaintiff’s Motion \nshould be GRANTED.    \niv. Laches \n52. Under North Carolina law \n[t]o establish the affirmative defense of laches, our case law \nrecognizes that 1) the doctrine applies where a delay of \ntime has resulted in some change in the condition of the \nproperty or in the relations of the parties;  2) the delay \n \n \nnecessary to constitute laches depends upon the facts and \ncircumstances of each case; however, the mere passage of \ntime is insufficient to support a finding of laches;  3) the \ndelay must be shown to be unreasonable and  must have \nworked to the disadvantage,  injury or prejudice of the \nperson seeking to invoke the doctrine of laches; and 4) the \ndefense of laches will only work as a bar when the claimant \nknew of the existence of the grounds for the claim. \n \nMMR Holdings L.L.C. v. City of Charlotte , 148 N.C. App. 208, 209– 210, 558 S.E.2d \n197, 198 (2001).   \n53. This case was brought only eleven months after John Michael resigned \nfrom GCC.  Th is Court fails to understand how GCC unreasonably delayed in \nbringing this case, and Defendants point to no evidence that shows that this eleven -\nmonth period was unreasonable or prejudiced Defendants.  Therefore, to the extent \nPlaintiff’s Motion seeks summary judgment as to Defendants’ laches affirmative \ndefense, Plaintiff’s Motion should be GRANTED. \nv. Failure to Mitigate Damages \n54. A plaintiff has a duty to mitigate its damages when it “can do so with \nreasonable exertion or at trifling expense; and ordinarily, [it] will be allowed to \nrecover from the delinquent party only such damages as [it] could n ot, with \nreasonable effort, have avoided.”  Biemann and Rowell Co. v. Donohoe Companies, \nInc., 147 N.C. App. 239, 247, 556 S.E.2d 1, 6 (2001).  \n55. GCC argues that it tried to mitigate the harm caused by Defendants by: \nhiring an outside public relations firm to reassure its long-time clients; spending over \n$600,000 on employee retention bonuses; and hiring two recruiting firms to recruit \nand replace employees lost to Sequoia.  (ECF No. 46, at pp. 22–23.)  \n \n \n56. Defendants assert that GCC failed to mitigate its damages because \nGCC: made no efforts to hire qualified employees away from its competitors; did not \nreach out to John Michael to ask for help  locating documents; and did not reallocate \nits employees to adequately staff existing jobs.  (ECF No. 80, at p. 18.) \n57. At this summary judgment stage, the Court cannot make the fact-\nintensive inquiries necessary to determine whether GCC failed to mitigate its \ndamages.  Therefore, to the extent Plaintiff’s Motion seeks summary judg ment as to \nDefendants’ affirmative defense of failure to mitigate damages, Plaintiff’s Motion \nshould be DENIED. \nD. Defendants’ Motion \n58. Defendants seek summary judgment on all  of GCC’s claims brought \nagainst them.  The Court already has decided the Motions regarding GCC’s computer \ntrespass claim and will now address GCC’s remaining claims. \ni. Aiding and Abetting Claims \n59. GCC attempts to bring causes of action for aiding and abetting  breach \nof fiduciary duty and constructive fraud against Mark, Sequoia, and Colangelo.  \nDefendants argue that these claims must be dismissed because North Carolina does \nnot recognize causes of action for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty.  (ECF \nNo. 48, at p. 19); see BDM Investments v. Lenhil, Inc. , 826 S.E.2d 746, 763 (N.C. Ct. \nApp. 2019) (“[T]he North Carolina Supreme Court has not recognized a cause of action \nfor aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, nor do we recognize it here.”).  GCC \n \n \ndoes not cite to any North Carolina authority recognizing a cause of action for aiding \nand abetting.  (ECF No. 74, at p. 14.) \n60. The Court concludes that, absent appellate authority recogniz ing a \ncause of action for aiding and abetting, the Defendants’ Motion as to GCC’s purported \nclaims for aiding and abetting should be GRANTED. \nii. Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud Against John Michael \n61. GCC brings claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud \nagainst John Michael.  GCC alleges that, “[a]s GCC’s current Secretary and as GCC’s \nDirector of Engineering and Construction through on or about April 3, 2017, John \nMichael was and is GC C’s fiduciary” and that John Michael breached his fiduciary \nduty and took advantage of his fiduciary relationship in order to benefit himself \nfinancially.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶  65–66, 87.)  There is no dispute that John Michael \nowed GCC fiduciary duties while he was an officer of GCC. \n62. GCC’s allegations of breach of fiduciary duty center around  John \nMichael’s involvement and ownership in Sequoia.   ( Id.)  GCC alleges that John \nMichael breached his fiduciary duty to GCC by, among other things: \na. Founding Sequoia in September 2015 without \ndisclosing his participation in Sequoia to GCC;  \n \nb. Usurping corporate opportunities by directing potential \nGCC employees to Sequoia for employment without \ndisclosing those potential employees’ availability to \nGCC;\n \n \nc. Usurping corporate opportunities by directing potential \nGCC projects to Sequoia without disclosing those \npotential projects to GCC;\n \n \n \n \nd. Entering into subcontracts with Sequoia on GCC’s \nbehalf without disclosing his participation in Sequoia’s \nfounding or his status as a founder, member or manager \nof Sequoia;\n \n \ne. Denigrating GCC’s management to Dominion and other \ncurrent or potential GCC clients before resigning his \nposition as GCC’s Director of Engineering and \nConstruction;\n \n \nf. Recruiting key GCC employees to join Sequoia; \n \ng. Misappropriating GCC’s Business Relationships and \nExpectancies and Trade Secrets before resigning his \nposition as GCC’s Director of Engineering and \nConstruction;\n \n \nh. Actively concealing his position as a founder, manager \nand member of Sequoia while entering i nto a \nsubcontract with Sequoia on GCC’s behalf; [and]\n \n \ni. Attempting to expand Sequoia’s relationship with \nDominion and other GCC clients while criticizing GCC \nand its current management to those GCC clients before \nresigning his position as GCC’s Director of Engineering \nand Construction[.]\n \n \n(Id. at ¶¶ 66, 87.) \n63. In order to establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, plaintiff must \nshow that: (1) defendant owed plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) defendant breached his \nor her fiduciary duty; and (3) the breach o f fiduciary duty was a proximate cause of \ninjury to plaintiff.  Farndale Co., LLC v. Gibellini, 176 N.C. App. 60, 68, 628 S.E.2d \n15, 20 (2006).  “To establish constructive fraud, a plaintiff must show that defendant \n(1) owes plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) breached this fiduciary duty; and (3) sought to \nbenefit himself in the transaction.”  Crumley & Assocs ., P.C. v. Charles Peed & \nAssocs., P.A., 219 N.C. App. 615, 620, 730 S.E.2d 763, 767 (2012).  “Claims for breach \n \n \nof fiduciary duty and constructive fraud both require proof of an injury proximately \ncaused by the breach of duty.”  BDM Investments v. Lenhil, Inc., 2014 NCBC LEXIS \n6, at *29–30 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 20, 2014)  (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted); Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 141, 749 S.E.2d 262, 268 (2013) (“The first \nissue before us is whether there was sufficient evidence, as a matter of law, that \n[defendant] breached a fiduciary duty owed to plaintiffs, proximately causing injury \nto them.”); Estate of Smith by & Through Smith v . Underwood, 127 N.C. App. 1, 10, \n487 S.E.2d 807, 813 (1997)  (“The elements of a constructive fraud claim are proof of \ncircumstances, (1) which created the relation of trust and confidence, and (2) led up \nto and surrounded the consummation of the transaction in which defendant is alleged \nto have taken advantage of his position of trust  to the hurt of plaintiff .”) (emphasis \nadded) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n64. Defendants argue that John Michael did not breach his fiduciary duties \nto GCC because Colangelo was, and is, the 100% owner of Sequoia, and John Michael \nwas not, and is not, an owner of Sequoia.  (ECF No. 48 , at p. 15.)   Additionally, \nDefendants argue that John Michael did not usurp any corporate opportunities from \nGCC by hiring Sequoia as a subcontractor prior to his resignation because GCC was \nunable to perform water treatment work and GCC was aware of (and approved of) \nSequoia performing the water treatment work and Colangelo being  associated with \nSequoia.  ( Id. at pp. 16–17.)  Defendants also assert that John Michael’s successful \nattempt at obtaining a bid for GCC worth approximately $50 million close to the date \n \n \nof his resignation shows that John Michael did not breach his fiduciary duties to GCC.  \n(Id.)   \n65. As to the constructive fraud claim, Defendants argue that this claim \nmust also fail because there is no evidence that John Michael personally benefitted \nfrom any work Sequoia performed prior to his resignation from GCC.  (Id. at p. 18.) \n66. GCC contends that John Michael is not entitled to summary judgment \non either the breach of fiduciary duty or constructive fraud claim because there is a \ngenuine dispute as to Sequoia’s ownership.  (ECF No. 7 4, at p. 11.)   Furthermore, \nJohn Michael sent GCC ’s allegedly confidential docum ents and information to \nColangelo with Sequoia while he was working at GCC.  ( See ECF No. 79, at pp. 3–7, \n11–16, 51.) \n67. The Court agrees with GCC .  At a minimum,  there is contradictory \nevidence in the record,  creating a fact dispute,  as to whether John Micha el has any \nownership interest in Sequoia.  Although John Michael appears to have successfully \nworked to obtain a bid that benefitted GCC just a few months prior to resignation, \nthere is also substantial evidence that John Michael sent GCC documents to \nColangelo while still employed with GCC, including T&M Rates and a work plan for \na job in Asheville.  It is also unclear when John Michael’s fiduciary duties to GCC \nstopped, as there is a question whether  John Michael resigned  as GCC’s Secretary \nthe day that he resigned as Director of Engineering and Construction.   As such, the \nCourt cannot dismiss the breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud claim s \nagainst John Michael at this stage.  \n \n \n68. Therefore, to the extent Defendants’ Motion seeks summary judgment \non Plaintiff’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud against John \nMichael, Defendants’ Motion should be DENIED.  \niii. Breach of Fiduciary Duty Against Mark \n69. GCC also alleges a breach of fiduciary duty claim against Mark, stating \nthat “Mark was and is GCC’s fiduciary”  in his role as  GCC’s Vice President of \nOperations.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 72–73.)  GCC alleges that Mark breached his fiduciary \nduty to GCC by, among other things: \na. Supporting and assisting John Michael in founding  \nSequoia in September 2015  without disclosing to GCC \nJohn Michael ’s participation in founding Sequoia, or \nMark’s assistance to John Michael in doing so; \n \nb. Supporting and assisting John Michael in usurping \ncorporate opportunities by direct ing potential GCC \nemployees to Sequoia for employment without \ndisclosing those potential employees ’ availability to \nGCC; \n \nc. Supporting and assisting John Michael in usurping \ncorporate opportunities by directing potential GCC \nprojects to Sequoia without disclosing those potential \nprojects to GCC; \n \nd. Supporting and assisting John Michael in entering into \nsubcontracts with Sequoia on GCC ’s behalf without \ndisclosing John Michael ’s participation in Sequoia ’s \nfounding or John Michael’s status as a founder, member \nor manager of Sequoia; \n \ne. Supporting and assisting John Michael in denigrating \nGCC’s management to Dominion and other current or \npotential GCC clients before John Michael resigned his \nposition as GCC ’s Director of Engineering and \nConstruction; \n \n \n \nf. Recruiting key GCC employees to join Sequoia; \n \ng. Supporting and assisting John Michael in \nmisappropriating GCC ’s Business Relationships and \nExpectancies and Trade Secrets before John Michael \nresigned his position as GCC’s Director of Engineering \nand Construction; \n \nh. Supporting John  Michael in actively concealing his \nposition as a founder, manager and member of Sequoia \nwhile John Michael entered into a subcontract with \nSequoia on GCC’s behalf; [and] \n \ni. Supporting and assisting John Michael in attempting to \nexpand Sequoia’s relationship with Dominion and other \nGCC clients while criticizing GCC and its current \nmanagement to those GCC clients before John Michael \nresigned his position as GCC’s Director of Engineering \nand Construction[.] \n \n(Id. at ¶ 74.) \n \n70. However, the only eviden ce that GCC identifies in support of its claim \nfor breach of fiduciary duty against Mark are (a) text messages sent by John Michael \nto Colangelo claiming that John Michael discussed his plan to join Sequoia with Mark \nand containing statements allegedly made by Mark that he “wants to make the stand” \nand “just doesn’t want to leave the same time as [John Michael], ” and (b) Mark’s \nstatement to J.M. that he would be “surprised” at how many GCC employees John \nMichael and Mark could “take” if they left GCC.  (ECF No. 74, at p. 12; ECF No. 49.12, \nat pp. 13–14; ECF No. 76, at pp. 70, 158 .)  Defendants argue this evidence does not \ncreate an issue of fact as to whether Mark breached his fiduciary duties to GCC.  (ECF \nNo. 48, at p. 18; ECF No. 83, at p. 4.) \n \n \n71. The Court agrees with Defendants.  The evidence that GCC relies on to \nshow that Mark breached his fiduciary duties to GCC consist s of hearsay from John \nMichael, and Mark’s prediction that GCC employees would resign if he and John \nMichael left the company .  This is wholly insufficient to create an issue of material \nfact that Mark breached fiduciary duties to GCC .  Therefore, to the extent \nDefendants’ Motion seeks summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty against Mark, Defendants’ Motion should be GRANTED.  \niv. Tortious Interference with C ontract and P rospective Economic \nAdvantage \n \n72. GCC styles its Sixth Claim as a claim for “tortious interference with \ncontract and business relations .”  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ ¶ 95–99.)  GCC claims that \nDefendants interfered both with at-will employment contracts between GCC and its \nemployees and interfered with its continuing relationships with Duke and Dominion, \nand more particularly with GCC’s attempts to obtain the Yorktown, Greenville, and \nPossum Point projects. \na. Tortious Interference with Contract \n73. To establish a claim for tortious interference with contract , a claimant \nmust allege: \n(1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third person \nwhich confers upon the plaintiff a contractual right against \na third person; (2) the defendant knows of the contract; (3) \nthe defendant intentionally induces the third person not to \nperform the contract; (4) and in doing so acts without \njustification; (5) resulting in actual damage to plaintiff. \n \nUnited Labs., Inc. v. Kuykendall, 322 N.C. 643, 661, 370 S.E.2d 375, 387 (1988). \n \n \n \n74. Interference with a contract is “justified if it is motivated by a legitimate \nbusiness purpose, as when the plaintiff and the defendant, an outsider, are \ncompetitors.”  Embree Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., 330 N.C. 487, 498, 411 S.E.2d \n916, 924 (1992).  A defendant’s actions are not justified “[i]f the defendant ’s only \nmotive is a malicious wish to injure the plaintiff.”  Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Hooks, \n322 N.C. 216, 221, 367 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1988) (emphasis added). \n75. The malice required to overcome a justification of business competition \nis legal malice, and not actual malice.  Childress v. Abeles, 240 N.C. 667, 675, 84 \nS.E.2d 176, 182 (1954) (“It is not necessary, however, to allege and prove actual malice \nin the sense of personal hatred, ill will , or spite in order to make out a case for the \nrecovery of compensatory damages against the outsider for tortiously inducing the \nbreach of the third person’s contract with the plaintiff.  The term ‘malice’ is used in \nthis connection in its legal sense, and denotes the intentional doing of the harmful \nact without legal justification.”).  Legal malice “means intentionally doing a wrongful \nact or exceeding one’ s legal right or authority in order to prevent the making of a \ncontract between two parties” and the act “must be taken with the design of injuring \none of the parties to the contract or of gaining some advantage  at the expense of a \nparty.”  Murphy v. McIntyre, 69 N.C. App. 323, 328–29, 317 S.E.2d 397, 401 (1984). \n76. If an individual has a sufficien t lawful reason for inducing the breach, \nsuch as in the interest of competition, he or she is exempt from liability, regardless of \nhis or her actual malice.   Robinson, Bradshaw, & Hinson, P.A. v. Smith , 129 N.C. \nApp. 305, 318 , 498 S.E.2d 841, 851  (1998).  “ Even if plaintiff shows that defendant \n \n \nacted with ill intentions, legal malice does not exist unless plaintiff can show that \ndefendant had no legitimate business justification for the interference. ”  Griffin v. \nHolden, 180 N.C. App. 129, 140, 636 S.E.2d 298, 306 (2006);  RCJJ, LLC v. RCWIL \nEnters., LLC, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 46, at *38 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 20, 2016). \n77. Defendants argue that GCC “ fails to show that Sequoia had no \n‘legitimate business interest’ in hiring former GCC employees—none of whom had \nnon-competition agreements and nearly all of whom provided GCC with weeks of \nadvance notice that they would be leaving.”  (ECF No. 48, at p. 14.) \n78. GCC’s only response to Defendants’ argument is that “[q] uestions of \nmaterial fact also remain whether Defendants also tortiously interfered with GCC’s \nat-will employment contracts .”  (ECF No. 74, at p. 15.)  GCC does not cite to any \nspecific evidence supporting its claim.  GCC does not argue that Sequoia had no \nlegitimate business reason for hiring GCC’s employees.  To the contrary, GCC claims \nthat Sequoia was a competitor.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 3.) \n79. Plaintiff has not created a genuine issue of fact that Defendants lacked \njustification and did not act for legitimate business purposes in hiring GCC’s \nemployees.  Therefore, to the extent Defendants’ Motion seeks summary judgment in \ntheir favor on Plaintiff’s claim for tortious interference with contract  for interfering \nwith GCC’s at -will employment contracts with its  employees, Defendants’ Motion \nshould be GRANTED.  \n \n \n \n \nb. Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage \n80. GCC claims that after John Michael left GCC, Defendants wrongfully \ninterfered with prospective contracts put out for bid by Dominion on the Yorktown, \nGreenville, and Possum Point projects.  Sequoia underbid GCC on each of these \nprojects and the projects were awarded to Sequoia. \n81. “An action for tortious  interference with prospective  economic \nadvantage is based on conduct by the defendants which prevents the plaintiffs from \nentering into a contract with a third party.”  Walker v. Sloan, 137 N.C. App. 387, 392–\n93, 529 S.E.2d 236, 241 (2000) (citing Owens v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., 330 N.C. 666, \n680, 412 S.E.2d 636, 644 (1992)).   A claim for tortious interference with prospective \neconomic advantage requires a plaintiff to show that the defendant “interfere[d] with \na business relationship ‘by maliciously inducing a person not to enter into a contract \nwith [the plaintiff], which he [or she] would have entered into but for the interference, \n. . . if damage proximately ensues, when this interference is done not in the legitimate \nexercise of the interfering person ’s rights.’”  Beverage Sys. of  the Carolinas, LLC v. \nAssociated Bev. Repair, LLC , 368 N.C. 693, 701, 784 S.E.2d 457, 463 \n(2016) (quoting Spartan Equip. Co. v. Air Placement Equip. Co. , 263 N.C. 549, 559, \n140 S.E.2d 3, 11 (1965)).   “Stating a claim for tortious  interference with prospective \neconomic advantage requires that the plaintiff allege facts [  ] show[ing] that the \ndefendants acted without justification in inducing a third party to refrain from \nentering into a contract with them[,] which contract would have ensued but for the \n \n \ninterference.”  Cheryl Lloyd Humphrey Land Inv. Co., LLC v. Resco Prods. , 831 \nS.E.2d 395, 403 (2019) (quotation marks omitted). \n82. Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment because \nGCC has not produced any evidence that “but for” Sequoia’s alleg ed interference, \nGCC would have been awarded the contracts for the Yorktown, Greenville, and \nPossum Point projects .  (ECF No. 48, at pp. 12 –14; ECF No. 83, at pp. 4– 6.)  \nAdditionally, Defendants assert that “ Sequoia clearly had a legitimate business \npurpose in submitting bids for work . . . as this is the primary way business is \nobtained in the industry.”  (ECF No. 83, at p. 6.)  \n83. GCC argues that reasonable inferences can be drawn from the record, \nincluding John Michae l’s communications with Colangelo, that “Defendants \nmaliciously induced Dominion not to contract with GCC, and that, but for this \ninducement, this customer would have remained with GCC for new or additional \nwork.”  (ECF No. 7 4, at p. 15.)   However, GCC off ers no evidence that “but for” \nSequoia’s bids, GCC would have been awarded the Yorktown, Greenville, and Possum \nPoint projects.  In fact, GCC has offered no evidence regarding whether entities other \nthan GCC and Sequoia bid on the projects, and no evidence that GCC was the next \nlowest bidder to Sequoia.  The lack of such “but for” evidence is fatal to GCC’s claim \nfor tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.  Beverage Sys. of the \nCarolinas, LLC, 368 N.C. at  701, 784 S.E.2d at 463 (In order to survive summary \njudgment on a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic relations, “a \n \n \nplaintiff must produce evidence that a contract would have resulted but for a \ndefendant’s malicious intervention.”). \n84. In addition, GCC’s claim fails bec ause the undisputed evidence \nestablishes that Sequoia was a “ competitor” with GCC for the type of work involved \nin the Yorktown, Greenville, and Possum Point projects.  At the time of the bidding \non the three projects, Sequoia was an established business entity performing \ndewatering and other work  for Dominion, and had a legitimate business interest in \nacquiring additional work of that nature.  GCC has not produced evidence that \nSequoia lacked a justification for bidding on the Yorktown, Greenville, and Possum \nPoint projects.  Hooks, 322 N.C. at 221, 367 S.E.2d at 650 (“If the defendant ’s only \nmotive is a malicious wish to injure the plaintiff, his actions are not justified.” ); see \nalso Area Landscaping, L.L.C. v. Glaxo-Wellcome, Inc., 160 N.C. App. 520, 523, 586 \nS.E.2d 507, 510 (2003) (“In order to demonstrate the element of acting without \njustification, the action must indicate no motive for interference other than malice.”) \n(quotation marks omitted); Griffin, 180 N.C. App. at 140, 636 S.E.2d at 306 (“Even if \nplaintiff shows that defendant acted with ill intentions, legal malice does not exist \nunless plaintiff can show that defendant had no legitimate business justification for \nthe interference.”). \n85. Therefore, to the extent D efendants’ Motion seeks summary judgment \nin their favor on Plaintiff’s claim for tortious interference with prospective economic \nadvantage, Defendants’ Motion should be GRANTED.  \n \n \n \nv. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets \n86. In the Complaint, GCC alleges that John Michael, Colangelo, and \nSequoia misappropriated GCC’s trade secrets while John Michael was still employed \nby GCC and used the trade secrets : “in founding Sequoia as a business” ; “to poach \nkey GCC employees” ; “to begi n purchasing equipment and bidding on jobs for \nSequoia”; “to begin conversations with GCC clients about securing jobs for Sequoia in \ncompetition with GCC”;  and “to undermine GCC’s standing with GCC’s long -term \ncustomers.”  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 103.)  Specifica lly, GCC claims that John Michael, \nColangelo, and Sequoia “acquired, disclosed or used [GCC’s] Trade Secrets without \nGCC’s express or implied consent.”  (Id. at ¶ 104.)   \n87. Under the N orth Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act , \n“misappropriation” is defined as the “acquisition, disclosure, or use of a trade secret \nof another without express or implied authority or consent, unless such trade secret \nwas arrived at by independent development, reverse engineering, or was obtained \nfrom another person with a right to disclose the trade secret.”  N.C. G.S. § 66-152(1).  \nIn order to evaluate a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets, the Court must \nfirst consider whether the alleged information constitutes a trade secret.  A “trade \nsecret” is defined as  \nbusiness or technical information, including but not limited \nto a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of \ninformation, method, technique, or process that:  \n \na. Derives independent actual or potential commercial \nvalue from not being generally known or readily \nascertainable through independent development or \n \n \nreverse engineering by persons who can obtain \neconomic value from its disclosure or use; and  \n \nb. Is the subjec t of efforts that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 66.152(3). \n88. “Trade secret protection is generally precluded for information that is \nwidely available or generally known in the relevant industry.”  RoundPoint Mort g. \nCo. v. Florez, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 18, 2016).  Public \ninformation such as client names, customer contact information, or published prices \nfor products is usually not considered a trade secret.  See Safety Test & Equip. Co. v. \nAm. Safety Util. Corp., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *26 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 23, 2015).  \nHowever, “in some instances, a trade secret can be found if the information or process \nhas particular value as a compilation or manipulation of information, even if the \nunderlying information is otherwise publicly available.”  RoundPoint , 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 18, at *32.  GCC asserts that it is the “‘ compilation of business’ information” \nthat constitutes its protectable trade secrets.  (ECF No. 7 4, at p. 16.)  Specifically, \nGCC alleges that the trade secrets misappropriated in this case consist of: \nthe names, contacts, addresses and phone numbers of \nGCC’s employees, customers and vendors; the equipment \nand project needs of GCC’s customers; GCC’s costs, \nbidding, and pricing strategies; GCC’s marketing practices \nand materials; GCC’s hiring and allocation of human \nresources; employee compensation; specific project billing \ndata; equipment and personnel T&M rates; profit and loss \ndata and other financial information; GCC’s bond capacity, \ninsurance and workers compensation coverage; company \nsoftware information; and other confidential business \ninformation. \n \n \n \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶ 16.) \n89. Defendants assert that they are entitled to summary judgment for the \nfollowing reasons: GCC’s information is not entitled to protection as a trade secret ; \nGCC took no reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy of the information ; and \nDefendants did not misappropriate the information.  (ECF No. 48, at pp. 10–12.)  The \nCourt will address these arguments in turn.    \n90. Defendants argue that the identified information does not qualify as a \ntrade secret because: (1) certain of GCC’s employees, when deposed, could not identify \nany trade secret; and (2) the information  would not “be of any commercial value to  \nany competitor”—“in the construction business, every job is unique, every company \nhas its own equipment and labor rates, and every company prices a job ‘the way [it] \nsee[s] it.’”  (ECF No. 48, at p. 11 (quoting Ed Martin Dep., ECF No. 50 at  Ex. 7, \n295:12–23).)     \n91. The Court is not persuaded by Defendants’ argument s.  First, the fact \nthat certain company representatives of GCC could not name their “trade secrets” \nwhen asked at deposition is not dispositive.  Many non- lawyers may not know the \nlegal definition of a trade secret. \n92.  In addition, while customer information by itself may  not constitute a \ntrade secret, the compilation of information that GCC includes in a work plan or bid \nproposal could qualify.  Bldg. Ctr., Inc. v. Carter Lumber of the North, Inc., 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 85, at *19 –20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 17, 2017) (“Although  customer \nlists, when compiled with pricing and bidding formulas, can som etimes qualify as a \n \n \ntrade secret under the [North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act], the Court does \nnot consider a customer list containing only information that is easily accessible \nthrough a telephone book or other readily available sources to be a trade secret.”); \nSunbelt Rentals, Inc. , 174 N.C. App. at 56, 620 S.E.2d at 228 (holding “customer \ninformation (identity, contacts and requirements of its rental customers)” constituted \ntrade secrets).  At this stage, there is enough evidence to create a contested issue as \nto whether the information identified by GCC constitutes a trade secret.  \n93. Defendants also contend that GCC did not take “any steps, let alone \nreasonable steps, to maintain the secrecy of such information.”  (ECF No. 48, at p . \n11.)  With regard to GCC’s efforts to maintain the secrecy of its trade secrets, it is \nundisputed that GCC does not have confidentiality agreements with employees, or \nany policies regarding confidential information.  (Catherine Glover Frazier Dep., ECF \nNo. 68.3, at 36:8– 20, 290:10 –17.)  However, the computers that GCC provided to \nmanagement and supervisory personnel were password protected.  (Catherine Glover \nFrazier Dep., ECF No. 50 at Ex. 14, 157:8–160:21.)  Additionally, only those involved \nin preparing estimates or billing had access to GCC’s  alleged trade secrets, such as \nthe T&M Rates.  (Id.)  Thus, there is enough evidence to also create a disputed issue \nas to whether GCC took reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy of its trade secrets.  \n94. Finally, GCC has produced evidence that creates a disputed issue of \nmaterial fact about whether John Michael, Colangelo, and Sequoia misappropriat ed \nGCC’s trade secrets, including  emails and text messages from John Micha el to \nColangelo in which he shares GCC’s T&M Rates (ECF No. 79, at pp. 3–7, 11–15), \n \n \nequipment rates ( Id. at p. 51), and a GCC work plan for a construction project in \nAsheville (Id. at pp. 15–16).  This is sufficient evidence of misappropriation to allow \nthis claim to go forward.  \n95. Therefore, t o the extent Defendants’ Motion seeks judgment in their \nfavor on GCC’s claim for misappropriation of trade secrets , Defendants’ Motion \nshould be DENIED. \nvi. Unfair Methods of Competition \n96. GCC alleges that Defendants violated  the North Carolina Unfair and \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1, by, among other things: \na. Promoting dissatisfaction and distrust of GCC and its \ncurrent management among GCC ’s present and potential \nclients; \n \nb. Fomenting dissatisfaction and distrust of GCC and its \ncurrent management among GCC ’s key employees and \nother employees; \n \nc. Destroying, and encouraging other GCC employees to \ndestroy, information on GCC- owned smartphones and \ncomputers before returning those devices to the [c]ompany \nupon their departure, thereby concealing Defendants ’ \nunlawful and malicious acts from GCC and hampering \nGCC’s ability to discover those acts and to seek to remedy \nthe false and negative information concerning  GCC being \ncirculated by Defendants and by others at their direction \nor encouragement; \n \nd. Spreading rumors about GCC among GCC ’s clients and \npotential clients in an effort to  create disquiet and \ninsecurity among those clients and thus to encourage those \nclients not to retain GCC on their projects or to hire them \nfor new projects; \n \ne. Spreading rumors about GCC among GCC ’s employees in \nan effort to create disquiet and insecurity a mong those \n \n \nemployees and thus to encourage those employees to leave \ntheir employment with GCC and to go to work with \nSequoia; \n \nf. Seeking to entice away GCC ’s key employees in order to \ndamage or eliminate GCC ’s ability to carry on operations \nand adequately st aff its projects so as to damage GCC ’s \nability to compete, particularly in the key area of coal ash \nremoval and pond development and management; \n \ng. Acquiring and using GCC ’s Business Relationship and \nExpectancies and GCC’s Trade Secrets to their advantage \nand to GCC’s detriment; [and] \n \nh. Surreptitiously and intentionally using GCC employees to \nsolicit other GCC key employees while both the soliciting \nand the solicited employees were still employed by GCC[.] \n \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶ 110.)  \n \n97. Section 75-1.1 declares unlawful any “[u]nfair methods of competition in \nor affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting \ncommerce.”  To state a claim under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1, a plaintiff must allege that “(1) \nthe defendants committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice, or an unfair method \nof competition, (2) in or affecting commerce, (3) which proximately caused actual \ninjury to the plaintiff[  ] or to the [ plaintiff’s] business.”  Birtha v. Stonemor, N.C., \nLLC, 220 N.C. App. 286, 298, 727 S.E.2d 1, 10 (2012).   “A practice is unfair when it \noffends established public policy as well as when the practice is immoral, unethical, \noppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers, and a practice is \ndeceptive if it has the capacity or tendency to deceive.”  Bumpers v. Cmty. Bank of N. \nVa., 367 N.C. 81, 91, 747 S.E.2d 220, 228 (2013)  (quotation marks omitted); see also \nAce Chem. Corp. v. DSI Transps., 115 N.C. App. 237, 247, 446 S.E.2d 100, 106 (1994) \n \n \n(“An act or practice is deceptive if it has the capacity or tendency to deceive.” ) \n(quotation marks omitted).  Unfair competition eludes a precise definition, and \nwhether an act or practice is unfair or deceptive is ultimately a question of law for \nthe Court.  Songwooyarn Trading Co. v. Sox Eleven, Inc. , 213 N.C. App. 49, 56, 714 \nS.E.2d 162, 167 (2011).   \n98. The evidence GCC relies on to support its unfair methods of competition \nclaim mirrors the evidence it relies on in  support of its misappropriation of trade \nsecrets and breach of fiduciary duty against John Michael  claims.  North Carolina \ncase law has held that breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of trade secrets \nmay form the basis of an unfair methods of competition claim.  See Compton v. Kirby, \n157 N.C. App. 1, 20, 577 S.E.2d 905, 917 (2003); Drouillard v. Keister Williams \nNewspaper Services, Inc., 108 N.C. App. 169, 172, 423 S.E.2d 324, 326 (1992).  Having \nalready determined that Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on these \nclaims, GCC’s claim for unfair methods of competition should also be allowed to go \nforward. \n99. Accordingly, to the extent Defendants’ Motion seeks summary judgment \non Plaintiff’s claim for unfair methods of competition, Defendants’  Motion should be \nDENIED. \nvii. Conversion \n100. GCC repackages its computer trespass claim as a claim for conversion.  \nGCC alleges that John Michael “destroyed the contents of the [GCC -owned] laptop,” \n“made unauthorized electronic copies of computer data residing  \n \n \nin . . . the GCC laptop prior to his destruction of that data,” and “has not returned the \ndata he copied to GCC.”  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 125.)   \n101. Under North Carolina law, conversion is the “unauthorized assumption \nand exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to \nanother, to the alteration of their condition or the exclusion of an owner’s rights.”   \nVariety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs., LLC , 365 N.C. 520, 523, \n723 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2012) (citation omitted).  There are two elements in a claim fo r \nconversion: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership and (2) the defendant’s wrongful possession.  \nId.   \n102. “The essence of conversion is not the acquisition of property by the \nwrongdoer, but a wrongful deprivation of it to the owner.”   Bartlett Milling Co., L.P. \nv. Walnut Grove Auction & Realty Co. , 192 N.C. App. 74, 86, 665 S.E.2d 478, 488 \n(2008) (citation omitted) .  “[R]etention  by a wrongdoer of an electronic copy in a \nmanner that does not deprive the original owner of access to the same electronic data \ncannot constitute conversion under current North Carolina law. ”  Duo -Fast \nCarolinas, Inc. v. Scott’s Hill Hardware & Supply Co. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 2, at *36 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 2, 2018); see also New Friendship Used Clothing Collection, LLC \nv. Katz, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *38– 39 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017) (“[M]erely \nmaking a copy of, as opposed to deleting, electronically stored information does not \nsupport a conversion claim because the owner is not deprived of possession or use of \nthe information.”). \n \n \n103. Defendants do not dispute that John Michael deleted the data from the \nGCC laptop’s hard drive or that he deleted his GCC email.  Instead, Defendants argue \nthat GCC was not deprived of its possession or use of the data because GCC was able \nto recover the emails that John Michael deleted  within five days, and John Michael \naffirmed that, following GCC’s initiation of the lawsuit, he  returned to GCC all the \ncomputer files he deleted.  (ECF No. 49.26; Catherine Glover Frazier Dep., ECF No. \n68.3, at 291:5–292:5; John Michael Aff., ECF No. 68.2, at ¶¶ 12–16.)  \n104. The uncontested evidence shows that Defendants deprived GCC of \naccess to its emails and computer files —at least temporarily.  John Michael did not \njust make an electronic copy of his GCC emails and the data from his GCC laptop, \nbut he deleted every email from his GCC account and all files, including the operating \nsystem, from his company-owned laptop.  Whether GCC suffered any actual damages \nas a result of being deprived of the data is an issue for trial. \n105. Therefore, to the extent Defendants’ Motion seeks summary judgment \nin their favor on GCC’s claim for conversion, Defendants’ Motion should be DENIED. \nviii. Civil Conspiracy and Punitive Damages \n106. With regard to GCC’s causes of action for civil conspiracy and punitive \ndamages, Defendants only argue that these claims fail because the “underlying tort \nclaims under which these claims arise fail.”  (ECF No. 48, at p. 21.)  The Court already \nhas concluded that GCC has produced evidence that could support claims for breach \nof fiduciary duty and misappropriation of trade secrets .  See N.C.G.S. § 66 -154(c) \n(Punitive damages can be awarded for misappropriation of trade secrets if “willful \n \n \nand malicious misappropriation exists.”).  To the extent  Defendants’ Motion seeks \njudgment in their favor on GCC’s claims for civil conspiracy and punitive damages, \nDefendants’ Motion should be DENIED. \nV. CONCLUSION \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: \n1. To the extent the Motions seek summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s \ncomputer trespass claim, the Motions are DENIED. \n2. To the extent Plaintiff’s Motion seeks summary judgment as to Defendants’ \naffirmative defenses for estoppel, unclean hands, statute of limitations, \nwaiver, and laches, Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED. \n3.
