  "raw_text": "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n22 CVS 13767 \n \nCAROLINA MEDICAL PARTNERS, \nPLLC; NIMISH PATEL; and \nSHEPHALI PATEL, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nAMIT G. SHAH and PALMETTO \nMEDICAL GROUP, PLLC, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANTS’ PARTIAL  \nMOTION TO DISMISS  \n \n \n1. Nimish Patel and Shephali Patel  are physicians.  For many years, they \npracticed together with Amit Shah, also a physician.  But no more: mutual distrust \nbetween the two sides led to a mutual decision  to divide their practice and end their \nprofessional relationship.  It has been a messy divorce.  Only w ith the help of a \nmediator were the parties able to agree on the terms of separation.  Now, the Patels \nhave brought this lawsuit, claiming that they have lived up to their end of the bargain \nbut that Shah hasn’t.   \n2. Shah and his fellow defendant, Palmetto Medical Group, PLLC, have moved \nto dismiss one of the six claims asserted against them .  (ECF No. 22.)  For the \nfollowing reasons, the Court GRANTS the motion. \nMoore & Van Allen PLLC, by Christopher D. Tomlinson, Caroline F. \nSavini, and Sarah H. Negus, for Plaintiffs Carolina Medical Partners, \nPLLC, Nimish Patel, and Shephali Patel.  \nK&L Gates LLP, by Marla T. Reschly and Daniel D. McClurg, for \nDefendants Amit G. Shah and Palmetto Medical Group, PLLC.  \nConrad, Judge. \nCarolina Med. Partners, PLLC v. Shah, 2023 NCBC 6.  \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion to dismiss.  The \nfollowing background assumes that the allegations of the verified complaint are true.   \n4. Before their falling out, Shah and the Patels were joint owners of more than \nhalf a dozen businesses.  Chief among them was Palmetto Medical Group, an adult \nand senior primary care practice based in South Carolina.  (See V. Compl. ¶¶ 15, 18, \nECF No. 3.) \n5. By the middle of  2021, the relationship between Shah and  the Patels had \nsoured, with each side leveling accusations of misconduct against the other.  So they \nagreed to mediate their disputes and go their separate ways.  The mediation did not \nproduce a full and final settlement  of every dispute .  It did, however, produce a \nframework for dividing  the parties’ many business interests, which t hey \nmemorialized in a Practice Separation Agreement.  ( See V. Compl. ¶  20 & Ex. A \n[“PSA”].)  \n6. There is no need to go over every term of the agreement.  Just a  few are \nrelevant.  To start, Shah agreed to buy the Patels’ interest in Palmetto Medical Group \nfollowing an appr aisal.  Th us, one practice became two.  Shah  stayed at Palmetto \nMedical Group as  its sole owner.  The Patels left and  opened a new, competing \npractice called Carolina Medical Partners, PLLC.  (See V. Compl. ¶ 22; PSA § 1(b).)  \n7. Next, the parties agreed to notify patients that the Patels were forming their \nown practice and to give them  the option to stay at Palmetto Medical Group or to \nfollow the Patels to Carolina Medical Partners.  Patient choice was to be paramount.  \nBoth sides promised “to ensure that a patient’s choice of primary care provider is \nhonored” and not to  “unduly influence any patient .”  Confused patients who called \nPalmetto Medical Group asking for the Patels, for example, were supposed to be given \ncontact information for Carolina Medical Partners.  (V. Compl. ¶ 23; PSA § 6.)  \n8. Anticipating disagreements , the parties adopted dispute resolution \nprocedures.  They also added a choice-of-law clause, which states that the agreement \n“shall be construed and governed in accordance with” North Carolina law.  (V. Compl. \n¶¶ 34, 51, 53; PSA § 12.) \n9. As alleged, Shah breached the agreement almost immediately.  Among other \nthings, Shah lobbied patients to stay with Palmetto Medical Group , made sure that \nsome patients did not get the notice about the Patels’ new practice, and changed the \nscheduling process “so that the Patels’ patients were seen by other providers .”  \nPalmetto Medical Group continued to list  the Patels on its website as available \nphysicians well after their departure.   It also continued to sen d appointment \nreminders and scheduling requests to the Patels’ patients, some of whom showed up, \nasked for the Patels , and were instead seen by  another practitioner.  And w hen \npatients chose to go to Carolina Medical Partners, Shah and Palmetto Medical Group \nrefused to transfer their medical records.  (See V. Compl. ¶¶ 24, 97, 112, 113.) \n10. The Patels and Carolina Medical Partners brought this suit against Shah \nand Palmetto Medical Group “ to enforce” the Practice Separation Agreement.  For \nsimplicity, the Court will refer to the plaintiffs as the Patels and the defendants as \nShah.  There are four claims for breach of the agreement, including the provisions on \npatient notification and transition.  There is a fifth claim for fraud.  Last,  there is a \nsixth claim labeled “Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices ,” which is based on th e \nalleged “acts intended to lure the Patels’ patients to” Palmetto Medical Group.  (See, \ne.g., V. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 10, 91, 97, 112–14.) \n11. Shah has moved to dismiss the sixth claim but no others.  The motion is fully \nbriefed, and on 5 January 2023, the Court held a hearing at which all parties were \nrepresented by counsel.  The motion is ripe.  \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n12. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim “tests the legal sufficiency of \nthe complaint.”  Isenhour v. Hutto , 350 N.C. 601, 604 (1999) (citation and quotation \nmarks omitted).  Dismissal is proper when “(1) the complaint on its face reveals that \nno law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence \nof facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3)  the complaint discloses some fact that \nnecessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. \n605, 615 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted).   In deciding the motion, the \nCourt must treat the well -pleaded allegations of the complaint as true and view the \nfacts and permissible inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  \nSee, e.g., Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc. , 372 N.C. 326, 332 (2019) .  The Court \nmay also consider documents, such as contracts, that are the subject of the complaint.  \nSee, e.g., Oberlin Cap., L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60 (2001).   \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n13. The claim for “Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices” is a bit enigmatic.  On \nits face, it appears to be grounded in statute rather than the common law.  But it does \nnot name any statute, act, or jurisdiction as the source of the cause of action. \n14. Shah reads the claim  as one under N.C.G.S. §  75-1.1, which proscribes \n“unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.”  He contends that the \ncomplaint does not state a valid claim under section 75-1.1 because the alleged acts, \neven if unfair or deceptive,  are not in or affecting commerce .  In support, he relies \nprimarily on  statutory language that defines “commerce” to exclude “professional \nservices rendered by a member of a learned profession.”  N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1(b). \n15. In their opposition brief, t he Patels say  that the claim is not grounded in  \nsection 75 -1.1 or North Carolina law  but is instead grounded in South Carolina ’s \nUnfair Trade Practices Act , which has no analogous exemption for members of a \nlearned profession .  A t the hearing, though, the Patels’ counsel  switched course , \narguing that the claim was made in the alternative under either North Carolina law \nor South Carolina law.  Later in the hearing, counsel switched course again, arguing \nthat both States’ statutes apply because part of the claim is based on a breach of the \nPractice Separation Agreement that is governed by its North Carolina choice-of-law \nclause while another part is  based on extracontractual conduct governed by South \nCarolina law.   \n16. It goes without saying that a complaint should not be a moving target.  Basic \npleading rules make that clear.  A plaintiff must give sufficient notice of its claim to \nallow its adversary and the Court “to understand the nature of [the claim] and the \nbasis for it.”  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 104 (1970); see also N.C. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1).  \nWhether this claim meets that standard is questionable, given the Patels’ own \nuncertainty. \n17. Nevertheless, the Court will assume for argument’s sake that the claim \ndraws on both North Carolina and South Carolina law.  Either way, it is deficient.   \n18. First, South Carolina  law does not apply to any  claim for unfair and \ndeceptive trade practices predicated on a breach of the Practice Separation \nAgreement.  This is because the parties agreed that North Carolina law would govern \nthe interpretation and implementation of the agreement.  And “parties to a business \ncontract may agree in the business contract that North Carolina law shall govern \ntheir rights and duties in whole or in part . . . .”  N.C.G.S. § 1G-3.   \n19. Perhaps South Carolina law would apply to extracontractual conduct, as the \nPatels contend.  But none is alleged .  Twice, the complaint states that the Patels \nbrought this action “for breach of and to enforce” the a greement.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 10.)  \nMoreover, each alleged unfair and deceptive act is also alleged  to be a breach of the \nagreement.  These acts include  sending deceptive appointment reminders and \nscheduling requests to the Patels’ patients, pressuring patients to see Sh ah or \nanother practitioner rather than the Patels, falsely advertising on a website that the \nPatels were accepting patients at Palmetto Medical Group, and otherwise trying to \ninfluence patients’ choice of provider.  (Compare Compl. ¶¶ 24, 91, 97, with ¶¶ 112–\n14; see also PSA § 6.)  \n20. The opposition brief confirms as much.  In their own words, the Patels filed \nsuit “for breach of and to enforce the terms of the” Practice Separation Agreement.  \nThey argue, for example,  that “Shah’s deceitful conduct arises out of a contractual \narrangement”; that he “purposefully deviated from” contract terms regarding patient \ntransition “in breach of the” agreement; that acts such as  “deceptively soliciting \npatients and business relationships away from the Patels” were  a “breach of several \nprovisions”; and that  the “conduct occurred in the context of transitioning patients \nand business opportunities to a different provider of medical services, pursuant to a \ncontractual relationship and related contractual obligations.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n Br. 1, 3–5, \n16, 18, ECF No. 31.)   \n21. At no point have the Patels pointed to anything other than contractual \nconduct as the basis for their claim.  Their brief alludes to allegations that Shah \ndisparaged the m and interfered with the ir business re lationship with an assisted \nliving facility.  Yet these alleged acts are outside the claim for unfair trade practices \nand, in any event,  are also named among the claimed breaches of  the Practice \nSeparation Agreement.  (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 25, 26, 39–44, 91, 97; PSA §§ 7, 11.)   \n22. In short, the claim for “Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices” is predicated \nentirely on breaches of the Practice Separation Agreement.  Thus, the parties’ \nselection of North Carolina law governs, and the complaint fails to state a claim under \nSouth Carolina’s Unfair Trade Practices Act.  \n23. Turning to North Carolina law, the Court also concludes that the complaint \nfails to state a claim under section 75-1.1.  As discussed, the statute defines commerce \nto exclude “ professional services rendered by a member of  a learned profession.”  \nN.C.G.S § 75-1.1(b).  This statutory exemption, which “for medical professionals has \nbeen broadly interpreted,”  requires a two-part inquiry: “First, the person or entity \nperforming the alleged act must be a member of a learned profession.  Second, the \nconduct in question must be a rendering of professional services.”  Sykes, 372 N.C. at \n334 (cleaned up); accord Wheeless v. Maria Parham Med. Ctr., Inc. , 237 N.C. App. \n584, 589 (2014). \n24. Without question,  Shah (a physician)  and Palmetto Medical Group (a \nprimary care practice) are members of a learned profession.  The only issue is whether \ntheir alleged conduct involves the rendering of medical services.  It does.     \n25. All the alleged unfair or deceptive acts concern efforts to  influence patients \nto choose Shah over the Patels  as medical provider.  The complaint puts it bluntly:  \nShah intended “to deceive patients into seeking medical service at [Palmetto Medical \nGroup] instead of with the Patels.”  (Compl. ¶  114 (emphasis added).)  This alleged \nconduct—centered on patient solicitation —“is directly relate d to provi ding patient \ncare” and fits comfortably  within the statutory exemption .  Sykes, 372 N.C. at 336; \nsee also Aesthetic Facial & Ocular Plastic Surgery Ctr., P.A. v. Zaldivar, 264 N.C. \nApp. 260 , 275  (2019) (concluding that the solicitation of patients and practice of \nmedicine alleged to be in breac h of contract arose from a rendering of professional \nservices); Alamance Fam. Prac., P.A. v. Lindley, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 83, at *24 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Aug. 14, 2018) (granting motion to dismiss claim based on allegations that \ndefendant “began an allergy testing  practice, obtained patient information, solicited \npatients, and attempted to secure a referral agreement”). \n26. Accordingly, the learned profession exemption applies, and the Patels have \nnot adequately alleged acts in or affecting commerce, as required by section 75 -1.1.  \nThe Court need not and does not reach Shah’s alternative arguments for dismissal.  \nIV.  \nCONCLUSION  \n27. For all these reasons, the Court GRANTS the motion.  The claim for unfair \nand deceptive trade practice is DISMISSED.   \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 24th day of January, 2023. \n \n \n       /s/ Adam M. Conrad     \n      Adam M.
