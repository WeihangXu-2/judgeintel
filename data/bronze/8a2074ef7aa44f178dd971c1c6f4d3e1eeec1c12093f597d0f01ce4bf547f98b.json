Inc., 2025 NCBC 27. \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n24CV055870-590 \n \nFINANCIAL CARRIER SERVICES \nLLC d/b/a TBS CHARLOTTE, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nKINGPIN CAPITAL INC. and RYAN \nMCCRAY, AN INDIVIDUAL, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION  \nON MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n1. Ryan McCray was once an employee of Financial Carrier Services LLC  (or \nFCS for short).  In 2024, he resigned and began working for a competitor, Kingpin \nCapital Inc.  In this lawsuit, FCS alleges that McCray and Kingpin are competing \nunfairly by using its  trade secrets and confidential information to solicit its \ncustomers.  McCray and Kingpin have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in \nits entirety.  For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in \npart the motion to dismiss.  \nTaylor English Duma, LLP, by Ryan M.  Arnold, and Buchalter, a \nProfessional Corporation, by Alison M. Ballard and Andrew H. Pinter, \nfor Plaintiff Financial Carrier Services LLC d/b/a TBS Charlotte. \n \nBradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP, by C. Bailey King, Jr. and Tamara \nR. Boles, for Defendants Kingpin Capital Inc. and Ryan McCray. \n \nConrad, Judge. \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \n2. The Court does not make findings of fact  on a motion to dismiss .  The \nfollowing background assumes that the allegations of the amended complaint are \ntrue. \n3. FCS is a Delaware LLC  based in North Carolina.  It offers “factoring and \nfinancing services for companies in the logistics and transportation industries.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 1, 9, ECF No. 24.) \n4. McCray joined FCS more than a decade ago.  At some point, he became the \ncompany’s Client Services Supervisor with responsibility for  managing its customer \naccounts and supervising its customer service employees.  As alleged, “McCray was \nthe ‘face’ of FCS,” trusted with wide-ranging access to strategic, financial, and \ncustomer-specific information.  As a condition of his employment, h e signed an \nemployment agreement containing provisions that  broadly restrict his right to  \ncompete against the company, solicit its customers , and use its c onfidential \ninformation.  (See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 19, 21–26, 28–30, 32, 33.) \n5. McCray resigned from FCS in early 2024 and took a similar customer service \nposition with  Kingpin.  Over the next several months, at least eleven customers \nabandoned FCS in favor of Kingpin.  All eleven had fallen under McCray’s purview—\neither direct ly or in his  supervisory capacity—while he was employed by FCS .  \nSuspecting foul play, FCS sent cease-and-desist letters to McCray and Kingpin in \nwhich it accused McCray of breaching his employment agreement and demanded \ninformation about his activities on Kingpin’s behalf.  A flurry of correspondence \nfollowed.  Among other things, c ounsel for McCray and Kingpin questioned the \nauthenticity of McCray’s employment agreement and produced a second version \npurporting to have  more favorable restrictive covenant terms.  After investigating, \nFCS concluded that this second version was fraudulent.  (See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 49, \n51, 52, 63, 64, 89, 90, 92, 93, 103, 135–40, 144–47.) \n6. In this case, FCS alleges that McCray shared its confidential information \nwith Kingpin and that Kingpin used that information to gain a market advantage  \nand lure away FCS’s customers .  FCS’s amended complaint includes claims against \nMcCray for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets.  It also includes \nclaims against both McCray and Kingpin for tortious interference with contract , \nunfair or deceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1, fraud, and injunctive \nrelief.   \n7. McCray and Kingpin have jointly moved to dismiss all claims.  (See ECF No. \n28.)  After reviewing the parties’ briefs, the Court concludes that oral argument would \nnot aid its decision and therefore elects to decide the motion without a hearing .  See \nBCR 7.4. \nII. \nANALYSIS \n \n8. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency of the \ncomplaint.”  Isenhour v. Hutto, 350 N.C. 601, 604 (1999) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  The motion should be granted only when “(1) the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals \nthe absence of facts suffici ent to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses \nsome fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco \nPLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \n9. In deciding the motion, the Court must treat the well-pleaded allegations of \nthe complaint as true and view the facts and permissible inferences “in the light most \nfavorable to” the nonmoving party.  Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, \n332 (2019) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Exhibits to the complaint are \ndeemed to be part of it and may also be considered, see Krawiec v. Manly , 370 N.C. \n602, 606 (2018), but the Court need not accept as true any “conclusions of law or \nunwarranted deductions of fact,” Wray v. City of Greensboro , 370 N.C. 41, 46 (2017) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \nA.  Misappropriation of Trade Secrets \n10. “To plead misappropriation of trade secrets, a plaintiff must identify a trade \nsecret with sufficient particularity so as to enable a defendant to delineate that which \nhe is accused of misappropriating and a court to determine whether misappropriation \nhas or is threatened to occur.”  Krawiec, 370 N.C. at 609 (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  McCray and Kingpin contend that the amended complaint fails to meet this \nstandard.  The Court agrees. \n11. FCS identifies its trade secrets in vague, conclusory terms: “customer lists, \ninformation concerning FCS’s customers and business partners, internal operational \ninformation, business and marketing strategies, and other non -public, proprietary \ninformation.”  (Am. Compl. ¶  213.)  At no point does the amended complaint “put \ndefendants on notice as to the precise information allegedly misappropriated.”   \nKraweic, 370 N.C. at 611 (deeming “original ideas and concepts for dance productions, \nmarketing strategies and tactics,  as well as student, client and customer lists and \ntheir contact information” to be insufficiently particular); see also Design Gaps, Inc. \nv. Hall, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 64, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 1, 2024). \n12. In its opposition brief, FCS argues that  paragraphs 29  through 31 of its \namended complaint provide additional particularity.  They do not.  These paragraphs \nare equally vague, referring to “business development strategies and goals, ” \n“knowledge of [FCS’s] operations,” the “specific needs ” of customers , “how to best \nmarket and position factoring services to ” customers, and  customer “business \npractices and plans for future business.”  (Am. Compl. ¶  29.)  There is “no further \ndetail about these” generically described strategies, goals, needs, and plans.  Kraweic, \n370 N.C. at 611.  Nor does FCS explain how it developed, maintained, and protected \nthis information. \n13. Accordingly, the Court concludes that FCS has not identified its trade \nsecrets with sufficient particularity and grants the motion to dismiss the claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets. \nB.  Breach of Contract \n14. FCS claims that McCray breached the noncompetition, customer \nnonsolicitation, and confidentiality clauses in his employment agreement.  (FCS does \nnot claim that McCray breached a different clause that restricts his right to solicit its \nemployees.)  McCray contends that the noncompetition and customer nonsolicitation \nclauses are unenforceable and that FCS has not adequately alleged a breach of the \nconfidentiality clause. \n15. Noncompetition.  Our appellate courts have stressed that “covenants not \nto compete between an employer and employee are not viewed favorably in modern \nlaw.”  Farr Assocs., Inc. v. Baskin , 138 N.C. App. 276, 279 (2000) (cleaned up).   The \ncovenant “must be no wider in scope than is necessary to protect the business of the \nemployer.”  VisionAIR, Inc. v. James, 167 N.C. App. 504, 508 (2004).  “If a contract by \nan employee in restraint of competition is too broad to be a reasonable protection to \nthe employer’s business it will not be enforced.”  Whittaker Gen. Med. Corp. v. Daniel, \n324 N.C. 523, 528 (1989). \n16. McCray’s noncompetition clause is facially overbroad.  In sweeping terms, it \nstates that he  “shall not in any way or capacity ”—including as  “an employee,” \n“investor,” or “otherwise” —“directly or indirectly  . . . [s]ell or provide financial \nservices to any Company Customer in the United States ” for one year after the end \nof his employment with FCS.  (Am. Compl. Ex. A § 3, ECF No. 24.2 .)  This language \nis so broad that it purports to bar McCray not only from doing the kind of work he did \nfor FCS but also wholly unrelated work.  What’s more, the clause would bar him from \nholding an indirect investment interest  (through a mutual fund , for example) in \nvirtually any financial services compan y, including those that do not compete with \nFCS.  Simply put, this clause is indistinguishable from similar clauses that this Court \nand our appellate courts have deemed to be overbroad and unenforceable.   See, e.g., \nVisionAIR, 167 N.C. App. at 509 ( discussing clause that  would prohibit employee \nfrom “holding interest in a mutual fund invested in part in a firm engaged in business \nsimilar to [the employer]”); see also Prometheus Grp. Enters ., LLC v. Gibson, 2023 \nNCBC LEXIS 42, at *13–15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 21, 2023) (collecting cases); InVue \nSec. Prods., Inc. v. Stein, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 115, at *13 (N.C. Super.  Ct. Dec. 18, \n2017) (same). \n17. FCS urges the Court to apply the blue -pencil rule to save the clause.  In \ntheory, t he Court  could choose not to enforce “a distinctly separable part of the \ncovenant” while enforcing the rest.  Hartman v. W.H. Odell & Assocs., 117 N.C. App. \n307, 317 (1994).  Here, though, FCS seeks to rewrite the clause  by excising integral \nphrases (“directly or indirectly” and “financial services” ).  As in another recent case, \n“[t]he Court will not exercise its discretion to blue pencil a provision that was not \nclearly drafted to be divisible.”  Prometheus, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *20–21.  \n18. Because the noncompetition clause is facially overbroad and unenforceable, \nthe Court grants the motion to dismiss FCS’s claim for breach of the clause. \n19. Nonsolicitation.  The customer nonsolicitation clause is also \nunenforceable.  Again, the employment agreement uses sweeping terms: for one year \nafter his employment , McCray “shall not in any way or capacity .  . . directly or \nindirectly” either (1)  “[s]olicit any Company Customer for the purpose of selling or \nproviding factoring services  to such Company Customer in the United States”  or \n(2) “[f]actor for, or solicit or otherwise do business with, any Company Client in the \ncourse of engaging in financial service business in the United States.”   (Am. Compl. \nEx. A § 3.)  A “Company Customer” includes FCS’s actual and prospective customers \nin the year leading up to McCray’s resignation.  (See Am. Compl. Ex. A § 2(b).) \n20. Read literally, this clause would bar McCray from doing any financial \nservice business in any capacity, even indirectly,  with any FCS customer  in the \nUnited States .  That is inordinately expansive.  FCS insists that the scope is \nreasonable because McCray was aware of and had some contact with all its \ncustomers.  But FCS alleges only that he “was the direct, front-line client contact for \na significant portion of FCS’s customer base.”  ( Am. Compl. ¶ 24 (emphasis added).)  \nThe clause purports to bar him from directly or indirectly doing business with FCS’s \nentire customer base —including the portion with which he had minimal or merely \nindirect contact and even  prospective customers with wh ich he may have had no \ncontact at all.   See Prometheus, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *22 –23 (concluding that \nsimilar clause was overbroad ); Mech. Sys. & Servs.  v. Howard, 2021 NCBC LEXIS \n69, at *9–10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 11, 2021) (collecting cases). \n21. Because the nonsolicitation clause is facially overbroad and unenforceable, \nthe Court grants the motion to dismiss FCS’s claim for breach of the clause. \n22. Confidentiality.  Courts do not scrutinize confidentiality clauses as heavily \nas restrictive covenants.  Indeed, McCray and Kingpin do not contend that the \nconfidentiality clause in McCray’s employment agreement is unenforceable.  Rather, \nthey contend that FCS has not adequately alleged a breach.  The Court disagrees.   \nClaims for breach of contract are not subject to heightened pleading standards.  The \nparticularity requirement that applies to trade-secret claims does not apply here, for \nexample.  FCS has alleged that McCray acquired confidential business and financial \ninformation, that he disclosed this information to Kingpin, and that McCray and \nKingpin used this information to steal clients and otherwise compete unfairly.  (See, \ne.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 143–47.)  These allegations are not conclusory, and taken as true, \nthey suffice to state a claim .  The Court therefore denies the motion to dismiss the \nclaim for breach of the confidentiality clause in McCray’s employment agreement. \nC.  Tortious Interference with Contract \n23. To state a claim for tortious interference with contract, the plaintiff must \nallege that a valid contract exists between it and a third person and that the \ndefendant knew of the contract, intentionally induced the third person not to perform \nthe contract, did so without justification, and caused actual damage .  See Embree \nConstr. Grp., Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc. , 330 N.C. 487, 498 (1992).  Inducement generally \nrequires purposeful conduct by the defendant.  See, e.g. , Gallaher v. Ciszek , 2020 \nNCBC LEXIS 124, at *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 16, 2020). \n24. FCS claims , first,  that Kingpin tortiously interfered with McCray’s \nemployment agreement by causing him to breach its noncompetition, customer \nnonsolicitation, and confidentiality clauses.  It also claims that McCray and Kingpin \nunlawfully induced its customers to terminate their contracts with it.   McCray and \nKingpin argue  that these claims must be dismissed because they are based on \nunenforceable restrictive covenants and because any interference with FCS’s \ncustomer contracts was justified. \n25. Having held that McCray’s  noncompetition and nonsolicitation clauses are \nunenforceable, the Court concludes that they “cannot support” FCS ’s “claim for \ntortious interference with contract .”  Phelps Staffing, LLC v. C.T. Phelps, Inc. , 226 \nN.C. App. 506, 512 (2013);  see also Design Gaps , 2024 NCBC LEXIS 64, at *10 \n(dismissing tortious interference claim based on unenforceable  noncompetition and \nnonsolicitation covenants).  \n26. But the claim for breach of the confidentiality clause remains.  Market \ncompetition may justify “interference in another’s business relations ” but only  “so \nlong as it is carried on in furtherance of one’s own interests and by means that are \nlawful.”  Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Hooks , 322 N.C. 216, 221 (1988)  (emphasis \nadded).  As alleged, McCray and Kingpin  competed by unlawful means .  Liberally \nconstrued, the amended complaint alleges that Kingpin knew of McCray’s \nnondisclosure obligation , Kingpin  induced McCray to breach that obligation , and \nKingpin and McCray used FCS’s confidential information to induce its customers to \nterminate their contracts.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 168, 170, 177.)  The Court concludes \nthat these allegations, taken as true, suffice to state a claim. \n27. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to dismiss the claims for tortious \ninterference to the extent premised on the noncompetition and customer \nnonsolicitation clauses but otherwise denies the motion to dismiss the claims. \nD.  Section 75-1.1 \n28. FCS’s section 75-1.1 claims appear to be predicated on its underlying claims \nfor tortious interference with contract , but not its claims for breach of contract  and \nmisappropriation of trade secrets .  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶  197, 206 (referring to \nMcCray’s and Kingpin’s “tortious interference”).)   McCray and Kingpin offer no \nindependent reason to dismiss the section 75-1.1 claims apart from those related to \nthe claims for tortious interference discussed above.  Thus, the Court concludes that \nthe section 75-1.1 claims shall proceed to the same extent as the tortious interference \nclaims. \nE.  Fraud \n29. In prelitigation discussions, counsel for McCray and Kingpin questioned the \nauthenticity of McCray’s employment agreement and produced a materially different \nversion of it.  FCS alleges that this second version is a fake.  FCS also alleges  that \nMcCray and Kingpin knew that the document was fake at the time and produced it \nwith the intent to deceive.  These allegations form the basis for FCS’s fraud claim.   \n30. The Court concludes that  this claim has multiple pleading defects.  As \nMcCray and Kingpin correctly observe, FCS has not alleged that it reasonably relied \non any representations about the disputed version of the employment agreement.  As \nalleged, FCS received the document, questioned its authenticity, conducted an \ninvestigation, determined that it was fake, and carried on with this lawsuit.  (See, \ne.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 95, 109, 129, 130.)  The amended complaint does not include an \nallegation that FCS was deceived or that it relied on any representation by McCray \nand Kingpin—a necessary allegation.  Moreover, even if FCS had alleged that it was \ndeceived, it  does not allege how  it was harmed.  What FCS alleges is that the \nuncertainty surrounding the disputed version caused it  to forgo any effort to seek \ninjunctive relief to enforce the noncompetition and nonsolicitation clauses in the real \nversion of McCray’s employment agreement.  But those clauses are unenforceable for \nthe reasons stated above.  Thus, it would have been fruitless to seek injunctive relief, \nand the lost opportunity to do so did not harm FCS.  See Head v. Gould Killian CPA \nGrp., P.A., 371 N.C. 2, 9 (2018) (identifying deception, reasonable reliance, and injury \nas essential elements of fraud). \n31. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to dismiss the claim for fraud. \nF.  Injunctive Relief \n32. Injunctions are remedies, not independent causes of action.  See Revelle v. \nChamblee, 168 N.C. App. 227, 230 (2005).  The Court therefore grants the motion to \ndismiss the standalone claim for injunctive relief.  That said, FCS may be able to seek \ninjunctive relief as a remedy if it prevails on its other remaining claims.  Thus, the \ndismissal is without prejudice to FCS’s ability to move for an injunction as a remedy \nat the appropriate time. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n33. For these reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the \nmotion to dismiss as follows: \na. The Court DISMISSES with prejudice the claims for misappropriation of \ntrade secrets, breach of the noncompetition clause, breach of the customer \nnonsolicitation clause, tortious interference with contract ( only to the \nextent based on the noncompetition and customer nonsolicitation \nclauses), and violations of section 75-1.1 (only to the extent based on the \nnoncompetition and customer nonsolicitation clauses). \nb. The Court DISMISSES the remedial claim for injunctive relief without \nprejudice to FCS’s ability to move for injunctive relief as a remedy at the \nappropriate time. \nc. The Court DENIES the motion in all other respects. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 19th day of June, 2025. \n \n \n       /s/ Adam M. Conrad   \n     Adam M.
