This action arises out of the sale of a self-storage business and real property \nby Defendants.  Plaintiff asserts both individual claims and  derivative claims on \nbehalf of Defendants HP Properties, LLC (“HP”) and Hyde -HP Properties, LLC \n(“Hyde-HP”).   \n4. Plaintiff alleges that, in 2014, Hyde and the Powells negotiated a sale of the \nself-storage business, EZ Storage, LLC (“EZ”), and the real property on which EZ was \nlocated for a total purchase price of $2,675,000.00.  Plaintiff challenges the allocation \nof the purchase price among HP, Hyde-HP, and EZ as, among other things, a breach \nof Hyde’s and Mr. and Mrs. Powell’s fiduciary duties to the companies and  fiduciary \nduties to Plaintiff. \n5. The Motions seek dismissal of all claims asserted by Plaintiff in her \nindividual capacity.  Because Plaintiff’s complaint fails to allege facts necessary to \nestablish either that Hyde or the Powells owed Plaintiff a special duty or that Plaintiff \nsuffered a separate and distinct injury apart from the LLCs, the Court concludes that \nthe Motions should be granted and Plaintiff’s individual claims dismissed. \n6. Defendants made clear at the hearing  on the Motions that they were not, \nat this stage of the litigation, seeking dismissal of any of Plaintiff’s derivative claims.  \n \n \nThe Court thus does not consider the validity of Plaintiff’s derivative claims asserted \non behalf of Hyde -HP, the LLC in which Plaintiff is a 50% member.  However,  the \nCourt concludes that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert any derivative claims on behalf \nof HP because Plaintiff is not a member of HP.  Because Plaintiff lacks standing to \nbring derivative claims on behalf of HP , the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction \nover these claims and therefore concludes that these claims should also be dismissed.   \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n7. Plaintiff instituted this action on March 24, 2016 by filing a Verified \nComplaint.  Plaintiff named as defendants Hyde, Mr. Powell, Mrs. Powell, HP, and \nHyde-HP.  Although named as actual defendants, the Court notes that, because \nPlaintiff does not assert claims against HP or Hyde -HP, but rather asserts claims \nagainst Hyde and the Powells on behalf of the entities, their proper characterization \nis as nominal defendants.  See Robinson on North Carolina Corporate Law § 17.05[2] \n(7th ed. 2015) (“Since a derivative action asserts a corporate claim, the corporation \nitself . . . is a necessary party to the action and is normally joined as a nominal \ndefendant.”). \n8. The case was designated as a complex business case pursuant to N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 7A -45.4 by order of the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court \ndated March 24, 2016, and was assigned to the Honorable James L. Gale by order \ndated March 28, 2016.  The  case was later reassigned to the undersigned by order \ndated July 5, 2016.   \n \n \n9. Hyde’s Motion was filed on June 6, 2016.  The Powells’ Motion was filed on \nJune 17, 2016.  Initial briefing on the Motions was completed, and the Court held a \nhearing on the Motions on August 3, 2016 at the Buncombe County Courthouse. \n10. Although both Motions plainly state that Hyde and the Powells “move[] to \ndismiss Plaintiff’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, punitive  \ndamages, and unfair and deceptive trade practices,” (see, e.g., Hyde Mot. Dismiss 1), \nHyde and the Powells made clear at the hearing that they seek dismissal of all claims \nasserted by Plaintiff in her individual capacity, a broader set of claims than as \ndisclosed in the Motions.   \n11. Because Plaintiff had not been afforded the opportunity to address in \nwriting arguments against the dismissal of all of her individual claims, the Court \npermitted Plaintiff an opportunity to file a post-hearing supplemental brief.  Plaintiff \ndid so on August 23, 2016, and both Hyde and the Powells filed briefs in response to \nPlaintiff’s supplemental brief on September 2, 2016. \n12. The brief filed by the Powells on September 2, 2016 is titled “Supplemental \nBrief to be Treated as Supplemental Motion to Dismiss” (the “Powells’ Supplemental \nBrief”).  Therein, the Powells request that their filing “be treated as a Supplemental \nMotion to Dismiss made pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and (6), and 12(h) for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction and fa ilure to state claims upon which relief can be \ngranted as to all purported causes of action against the Defendants Powell.”  (Powells’ \nSuppl. Brief. 1.)  Plaintiff filed a response in opposition to the Powells’ Supplemental \nBrief on September 22, 2016.   \n \n \n13. The Court also requested that the parties submit supplemental briefing on \nthe applicability of the North Carolina Court of Appeals’ recent decision in Raymond \nJames Capital Partners, L.P. v. Hayes , No. COA15-745, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 819  \n(Aug. 2, 2016) , to the issues raised by the Motions  and the Court’s concern that \nPlaintiff may lack standing to assert derivative claims on behalf of HP.  This \nsupplemental briefing was completed on August 23, 2016.   \n14. All briefing and argument ha ve been completed, and t he Motions are now \nripe for resolution. \nIII. THE PARTIES \n15. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(6), but only recites those factual allegations included in the Complaint that are \nrelevant to the Court’s determination of the Motions.  See, e.g., Concrete Serv. Corp. \nv. Investors Grp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986). \n16. HP and Hyde -HP are both North Carolina limited liability companies.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 5, 7.)   \n17. Plaintiff is a resident of Asheville, Buncombe County, North Carolina and \nowns a 50% interest in Hyde-HP.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 8.)   \n18. Hyde, Plaintiff’s brother, is also a resident of Asheville.  (Compl. ¶¶ 2, 15.)  \nHyde owns the other 50% interest in Hyde -HP and is the manager of that entity.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 21, 28.)  Hyde also acts as a manager of HP.  (Compl. ¶¶ 28.)  Hyde is also \na member of EZ.  (Compl. ¶ 45.)   \n \n \n19. Mr. Powell owns a 25% interest in HP and is a manager of HP.  (Compl. ¶ \n18.)   \n20. Hyde-HP owns a 75% interest in HP.  (Compl. ¶ 23.)   \n21. Plaintiff alleges that, as a result of her 50% ownership interest in Hyde -\nHP, and Hyde -HP’s 75% ownership interest in HP, she herself effectively owns a \n37.5% interest in HP.  (Compl. ¶ 23.)   \n22. Plaintiff does not allege that Mrs. Powell owns a membership in terest in \nHP, but Plaintiff does allege that Mrs. Powell may have acted as a manager of HP.  \n(Compl. ¶ 30) (emphasis added).  Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Powell and/or Mrs. Powell \nalso acted as managers of EZ.  (Compl. ¶ 31.)   \nIV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n23. In the  1990s, Wallace Hyde (“Wallace”), Plaintiff’s and Hyde’s father, \ncreated HP, naming himself and Mr. Powell as managers  of that entity .  (Compl. ¶ \n15.)  Wallace initially owned a 75% interest in HP, and Mr. Powell own ed the \nremaining 25%.  (Compl. ¶ 18.) \n24. Around the same time, Wallace also founded EZ to operate a self -storage \nfacility on 3.6 acres at 75 Highland Center Boulevard in Asheville, North Carolina \n(the “3.6 Acre Property”).  (Compl. ¶ 17.)   \n25. At all relevant times until 2014, HP owned the 3.6 Acre Property.  (Compl. \n¶ 19.)  EZ leased the 3.6 Acre Property from HP pursuant to a ground lease.  (Compl. \n¶ 20.)   \n \n \n26. In 2011, Wallace created Hyde -HP, naming Hyde the sole manager.  \n(Compl. ¶ 21.)  Wallace initially owned a 50% interest in Hyde-HP, and Hyde owned \nthe other 50%.  (Compl. ¶ 21.)   \n27. A few years before Wallace’s death, he transferred his 50% interest in Hyde-\nHP to Plaintiff, making her an equal 50% owner of Hyde-HP along with her brother.  \n(Compl. ¶ 21.)  Also at some point before his death, Wallace  transferred his \nmanagerial role in HP to Hyde, making Hyde the new manager of HP.  (Compl. ¶ 22.)  \nFinally, Wallace transferred his 75% ownership interest in HP to Hyde -HP, making \nHyde-HP the majority owner of HP .  (Compl. ¶ 23.)  Wallace died on January 13, \n2013.  (Compl. ¶ 42.)   \n28. Hyde-HP owned a 2.1 acre tract of property adjacent to the 3.6 Acre \nProperty (the “2.1 Acre Property”).  (Compl. ¶ 26.)  Hyde utilized the 2.1 Acre Property \nfor parking and various other activities associated with the EZ facilit y.  (Compl. ¶ \n26.)  Hyde never sought Plaintiff’s permission or obtain ed her consent to utilize the \n2.1 Acre Property for Hyde’s own personal interests, and Hyde never compensated \nHyde-HP or Plaintiff for his use of the 2.1 Acre Property.  (Compl. ¶ 27.)   \n29. As a tenant on the 3.6 Acre Property, EZ paid HP monthly rent.  (Compl. ¶ \n38.)  The original lease between EZ and HP, executed in 1995, provided for EZ to pay \nHP rent of $8,333.33 per month.  Plaintiff received a portion of this monthly rent and \nused it to  support herself financially.  (Compl. ¶ 39.)  However, the EZ rent checks \nwere often late, or would not arrive, while Wallace was alive, Wallace had to intervene \nto ensure that Plaintiff received her share of the EZ rent.  (Compl. ¶ 40.)   \n \n \n30. In April 2013, Hyde unilaterally agreed, on behalf of HP, to lower the \nmonthly rent EZ owed to HP from $8,333.33 per month to $6,666.66 per month.  \n(Compl. ¶ 43.)  Hyde never consulted Plaintiff regarding the decrease in rent and \nnever obtained her consent for the decrease.  (Compl. ¶ 44.)   \n31. Nearly a year after the rent reduction, Hyde, acting as manager of HP and \nHyde-HP, and the Powells, acting as managers of HP and EZ, negotiated a sale of \nEZ’s assets, along with both the 3.6 Acre Property and the 2.1 Acre Property , to a \nthird-party purchaser.  (Compl. ¶ 46.)  \n32. The total purchase price was $2,675,000.00, allocated as follows: $2,500,000 \nto HP and EZ, and $175,000.00 to Hyde-HP.  (Compl. ¶ 47.)  HP received $1,000,000 \nof the $2,500,000 allocated to it and EZ, while EZ received $1,500,000.  (Compl. ¶ 48.)  \nThis allocation was unjustified.  (Compl. ¶ 49.)   \n33. No appraisal was ever commissioned for the 2.1 Acre Property .  The 2.1 \nAcre Property was worth far greater than the amount of the purchase price allocated \nto it ($175,000).  (Compl. ¶¶ 53, 54.) \n34. Plaintiff was not informed of the plans to sell the  two parcels comprising \nthe 75 Highland Center property and was not consulted in any way concerning the \nsale, or how the purchase price was determined or allocated.  (Compl. ¶ 57.)   \n35. On December 10, 2015, Plaintiff, as a member of Hyde-HP and HP, served \na formal demand letter on all Defendants as managers of Hyde -HP and HP, \ndemanding that: (a) Hyde-HP file suit on behalf of Hyde -HP itself and as a member \nof HP; and (b) HP file suit on behalf of itself, to seek redress for various breaches and \n \n \nunlawful actions and omissions  by Hyde and the Powells .  (Compl. ¶ 61.)  As of the \nfiling of the Complaint, no defendant has formally responded to the demand letter, \nnor agreed to file a deriv ative action on behalf of either Hyde -HP or HP.  (Compl. ¶ \n62.)   \nV. LEGAL STANDARD \n36. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \nreviews the allegations of the Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiff.  The \nCourt’s inquir y is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, \ntreated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under \nsome legal theory.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d \n838, 840 (1987).  The Court construes the Complaint liberally and accepts all \nallegations as true.  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 \n(2009). \n37. Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is p roper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when the \ncomplaint reveals on its face the absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim;  [or] \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeat s the plaintiff’s \nclaim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc. , 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985); see also \nJackson v. Bumgardner , 318 N.C. 172, 175, 347 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1986); Mileski v. \nMcConville, 199 N.C. App. 267, 269, 681 S.E.2d 515, 517 (2009); Pinney v. State Farm \nMut. Ins. Co. , 146 N.C. App. 248, 253, 552 S.E.2d 186, 190 (2001).  Otherwise, “a \ncomplaint should not be dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty \n \n \nthat plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in \nsupport of the claim.”  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) \n(emphasis omitted).   \n38. The Court is not required “to accept as true allegations that are merely \nconclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope \nHosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs. , 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 \nS.E.2d 873, 880 (2005).  The Court can also ignore a party’s legal conclusions set forth \nin its pleading.  McCrann v. Pinehurst, LLC, 225 N.C. App. 368, 377, 737 S.E.2d 771, \n777 (2013). \n39. Under Rule 12(h)(3), “[w]henever it appears by suggestion of the parties or \notherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall \ndismiss the action.”  See also N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).     \nVI.  PLAINTIFF’S DERIVATIVE CLAIMS \n40. Hyde and the Powells made clear at the hearing that their Motions do not \nseek dismissal of any of Plaintiff’s derivative claims asserted against any of them.  \nHyde and the Powells have brought their Motions separately.  However, the Powells’ \nSupplemental Brief purports to move the Court to dismiss all claims, both individual \nand derivative, that Plaintiff asserts against them.  Additionally, as will be explained, \nthe Court concludes that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring derivative claims on behalf \nof HP.  For these reasons, the Court addresses Plaintiff’s derivative claims first.   \n41. Plaintiff attempts to assert derivative claims on behalf of both Hyde -HP \nand HP.   Under the North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act, only “a member \n \n \nmay bring a derivative action.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D -8-01; see, e.g., Bolier & Co. v. \nDecca Furniture (USA), Inc., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 55, at *16–17 (N.C. Super. Ct. May \n26, 2015) (dismissing derivative claims where record failed to reflect that plaintiff \nwas a member of the LLC)   \n42. With regard to Plaintiff’s derivative claims on behalf of HP, Plaintiff admits \nthat she is not a member of HP.  Rather, she alleges that, as a result of her 50% \nownership interest in Hyde -HP, and Hyde -HP’s 75% ownership interest in HP, she \nherself effectively owns a 37.5% interest in HP.  This interest, Plaintiff contends, \nprovides standing to pursue a derivative claim on behalf of HP against Hyde and the \nPowells as managers of HP.   \n43. Plaintiff describes her claim on behalf of HP as a “double derivative” claim.  \nAs explained by the Delaware Supreme Court, “a double derivative suit is one brought \nby a shareholder of a parent corporation to enforce a claim belonging to a subsidiary \nthat is either wholly owned or majority controlled.”  Lambrecht v. O’Neal, 3 A.3d 277, \n282 (Del. 2010).  Delaware law recognizes the right of a plaintiff, who owns stock in \na parent corporation, to bring a double derivative action as a shareholder of the \nparent against directors of a subsidiary cor poration for the directors’ breaches of \nfiduciary duty that results in harm to the subsidiary and, indirectly, to the parent as \nthe subsidiary’s only or majority shareholder.  See id. at 282–83.   \n44. Here, Plaintiff’s description of her attempt to bring deri vative claims on \nbehalf of HP as a double derivative claim exhibits a misunderstanding of the nature \nof double derivative claims.  A “double derivative” claim by a shareholder of a parent \n \n \ncompany on behalf of the parent company – i.e., the company in which the plaintiff is \nactually a shareholder – is brought against the directors of the subsidiary for \ndamages incurred by the parent c ompany as a result of injury to the parent’s value \ncaused by injury to the subsidiary.  Here, however, Plaintiff attempt s to assert \nderivative claims on behalf of HP, the subsidiary, a company in which she is not a \nmember, in addition to derivative claims on behalf of Hyde-HP. \n45. “[A] court has inherent power to inquire into, and determine, whether it has \njurisdiction and to dismiss an action ex mero motu when subject matter jurisdiction \nis lacking.”  Reece v. Forga , 138 N.C. App. 703, 704, 531 S.E.2d 881, 882  (2000).  \nBecause Plaintiff is not a member of HP, the Court concludes that Plaintiff lacks \nstanding to assert derivative claims on behalf of HP.  Because lack of standing defeats \nthe Court’s subject matter jurisdiction, the Court must dismiss Plaintiff’s derivative \nclaims asserted on behalf of HP with prejudice.  See Marriott v. Chatham Cty. , 187 \nN.C. App. 491, 494, 654 S.E.2d 13, 16 (2007) (“Standing is a necessary prerequisite \nto a court’s proper exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.”).   \n46. Plaintiff’s derivative claims brought on behalf of Hyde -HP, however, are a \ndifferent matter.  Plaintiff alleges that she is a 50% member of Hyde -HP, that she \nmade a written demand on Hyde -HP to take suitable action, and that such demand \nwas rejected.  Thus, under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D-8-01, and assuming her allegations \nregarding her demand to be true, Plaintiff has standing to bring derivative claims on \nbehalf of Hyde-HP. \n \n \n47. Nonetheless, the Powells’ Supplemental Brief puts at issue the question of \nwhether Plaintiff may bring  a derivative action on behalf of Hyde -HP against the \nPowells for the Powells’ alleged wrongful actions that injured HP, the subsidiary LLC \nin which Hyde-HP is a 75% member.  Such a claim would be in the nature of a double \nderivative claim.  See Lambrecht, 3 A.3d at 282.   \n48.  Our appellate courts have not explicitly addressed whether a plaintiff may \nbring a double derivative claim under North Carolina law. The Court of Appeals, in \nHayes, dealt with individual claims in a factual scenario not unlike Plaintiff’s claims \nhere.  The Court in Hayes was not, however, called upon to decide whether a double \nderivative claim exists under North Carolina law.   Absent guidance from the North \nCarolina appellate courts, this Court may look to, but is not controlled by, Delaware \nlaw on the subject.  See First Union Corp. v. Suntrust Banks, Inc., 2001 NCBC LEXIS \n7, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2001) (“North Carolina courts have frequently \nlooked to Delaware for guidance [on matters of corporate law] beca use of the special \nexpertise and body of case law developed in the Delaware Chancery Court and the \nDelaware Supreme Court.”).  \n49. As noted above, Delaware courts recognize the legitimacy of a claim brought \nby a shareholder of a parent company to enforce a claim belonging to a subsidiary, in \ncertain instances, so long as that subsidiary is wholly owned or majority controlled  \nby the parent .  Lambrecht, 3 A.3d at 282.  Here, Plaintiff’s Complaint, liberally \nconstrued, states claims against Hyde and the Powells th at would qualify as double \nderivative claims on behalf of Hyde-HP under Delaware law. \n \n \n50. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Hyde breached his fiduciary duty to HP \nby unilaterally agreeing on behalf of HP to lower monthly rent owed by EZ, resulting \nin a loss  of income to Hyde -HP, as a 75% member in HP.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 39, 43.)  \nPlaintiff also alleges that Hyde and the Powells breached their fiduciary duties to HP \nin their allocation of the purchase price between HP and EZ, which allegedly \nbenefitted EZ at HP’s expense.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 46, 48, 49.)  These allegations, among \nothers, would, the Court believes, properly state a double derivative claim under \nDelaware law.   \n51. In the absence of explicit guidance from North Carolina appellate courts \nregarding the valid ity of double derivative claims in North Carolina, the Court \ndeclines to dismiss such claims at this stage of the litigation, either on its own motion \nunder Rule 12(h)(3), or on the Powells’ purported Rule 12(b)(1) Motion set forth in the \nPowells’ Suppleme ntal Brief.  Accordingly, to the extent the Powells move for \ndismissal of such claims in their Supplemental Brief, the Court concludes that the \nPowells’ Motion should be denied , without prejudice to any of the Defendants’ right \nto challenge the viability o f Plaintiff’s double derivative claim at the dispositive \nmotion stage of this litigation. \nVII. PLAINTIFF’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS  \n \n52. Both Hyde’s Motion and the Powells’ Motion  seek dismissal of Plaintiff’s \nclaims asserted in Plaintiff’s individual capacity rather than derivatively.  Plaintiff \nasserts individual claims against Hyde and the Powells for breach of contract, breach \nof fiduciary duty , constructive fraud , conversion, unjust enrichment , punitive \n \n \ndamages, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and accounting.  Each claim is based \non Hyde’s and the Powells’  alleged breach of their fiduciary duties to the LLCs by \ntheir alleged wrongful allocation of the EZ purchase price am ong the various LLCs  \nand, as to Hyde specifically,  for his alleged unilateral reduction of the rent EZ paid \nHP each month.   \n53. Under North Carolina law, the rule is that “[s]hareholders . . . of \ncorporations generally may not bring individual actions to recover what they consider \ntheir share of the damages suffered by the corporation.”  Hayes, 2016 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 819, at *6 (quoting Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 660, 488, \nS.E.2d 215, 220–21 (1997)).  Despite this general rule, however,  \na “shareholder may maintain an individual action against a third party \nfor an injury that directly affects the shareholder, even if the corporation \nalso has a cause of action arising from the same wrong, ” under two \ncircumstances: (1) where “the wrongdoer owed [the shareholder] a \nspecial duty[,] ” and (2) where the shareholder suffered a personal \ninjury—one that is “separate and distinct from the injury sustained by \nthe other shareholders or the corporation itself.”   \n \nId. at *8 (quoting Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 219).  This rule, and its \nexceptions, are equally applicable in the LLC context.  See, e.g., SCA-Blue Ridge, LLC \nv. WakeMed, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 2 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 4, 2016).     \nA. Hyde’s Motion \n54. For Plaintiff to maintain individual claims  against Hyde, she must allege \neither (1) that Hyde owed Plaintiff a special duty, or (2) that Plaintiff suffered a \npersonal injury separate and distinct from the injury suffered by the LLCs.  Hyde \nargues that Plaintiff has not alleged facts sufficient to establish either a special duty \n \n \nor unique personal injury and that, therefore, Plaintiff’s individual claims against \nthem should be dismissed.    \n55. As to the special duty exception, Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that \nshe and Hyde, each a 50% co-owner of Hyde-HP, are siblings, (Compl. ¶ 15), and that \n“Hyde made every effort to exclude Plaintiff from the operation of the LLCs and \nwithheld information from her about both LLCs,” (Compl. ¶ 25).  Plaintiff argues that \nthese allegations are sufficient to establish that Hyde owed Plaintiff a special duty.   \n56. The special duty that is required for a plaintiff to maintain an individual \naction  \nmay arise from contract or otherwise.  To support the right to an \nindividual lawsuit, the duty must be one that the alleged wrongdoer \nowed directly to the s hareholder as an individual.  The existence of a \nspecial duty thus would be established by facts showing that defendants \nowed a duty to plaintiffs that was personal to plaintiffs as shareholders \nand was separate and distinct from the duty defendants owed t he \ncorporation.  A special duty therefore has been found when the wrongful \nactions of a party induced an individual to become a shareholder; when \na party violated its fiduciary duty to the shareholder; when the party \nperformed individualized services direc tly for the shareholder; and \nwhen a party undertook to advise shareholders independently of the \ncorporation. \n \nHayes, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 819,  at *10–11 (quoting Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 \nS.E.2d at 220).  Although Barger did not purport to identify an exhaustive list, the \nCourt of Appeals has concluded that “the special duty exception clearly requires an \narticulation of some duty owed to a plaintiff that is distinct from the general fiduciary \nduties directors and officers owe to the corporation.”  Id. at *11.   \n57. Plaintiff contends that, in addition to th e list articulated in Barger, a \nfamilial relationship standing alone satisfies the special duty exception.  In Poulos v. \n \n \nPoulos, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 58 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 2, 2015), for example, this Court \n(McGuire, J.) held that an allegation that plaintiff and defendant were, in addition to \neach being 50% members in an LLC, husband and wife was a “sufficient allegation of \na ‘special relationship’” to survive a motion to dismiss.  Id. at *9.   \n58. The Court concludes that Poulos does not control in the se circumstances.  \nHere, the relationship between Plaintiff and Hyde is one of brother and sister, rather \nthan husband and wife, the latt er being “the most confidential of all relationships.”  \nLink v. Link, 278 N.C. 181, 193, 179 S.E.2d 697, 704 (1971).  Moreover, in Poulos, the \nplaintiff alleged that she relied on her husband’s representations that certain alleged \nfraudulent transfers were  for estate planning purposes, and that she placed actual \ntrust and confidence in her husband to properly engage in the business of the LLCs \nin her best interests.   \n59. Here, however, there are no such allegations.  While the relationship \ndescribed in the Com plaint is a strained one , there is no allegation that the \nrelationship between Plaintiff and Hyde, although familial, was anything more than \nthat of co-members of an LLC.  The Court declines to hold that a sibling relationship \ncombined with  50% ownership of an LLC , without more,  creates a special duty \nsufficient to bypass the general rule in North Carolina that a member may not bring \nan individual action to recover damages suffered by the LLC.  See, e.g., Maurer v. \nMaurer, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 41, at *13 (Aug. 23, 2013) (declining to recognize special \nduty where plaintiff and defendant were former spouses and 50/50 co -owners of \ncorporation).   \n \n \n60. Plaintiff’s allegations do not otherwise satisfy the special duty exception.  \nPlaintiff has not alleged that Hyde induced  Plaintiff to become a member of Hyde -\nHP, that Hyde performed individualized services directly for Plaintiff, or that Hyde \nundertook to advise Plaintiff independently of the LLC.  See Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, \n488 S.E.2d at 220.   \n61. In addition, Hyde plainly does not owe Plaintiff a fiduciary duty  simply \nbecause they are both members of Hyde-HP.  “Members of a limited liability company \n. . . do not owe a fiduciary to each other . . . .”  Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. \nApp. 469, 473, 675 S.E.2d 133, 13 7 (2009).  Neither does Hyde owe Plaintiff a \nfiduciary duty as a result of his status as the manager of Hyde -HP.  See, e.g., id. \n(“[M]anagers of a limited liability company also owe a fiduciary duty to the company, \nand not to individual members.”).  Althou gh a controlling member may owe a \nfiduciary duty to a minority member, see id., here, Plaintiff alleges that she and Hyde \nare both 50% members of Hyde -HP.  Thus, Plaintiff is not a minority member , and \nHyde is not a controlling member.  See Allen v. Ferrera, 141 N.C. App. 284, 291, 540 \nS.E.2d 761, 766 (2000) (“[P]laintiff was a fifty percent owner . . . and hence was not a \nminority shareholder.”).   \n62. The Court specifically addresses Plaintiff’s claim against Hyde for breach \nof the Hyde -HP Operating Agreement .  As noted above, a special duty “may arise \nfrom contract or otherwise.”  Hayes, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 819, at *10 (quoting \nBarger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 220).  However, Hayes and Barger are also \nclear that “the duty must be one that the alleged wrongdoer owed directly to the \n \n \nshareholder as an individual.”  Id. (quoting Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at \n220).  Here, Plaintiff alleges, specifically in regard to her breach of contract claim  \nagainst Hyde, that  \nDefendants have breached their obligations, duties, and responsibilities \nunder the . . . Hyde -HP [Operating Agreement], particularly the duties \nassigned to managers in the operating agreements.  In particular, \nDefendants breached the duties set forth in the . . . Hyde-HP [Operating \nAgreement] not to engage in acts or omissions that were clearly in \nconflict with the interests of the LLCs and . . . engage in transactions \nfrom which a manager derives an improper personal benefit.   \n \n(Compl. ¶¶ 66, 67.)   \n63. These alleged duties are neither different from the usual fiduciary duties \nowed by a manager of an LLC, see N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D-3-21, nor special to Plaintiff \nindividually, rather than duties owed to the LLC as a matter of contract.  Accordingly, \nthe Court concludes that the Hyde-HP Operating Agreement, itself, is not sufficient \nto create a special duty owed by Hyde specifically to Plaintiff.  For these same reasons, \nPlaintiff’s individual claim for breach of the Hyde-HP Operating Agreement also fails. \n64. Like Hayes, “this case does not present a situation where the recognition of \na special duty would be proper or justified.”  Hayes, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 819 , at \n*14.  For these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to allege that \nHyde owed any special duty to Plaintiff. \n65. Turning next to the special injury exception, to proceed under this \nexception, “a plaintiff must allege an injury ‘peculiar and personal’ to itself as a \nshareholder.”  Id. (quoting Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 220).  “Specifically, \na plaintiff must show that its particular injury was ‘separate and distinct from the \n \n \ninjury sustained by the other shareholders or the corporation itself.’”  Id. (quoting \nBarger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 219).   \n66. Plaintiff’s Complain t contains numerous allegations that, as a result of \nHyde’s wrongdoing, “HP, Hyde -HP, and Plaintiff have been damaged.”  ( See, e.g., \nCompl. ¶¶ 70, 81, 94, 99, 106, 110.)  Completely absent from Plaintiff’s Complaint, \nhowever, is any allegation that Plainti ff suffered a “peculiar and personal” injury, \napart from that suffered by Hyde-HP.   \n67. Plaintiff contends that the allegations that (1) Plaintiff was not a member \nof EZ, and (2) Defendants engaged in a series of transactions that benefitted EZ to \nthe detriment of Hyde-HP, HP, and Plaintiff are sufficient to establish a special injury \nsuffered by Plaintiff.  The Court disagrees.  The harm allegedly suffered by Plaintiff \nas a result of the alleged wrongful allocation of the purchase price by Hyde and the \nPowells among EZ, Hyde-HP, and HP is exactly the same harm that Plaintiff alleges \nwas suffered by the LLCs.  Plaintiff has failed to allege any injury she suffered that \nis separate and distinct from the injury suffered by Hyde -HP.  See, e.g., Barger, 346 \nN.C. at 658, 488 S.E.2d at 219 (“[S]hareholders cannot pursue individual causes of \naction against third parties for wrongs or injuries to the corporation that result in the \ndiminution or destruction of the value of their stock.”).   \n68. In sum, Plaintiff ’s Complaint does not allege facts sufficient to establish \neither of the exceptions outlined in Barger and followed in Hayes.  For these reasons, \nthe Court concludes that Plaintiff’s individual claims against Hyde should be \ndismissed. \n \n \nB. The Powells’ Motion \n69. Plaintiff’s individual claims against the Powells fail for the same reason s \nthe same claims fail against Hyde.  Plaintiff’s  Complaint does not allege facts \nsufficient to establish either of the Barger exceptions.  A ccordingly, for the same \nreasons explained above in connection with Hyde’s Motion, the Court concludes that \nPlaintiff’s individual claims against the Powells should be dismissed. \nC. Dismissal With or Without Prejudice \n70. Plaintiff requests that any dismissal of her individual claims be without \nprejudice.  Plaintiff contends that, because information concerning the operation of \nHyde-HP was withheld from her, her ability to allege facts are necessarily limited to \nwhat she currently knows or believes to be true, and that if evidence is uncovered \nduring discovery that would support individual claims, Plaintiff should be allowed to \namend the pleadings and assert those claims.   \n71. “The decision to dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the \ndiscretion of the trial court . . . .”  First Fed. Bank v. Aldridge, 230 N.C. App. 187, 191, \n749 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2013).  The Court concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that \ndismissal of Plaintiff’s individual claims , except for any such claims asserted out of \nher alleged status as a member of HP , at this stage should be without prejudice to \nPlaintiff’s right to attempt to reassert such claims by way of a motion to amend her \nComplaint in the event discovery uncovers facts sufficient to establish one of the two \nBarger exceptions discussed above , or that Pla intiff is otherwise entitled to bring \nindividual claims against Hyde and/or the Powells.   \n \n \nVIII. CONCLUSION \n72. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS Hyde’s Motion, \nGRANTS in part the Powells’ Motion, and DISMISSES without prejudice Plaintiff’s \nclaims asserted in her individual capacity  against Hyde and the Powells , except for \nany claims asserted out of her alleged status as a member of HP, which are dismissed \nwith prejudice.  The Court further, sua sponte, DISMISSES with prejudice Plaintiff’s \nclaims asserted derivatively on behalf of HP  against Hyde and the Powells .   As a \nresult of the Court’s rulings as set forth herein, all individual claims against Hyde  \nand the Powells  are dismissed.  Plaintiff’s derivative claims against Hyde an d the \nPowells on behalf of Hyde-HP survive the Motions.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 4th day of October, 2016. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
