Design Gaps, Inc. is an interior -design company owned by David and Eva \nGlover.  In this lawsuit, Design Gaps and the Glovers have  sued a former employee, \nJocelyn Hall, for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, embezzlement, \nand more.   They have also sued Hall’s new employer  and its principals.  All \ndefendants have m oved to dismiss the complaint .  For the following reasons, the \nCourt DENIES the motion to dismiss the embezzlement claim but GRANTS the \nmotions to dismiss all other claims. \nHess Law , PLLC, by Todd M. Hess, for Plaintiffs  Design Gaps, Inc., \nDavid Glover, and Eva Glover. \nMaloney Law & Associates, PLLC,  by Margaret B. Maloney, for \nDefendants Jocelyn Hall and Hall Interiors, LLC. \nDesign Gaps, Inc. v. Hall, 2024 NCBC 30. \nShumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, by Lucas D. Garber and Samuel A. \nLong, for Defendants Peters Custom Homes, Inc., Nicholas Peters, Peters \nCustom Design, LLC d/b/a Emerald & Oak Design Studio, and Miriam \nPeters.  \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n2. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion to dismiss made under \nRule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Ru les of Civil Procedure .  The following \nbackground assumes that the allegations in the complaint are true. \n3. Design Gaps “specializes  in high-end residential custom construction and \nrenovations including fine custom cabinetry that is used throughout the home .”  It \noperates “throughout the Carolinas ” and claims to have developed valuable trade \nsecrets and other intellectual property.  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 12, ECF No. 3.) \n4. Hall joined Design Gaps in 2018.  Her duties, which are reflected in a written \nemployment agreement, included meeting with prospective clients to determine their \nneeds, taking measurements for use in designs, maintaining the showroom, and \nassisting with a variety of  sales and marketing activities .  Also w ithin Hall’s \nemployment agreement are provi sions that restrict her right to compet e against \nDesign Gaps and solicit its customers during her employment and for  another two \nyears after.  The noncompetition clause states that Hall “shall not in any manner, \ndirectly or indirectly, anywhere where the Company conducts the Company Business, \n(i) [sic] own, manage, operate, join,  control, or participate in the ownership, \nmanagement, operation, or control of, or be connected in any manner with, any entity \nthe business of which competes with the Company Business.”  “Company Business” \nis defined to “mean the design and selling of residential cabinetry.”  The \nnonsolicitation clause states that she shall not  “directly or indirectly .  . . solicit \ncustomers or suppliers of the Company or its affiliates” for her own benefit or for any \nother person’s or entity’s benefit.  (Compl.  ¶¶ 17, 21; Compl. Ex. A [“Empl. Agrmt.”] \n§§ 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, ECF No. 3.) \n5. Hall resigned in 2021, ostensibly because she was burned out.  She asked to \nkeep her work laptop after her departure, telling Design Gaps that this would make \nit easier for her to answer any questions her replacement might have about ongoing \nprojects.  Design Gaps agreed.  A few weeks later, though, Design Gaps learned that \nHall had joined its competitor, Peters Custom Design, LLC (doing business as \nEmerald & Oak Design Studio ).  At that point, Design Gaps retrieved Hall’s laptop \nand blocked her access to its web-based data.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 22–24.) \n6. This episode led Design Gaps to investigate Hall’s activities further.  Design \nGaps now believes that Hall routinely invoiced clients through her personal company, \nHall Interiors, LLC, so that they paid her, not Design Gaps, for products and services.  \nIn one example, a client gave Hall a check made out to Design Gaps for over $5,000.  \nRather than convey the check to Design Gaps, Hall destroyed it and directed the \nclient to pay the sum to Hall Interiors.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 30–35.) \n7. Design Gaps also believes that Hall has given its trade secrets and creative \ndesigns to Peters Custom Design  and its proprietor, Miriam Peters , as well as  a \nrelated company called Peters Custom Homes, Inc. and its proprietor, Nicholas Peters \n(together, “Peters Defendants”).  As alleged, the Peters Defendants have since passed \noff some of Design Gaps’ cabinet and closet designs as their own.  Faced with what it \nbelieves to be unfair competition, Design Gaps closed its Charlotte, North Carolina \nlocation in 2023.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 16, 36, 38–40, 42.) \n8. Design Gaps and the Glovers sued Hall , Hall Interiors,  and the Peters \nDefendants in early 2023 in federal court.  Central to that lawsuit were  claims for \nfalse designation of origin under the federal Lanham Act and for misappropriation of \ntrade secrets under the federal Defen d Trade Secrets Act .  The federal court \ndismissed both, concluding that copyright laws preempted the Lanham Act claim and \nthat the complaint did not adequately identify the alleged trade secrets for purposes \nof the Defend Trade Secrets Act .  Having dismissed these federal -law claims , the \ncourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction  over the state-law claims and \ndismissed them without prejudice.  See generally Design Gaps, Inc. v. Hall, 2023 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 208773 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 21, 2023).  \n9. This lawsuit followed.  Design Gaps and the Glovers have not reasserted any \nfederal-law claims  or any claims based on alleged trademarks, trade dress, or \ncopyrighted designs.  They have, however, reasserted the state-law claims dismissed \nin the earlier federal litigation.  The complaint includes eight causes of action: breach \nof contract (by Design Gaps against Hall); misappropriation of trade secrets (by all \nplaintiffs against all defendants); tortious interference with contract (by Design Gaps \nagainst the Peters Defendants); unfair or deceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. \n§ 75-1.1 (by Design Gaps against all defendants); breach of fiduciary duty (by Design \nGaps against Hall); fraud (by all plaint iffs against Hall); embezzlement (by all \nplaintiffs against Hall); and constructive fraud (by all plaintiffs against Hall). \n10. Two motions to dismiss are pending: one by Hall and Hall Interiors and the \nother by the Peters Defendants.  The motions have been fully briefed, and the Court \nheld a hearing on 30 April 2024.  The motions are ripe for disposition. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n11. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency of the \ncomplaint.”  Isenhour v. Hutto, 350 N.C. 601, 604 (1999) (citation and quotation marks \nomitted).  The motion should be granted only when “(1) the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals \nthe absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3)  the complaint discloses \nsome fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.”  Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco \nPLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \n12. In deciding the motion, the Court must treat the well-pleaded allegations of \nthe complaint as true and view the facts and permissible inferences “in the light most \nfavorable to” the nonmoving party.  Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, \n332 (2019) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Exhibits to the complaint are \ndeemed to be part of it and may also be considered, see Krawiec v. Manly , 370 N.C. \n602, 606 (2018), but the Court need not accept as true any “conclusions of law or \nunwarranted deductions of fact,” Wray v. City of Greensboro , 370 N.C. 41, 46 (2017) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n13. These motions present garden-variety disputes that are governed by settled \nlaw.1  The Court begins with the claim for breach of contract. \nA. Breach of Contract \n14. Design Gaps claim s that Hall  breached the noncompetition and \nnonsolicitation clauses in her employment contract.  Restrictive covenants like these \nmust be “(1) in writing; (2) made part of a contract of employment; (3) based on \nvaluable consideration; (4) reasonable both as to time and territ ory; and (5) not \nagainst public policy.”  United Labs., Inc. v. Kuykendall, 322 N.C. 643, 649–50 (1988).  \n“If a contract by an employee in restraint of competition is too broad to be a reasonable \nprotection to the employer’s business it will not be enforced.”   Whittaker Gen. Med. \nCorp. v. Daniel , 324 N.C. 523, 528 (1989); see also  InVue Sec. Prods., Inc. v. Stein , \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 115, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 18, 2017). \n15. Hall’s noncompetition clause  is facially overbroad and unenforceable.  I t \npurports to stop her from “directly or indirectly” owning, joining, or being “connected \nin any manner with” a competitor for two years following the end of her employment \nwith Design Gaps .  ( Empl. Agrmt. §  4.2.)  This sweeping restriction—which would \n \n1 Copyright preemption , which is not a garden -variety issue in this Court,  featured \nprominently in the earlier federal litigation.  The Peters Defendants initially made similar \narguments here out of an abundance of caution, noting that the complaint in this case retains \nall the allegations that supported the plaintiffs’ federal-law claims in that case.  But Design \nGaps and the Glovers have since confirmed that they are not relying on any alleg ations \nrelated to trademarks, trade dress, or copyrighted designs and that those allegations  are \nsimply a vestige of the original federal complaint.  Thus, there is no need to address copyright \npreemption. \nprevent Hall from having any association with a competitor, even if unrelated to the \nduties she performed for Design Gaps—isn’t remotely tailored to protect Design Gaps’ \nlegitimate business interests.  See VisionAIR, Inc. v. James, 167 N.C. App. 504, 508–\n09 (2004) (concluding that a noncompetition clause  that barred an  employee from \n“participat[ing] in, directly or indirectly, any business similar to” the former \nemployer’s was unenforceable).2  \n16. Hall’s nonsolicitation clause is facially overbroad for similar reasons.  It \npurports to stop her (again for two years ) from “directly or indirectly ” soliciting all \n“customers” of Design Gaps “or its affiliates”—even those she had no contact with and \ndid not know .  ( Empl. Agrmt. §  4.1.)  A  restriction on solicitation that “extends to \nareas where [the employee] had no connections or personal knowledge of customers” \nis unreasonable, especially when it sweeps in  customers of affiliated companies for \nwhom the employee did not work .  Hejl v. Hood, Hargett & Assocs., Inc. , 196 N.C. \nApp. 299, 307 (2009); see also Prometheus Grp. Enters., 2023 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *13 \n \n2 Cases with similar holdings are legion.  See, e.g., Med. Staffing Network, Inc. v. Ridgway , \n194 N.C. App. 649, 656 (2009) (“[W]e have held that restrictive covenants are unenforceable \nwhere they prohibit the employee from engaging in future work that is di stinct from the \nduties actually performed by the employee .”); Hartman v. W.H. Odell & Assocs. , 117 N.C. \nApp. 307, 317 (1994) (refusing to enforce a noncompetition covenant that “requires plaintiff \nto have no association whatsoever with any business that pr ovides actuarial services”); \nPrometheus Grp. Enters., LLC v. Gibson, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. \n21, 2023) (“North Carolina courts have repeatedly warned the drafters of restrictive \ncovenants about the dangers of using the phrase ‘dire ctly or indirectly’ when defining the \nscope of a non-compete.”); Power Home Solar, LLC v. Sigora Solar, LLC, 2021 NCBC LEXIS \n55, at *25 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 18, 2021) (“North Carolina courts have routinely refused to \nenforce noncompete provisions that prohibit former employers from ‘indirectly’ working for a \ncompetitor or similar business.”) ; Aeroflow Inc. v. Arias , 2011 NCBC LEXIS 21, at *17– 18 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. July 5, 2011) (“The plain language of the non-competition provision, drafted \nby Aeroflow, would prevent Arias working for a competitor in a position wholly outside the \nscope of his employment with Aeroflow.”). \n(collecting cases); Mech. Sys. & Servs. v . Howard, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *9 –10 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 11, 2021) (same). \n17. Because t he noncompetition and nonsolicitation clauses in Hall’s \nemployment contract are overbroad and unenforceable, the Court grants her motion \nto dismiss the claim for breach of contract. \nB. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets  \n18. Design Gaps and the Glovers assert their claim for misappropriation of trade \nsecrets against all defendants.  “To plead misappropriation of trade secrets, a plaintiff \nmust identify a trade secret with sufficient particularity  so as to enable a defendant \nto delineate that which he is accused of misappropriating and a court to determine \nwhether misappropriation has or is threatened to occur.”  Krawiec, 370 N.C. at 609 \n(citation and quotation marks omitted).   \n19. The complaint doesn’t come close to satisfying this standard.  In vague and \nconclusory fashion, it identifies the trade secrets to include “customer lists, pricing \nformulas, and bidding formulas,” as well as  “product sources, products, price lists, \nadvertising plans, designs and materials, technical drawings, services, pricing points, \nmethods of sales and business contracts and training methods as well as .  . . \ncustomers’ pricing programs, unit sales, dollar volume, models, financial information, \nproduct roadmaps, channelization and sales strategies .”  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 69, 70.)  As in \nKrawiec, there is  “no further detail about these” customer lists, formulas, plans, \nmaterials, methods, information, roadmaps, and strategies “sufficient to put \ndefendants on notice as t o the precise information alle gedly misappropriated.”  370 \nN.C. at 611  (concluding that identification of trade secrets as “original ideas and \nconcepts for dance productions, marketing strategies and tactics, as well as student, \nclient and customer lists and their contact information” was insufficiently \nparticular).3   \n20. Accordingly, the Court grants the motions to dismiss the claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets.   \nC. Tortious Interference with Contract \n21. Design Gaps claims that the Peters Defendants tortiously interfered with \nHall’s employment agreement  by causing her to terminate the agreement and to \nbreach its noncompetition and nonsolicitation clauses .  To state a claim for tortious \ninterference with contract, the plaintiff  must allege that a valid contract exists \nbetween it and a third person and that the defendant  knew of the contract , \nintentionally induced the third person  not to perform the contract , did so without \njustification, and caused actual damage.  See Embree Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., \n330 N.C. 487, 498 (1992).   \n22. Hall’s noncompetition and nonsolicitation clauses  are unenforceable.  As a \nresult, they “cannot support [Design Gaps’] claim for tortious interference with \n \n3 This Court has routinely granted motions to dismiss claims for misappropriation of trade \nsecrets based on similarly vague and generalized identifications of the alleged trade secrets.  \nSee, e.g., Power Home Solar, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 55, at *34 (identifying trade secrets generally \nas “proprietary practices, methods, techniques, and pricing models” was not sufficiently \nparticular); Bite Busters, LLC v. Burris, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 26, at *20 –21 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMar. 25, 2021)  (identifying trade secrets generally as “processes” and “procedures” was \ninsufficiently particular); AECOM Tech. Corp. v. Keating, 2012 NCBC LEXIS 9, at * 8 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 6, 2012 ) (identifying trade secrets generally as “customer lists, customer \ncontract information, pricing information and product information” was insufficiently \nparticular). \ncontract.”  Phelps Staffing, LLC v. C.T. Phelps, Inc. , 226 N.C. App. 506, 512 (2013); \nsee also Power Home Solar, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 55, at *45. \n23. Moreover, the complaint on its face shows that the Peters Defendants were \nlegally justified in offering Hall a new job and, by extension, causing her to end her \nemployment agreement with De sign Gaps.  A s our Supreme Court has explained, \n“competition in business constitutes justifiable interference in another’s business \nrelations and is not actionable so long as it is carried on in furtherance of one’s own \ninterests and by means that are lawful.”  Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Hooks, 322 N.C. \n216, 221 (1988).  In addition, “everyone has the right to offer better terms to another’s \nemployee, so long as the latter is free to leave.”  Id. at 222.  Here, the Peters \nDefendants and Design Gaps are competitors, ( see Compl. ¶¶  14, 23), and Hall’s \nemployment agreement allowed her to terminate it  on thirty -days’ notice , ( Empl. \nAgrmt. § 3.1). \n24. Design Gaps argues that the Peters Defendants acted without justification \nbecause their goal was to misappropriate trade secrets rather than to engage in \nlegitimate competition.  As discussed, though, the complaint does not adequately \nallege misappropriation.  \n25. The Court therefore grants the motion to  dismiss the claim for tortious \ninterference with contract .  See Peoples Sec. Life Ins. , 322 N.C. at 220 (“A motion \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted when the complaint reveals that the \ninterference was justified or privileged.”). \nD. Section 75-1.1 \n26. The section 75-1.1 claim is predicated entirely on the claims  for breach of \ncontract, misappropriation of trade secrets , and tortious interference with contract .  \nHaving dismissed those claims, the Court dismisses the section 75 -1.1 claim for the \nsame reasons. \nE. Breach of Fiduciary Duty & Constructive Fraud \n27. Design Gaps alleges  that Hall breached fiduciary duties arising from her \nemployment with the company .  ( See Compl. ¶¶  88, 89, 115 .)  As Hall correctly \nobserves, though, employ ees who are not officers or directors typically do not owe \ntheir employers fiduciary duties.   See Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 652 (2001) \n(“[T]he relation of employer and employee is not one of those regarded as \nconfidential.” (citation and quotation marks omitted )).  The rare exception is when \nthe employee “exercise[s] dominion” over the employer .  I d.; see also Reichhold \nChems., Inc. v. Goel, 146 N.C. App. 137, 155 (2001) (“A managerial position alone does \nnot demonstrate the requisite domination and influ ence on the other required to \ncreate a fiduciary obligation.” (cleaned up)).  Nothing in the complaint suggests that \nHall exercised dominion over Design Gaps. \n28. Accordingly, Design Gaps has not adequately alleged that a fiduciary \nrelationship exists.  The Court therefore dismisses its claims for breach of fiduciary \nduty and constructive fraud.   See Azure Dolphin, LLC v. Barton , 371 N.C. 579, 599 \n(2018) (holding that a claim for constructive fraud arises only when “a confidential or \nfiduciary relationship exists” ( citation and quotation marks omitted) ); Dalton, 353 \nN.C. at 651 (“For a breach of fiduciary duty to exist, there must first be a fiduciary \nrelationship between the parties.”).   \nF. Fraud \n29. The claim for fraud is also deficient.  A “false representation . . . of a material \nfact” is essential to fraud.  Rowan Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 332 N.C. 1, \n17 (1992).  Equally essential, the plaintiff who claims fraud must have relied on and \nbeen deceived by the misrepresentation.  See id.  Although the complaint alleges that \nHall misled customers, there are no allegations that she made any false \nrepresentations to Design Gaps or the Glovers.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 93, 95.)  Indeed, the \ncomplaint alleges that Design Gaps and the Glovers did not find out about, much less \nrely on, the supposedly false statements to customers until after her resignation.  (See \nCompl. ¶ 100.)  The Court therefore dismisses the fraud claim.   See Bucci v. Burns, \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 37, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 25, 2018) (“It goes without saying \nthat an individual cannot be defrauded by a misrepresentation he never sees, hears, \nor even knows about.”). \nG. Embezzlement \n30. Design Gaps and the Glovers allege that Hall embezzled money belonging \nto them during her employment.  It is unlawful for an agent of a corporation to \n“[e]mbezzle or fraudulently or knowingly and willfully misapply or convert to his own \nuse” the corporation’s “money, goods or other chattels.”  N.C.G.S. § 14-90; see also id. \n§ 1-538.2(a), (c) (authorizing civil action for embezzlement).  Hall contends that the \nallegations in the complaint , even if take n as true, show that the money at issue \nbelonged to her, not Design Gaps .  This is unpersuasive.  Viewing the allegations in \nthe light most favorable to Design Gaps and the Glovers , Hall received at least one \ncheck from a customer made out to Design Gaps  that she destroyed.  She then  told \nthe customer to pay her directly.  (See Compl. ¶ 34.)  That is sufficient to allege that \nHall knowingly misapplied or converted to her own use money belonging to Design \nGaps.  Accordingly, the Court denies Hall’s motion to dismiss the embezzlement \nclaim. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n31. For all these reasons, the Court  DENIES Hall’s motion to dismiss the \nembezzlement claim.  The Court GRANTS  the remainder of her motion and  \nGRANTS the Peters Defendants’ motion.  Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract, \nmisappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference with contract, vi olations of \nsection 75 -1.1, breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and fraud are  \nDISMISSED with prejudice. \nSO ORDERED, this the 1st day of May, 2024. \n \n \n       /s/ Adam M.
