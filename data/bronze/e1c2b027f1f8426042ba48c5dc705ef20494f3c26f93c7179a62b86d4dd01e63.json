  "raw_text": "Morgan v. Turn-Pro Maint.

THIS MATTER is before the Court upon (i) Defendant Robert Singletary’s \n(“Singletary”) Motion for Summary Judgment ( the “Singletary Motion”), (ECF No. \n49), and (ii) Plaintiff Joshua Morgan’s  (“Morgan”) Motion for Summary Judgment  \n(the “Morgan Motion”), (ECF No. 41), both individually and derivatively on behalf of \nAlpine Waste Solutions, LLC  (“Alpine” or the “Company” ), in the above- captioned \ncase (collectively, the “Motions”).  \n2. Having considered the Motions, the related briefing, and the arguments of \ncounsel at the hearing on the Motions, the Court (i) DENIES the Singletary Motion; \nand (ii) GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Morgan Motion.  \nAlexander Ricks, PLLC, by Alice C. Richey, for Plaintiff Joshua Morgan, \nboth individually and derivatively, on behalf of Alpine Waste Solutions, \nLLC.  \n \nRobert M. Singletary, pro se.  \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge.  \n \n \n \n \nI. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion for \nsummary judgment, but “it is helpful to the parties and the courts for the trial judge \nto articulate a summary of the material facts which he considers are not at issue[.]”   \nHyde Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142, 215 S.E.2d 162, \n165 (1975).  \n4. Morgan and Singletary formed Alpine in 2014  to provide trash collection \nand general maintenance services for property management companies and \napartment complexes.  (V. Compl. ¶ 9, ECF No. 3; Second Aff. Robert M. Singletary  \n¶¶ 11, 13 [hereinafter “Singletary 2nd Aff.”], ECF No. 52.)  \n5. Morgan and Singletary are the only two members of Alpine, and each holds \na 50% ownership interest in the Company.  (V. Compl. Ex. A; Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. \n1, at ¶¶ 5–7, 37 [hereinafter “Morgan Aff.”], ECF No. 41.1; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 12.)  \nAlpine does not have a written operating agreement , (Morgan Aff. ¶ 7; Pl.’s Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. 2, at 13:11–14:5 [hereinafter “Singletary Dep.”], ECF No. 41.2), and is \nno longer in business, (Morgan Aff. ¶ 47, Ex. S; see also Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 30).  \n6. Singletary served as Alpine’s member-manager and handled the Company’s \nday-to-day operations while it conducted business.  (V. Compl. ¶ 10; Morgan Aff. ¶ 10; \nSingletary 2nd Aff.  ¶ 15; Singletary Dep. 13:11–13, 14:20–15:6.)  Morgan provided \nAlpine’s initial funding and had a more passive role in the C ompany’s operations.  \n(Morgan Aff. ¶ 7; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 12.)  \n \n \n \n \n7. Alpine enjoyed some early success .  I n late 2015, t he C ompany obtained \nservice contracts with three properties managed by Ardmore Residential, Inc. \n(“Ardmore”): (1) King’s Grant Apartments, LLC, dated October 7, 2015; (2) Th e \nRetreat at the Park, LLC, dated October 12, 2015; and (3) Howell Road, LLC, dated \nOctober 2, 2015 (collectively, the “Ardmore Contracts”).  (Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 15–17, Exs. \nB–D; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 17.)  Building on that success, a few months later, Alpine \nentered into a service contract dated March 7, 2016 with Grubb Properties, Inc.  \n(“Grubb Properties”) to provide services at Grubb Properties’ LangTree Lake Norman \nApartments property (the “Grubb Contract”).  (Morgan Aff. ¶ 14, Ex. A; see also Index \nExhibits Referenced Second Aff. Robert M. Singletary  Ex. F [hereinafter, “Index \nSingletary 2nd Aff.”], ECF No. 53.)  \n8. Beginning in 2016, the relationship between Morgan and Singletary \ndeteriorated, with each suspecting the other of misusing Alpine’s a ssets.  According \nto Morgan, beginning in April 2016, Singletary caused Alpine to pay for Singletary’s \npersonal expenses, including groceries, meals, rent, and a personal loan to \nSingletary’s brother, in the total amount of $4,987.29.  ( Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 28–29; see \nalso Morgan Aff. Exs. G (Alpine bank statements) and H (Alpine operating account \ntransaction list).)  Morgan also claims that Singletary made false statements to \nAlpine’s customers to excuse Alpine’s poor performance, including a  statement that \nSingletary’s “business partner” was to blame for Alpine’s failures and that “a business \npartner was being removed from Alpine.”  (V. Compl. ¶¶ 18–20; Morgan Aff. ¶ 30, Ex. \nI.)  For his part, Singletary alleges  that Morgan made an unauthorized withdrawal \n \n \n \n \nof $1,000 from Alpine’s operating account  on April 25, 2016 , (Singletary 2nd Aff.  \n¶ 23), and failed to pay Alpine  approximately $2,500 Singletary contends Morgan \nowed the Company, (Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 24).  \n9. Apparently in response to this deteriorating relationship, Singletary, while \nstill the member -manager of Alpine, created Turn-Pro Management Services, LLC \n(“Turn-Pro”) on May 13, 2016  to provide the same services  as Alpine.  (V. Compl. \n¶¶  21–22, 24; Morgan Aff. ¶ 31, Ex. J; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶¶ 31–32; Singletary Dep. \n75:19–25, 217:9– 22.)  Singletary was and remains  Turn-Pro’s sole member  and \nmanager.  (V. Compl. ¶ 23; Morgan Aff. ¶ 31, Ex. J.)  \n10. Singletary candidly acknowledge s that while  acting as Alpine’s member-\nmanager, he transferred funds, contracts , and assets of Alpine to Turn -Pro without \nMorgan’s knowledge or consent .  (Singletary Dep. 54:3– 25, 74:12–75:18, 77:20–23, \n86:16–24, 105:9– 106:2, 216:8– 217:25.)  For example, Singletary transferred funds \nfrom Alpine’s operating account to Turn -Pro on May 19, 2016 and again on May 25, \n2016 in the amounts of $ 1,200.00 and $1,750 .00, respectively.  (V. Compl. ¶ 25; \nMorgan Aff. ¶ 33, Ex. O; Singletary Dep. 216:8–217:22.)  That same month, Singletary \ntransferred Alpine’s “insurance polic[ies]” to Turn-Pro.  (V. Compl. ¶ 27; Morgan Aff. \n¶ 34,  Ex. P; Singletary Dep. 217:9 –22.)  Most significantly, Singletary assigned \nAlpine’s Ardmore  and Grubb  Contracts to Turn -Pro—executing assignment \ndocuments on behalf of both Alpine and Turn- Pro—all without Morgan’s knowledge \nor consent.  (V. Compl. ¶ 26; Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 32, 41, Exs. K–N; Singletary Dep. 54:3–\n25, 74:12–75:18, 77:20–23, 86:16–24, 217:9–22, 219:1–222:25; Index Singletary 2nd \n \n \n \n \nAff. Ex. F.)  As a result  of Singletary’s actions, Alpine had no assets by June \n2016.  (Morgan Aff. ¶ 35.) \n11. After the assignment of the Grubb Contract , Turn-Pro began providing \nservices for Grubb Properties in May and June 2016  for which Turn -Pro received \npayment.  Turn-Pro did not remit any of these sums to Alpine.  ( Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 40–\n41; Singletary Dep. 105:9–106:2.)  Alpine also received funds from Ardmore under the \nArdmore Contracts during this time.  Although Ardmore’s payments under th ese \ncontracts were paid to Alpine , Singletary transferred the paid funds from Alpine to \nTurn-Pro without consideration to Alpine.  (Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 33, 41, Ex. O; Singletary \nDep. 105:9–106:2.)  \n12. At some point in June 2016, Morgan became aware of Singletary’s conduct, \nand, on June 15, 2016, e -mailed Ardmore and Grubb Properties  to advise that \nSingletary’s transfers of the Ardmore and Grubb C ontracts to Turn -Pro were \nunauthorized and invalid.  (V. Compl. ¶ 29; Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 36– 38; Singletary 2nd  \nAff. ¶ 35; Index Singletary 2nd Aff. Ex. D, at 13–16, Ex. E.)  \n13. Ardmore and Grubb Properties  soon expressed confusion and frustration \nover whether Alpine or Turn -Pro was to service their contracts and to which entity \nthey were to send their communications, complaints, and payments.  (Singletary 2nd \nAff. ¶ 44; Index Singletary 2nd Aff.  Ex. D, at 18 , Ex. J, at 37 .)  Shortly thereafter, \nGrubb Properties cancelled the Grubb Contract by “back-dat[ing]” a letter cancelling \nthe contract on May 1, 2016 as to be effective June 1, 2016, (Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 44; \nIndex Singletary 2nd Aff.  Ex. F) , and, on July 11, 2016, Ardmore cancelled the \n \n \n \n \nArdmore Contracts , ( Morgan Aff. ¶  40, Ex. R ; Singletary 2nd Aff.  ¶ 43; Index \nSingletary 2nd Aff.  Ex. D, at 21 ).  Ardmore also ceased consideration of a fourth \ncontract with Alpine —to provide services for Ardmo re’s Cates Creek apartment \ncomplex—around this same time.  (Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 22, 40, Ex. R; Singletary 2nd Aff. \n¶ 43; Singletary Dep. 105:1–106:13; Index Singletary 2nd Aff. Ex. D, at 21.)  \n14. The cancellation of the Ardmore and Grubb Contracts eliminated Alpine’s \nand Turn-Pro’s primary sources of revenue, quickly le ading to the deterioration of \nboth businesses.  Morgan and Singletary thereafter exchanged demands and counter-\ndemands, as discussed below.  Their inability to resolve their dispute u ltimately led \nMorgan to commence this litigation in January 2018.  Shortly thereafter, on February \n28, 2018, Alpine was administratively dissolved for failure to file an annual report.  \n(Morgan Aff. ¶ 47, Ex. S.)  \nII.  \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \n15. Prior to the commencement of this litigation, Morgan ’s counsel  sent a \nChapter 57D records and information demand (the “Records Demand”)  on June 8, \n2016 addressed to Singletary at 4404 Firwood Lane, Charlotte, N.C. 28209  \n(“Charlotte Address”), asking Singletary, as Alpine’s managing member, to permit \ninspection of certain of Alpine’s records and information no later than June 22, 2016.  \n(V. Compl. ¶ ¶ 31–32, Ex. B; Singletary 2nd Aff.  ¶ 33.)  Singletary confirmed that \nAlpine received the Records Demand, (Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 33), and it is undisputed \n \n \n \n \nthat Singletary did not respond or provide the requested documents or information , \n(Morgan Aff. ¶ 32).  \n16. On August 10, 2017, Morgan’s counsel mailed a letter (the “Demand Letter”) \nby first class mail, addressed to Alpine , in care of Singletary as Alpine’s managing \nmember, at the Charlotte Address, (V. Compl. Ex. A; Pl.’s Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. \nJ. All Claims & Countercls . [hereinafter “Pl.’s Reply”] Ex. A, at ¶¶ 3 –6, Ex. 1 \n[hereinafter “Traynum Aff.”], ECF No. 55.1), demanding that Alpine remedy certain \nalleged misconduct that Morgan claimed had been “facilitated by [Singletary] with \nregard to the Company [,]” (V. Compl. Ex. A; see also  Morgan Aff. ¶ 46).  That same \nday, Morgan’s counsel sent the Demand Letter by e -mail to Singletary, again as \nAlpine’s managing member, to the e -mail address rob@singletarygroup.com.  \n(Traynum Aff. ¶ 7 , Ex. 2 .)  Significantly for purposes of these Motions, Singletary \ncontends that he, and thus Alpine, never received the Demand Letter  from Morgan \nin any form .  ( Singletary 2nd Aff.  ¶¶ 7–8, 10; Br. Supp. Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 2 –3, \nECF No. 51 ; Aff. Robert M. Singletary [hereinafter “Singletary 1st Aff.”] ¶¶ 6–7, 9, \nECF No. 50.)  \n17. On January 29, 2018, Morgan  filed this action , in both his individual \ncapacity and derivatively on behalf of Alpine,  against Turn-Pro, Singletary, and \nAlpine.  Morgan assert ed (i) derivative claims against Singletary for breach of \nfiduciary duty, construct ive fraud, and conversion; (ii) a derivative claim against \nTurn-Pro for constructive trust; (iii) derivative claims against Singletary and Turn -\nPro for tortious interference with contract, tortious interference with prospective \n \n \n \n \neconomic advantage, usurpati on of corporate opportunities, unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75 -1.1, and punitive damages; (iv) an individual \nclaim against Alpine for the exercise of information rights under N.C.G.S. §   57D-3-\n04; and (v) individual and derivative claims against Alpine for judicial dissolution  \nunder N.C.G.S. § 57D-6-02.  (V. Compl. 6–16.)  \n18. On May 25, 2018, Singletary, for himself and on behalf of Alpine, and Alpine, \nin its own name, filed their Answer to the Complaint and asserted counterclaims  \nagainst Morgan for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices under section 75 -1.1, violation of N.C.G.S. § 57D- 4-05, tortious \ninterference with contract, violation of N.C.G.S. §§  14-453, 454, 456, and 458 , and \nviolation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. § 2510-22, \nfor which they sought actual and punitive damages,  attorneys’ fees and costs,  and \njudicial dissolution of Alpine under N.C.G.S. § 57D-6-02.  (Mot. Dismiss & Ans. All \nDefs. & Derivative & Direct Countercls . Alpine [hereinafter “Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss”], \nECF No. 16.)  \n19. On January 30, 2019, Alpine withdrew its counterclaim against Morgan for \nbreach of fiduciary duty.  (ECF No. 34.)  \n20. On April 4, 2019, Morgan dismissed his section 75 -1.1 claim without \nprejudice, (ECF No. 38) , and on May 9, 2019, dismissed his  claims for conversion, \nusurpation of corporate opportunities, constructive trust, and for information rights \nunder section 57D-3-04, also without prejudice, (ECF No. 40).  \n \n \n \n \n21. On May 9, 2019, Morgan filed the Morgan Motion , (ECF No. 41 ), and on \nJune 10, 2019, Singletary, acting pro se, filed the Singletary Motion , (ECF No. 49).  \nIn support of his Motion, Singletary also filed two affidavits he signed under oath, his \nfirst on June 10, 2019, (Singletary 1st Aff.), and his second on June 11, 2019, with an \naccompanying index of exhibits, (Singletary 2nd Aff.; Index Singletary 2nd Aff.).  \n22. After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motions on July 23, 2019, \nat which Morgan was represented by counsel, Singletary appeared pro se, and Turn-\nPro did not appear.1  The Motions are now ripe for resolution.  \nIII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n23. Under Rule 56 of the North Carolina Rule s of Civil Procedure  (“Rule(s)”), \nsummary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and tha t any party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c) .  “An issue is ‘genuine’ if it \ncan be proven by substantial evidence and a fact is ‘material’ if it would constitute or \nirrevocably establish any material element of a claim or a defense.”  CSX Transp., \n                                            \n1 Turn-Pro was originally represented by counsel in this action, but upon proper motion, the \nCourt permitted Turn -Pro’s counsel to withdraw by order dated February 20, 2019.  No \nsuccessor counsel has appeared.  As an unrepresented limited liability company,  Turn-Pro \nwas precluded from pro se participation in the hearing under well-established North Carolina \nlaw.  See, e.g., LexisNexis, Div. of Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Travishan Corp., 155 N.C. App. 205, \n209, 573 S.E.2d 547, 549 (2002) ( holding “a corporation must be represented by a duly \nadmitted and licensed attorney -at-law and cannot proceed pro se”); see also, e.g ., Carter v. \nMaximov, No. COA10-1408, 2011 N.C. App. LEXIS 1767 , at *7 –8 (N.C. Ct. App. Aug. 16, \n2011) (dismissing appeal in part because non- attorney plaintiff could not represent \ncorporation in litigation).   \n \n \n \n \nInc. v. City of Fayetteville, 247 N.C. App. 517, 521, 785 S.E.2d 760, 763 (2016) (citation \nomitted).  “  ‘Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion ’ and means ‘more than a scintilla \nor a permissible inference.’ ”  United Cmty. Bank (Ga.) v. Wolfe , 369 N.C. 555, 558, \n799 S.E.2d 269, 271 (2017) ( quoting Ussery v. Branch Banking & Tr.  Co., 368 N.C. \n325, 335, 777 S.E.2d 272, 278–79 (2015)).  \n24. Under Rule 56, “ [e]vidence presented by the parties is viewed in the light \nmost favorable to the non-movant.”  Summey v. Barker, 357 N.C. 492, 496, 586 S.E.2d \n247, 249 (2003) (citation omitted); see also Smith v. Beasley, 298 N.C. 798, 801, 259 \nS.E.2d 907, 909 (1979)  (“It is the fu nction of the  jury alone to weigh the evidence, \ndetermine the credibility of the witnesses and the probative force to be given their \ntestimony, and determine what the evidence proves or fails to prove.”).  The movant \nbears the burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists.  Liberty \nMut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002).  T he \nmoving party  can meet  this burden  by proving that “an essential element of the \nopposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by \nan affirmative defense” or by  showing “through discovery that the opposing party \ncannot produce evidence to support an essential element of [his or] her claim [.]”  \nDobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77,  83, 530 S.E.2d 829,  835 (2000).  If the moving party \nmeets its burden, then “the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast \nof evidence demonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he \ncan at least establish  a prima facie case at trial .”  Patel v. Scottsdale Ins. Co. , 221 \n \n \n \n \nN.C. App. 476, 480, 728 S.E.2d 394, 397 (2012) (quoting Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. \nApp. 778, 784–85, 534 S.E.2d 660, 664 (2000)).  \nIV. \nANALYSIS \nA.  Singletary’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n25. Singletary moves for summary judgment on  all of Morgan’s derivative \nclaims and opposes the Morgan Motion on those same claims  on the ground  that \nMorgan failed to make a proper pre-suit demand as required under N.C.G.S. § 57D-\n8-01(a)(2).  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 49.)  That provision requires that prior \nto asserting a derivative claim, an LLC member must have: \nmade written demand on the LLC to take suitable action, and either (i) \nthe LLC notified the member that the member’s demand was rejected, \n(ii) 90 days have expired from the date the demand was made, or (iii) \nirreparable injury to the LLC would result by waiting for the expiration \nof the 90-day period. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2).  “ ‘A party’s standing to bring a derivative claim depends \non’ compliance with ‘the demand requirement’ in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D-8-01(a)(2).”  \nAzure Dolphin, LLC v. Barton, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 90, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. \n2, 2017), aff’d, 371 N.C. 579, 821 S.E.2d 711 (2018) (quoting Petty v. Morris, 2014 \nNCBC LEXIS 67, at *4 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 16, 2014)). \n26. Here, Singletary offers his own sworn testimony averring that he never \nreceived the Demand Letter, either by first class mail, e- mail, or otherwise.  ( Br. \nSupp. Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 2–3; Singletary 1st Aff.  ¶¶ 6–7, 9; Singletary 2nd Aff.  \n¶¶  7–8, 10.)  Singletary also offers evidence he contends shows that Morgan failed to \n \n \n \n \nmail the Demand Letter to his and Alpine’s correct  address, asserting that Alpine \nchanged its address on August 4, 2017 from the Charlotte Address to an address in \nClemmons, North Carolina (“Clemmons Address”).  (Br. Supp. Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. \n2–3; Singletary 1st Aff. ¶¶ 6, 9; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶¶ 7, 10.)   \n27. In opposition, Morgan has offered unrebutted evidence that his counsel  \nplaced the Demand Letter in first class mail on August 10, 2017 addressed to Alpine, \nin care of Singletary, at the Charlotte Address, (V. Compl. Ex. A; Traynum Aff. ¶¶  3–\n6, Ex. 1 ), the address reflected in Alpine’s latest annual report  (filed July 1, 2016) , \n(Pl.’s Reply Ex. B, Ex. 1, ECF No. 55.2).  Morgan also offers unrebutted evidence that \nhis counsel e- mailed the Demand Letter  on August 10, 2017 to \nrob@singletarygroup.com, (Traynum Aff. ¶ 7), the e-mail address Singletary has used \nto communicate successfully with the Court in this matter.   \n28. The Motions require the Court to  determine what constitutes  proper \ndemand under section 57D -8-01(a)(2).  Although section 57D-8-01(a)(2) specifically \nrequires a derivative demand on an LLC to be in writing , it does not specify the \nmanner in which th e demand must be delivered .  N. C.G.S. § 55D -33(d) deals with \nservice on entities through registered agents , the situation here,  and provides tha t \n“[n]othing in this section affects the right to serve any process, notice or demand  \nrequired or permitted by law to be served upon an entity  in any . . . manner now or \nhereafter permitted by law.” (emphasis added).   Under section 57D-8-01(a)(2), \n“[d]elivery is not required to be by registered or certified mail.”  Miller v. Burlington \nChem. Co. , LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6 , at *26 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 27, 2017) \n \n \n \n \n(emphasis added) (citing Petty, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 67, at *18).  I n the corpora tion \ncontext, “ ‘[n]otice’ includes demand[,]” N.C.G.S. § 55 -1-40(15), and “[n]otice may be \ncommunicated . . . by electronic means[ ] or by mail or private carrier[,]”  N.C.G.S. § \n55-1-41(b).  Against this backdrop, the Court concludes that Morgan’s demand \nthrough first class mail and e-mail were permissible methods of delivery for purposes \nof section 57D-8-01(a)(2). \n29. Implicit within the  statute’s language is the requirement that the written \ndemand be delivered , see Miller, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *26, and delivery to the \nLLC must be made through its registered  agent or to “a person or entity that has \nauthority to cause the LLC to reject the demand.”  Russell M. Robinson, II, Robinson \non North Carolina Corporation Law § 34.04[5], at n.61.1 (7th ed. 2018); see also Hilco \nTransp., Inc. v. Atkins, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 5, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 15, 2016)  \n(requiring that proper demand be addressed to “someone with authority to act on \nbehalf of the corporation”); Petty, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 67, at *17 (concluding that “any \nresponse . . . must be made by those with authority to act on behalf of the \ncorporation”).   \n30. The demand requirement exists to give a corporation or LLC the opportunity \n“to remedy the alleged problem without resort to judicial action, or, if ” resolution \nrequires judicial action, “to bring suit first against the alleged wrongdoers.”  \nZoutewelle v. Mathis, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 13, 2018) \n(quoting Bridges v. Oates, 167 N.C. App. 459, 467–68, 605 S.E.2d 685, 691 (2004)).  \nSince demand is required to permit the LLC to take corrective action, it follows that \n \n \n \n \nthe LLC must receive the demand to fulfill that statutory purpose.  See, e.g., Kane v. \nMoore, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 157,  at *34–35 (N.C. Super. C t. Nov. 26, 2018) ( finding \npre-suit demand untimely based on LLC’s receipt and rejection of demand) ; Miller, \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *27 (finding relevant receipt of demand); Petty, 2014 NCBC \nLEXIS 67, at *9 (same). \n31. It is undisputed that Morgan mailed and e -mailed the Demand L etter to \nSingletary.  Singletary, however, has filed three sworn affidavits averring that he did \nnot receive the Demand Letter either at his physical address or by e-mail.  (Singletary \n1st Aff. ¶¶ 6–7, 9; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶¶ 7–8, 10; Third Aff. Robert M. Singletary  ¶ 6 \n[hereinafter “Singletary 3 rd Affidavit”], ECF No. 58.1 .)  The issue therefore is \nwhether Morgan’s evidence of mailing, and Singletary’s sworn denials, create a \ngenuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment for either Singletary or \nMorgan. \n32. North Carolina recognizes that for “mail properly addressed and stamped, \nthe law presumes the addressee received it.”  Sherrod v. Ins. Ass’n, 139 N.C. 167, 169, \n51 S.E. 910, 911 (1905); see also Gore v. Myrtle/Mueller, 362 N.C. 27, 48, 653 S.E.2d \n400, 413 (2007) (“ [T]he law is that evidence of the mailing of a letter, properly \naddressed and with proper postage, raises a rebuttable presumption that the letter \nwas received by the intended recipient.” (citing Beard v. S. Ry. Co., 143 N.C. 136, 140, \n55 S.E. 505, 506 (1906)) ); Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Page -Myers Oil Co., 255 \nN.C. 167, 171, 120 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1961) (“[I]f the letter was written and mailed . . . , \nthere is a prima facie presumption that it was received.” (citations omitted)). \n \n \n \n \n33. Many courts have concluded that denial  of receipt alone is insufficient to \novercome the presumption of receipt  for Rule 56 purposes.  See, e.g. , McLaughlin v. \nAstrue, 443 F. App’x 571, 574 (1st Cir.  2011) (holding that for denial of applications \nfor disability and supplemental security income benefits, “ it is fairly well- accepted \nthat affidavits that merely . . . allege non-receipt within the five days [after the notice] \nare not sufficient, standing alone, to rebut the presumption”  (citations omitted) ); \nIsaacson v. N.Y. Organ Donor Network, 405 F. App’x 552, 553 (2d Cir. 2011) (holding \nthat “[t]he mere denial of receipt does not rebut [the] presumption” at the summary \njudgment stage (citation omitted)); United States v. Ekong , 518 F.3d 285, 287 (5th \nCir. 2007) (per curiam) ( concluding that “[t]he addressee’s ‘bare assertion of non-\nreceipt’ is insufficient to rebut the assumption” (citation omitted)); Bean v. Perdue, \n316 F. Supp. 3d 220, 230 (D.D.C. 2018) (concluding a plaintiff’s “bare assertion of non-\nreceipt . . . is not sufficient to raise a genuine dispute of fact regarding whether [the \ndefendant] sent the Response Letter”); Goetsch v. Shell Oil Co., 197 F.R.D. 574, 578 \n(W.D.N.C. 2000) (concluding that a “[p]laintiff’s affidavit, in which he simply denies \nreceipt of the [arbitration] notice, is insufficient to undermine the presumption of \nreceipt” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \n34. Other courts, however, have concluded to the contrary , reasoning that a \nperson in Singletary’s position rarely has  affirmative evidence other than a  denial \nand is in a difficult position to prove a negative,  that of non-receipt.  See Lupyan v. \nCorinthian Colls., Inc., 761 F.3d 314, 321–22 (3d Cir. 2014) (“[E]vidence sufficient to \nnullify the presumption of receipt . . . may consist solely of the addressee’s positive \n \n \n \n \ndenial of receipt, creating an issue of fact for the jury” because “where . . . receipt of \na letter is a contested issue, the individual recipient is forced to prove a negative[,]” \nand “[t]he law has long recognized that such an evidentiary feat is next to \nimpossible.”); Seminiano v. Xyris Enter., Inc., 512 F. App’x 735, 735 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(disagreeing with “the categorical proposition” that “a simple denial of receipt is \ninsufficient to rebut the presumption of receipt” because, “depending on the \ncircumstances, that presumption can be rebutted by a credible sworn declaration of \nnon-receipt.” (citation omitted)); In re Yoder Co., 758 F.2d 1114, 1118 (6th Cir. 1985) \n(“Testimony of non-receipt, standing alone, would be sufficient to support a finding of \nnon-receipt; such testimony is therefore sufficient to rebut the presumption of \nreceipt.”).  \n35. North Carolina appears to have cast its lot with th ese latt er courts , \nconcluding that “[e]vidence  of nonreceipt of the letter by the addressee . . . is some \nevidence that the letter was not mailed and raises a question of fact for the trier of \nfact.”  Wilson v. Claude J. Welch Builders Corp., 115 N.C. App. 384, 386, 444 S.E.2d \n628, 629 (1994)  (emphasis added)  (citations omitted) .  In this case, t he evidence \nappears overwhelming that the derivative demand was delivered to Singletary.  The \nletter was properly addressed and both mailed and e-mailed to his current addresses, \nwas never returned, and was never the subject of an e- mail or post office \nundeliverable message.  T here is no evidence that Singletary failed to receive any \nother email at the rob@singletarygroup.com address or any other mail at the \nCharlotte Address or the Clemmons A ddress through USPS mail forwarding.  \n \n \n \n \nNevertheless, Singletary has provided affirmative evidence of nonreceipt through his \nsworn testimony, and the Court concludes North Carolina precedent holds such \nevidence sufficient to raise a question of fact for the jury on that issue.  \n36. Accordingly, both the Singletary Motion on Morgan’s derivative claims and \nthe Morgan Motion seeking the entry of judgment on each of those same claims must \nbe denied on this ground.   \nB.  Morgan’s Motion for Summary Judgment \n37. Morgan, individually and derivatively on behalf of Alpine, seeks entry of \njudgment on his  remaining claims against De fendants and dismissal of all \ncounterclaims asserted against him.  (Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J , ECF No. 41 .)  Morgan  \ncurrently maintains derivative claims against Singletary for breach of fiduciary duty \nand constructive fraud and against Singletary and Turn-Pro for tortious interference \nwith contract and tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, for \nwhich he seeks actual/compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.  (Pl.’s \nMem. Law Supp. Mot. Summ. J. All Claims & Countercls . 7–14 [hereinafter “Pl.’s \nMem. Law”], ECF No. 42.)  Morgan acknowledges that his individual and derivative \nclaim for Alpine’s judicial dissolution is moot  because Alpine has already been \nadministratively dissolved.  \n38. While the Morgan Motion on his derivative claims must be denied due to the \nissue of fact concerning whether Singletary received the Demand Letter , the Court \nnevertheless addresses Morgan’s claims on this Motion to narrow the issues that \n \n \n \n \nmust be resolved by a jury at trial .  Thereafter, the Court addresses the Morgan \nMotion on Singletary and Alpine’s counterclaims.2  \n1. Morgan’s Breach of Fiduciary Duty Claim  \n \n39. Morgan alleges that Singletary, as Alpine’s manager, breached his fiduciary \nduties to Alpine by, among other things, using Alpine’s funds for personal use, \ncreating Turn-Pro to perform Alpine’s work for his own benefit, transferring money \nfrom Alpine’s bank account to Turn-Pro, and transferring the Ardmore and Grubb \nContracts, as well as Alpine’s insurance policies, to Turn-Pro, which resulted in the \ncancellation of Alpine’s contracts by Alpine’s customers.  (Pl.’s Mem. Law 7–8.) \n40.  “In order to establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, plaintiff must \nshow that: (1) defendant owed plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) defendant breached his \nfiduciary duty; and (3) the breach of fiduciary duty was a proximate cause of injury \nto plaintiff.”  See Miller, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *23 (citing Farndale Co., LLC v. \nGibellini, 176 N.C. App. 60, 68, 628 S.E.2d 15, 20 (2006)).  A manager of an LLC owes \na fiduciary duty to the LLC.  Id. (citing N.C.G.S. § 57D-3-21(b)); Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., \nL.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 474, 675 S.E.2d 133, 137 (2009) (“[M]anagers  of a limited \nliability company . . . owe a fiduciary duty to the company[.]”).  Since Singletary was \na member-manager of the Company, (V. Compl. ¶ 4; Morgan Aff. ¶ 7; Singletary 2nd \nAff. ¶ 5), Singletary owed fiduciary duties to Alpine. \n41. As a fiduciary, a “manager shall discharge [his or her] duties (i) in good faith, \n(ii) with the care an ordinary prudent person in a like position would exercise under \n                                            \n2 For ease of reference, the Court shall refer hereafter to the counterclaims asserted directly \nby Alpine and derivatively by Singletary on Alpine’s behalf as “Alpine’s counterclaims.”  \n \n \n \n \nsimilar circumstances, and (iii) subject to the operating agreement, in a manner the \nmanager believes to b e in the best interests of the LLC.”  N.C.G.S. § 57D -3-21(b).  \nSingletary, by his own admission, and Morgan , through other undisputed evidence, \nhave demonstrated that Singletary openly  breached his fiduciary duties to  Alpine \nthrough numerous acts Singletary brazenly committed while he was the member -\nmanager of Alpine, including:  \n(1) his creation of Turn -Pro, an entity he wholly -owned, and his use of \nTurn-Pro to engage in direct competition with Alpine  for which Turn -\nPro received payment without co nsideration to Alpine and without \nMorgan’s knowledge or consent, (V. Compl. ¶¶ 21–24; Morgan Aff. ¶ 31, \nEx. J; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶¶ 31– 32; Singletary Dep. 75:19 –25, 217:9–\n22); \n(2) his transfer of the Ardmore and Grubb C ontracts to Turn -Pro \nwithout consid eration to Alpine and without Morgan’s knowledge or \nconsent, (V. Compl. ¶ 26; Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 32, 41, Exs. K –N; Singletary \nDep. 54:3–25, 74:12–75:18, 77:20–23, 86:1–24, 217:9–22, 219:1–222:25; \nIndex Singletary 2nd Aff. Ex. F); \n(3) his transfer of funds earned and paid to Alpine under Alpine’s service \ncontracts to Turn-Pro without consideration to Alpine and without \nMorgan’s knowledge or consent , (Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 33, 41, 43–44, Ex. O; \nSingletary Dep. 105:9–106:2, 216:8–217:22, 219:1–222:25); and \n \n \n \n \n(4) his transfer of Alpine’s insurance polic ies to Turn -Pro without \nconsideration to Alpine and without Morgan’s knowledge or consent, (V. \nCompl. ¶ 27; Morgan Aff. ¶ 34, Ex. P; Singletary Dep. 217:9–25). \n42. It is also undisputed that Single tary’s actions caused Alpine to suffer \nsubstantial injury, including through the loss (and eventual cancellation) of the \nArdmore and Grubb Contracts, ( Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 32, 40, Exs. N, R ; Singletary Dep. \n54:3–25; Index Singletary 2nd Aff.  Ex. D, at 21 ), the l oss of the Cates Creek \nopportunity with Ardmore, ( Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 22, 40, Ex. R; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 43; \nSingletary Dep. 108:14– 25), and the loss of Alpine assets, including funds from \nAlpine’s bank accounts and sums due on customer contracts later paid to Turn -Pro, \n(Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 33, 41, 43, Ex. O; Singletary Dep. 105:9–106:2, 216:8–217:22, 219:1–\n222:25). \n43. Accordingly, should a jury conclude that Singletary received the Demand \nLetter, the Court concludes that summary judgment is proper establishing \nSingletary’s liability on Morgan’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty. \n2. Morgan’s Constructive Fraud Claim \n \n44. To establish constructive fraud, a  plaintiff must allege facts and \ncircumstances “(1) which created the relation of trust and confidence, and (2) led up \nto and surrounded the consummation of the transaction in which defendant is alleged \nto have taken advantage of his position of trust to the hurt of plaintiff.”  Head v. Gould \nKillian CPA Grp., P.A., 371 N.C. 2, 9, 812 S.E.2d 831, 837 (2018) (quoting Rhodes v. \nJones, 232 N.C. 547, 549, 61 S.E.2d 725, 726 (1950)) .  Additionally, a plaintiff must \n \n \n \n \nallege that, through the defendant’s misconduct, the defendant sought to benefit \nhimself and th e plaintiff was injured.  Nelson v. Alliance Hosp. Mgmt., LLC, 2011 \nNCBC LEXIS 43, at *22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 22, 2011)  (citation omitted); see also \nHauser v. Hauser, 252 N.C. App. 10, 16, 796 S.E.2d 391, 395 (2017) (“The primary \ndifference between pleading a claim for constructive fraud an d one for breach of \nfiduciary duty  is the constructive fraud requirement that the defendant benefit  \nhimself.” (quoting White v. Consol. Planning, Inc., 166 N.C. App. 283, 294, 603 S.E.2d \n147, 156 (2004))). \n45. As discussed above, Morgan has established Singletary’s breach of fiduciary \nduty.  To establish his claim for constructive fraud, Morgan  must also show through \nundisputed evidence that Singletary benefited himself through his misconduct.  \nMorgan more th an meets his burden here because each of the listed actions \nsupporting breach (i.e., Singletary’s transfers of Alpine’s contracts and funds to his \nwholly-owned entity Turn-Pro) directly benefited Singletary  as sole owner  of Turn-\nPro at the expense of Alpin e.  Viewing the record in the light most favorable to \nSingletary, the Court concludes that, should a jury conclude that Singletary received \nthe Demand Letter, summary judgment should be entered establishing Singletary’s \nliability for constructive fraud as a matter of law. \n3. Morgan’s Tortious Interference with Contract Claim \n \n46. To establish a claim for tortious interference with contract, a plaintiff must \nprove:  \n(1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third person which \nconfers upon the plaintiff a contractual right against a third person; (2) \n \n \n \n \nthe defendant knows of the contract; (3) the defendant intentionally \ninduces the third person not to perform the contract; (4) and in doing so \nacts without justification; (5) resulting in actual damage to the plaintiff.  \n \nBeverage Sys. of the Carolinas, LLC v. Associated Beverage Repair, LLC, 368 N.C. \n693, 700, 784 S.E.2d 457, 462 (2016) (quoting United Labs., Inc v. Kuykendall , 322 \nN.C. 643, 661, 370 S.E.2d 375, 387 (1988)).   \n47. Morgan contends here that Singletary tortiously interfered with Alpine’s \nArdmore and Grubb Contracts as a matter of law.  The Court agrees.  It is undisputed \nthat those contracts were valid and binding, ( Morgan Aff.  ¶¶ 13– 18, Exs. A –D; \nSingletary 2nd Aff.  ¶ 17; Index Singletary 2nd Aff.  Ex. F), that Singletary knew of \nthem as Alpine’s member-manager, (V. Compl. ¶¶ 13, 26; Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 10, 32, 41, \nExs. I, K–N; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶¶ 15, 17; Singletary Dep. 54:3–25, 77:20–23, 86:16–\n24, 217:9–22, 219:1–222:25; Index Singletary 2nd Aff.  Ex. F ), that Singletary \nintentionally induced Ardmore and Grubb not to perform the contracts with Alpine, \n(Morgan Aff. ¶ 32, Exs. K–N; Singletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 32; Singletary Dep. 54:3–25), that \nhe did so to further his own interest at the expense of Alpine in violation of his legal \nduties as a member -manager of Alpine, see, e.g ., Childress v. Abeles, 240 N.C. 667, \n675, 84 S.E.2d 176, 182 (1954) (Malice “denotes the intentional doing of the harmful \nact without legal justification.”); Sellers v. Morton, 191 N.C. App. 75, 82, 661 S.E.2d \n915, 921 (2008) (“A complainant must show that the defendant acted with malice and \nfor a reason not reasonably related to the protection of a legitimate business interest \nof the defending party.”), and that Alpine suffered actual damage as a result , (V. \n \n \n \n \nCompl. ¶ 26; Morgan Aff.  ¶¶ 32, 35, 41, 43–45, Exs. K–N; Singletary Dep. 54:3–25, \n77:20–23, 86:16–24, 217:9–22, 219:1–222:25). \n48. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Singletary, the Court \nconcludes that, should a jury conclude that Singletary received the Demand Letter, \nsummary judgment is properly entered establishing Singletary’s liability on Morgan’s \nclaim for tortious interference with contract as a matter of law.   \n4. Morgan’s Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage \nClaim \n \n49.  “To state a claim for wrongful interference with prospective advantage, [ a \nplaintiff] must allege facts to show that the defendants acted without justification in \n‘inducing a third party to refrain from entering into a contract with them which \ncontract would have ensued but for the interference.’ ”  Islet Scis., Inc. v. Brighthaven \nVentures, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 6, 2017) (quoting \nWalker v. Sloan , 137 N.C. App. 387, 3 93, 529 S.E.2d 236, 242 (2000) ).  “Mere \nexpectation of a continuing business relationship is insufficient”; rather, “a plaintiff \nmust produce evidence that a contract would have resulted but for a defendant’s \nmalicious intervention.”  Beverage Sys., 368 N.C. at 701, 784 S.E.2d at 463 (citing \nDalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 655, 548 S.E.2d 704, 710 (2001)).   \n50. The undisputed evidence shows that Ardmore directed Alpine to write a \ncontract for Ardmore’s  Cates Creek property on  June 1, 2016.  (Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 22, \n40, Ex. E.)   The undisputed evidence further shows that A rdmore canceled the \nArdmore Contracts and ceased negotiating the  Cates Creek contract just a month \nlater in July 2016 due to  “the continuing confusion and problems with Alpine [,]” \n \n \n \n \n(Index Singletary 2nd Aff.  Ex. D, at 21 ; see also Morgan Aff.  ¶¶ 22 , 40, Ex. R ; \nSingletary 2nd Aff. ¶ 43; Singletary Dep. 108:14–25), problems caused by Singletary’s \nunauthorized and unilateral assignment of the Ardmore Contracts to Turn- Pro.  As \na result, the undisputed evidence establishes  that but for Singletary’s tortious \ninterference with Alpine’s Cates Creek contract negotiations, Alpine would have \nsuccessfully reached an agreement for that property with Ardmore.  \n51. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Singletary, the Court \nconcludes that, should a jury conclude that Singletary received the Demand Letter, \nsummary judgment is properly entered establishing Singletary’s liability on Morgan’s \nclaim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage as a matter of \nlaw. \n5. Morgan’s Claim for Actual/Compensatory Damages \n \n52. Morgan seeks entry of judgment as to his actual/compensatory damages on \neach of his affirmative claims for relief.  Singletary acknowledged at his deposition \nthat Alpine’s future net profits on its Ardmore and Grubb Contracts, calculated over \nfive years, would total $439,546.95.  He also acknowledged that Alpine would have \nreceived annual revenue of $38,880.00  for the prospective Cates Creek contract, or \n$194,400.00 over a five-year period.  (Singletary Dep. 107:1–108:13, 113:1–114:13; see \nalso Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 22, 27; Pl.’s Mem. Law  12.)  Morgan seeks judgment in these \ntotal amounts, (Pl.’s Mem. Law 12), but without calculating the present value of these \nincome streams.  Because Morgan is seeking to be paid today the full value of a net \nincome stream into the future, the Court concludes that judgment in the amount \n \n \n \n \nsought is not proper and that damages must be based on net present value after the \npresentation of evidence and , if appropriate,  expert testimony.  Accordingly, the \nMorgan Motion shall be denied to this extent. \n53. Morgan also seeks damages of $4,987.29 for Singletary’s unauthorized \npurchases and misuse of Alpine’s operating account.  (Pl.’s Mem. Law 12.)  Morgan’s \nproffered evidence, however, consisting of numerous bank statements and debit card \nand operating account transactions attached as Exhibits G and H to his Motion, does \nnot clearly identify which transactions he claims are unauthorized and why .  The \nCourt thus denies the Morgan Motion as to these sums.   \n54. Finally, Morgan claims damages to Alpine of $2,950.00  for Singletary’s \nunauthorized payments from Alpine to Turn- Pro.  (Pl.’s Mem. Law  12.)  It is \nundisputed that Singletary transferred $2,950.00 via checks from Alpine’s operating \naccount to Turn-Pro on May 19 and 25, 2016 without Morgan’s knowledge or consent.  \n(Morgan Aff. ¶  33, Ex. O ; Singletary Dep. 216:8– 217:22.)  As such, the Court \nconcludes that, should a jury conclude that Singletary received the Demand Letter, \nentry of judgment for Alpine in the amount of $2,950 is proper as a matter of law for \nthese payments.   \n6. Morgan’s Claim for Punitive Damages \n \n55. Morgan also seeks entry of judgment as to punitive damages.  In light of the \nCourt’s conclusions concerning actual/ compensatory damages above, and given that \nthe Court concludes that a reasonable jury could , but is not required to,  find that \nSingletary has engaged in fraud, malice, or willful or wanton conduct  sufficient to \n \n \n \n \nentitle Morgan and Alpine to punitive damages, the Court will deny Morgan’s motion \nas to punitive damages and defer the issue of punitive damages to a jury at trial.  \n7. Alpine’s Counterclaims \n56. Morgan also moves for summary judgment dismissing each of Alpine’s \ncounterclaims against him with prejudice.  Like Morgan’s dissolution claim, \nSingletary’s claim for judicial dissolution is moot and shall be dismissed.  The Court \naddresses Alpine’s other counterclaims in turn.  \na. Breach of Contract \n57. First, Alpine contends that Morgan breached Alpine’s operating agreement \nby contacting Alpine customers and making statements  to customers damaging to \nAlpine.  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 26–28.)  “The elements of a claim for breach of contract \nare (1) existence of a valid  contract and (2) breach of the terms of that  contract.”  \nBrennan Station 1671, LP v. Borovsky , 821 S.E.2d 640, 645 (N.C. Ct. App. 2018)  \n(quoting Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000)).  Here, there \nis no written operating agreement, but it is undisputed that the parties orally agreed \nthat Singletary and Morgan would be Alpine’s only members, that Singletary would \nact as manager and manage Alpine’s day -to-day affairs, and that section 57D would \nsupply the operating agreement’s terms.  (Morgan Aff. ¶¶ 6–7, 10); see also N.C.G.S. \n§ 57D-1-03(23) (“[An] operating agreement may be in any form, including written, \noral, or implied, or any combination thereof.”). \n58. The undisputed evidence requires dismissal of Alpine’s counterclaim.  \nNothing in the partie s’ oral agreement or in Chapter 57D prohibit ed Morgan from \n \n \n \n \ncontacting Alpine’s customers, and the only evidence of Morgan’s communications \nwith customers does not support Alpine’s contention that such communications were \ndetrimental to Alpine.  To the contrary, the undisputed evidence shows that Morgan’s \ncommunications were consistent with the parties’ oral operating agreement and \nintended to protect Alpine’s contracts from Singletary’s ultimately successful (and \nimproper) efforts to move those contract s from Alpine to Turn -Pro.  As such, Alpine \nhas failed to offer any evidence to support its breach of contract counterclaim against \nMorgan, and that claim must therefore be dismissed. \nb. Section 75-1.1 \n59. Alpine next asserts an unfair and deceptive trade practices claim under \nsection 75-1.1 against Morgan for allegedly removing funds from Alpine’s checking \naccount, presenting false invoices to customers of Alpine, and improperly contacting \nAlpine’s customers.  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 24 –26.)  N.C.G.S. § 75- 1.1(a) makes plain, \nhowever, that “[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair \nor deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are declared unlawful. ” \n(emphasis added).  The Supreme Court of North Carolina has recognized that “a ny \nunfair or deceptive practices . . . solely related to the internal operations of [ ] a \nbusiness will not give rise to a claim under the Act ” because “ ‘[t]hey are not . . . “in \nor affecting commerce[.]” ’ ” White v. Thompson, 364 N.C. 47, 52, 691 S.E.2d 676, 679 \n(2010) (quoting HAJMM Co. v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc. , 328 N.C. 578, 594–95, \n403 S.E.2d 483, 493 (1991)).   \n \n \n \n \n60. Alpine’s section 75 -1.1 counterclaim reflects a purely internal dispute \nbetween Alpine’s two members over the authority Singletary and Morgan had to act \non behalf of Alpine.  As such, Morgan’s alleged conduct is not “in or affecting \ncommerce,” and Alpine’s section 75-1.1 claim must therefore be dismissed. \nc. N.C.G.S. § 57D-4-05 \n61. Alpine also asserts a  claim for violation of section 57D -4-05, (Defs.’ Mot. \nDismiss 29), which states: “ No distribution may be made by an LLC if, after giving \neffect to the distribution, either of the following would occur: (1)  The LLC would not \nbe able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business.  (2)  The \nLLC’s total liabilities would exceed the value of the LLC’s assets.”  N.C.G.S § 57D-4-\n05(a).  “If a distribution is made in violation of G.S. 57D -4-05, then each manager or \nother company official who alone or with other company officials had the authority to \nand did approve the distribution is personally liable to the LLC[.]”  Id. § 57D-4-06(a).  \nNevertheless, “a proceeding under this subsection is barred unless it is commenced \nwithin two years after the distribution [at issue].”  Id. (emphasis added). \n62. It is undisputed that the allegedly improper distribution here occurred on \nMay 2, 2016, (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 29), and that Alpine’s answer and counterclaim \nunder section 57D -4-05 was first filed over two years later, on May 25, 2018, ( ECF \nNo. 16).  The counterclaim thus is time-barred and must be dismissed on this basis. \nd. Tortious Interference with Contract \n63. Alpine alleges that Morgan tortiously interfered with Alpine’s contracts by \ninducing Alpine’s customers to terminate their contracts with  Alpine.  (Defs.’ Mot. \n \n \n \n \nDismiss 30–31.)  The Court has set forth in section IV.4.B above the elements of a  \nclaim for tortious interference with contract under North Carolina law.  Elements  \nthree (that the defendant intentionally induced the third person not to perform the \ncontract) and four (that in so doing the defendant acted without justification) are of \ninterest here.  See Beverage Sys., 368 N.C. at 700, 784 S.E.2d at 462.   \n64. Specifically, there is no evidence in  the record that suggests that Morgan \nsought to cause Alpine’s customers not to perform their contracts with Alpine.  To the \ncontrary, it is undisputed that all of Morgan’s outreach to third parties was to induce \nAlpine’s customers to perform their contracts with Alpine.  Alpine has failed to proffer \nevidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that Morgan intentionally \ninduced a third person not to perform a contract with Alpine , requiring dismissal of \nthis counterclaim. \n65.  Moreover, there is no evidence that Morgan’s acts were anything other than \na “reasonable and bona fide attempt” to protect Alpine’s legitimate business interests, \nand there is no evidence that Morgan acted through means that were unlawful, a \nfurther, and independent, basis for dismissal.  Se e, e.g., Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. \nHooks, 322 N.C. 216, 221, 367 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1988) ( “[C]ompetition in business \nconstitutes justifiable interference in another ’s business relations and is not \nactionable so long as it is carried on in furtherance of one ’s own interests and by \nmeans that are lawful.”). \n \n \n \n \ne. N.C.G.S. § 14-458 – Computer Trespass \n66. Alpine’s next claim for relief is for computer trespass under section  14-458 \nand its related provisions.  This counterclaim is based on the contention that Morgan \nchanged Singletary’s password in May 2016 to block him from using the Alpine e -\nmail account.  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 31 –32.)  N.C.G.S. §  14-458(a) provides that “ it \nshall be unlawful for any person to use a computer or computer network without \nauthority and with the intent to” disable, alter, or copy computer data.  “[A] person is \n‘without authority’ when . . . the person has no right or permission of the owner to \nuse a computer, or the person uses a computer in a manner exceeding the right or \npermission[.]”  Id. § 14-458(a)(6).  A claim for violation of this statute must be brought \nwithin one year of the alleged trespass.  Id. § 1-539.2A(b); id. § 1-54.   \n67. Here, Alpine’s counterclaim was brought in May 2018, (ECF No. 16), at least \ntwo years after the alleged statutory violation , and thus must be dismissed as time -\nbarred.  Moreover, it is undisputed that Morgan was the administrator of the Alpine \ndomain and h ad associated authority to access all of Alpine’s e -mail accounts, \nincluding Singletary’s.  (Morgan Aff. ¶ 11 .)  Those undisputed facts establish that  \nMorgan’s alleged conduct was within his authority  under the parties’ oral operating \nagreement.  As a result, Morgan’s conduct did not constitute a violation of section 14-\n458 as a matter of law  and, for this separate reason, Alpine’s computer trespass \ncounterclaim must be dismissed. \n \n \n \n \nf. 18 U.S.C. § 2510–22 – Electronic Communications Privacy Act  \n68. Alpine also alle ges that Morgan violated the federal Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. § 2510 –22 (“ECPA”), by reviewing \nSingletary’s e-mails after hacking into Singletary’s account.  (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 25–\n26, 32.)  The ECPA provides “ a civil remedy against any person who ‘ intentionally \nintercepts’ another person’s wire, oral, or electronic communications. ”  Abraham v. \nCty. of Greenville, 237 F.3d 386, 389 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a)).  \nUnder the ECPA, “[t] he term ‘ intercept’ means the acquisition of such \ncommunications through the use of any ‘ electronic, mechanical, or other device [,]’ ”  \nid. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2510(4) ), but does not apply to communications that are in \n“electronic storage[,]”  Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Serv ., 36 \nF.3d 457, 461–62 (5th Cir. 1994), including e-mails that have already been received, \nNovelPoster v. Javitch Canfield Grp. , 140 F. Supp. 3d 938, 952 (N.D. Cal. 2014) ; see \nalso United States v. Reyes, 922 F. Supp. 818, 836 (S.D .N.Y. 1996) (“Taken together, \nthe definitions thus imply a requirement that the acquisition of [electronic \ncommunications] be simultaneous with the original transmission of the data.”). \n69. Alpine contends here only that Morgan reviewed Singletary’s e- mails after \nSingletary had received them, and there is no evidence that Morgan acquired any of \nSingletary’s e-mails simultaneously with their original transmission.  (Morgan Aff. \n¶¶ 11, 36.)   As a result, there is no evidence in the record from which a jury could \nconclude that Morgan violated the ECPA, and this claim, too, must be dismissed as a \nmatter of law.  See, e.g., NovelPoster, 140 F. Supp. 3d at 952 (“[R]eading emails that \n \n \n \n \nhave already been received in an email account’s inbox does not constitute \n‘interception’ under the statute.” (citation omitted)).  \ng. Punitive Damages and Costs and Attorneys’ Fees \n70. Having concluded that each of Alpine’s counterclaims should be dismissed, \nthe Court further concludes that Alpine’s claim for punitive damages necessarily fails \nand must likewise be dismissed.   \n71. Similarly, given the Court’s conclusions concerning the validity of Morgan’s \naffirmative claims for relief, the Court concludes that Alpine’s claim for attorneys’ \nfees and costs under N.C.G.S. § 57D -8-05—which is based the contention that \nMorgan’s action was “commenced or maintained without cause or for an improper \npurpose” and included pleadings “ not well grounded in fact or . . . not warranted by \nexisting law or a good -faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of \nexisting law”—is wholly without merit and should also be dismissed.  \nV. \n \nCONCLUSION \n72. WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing, the Court hereby ORDERS  as \nfollows: \na. The Singletary Motion is DENIED. \nb. The Morgan Motion seeking dismissal of each of Alpine’s counterclaims \nis GRANTED, and those counterclaims are hereby dismissed with \nprejudice.  \n \n \n \n \nc. The Morgan Motion seeking judgment on his own claims is DENIED; \nprovided, however, that should a jury conclude that Singletary received \nthe Demand Letter, the Court concludes and rules as follows: \ni. The Morgan Motion seeking to establish Singletary’s  liability on \nMorgan’s breach of fiduciary duty claim is GRANTED; \nii. The Morgan Motion seeking to establish Singletary’s liability on  \nMorgan’s constructive fraud claim is GRANTED; \niii. The Morgan Motion seeking to establish Singletary’s liability on  \nMorgan’s tortious interference with contract claim is GRANTED; \niv. The Morgan Motion seeking to establish Singletary’s liability on  \nMorgan’s tortious interference with p rospective economic \nadvantage claim is GRANTED;  \nv. The Morgan Motion seeking to establish Singletary’s liability  on \nMorgan’s claim for judicial dissolution is DENIED as moot;  \nvi. The Morgan Motion seeking to establish Morgan’s actual / \ncompensatory damages on each of Singletary’s claims  is \nGRANTED in part , such that Morgan shall have and recover \nfrom Singletary damages in the amount of $2,950.00 together \nwith post-judgment interest at the legal rate until the judgment \nis satisfied, but is otherwise DENIED; and \nvii. The Morgan Motion seeking to establish punitive damages as a \nmatter of law is DENIED. \n \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 15th day of January, 2020. \n \n     /s/ Louis A.
