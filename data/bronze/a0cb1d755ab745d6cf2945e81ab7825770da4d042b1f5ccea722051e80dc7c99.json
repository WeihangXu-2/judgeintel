This putative class action is one of two related cases by four North \nCarolina-licensed chiropractors (“Plaintiffs”) who assert that  HNS’s business \npractices violate North Carolina’s antitrust and insurance laws.  The Court earlier \nnarrowed Plaintiffs’ claims by rejecting certain of the claims based on insurance laws \nand restricting potential antitrust claims to only those based on a relevant market \ndefined as the market for chiropractic services in North Caroli na (“North Carolina \nMarket”).  The Motion seeks to dismiss all claims because of Plaintiffs’ failure to \nallege market power within that market.   \n3. Plaintiffs’ essential contention is that HNS, and insurers with which it \nconspires, unlawfully restrict s the output of c hiropractic services.  In this action \n(“Sykes I”), Plaintiffs bring suit against HNS and its owners.  In the later -filed case, \nSykes v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina , No. 15 CVS 3136,  (“Sykes II”), \nPlaintiffs assert substantially similar claims against Blue Cross Blue Shield of North \nCarolina (“Blue Cross”), Cigna Healthcare of North Carolina, Inc. (“Cigna”), and \nMedCost, LLC1 (“MedCost” and collectively with Blue Cross and Cigna, “Insurers”).   \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiffs also originally sued another third -party administrator, Healthgram, Inc., but have since \ndismissed their claims against it. \n \n \n4. The Court today issues a separate O rder & Opinion in Sykes II  and \ndismisses all claims in both cases because Plaintiffs have failed to allege market \npower in the North Carolina Market.  \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n5. The procedural background of this action is  more fully summarized in \nthe Court’s August 18, 2017 Order & Opinion.  Sykes I, No. 13 CVS 2595, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 73, at *3–6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017).   \n6. Plaintiffs brought this action on April 30, 2013, after which the case was \ndesignated as a complex business case and assigned to the undersigned.   \n7. Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on July 28, 2013, and \nDefendants moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule s 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the North \nCarolina Rules of C ivil Procedure .  The Court denied that motion and stayed \nadditional proceedings pending discovery regarding market definition.  See Sykes I, \n2013 NCBC LEXIS 52, at *3, *13–17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 5, 2013).   \n8. During the market discovery period, Plaintiffs brought Sykes II against \nInsurers and, on July 16, 2015,  filed their Second Amended Class Action Complaint \n(“Second Amended Complaint”) in this action.   In the Second Amended Complaint, \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants’ conduct harmed four possible relevant markets, the \nfourth of which is the North Carolina Market. \n9. On August 28, 2015 , Defendants filed a motion for partial summary \njudgment, contending that the first three  markets Plaintiffs alleged were \n \n \nimpermissibly narrow and legally non -cognizable, and t hat Defendants did not \nparticipate in the North Carolina Market.   \n10. On September 25, 2015, Defendants filed the Motion, which attacks the \nsufficiency of all of the claims in the Second Amended Complaint.   \n11. On August 18, 2017, the Court issued its Order & Op inion on \nDefendants’ motion for partial summary judgment and the Motion.  The Court \ndismissed Plaintiffs’ declaratory judgment claims to the  extent that they are based \non chapter 58 violations, their North Carolina General Statute section  75-1.1 claim, \ntheir breach of fiduciary duty claim, and their conspiracy claim to the extent it \ndepended on anything other than claims based on violations of North Carolina \nGeneral Statutes sections 75 -1, 75-2, and  75-2.1 (“Antitrust Claims”) , which  the \nCourt did not dismiss.  Sykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *71–72.  The Court granted \nin part and denied in part D efendants’ motion for partial summary judgment,  and \ndismissed the Antitrust Claims to the extent that they were based on three of the \nfour markets Plaintiffs proposed because those markets are not legally cognizable .  \nId. at *71.  The Court accepted the No rth Carolina Market  as legally cognizable .  \nHowever, it deferred ruling on whether Plaintiffs ’ Antitrust Claims could continue \nbecause it could not reasonably assess the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ allegation s of \nDefendants’ market power within the North Carolina Market until receiving  \nsupplemental briefs on that issue.  Id. at *64.   \n12. On October 2, 2017, the parties  filed supplemental briefs, and , on \nOctober 23, 2017, the parties filed response briefs.   \n \n \n13. Pursuant to Rule 7.4 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure for \nthe North Carolina Business Court, the Court elects to rule on the Motion without \nadditional oral argument.  The Motion is ripe for resolution.   \nIII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n14. The Court refers to its earlier extensive summary of factual background, \nSykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *6–13, and here includes only factual information \npertinent to the Motion.  The Court accepts Plaintiffs’ factual allegations as true and \nmakes any permissible  inferences favorable to them, but is not bound by legal \nconclusions unsupported by underlying factual allegations. \nA. The Parties \n15. The named Plaintiffs —Susan Sykes,  Dawn Patrick, Troy Lynn, and \nBrent Bost —are four licensed North Carolina chiropractors and their affiliated \npractices.  (Second Amended Class Action Compl. (“Second Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 3–6, ECF \nNo. 78.)  Plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of “all licensed chiropractors \npracticing in North Carolina from 2005 to the present who provided service s in the \nNorth Carolina Market.”  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 47.)   \n16. HNS is an “integrated independent practice association” (“IPA”), \nconsisting of approximately 1,000 of North Carolina’s approximately 2,000 active \nchiropractors.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28–29, 57.) \n17. Individual Defendants Michael Binder, Steven Binder, Robert Stroud, \nLarry Grossman, Matthew Schmid, Ralph Ransone, Jeffery Baldwin, Ira Rubin, \nRichard Armstrong, Brad Batchelor, John Smith, Rick Jack son, Mark Hopper  are \n \n \nchiropractors who currently or pre viously practiced chiropractic in North Carolina \nand who own, or previously owned, an interest in HNS.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 8 –\n20, 26.)  \nB. HNS’s Business Structure  \n18. Only HNS members can provide  in-network chiropractic services for  \nInsurers who contract with HNS.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 32.)  Chiropractors enroll in \nHNS by agreeing to provide in -network care to patients covered by Insurers, with \nwhom HNS has entered into exclusive agreements to provide in -network care.  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 29 .)  All chiropractors who join HNS must pay fees to HNS.  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 32.) \n19. HNS uses a utilization management (“UM”) program, whereby HNS and \nInsurers review and manage chiropractors based on their cost per patient.  ( Second \nAm. Compl. ¶  38.)  If a  chiropractor’s average cost per patient exceeds a mean \ncalculated by HNS by more than 50%, the chiropractor is put on probation and is \nsubject to potential termination.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 38.)  \n20. Plaintiffs allege that each class member was either exclud ed from in -\nnetwork access to the Insurers’ patients, charged fees and subjected to HNS’s \nutilization review process, or both.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 48.)  Plaintiffs allege that \nHNS is “like a union which negotiates employment terms for its members,” except  \nthat HNS puts Insurers’  interests ahead of Plaintiffs’ by exclusively contracting with \nInsurers to exact fees from chiropractors seeking access to pa tients covered by \nInsurers.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶  29–31.)  Essentially, Plaintiffs allege that HNS’s \n \n \nexclusive contracts with Insurers enable a “scheme that reduces the number of \nmedically necessary and appropriate treatments” provided by chiropractors in HNS’s \nnetwork and restrict output by allowing Insurers to avoid paying for medically \nnecessary and appropriate care.  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 37.)  Plaintiffs assert that the \nUM program reduces Insurers’  chiropractic purchases b y “millions of dollars per \nyear,” (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 42), thereby giving Insurers a “windfall.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. \nDefs.’ Mot. Dismiss Second Am. Compl. 2, ECF No. 96.) \n21. Plaintiffs initially alleged four markets, the narrowest of which was \nrestricted to insured in -network chiropractic services.  The Court has restricted the \nAntitrust Claims to those measured within the North Carolina Market. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n22. On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court considers \n“whether the pleadings, when taken as true, are legally sufficient to satisfy the \nelements of at least some legally recognized claim.”  Arroyo v. Scottie’s Prof’l Window \nCleaning, Inc., 120 N.C. App. 154, 158, 461 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1995) (quoting Harris v. \nNCNB Nat’l Bank of N.C., 85 N.C. App. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987)).  The \nCourt is not required “to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, \nunwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences,” Strickland v. Hedrick, \n194 N.C. App. 1, 20, 669 S.E.2d 61, 73 (2008) (quoting Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. \nDep’t of Health & Human Servs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005)), \nand may ignore the plaintiff’s legal conclusions.  McCrann v. Pinehurst, LLC, 225 \nN.C. App. 368, 377, 737 S.E.2d 771, 777 (2013). \n \n \n23. The Court will grant a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) when any \nof three things is true: (1) no law supports the plaintiff's claim, (2) the complaint does \nnot plead sufficient facts to state a legally sound claim, or (3) the complaint discloses \na fact that defeats the plaintiff’s claim.  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 \nS.E.2d 222, 224 (1985). \n24. The Motion must be decided under state law, but the Court may consider \nfederal case law as persuasive authority for the Antitrust Claims.  See Rose v. Vulcan \nMaterials Co., 282 N.C. 643, 656–57, 194 S.E.2d 521, 530–31 (1973); DiCesare v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., No. 16 CVS 16404, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 33, at *44 \n(N.C. Super. Ct April 11, 2017); Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC, v. Window \nWorld, Inc., Nos. 15 CVS 1–2, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *14–15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. \n25, 2016).  However, when considering federal case law, the Court does not apply the \n“plausibility” standard adopted by the federal courts.  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 555–56 (2007). \nV. ANALYSIS \nA. Plaintiffs do not Satisfy Rule 12(b)(6) Simply by Adhering to Rule 8. \n25. In their abbreviated supplemental briefs, Plaintiffs argue that they have \ncomplied with Rule 8’s requirement to provide fair notice of their claims , and that \nsurviving the Motion  under Rule 12(b)(6) does not require more.  (Pls.’ Suppl. Br. \nConcerning Market Power 1–2, ECF No. 105; Pls.’ Response Br. Concerning Market \nPower 1–2, ECF No. 108.)  Making no attempt to segregate their factual allegations \namong the four markets they allege, Plaintiffs argue only that thirty-four or more \n \n \nparagraphs in the Second Amended Complaint “have allegations about market \npower, abuse of that power, how [Defendants] have used their power to restrict output \nand fix prices and how competition has been restricted.”  (Pls.’ Suppl. Br. Concerning \nMarket Power 2.) \n26. “The general standard for civil pleadings in North Carolina is notice \npleading.”  Murdock v. Chatham Cty. , 198 N.C. App. 309, 316, 679 S.E.2d 850, 855 \n(2009) (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule 8(a)(1)) .  “Under this ‘notice pleading’ \nstandard, ‘a statement of claim is adequate if it gives sufficient notice of the claim \nasserted to enable the adverse party to answer and prepare for trial, to allow for the \napplication of the doctrine of  res judicata , and to show the type of case \nbrought.’”  Tillery Envtl. LLC v. A& D Holdings, Inc., No. 17 CVS 6525, 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 13, at *78 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 9, 2018) (quotin g Wake Cty. v. Hotels.com, \nL.P., 235 N.C. App. 633, 646, 762 S.E.2d 477, 486 (2014)).   \n27. However, even if a pleading provides proper notice of “the nature and \nbasis” of a claim sufficient to formulate an answer, the Court must still, under a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion, “address the legal sufficiency” of each pleaded claim.  Kingsdown, \nInc. v. Hinshaw, No. 14 CVS 1701, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 30, at *14, *15 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Mar. 25, 2015).  A pleading that satisfies Rule 8’s notice requirement may still be \nsubject to Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal.  Id. at *13 –45 (holding that a counterclaim -\nplaintiff’s claims did not violate Rule 8 and then dismissing with prejudice many of \nthose claims under Rule 12(b)(6)). \n \n \n28. The Court previously held that Plaintiffs satisfied  Rule 8 in regard to  \nclaims against the Individual D efendants.  Sykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at * 65 \n(noting that Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the Individual Defendants were “within \nthe outer bounds of acceptable notice pleading”).  The Court similarly concludes that \nPlaintiffs have satisfied Rule 8 in regard to  their definition of the North Carolina \nMarket, ( Second Am. Compl. ¶  33), and their generalized contention that  HNS \nabused its market power in that market.  (See, e.g., Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 37–39, 46, \n66–68).  This holding, however, does not resolve the Rule 12(b)(6) Motion. \nB. The Antitrust Claims  \n(1) The Court assumes, for purposes of the Motion only, that HNS \nparticipates in the North Carolina Market.  \n \n29.  Defendants initially argue that the Antitrust Claims against them must \nfail because they do not participate in the North Carolina Market.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Dismiss Second Am. Compl. 11 , ECF No. 86 .)  Plaintiffs characterize  this \nargument as “silly” and assert  that HNS’s contracts with insurers, contracts with \nchiropractors, and monitoring of chiropractors’ services “without question” constitute \nHNS’s participation in the North Carolina Market.  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss \nSecond Am. Compl. 11.)   \n30. The Court earlier concluded “that there are disputed issues of fact as to \nwhether Defendants participate in [the North Carolina M]arket,” and that summary \njudgment for Defendants on that issue was inappropriate at that time.  Sykes I, 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 73, at *46.   For purposes of the Motion  only, the Court assumes that \nHNS and the Individual Defendants participate in the North Carolina Market. \n \n \n(2) The Antitrust Claims require a showing of market power in the \nNorth Carolina M arket, which  Plaintiffs may allege through \ndirect or circumstantial evidence.  \n \n31. The Court has held that each of Plaintiffs’ Antitrust Claims require an \nappropriate allegation of market power in the North Carolina Market , whether the \nclaim is one for monopolization or monopso nization  Sykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, \nat *17–18, *22, *58.  Seller-side market power is the “ability to raise prices above the \nlevels that would be charged in a competitive market,” R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. \nPhillip Morris Inc., 199 F. Supp. 2d 362, 381 –83 (M.D.N.C. 2002) (quoting NCAA v. \nBoard of Regents of the Univ. of Okla. , 468 U.S. 85, 109 n.38 (1984 )), and buyer-side \nmarket power includes the buyer’s ability “to lower input prices below competitive \nlevels, which requires the ability to restrict the quantity demanded of the input,” and \nresults in higher output prices.  Roger D. Blair & Jeffrey L. Harrison, Antitrust Policy \nand Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297, 306 (1991).   \n32. Market power may be alleged based on facts that will prov ide either \ndirect or circumstantial evidence of that power.  Rebel Oil Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co., 51 \nF.3d 1421, 1434 (9th Cir. 1995).  Direct evidence “generally requires  . . . evidence of \nrestricted output and supracompetitive prices,” Sykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at \n*61, while circu mstantial evidence —“the more common type of proof” —generally \ncontains evidence “pertaining to the structure of the market.”  Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at \n1434.  Circumstantial proof will require at least that a plaintiff pr operly define a \nrelevant market, show that a defendant owns a dominant share of that market, and \nshow that there are significant barriers to entry to that market.  Id.; see also Sykes I, \n \n \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *61  (noting that indirect proof of market power requires \nproof “of ownership of a domi nant share of the relevant market and significant \nbarriers to market entry”). \n(3) Plaintiffs have failed to specifically allege an output restriction \nin the North Carolina Market adequate to suppo rt a \npresumption that HNS has market power.  \n \n33. Plaintiffs assert that they have adequately demonstrated a restriction \nof output of medically-necessary chiropractic services sufficient to infer HNS’s market \npower in the North Carolina Market.  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Second Am. \nCompl. 12–14.)  More specifically, Plaintiffs argue that their allegations that “tens of \nmillions of dollars of medically necessary care that has not been provided ” pursuant \nto HNS’s conduct by itself satisfies their pleading burden.  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Defs’ Mot. \nDismiss Second Am. Compl. 12–13.)   \n34. Plaintiffs correctly note that “proof of actual detrimental effects, such as \na reduction of output, can obviate the need for an inquiry into market power.”  FTC \nv. Indiana Fed ’n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 460 –61 (1986).  Judge Sotomayor while \nserving on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  wrote that “[i]f \na plaintiff can show that a defendant’s conduct exerted an actual adverse effect on \ncompetition, this is a strong indicator of market power.”  Todd v. Exxon Corp. , 275 \nF.3d 191, 206 (2d Cir. 2001). \n35.  However, again, Plaintiffs fail to account for the differences in how their \nallegations of output based on market power must b e separately viewed in the four  \nmarkets they allege.  After the Court examined Plaintiffs’ output-reduction argument \n \n \nin its August 18, 2017 Order & Opinion , it doubted, but left open the question of , \nwhether the pleadings justified “a presumption that Defendants have, or can be tied \nto, market power in the North Carolina Market adequate to relieve Plaintiffs of their \npleading burden.”  Sykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *64.  The Court now concludes \nthat Plaintiffs’ allegations of output reductions are not sufficient to  permit an \ninference that Defendants have market power in the North Carolina Market. \n36. Plaintiffs conflate their allegation of a reduction of output in markets the \nCourt has rejected  with an allegation of  reduction of output in the North Carolina \nMarket.  Plaintiffs seem to suggest that because Defendants have allegedly caused a \nreduction in the more narrow market s restricted to in-network chiropractors, (see, \ne.g., Second Am. Compl. ¶¶  39, 42, 98 ), it reasonably  leads to an inference  that \nDefendants have caused an overall reduction in output among all chiropractors in the \nNorth Carolina Market. \n37. While the Court here has the benefit of market discovery that dispels \nany such inference, the Second Amended Complaint asserts no facts that suggest \nmore than a shift in output from the in-network insured market to other segments of \nthe larger North Carolina Market, which includes chiropractic services provided out-\nof-network or to patients who make cash payments or receive services as beneficiaries \nof various government programs, including workers’ compensation.  Significantly, the \nSecond Amended Complaint supports this contrary inference when it alleges that \napproximately half of all licensed North Carolina chiropractors are not HNS \nmembers.  ( Second Am. Compl. ¶¶  28–29.)  Three of Plaintiffs ’ proposed markets \n \n \nexclude these alternative consumers of chiropr actic services, but they must be \nconsidered within the North Carolina Market.  Without factual allegations to support \ntheir argument, Plaintiffs state in conclusory fashion that “Defendants’ actions have \nreduced output and that output is not finding its wa y back into the market through \ngovernment insurance or the cash market. ”  (Pls.’ Response Br. Concerning Market \nPower 2).   \n38. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs do not allege a restriction of \nchiropractic services in the North Carolina Market sufficient to raise a presumption \nthat the restriction is due to HNS’s alleged market power.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are \nnot r elieved from pleading more specific facts that may be adequate to support a \nfinding of HNS’s market power in the North Carolina Market. \n(4) Plaintiffs fail to allege specific facts  adequate to support a \nfinding of HNS’s market power in the North Carolina Market.  \n \n39. The Court inquires whether the Second Amended Complaint alleges \nfacts which may be adequate to define a relevant market, show that a defendant owns \na dominant share of that market, and show that there are significant barriers to entry \nto that market.  Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1434; see also Sykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, \nat *61; cf. Sitelink Software, LLC v. Red Nova Labs, Inc. , 14 CVS No. 9922, 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 45, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 14, 2016) (holding that to succeed on \nantitrust claims, a plaintiff m ust allege some “minimal set of well -grounded factual \nallegations to support an assertion of market power” in the relevant market).   \n \n \n40. Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint includes the following \nallegations regarding their claims that HNS has market power within the North \nCarolina Market: \n The North Carolina Market is a market “in which HNS ha[s] \nmarket power.”  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 33);  \n “HNS and the Insurers through aggregation of ultimate \nconsumers of chiropractic services, and their participation and \nuse of the HNS network, have material market power in the \nrelevant markets.”  (Second Am. Compl. ¶ 34);  \n “By virtue of its exclusive relationships with the Insurers, \nparticularly [Blue Cross], HNS controls  . . . a materially \nsignificant percentage of  . . . th e North Carolina Market.”  \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 46); and \n “HNS through its exclusive contracts with the Insurers has \nmonopsony power in the relevant markets.”  (Second Am. Compl. \n¶ 132.)   \nAgain, these allegations are grouped among the four different market s Plaintiffs \nallege, three of which the Court has rejected.  While Plaintiffs allege that HNS \ncontrols a specific percentage of the markets the Court has rejected, (see, e.g., Second \nAm. Compl. ¶ 46 (“HNS controls 100% of the HNS Market”)), Plaintiffs do not allege \nthat HNS controls a specific share of the North Carolina Market.   \n \n \n41. Although “each case turns on a fact -specific inquiry,” SiteLink, 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 45, at *29, federal and state courts in North Carolina have found \nallegations that a defendant possesses at least fifty percent of a relevant market may \nbe adequate to show that that defendant owns a “dominant share” of the market.  See \nR. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co ., 199 F. Supp. 2d at 383 (finding that an alleged 51.3% \nmarket share was sufficient to show  a defendant’s dominant share); compare \nDiCesare, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 33, at *48–50 (finding that an allegation that a \ndefendant possessed “approximately 50%” of the relevant market was sufficient to \nallege that defendant’s dominant share in that market and allowing antirust claims \nto survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion), with Sitelink, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *30–31 \n(holding that an allegation of market share between 35% and 40% was insufficient to \nsurvive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “even under North Carolina’s liberal pleading \nstandard”). \n42. Arguably, Plaintiffs would have adequately alleged market power in the \nother more narrow markets had the Court not rejected them.  But, an allegation of a \nspecific market share in the narrower and irrelevant markets  cannot support a \nreasonable inference that HNS has market power in the North Carolina Market.  See \nBookhouse of Stuyvesant Plaza, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc. , 985 F. Supp. 2d 612, 621 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (holding that allegations that defendants had a 60% share i n the \nprint book market was insufficient to establish market power in the e -book market \nwhere the plaintiffs had made no specific allegations regarding the defen dants’ \nmarket share in the e-book market); see also Top Rank, Inc. v. Haymon , No. CV 15-\n \n \n4961-JFW (MRWx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164676, at *22 –24 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 16, \n2015) (holding that the plaintiff had not adequately pleaded market power in the \nrelevant market in part because the allegations regarding significant market share \npertained to markets the court had rejected).  \n43. Vague or conclusory allegations of market power in a relevant market \nmay be insufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, even if the market is sufficiently \ndefined.  See, e.g., Rick-Mik Enters., Inc. v. Equilon Enters. LLC, 532 F.3d 963, 972 \n(9th Cir. 2008) (holding that an allegation that the defendant ranked “number one” \nin its industry was insufficient to plead market power); Cupp v. Alberto-Culver USA, \nInc., 310 F. Supp. 2d 963, 974 (W.D. Tenn. 2004) (dismissing an antitrust claim when \nthe plaintiff made only conclusory allegations regarding the relevant market and \ndescribed the defendants’ market power using only vague descriptors); Hip Hop \nBeverage Corp. v. Monster Energy Co., No. 2:16-CV-1421-SVW-FFM, 2016 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 167077, at *14–15 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 26, 2016) (holding that an allegation that a \ndefendant controlled “a major percent” of the relevant market was insufficient to \nallege market power); Westlake Servs., LLC v. Credit Acceptance Corp., No. CV 15-\n07490 SJO (MRWx), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175643, at *18 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 7, 2015) \n(holding that an allegation that a defendant had a “predominant market share of and \nmarket power in” the relevant market was insufficient to plausibly show that the \ndefendant held sufficient market power). \n44. The Court is “fully cognizant that the Motion must be resolved under \nNorth Carolina’s lenient Rule 12(b)(6) standard rather than the more exacting \n \n \nfederal plausibility standard that governs . . . federal antitrust precedents,” but it is \nalso aware that “[e]ven North Carolina’s more lenient standard . . . does not allow a \nparty to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based on conclusory allegations that are \nnot supported by underlying factual allegations.”  Sitelink, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 45, at \n*17; see also Window World, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *13–14 (rejecting the plaintiffs’ \nargument that market power need not be specifically pleaded to withstand 12(b)(6) \ndismissal).   \n45.   Based on these principles, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs fail to \nallege facts adequate to support a finding that HNS has  market power in the North \nCarolina Market.  First, as noted above, Plaintiffs do not allege that HNS controls a \nspecific percentage of the North Carolina Market.   Second, Plaintiffs cannot rely on \nallegations of HNS’s market share in markets the Court has rejected .  Finally, \nPlaintiffs’ general allegations that HNS has “market power,” “material market \npower,” “a materially significant percentage ,” and “monopsony power” in the North \nCarolina Market, (Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 33, 34, 46, 132), are conclusory, nonspecific, \nand insufficient.   \n46. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs do not adequately \nallege HNS’s market power in the North Carolina Market.  Accordingly, the Antitrust \nClaims against HNS fail and must be dismissed.  See Rick-Mik, 532 F.3d, at 972 (“A \nfailure to allege power in the relevant market is a sufficient ground to dismis s an \nantitrust complaint.”). \n \n \n \nC. Plaintiffs’ Claims that Derive from the Antitrust Claims   \n(1) Declaratory judgment  \n47. Plaintiffs’ declaratory-judgment claim  originally sought ten different \ndeclarations, three of which the Court determined that Plaintiffs  do not have \nstanding to bring.  Sykes I, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *53 (holding that Plaintiffs lack \nstanding to  pursue alleged c hapter 58 violations) .  The Court also ruled that the \nremaining declaratory judgment claims “should survive dismissal, but only to the \nextent that they relate to the other surviving [antitrust] claims.”  Id. at *70.  Because \nthe Antitrust C laims do not survive, Plaintiffs’ remaining claims for declaratory \njudgment fail and must be dismissed.   \n(2)  Conspiracy  \n48. The Court previously noted that Plaintiffs’ civil conspiracy claim should \nsurvive Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal only to the extent that the Antitrust Claims survived.  \nId. at *70; see also Shope v. Boyer , 268 N.C. 401, 404 –05, 150 S.E.2d 771, 773 –74 \n(1966) (holding that North Carolina does not recognize freestanding civil conspiracy \nclaims).  The Antitrust Claims do not survive.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ civil conspiracy \nclaim fails and must be dismissed.  \n(3) Claims against Individual Defendants  \n49. Plaintiffs attempt to impose personal liabilit y on the Individual \nDefendants by alleging “that the Individual Defendants are either joint tortfeasors \nwho knowingly and purposefully established HNS to inflict harm on Plaintiffs  . . . , \nor co-conspirators who actively participated in the wrongful conduc t.”  Sykes I, 2017 \n \n \nNCBC LEXIS 73, a t *64–65.  The Court earlier concluded that “the claims against \nthe Individual Defendants survive the Motion . . . to the same extent that the claims \nalso survive against HNS.”  Id. at *66.  Because all of Plaintiffs’ claims against HNS \nare dismissed, all claims against the Individual Defendants fail and must likewise be \ndismissed. \n(4) Punitive damages  \n50. North Carolina does not allow freestanding claims for punitive damages.  \nShugar v. Guill, 304 N.C. 332, 335, 283 S.E.2d 507, 509 (1981) (“A civil action may \nnot be maintained solely for the purpose of collecting punitive damages but may only \nbe awarded when a cause of action otherwise exists in which at least nominal \ndamages are recoverable by the plaintiff.”).  Because the Court has dismissed each of \nthe claims against HNS and the Individual Defendants, Plaintiffs’ punitive damages \nclaim must also be dismissed.   \nVI. CONCLUSION \n51. After three complaints, two motions to dismiss, fact discovery regarding \nmarket definition, a summary judgment motion based on market definition, and two \nrounds of supplemental briefing, Plaintiffs continue to fail to adequately allege that \nHNS has market power in the North Carolina Market.  Plaintiffs’ failure to plead \nmarket power in the relevant market is f atal to all the Antitrust Claims, and the \nfailure of the Antitrust Claims is fatal to every other remaining claim.  There being \nno remaining claims, the Motion is GRANTED and the Second Amended Complaint \nis DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 5th day of April, 2018. \n \n \n /s/ James L.
