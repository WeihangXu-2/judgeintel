Vann, for Defendants Anthony \nWilliam Packer, Packer Investment Company, Inc., PA&K, LLC, Olde \nBeau General Partnership, and KPP, LLC. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \n \nI. FACTS \n1. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(6), but only recites those facts included in the complaint that are relevant \nto the Court’s determination of the Motion s.  See, e.g., Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs \nGrp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).  The facts relevant to \nthe determination of the Motion s are drawn from the Amended Complaint.  \n(“Amended Complaint,” ECF No. 4.)   \n2. This matter arises from the development of property in  the Olde Beau \nSubdivision in Alleghany County, North Carolina.  The Olde Beau Golf and Country \nClub is part of the Olde Beau Subdivision.  Defendant Olde Beau General Partnership \n \n \n(“OBGP”) owned the Olde Beau Subdivision.  (Id. at ¶ 4.)  The General Partne rs in \nOBGP are Defendant s Packer Investment Company, Inc. (“PIC”) and Kennington \nInvestment Company, Inc. (“KIC”).  Defendant Anthony William Packer (“Packer”) is \nthe President of PIC.  (Id. at ¶¶ 5–6.) \n3. Packer is also  a member of PA&K, LLC (“PA&K”).  PA&K is in the \nbusiness of developing residential properties and was involved in developing, \nmanaging, constructing, and selling property in the Olde Beau Subdivision.  (Id. at ¶ \n3.) \n4. Plaintiff Morris International, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) specializes in the \ndevelopment and marketing of real estate.   ( Id. at ¶  1.)  Sid Morris (“Morris”) is a \n“representative” of Plaintiff, but his specific role with Plaintiff is not alleged.  (Id. at \n¶ 17.) \n5. On May 20, 2015, Plaintiff, PA&K, and OBGP executed an “Agreement \nwith PA&K, LLC and Morris International, Inc. Olde Beau Golf and Country Club \nDevelopment Project .” (“Agreement ,” Id. at ¶ 18.) The A greement “ contemplated \ncreating a luxury RV resort wherein a portion of the Olde Beau Subdivision would be \ndeveloped for sales of individual lots to be owned and used by owners of luxury \nmotorhome coaches, with improvements, appropriate amenities , and golf club \nmembership.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 14 and 18, Ex. B at pp. 3–4.)2  The Agreement was  signed \non behalf of PA&K by Packer, and  on behalf of Plaintiff by Morris.   ( Id.)  Although \nnot mentioned in or a signatory to the Agreement, Plaintiff alleges that OBGP was \n \n2 In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff misidentifies the Agreement as Exhibit A. \n \n \nalso a party to the Joint Venture.  3  On September 15, 2015, PA&K and Plaintiff \nsigned an addendum to the Agreement.  (Id. at pp. 4–6.)  The parties referred to the \nproject as the “Olde Beau Joint Venture.”  (hereinafter “Joint Venture”).  \n6. Defendant Barry Poole is involved in developing, marketing, and selling \nreal estate as recreational vehicle (“RV”) resort properties.  ( Id. at ¶ 8.)  Plaintiff \nalleges that: \nDuring the active phase of the [ Joint Venture ], [Barry \nPoole] [was] directly and personally involved with \n[Plaintiff], PA&K [,] and OBGP in negotiations of an \nagreement for [Barry Poole] to serve, under contract to the \n[Joint Venture] , as the construction manager of the RV \nresort at Olde Beau. These negotiations included \ndiscussions of confidentiality and non -competition of \n[Barry Poole] relating to other RV resorts that he was \ninvolved with at the time. Thus, [Barry Poole] had actual, \ndetailed knowledge of the plans and opportunities that the \nJoint Venture was pursuing, and specifically of [Plaintiff]’s \ninterest in the venture. \n \n(Id. at ¶ 38.)   \n7. Plaintiff only alleges that the Joint Venture was negotiated with Barry \nPoole, but not that the parties entered into any type of contract or that B arry Poole \nwas hired as the construction manager for the Joint Venture. \n8. In January 2016, faced with an organized group of Olde Beau \ncommunity members opposing the project,  Packer and Morris agreed to “hold off on \nfurther development until the threat of legal action was resolved.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 28–31.)  \n \n3 Plaintiff alleges that “Packer, as President of PIC, a general partner in OBGP, and on behalf \nof OBGP, entered into this agreement and committed the real estate to the Olde Beau Joint \nVenture and to the JV Agreement with the knowledge and authority of OBGP and all its \nother partners.”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 21.) \n \n \nPacker also stated that he “likely would pu t the property up for auction.”  ( Id. at ¶ \n31.) \n9. By the end of August 2016, Plaintiff “believe[d] and understood that the \nRV project and other objectives of the [Joint Venture] would not proceed, and that \nPacker, PA&K , and OBGP would pursue other opportunit ies to develop or sell \ncomponents of the Olde Beau property.”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶¶ 34–35.) \n10. Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, in July 2017, Packer and Barry Poole formed \nDefendant KPP, LLC (“KPP”) , a North Carolina limited liability company,  to act as \nthe developer of the RV resort project that had been the subject of the Joint Venture \n(the “New Venture”).  (Id. at ¶ 37.) \n11. In November 2017,  Morris learned that Packer and B arry Poole were \ndeveloping of the RV resort project.   Morris visited the  property and saw that \nexcavation and other land improvements were underway in accordance with the  \ndesign that Plaintiff had prepared for the Joint Venture. (Id. at ¶ 36.) \n12. The sole allegation regarding Laura Poole contained in the Amended \nComplaint is that she “is an individual residing in Alleghany County, North Carolina” \nand “is a licensed real estate broker involved in marketing and selling RV resort \nproperties, including the real property involved in this lawsuit.”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 9.)  \nPlaintiff does not allege when Laura Poole was involved in marketing and selling the \nproperty and does not make any allegations of specific conduct by Laura Poole. \n \n \n \n \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n13. On January 30, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this matter   \n(ECF No. 3), and on March 2, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint.  (ECF No. \n4.)  On March 3, 2020, this case was designated as a mandatory complex business \ncase and assigned to the undersigned.  (Designation Ord er, ECF No. 1; Assignment \nOrder, ECF No. 2.) \n14. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff allege s claims against PA&K and \nOBGP for: breach of contract ( Count I ); breach of fiduciary duties  (Count II); and \ndissolution and accounting (Count VIII).  Plaintiff alleges a claim for a constructive \ntrust against PA&K, KPP, OBGP, PIC, and Defendant Kennington Investment \nCompany, Inc. (“KIC”) (Count III); a claim against OBGP and KPP for an equitable \nlien (Count IX); and a claim for tortious interference with a business contract and \nrelationship against Barry Poole, Laura Poole, Defendant Sherri Kennington Fagan, \nDefendant Kristi Kennington Hall, Defendant Kathy Kennington Davis, KPP, KIC, \nand PIC (Count VI).   Plaintiff alleges claims against all Defendants for: \n“misappropriation/conversion” (Count IV); violation of North Carolina’s Unfair and \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C.G.S. § 75 -1.1 (“UDTPA”) (Count V); and civil \nconspiracy (Count VII).   \n15. On March 30, 2020, Barry Poole filed Barry Poole’s Motion and Laura \nPoole filed the Motion to Dismiss, and the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees .  On the same \ndate, Barry Poole filed a Brief in Support of Barry Poole’s Motion, (B. Poole Br. Supp. \nMot., ECF No. 20), and Laura Poole filed a Brief in Support of the Motion to Dismiss \n \n \nand the Motion for Attorneys’ Fees.  (L. Poole Br. Supp., ECF No. 23).  On June 1, \n2020, Plaintiff filed it s Brief in Opposition to Defendants’ Respective Motions to \nDismiss (ECF No. 37), and on June 10, 2020, Barry Poole and Laura Poole filed \nreplies.  (ECF Nos. 38, 39). \n16. On July 16, 2020, the Court held a hearing on the Motions , which are \nnow ripe for resolution. \nIII. ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review \n17. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \ntrue are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal \ntheory, whether properly labeled or not.”   Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 N.C. App. \n669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).   Our appellate courts frequently reaffirm that \nNorth Carolina is a notice pleading state.   See, e.g., Feltman v. City of Wilson , 238 \nN.C. App. 246, 252, 767 S.E.2d 615, 620 (2014) (“Under notice pleading, a statement \nof claim is adequate if it gives sufficient notice of the claim asserted to enable the \nadverse party to answer and prepare for trial, to allow for the application of the \ndoctrine of res judicata, and to show the type of case brought.”) (quoting Wake Cty. v. \nHotels.com, L.P., 235 N.C. App. 633, 647, 762 S.E.2d 477, 486 (2014)). \n18. “It is well established that dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper \nwhen ‘(1) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim;  \n(2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good \n \n \nclaim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.’”  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615, 821 S.E.2d 729, 736–\n37 (2018) (quoting Wood v. Guilford County , 355 N.C. 161, 166, 558 S.E.2d 490, 494 \n(2002)).  \n19. In ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, the court construes the complaint \nliberally and accepts all allegations as true.  See Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, \n577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009).  However, the Court is not required “to accept as \ntrue allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health  & Human \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005) (citation omitted).  \n20. In addition, “when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court may \nproperly consider documents which are the subject of a plaintiff’s complaint and to \nwhich the complain t specifically refers even though they are presented by the \ndefendant.”  Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin , 147 N.C. App. 52, 60, 554 S.E.2d 840, \n847 (2001).  \nB. Barry Poole’s Motion \n21. Plaintiff makes the following  claims against Barry Poole : \nmisappropriation/conversion, unfair and d eceptive trade practices, tortious \ninterference with a business contract and relationship, and civil conspiracy .  Barry \nPoole seeks dismissal of these claims on the grounds that the allegations of the \nAmended Complaint fail to state any claim against him.  (ECF No. 19, at p. 1.) \n \n \n \ni. Misappropriation/Conversion \n22. Plaintiff alleges that: \n“[t]he [Joint Venture ] had substantial assets that were \ncontributed by [Plaintiff] in the form of intellectual \nproperty, marketing strategy and plans, site planning, \nslope analysis, zoning approval and other valuable and \nmaterial components of a viable venture . . . In violation of \n[Plaintiff]’s rights and without its knowledge, participation \nor consent, the Defendants joined forces to wrongfully \nappropriate these assets to their own benefit, and to the \ndetriment of [Plaintiff] and the [Joint Venture].”   \n \n(ECF No. 4, at ¶¶ 75–76.)   \n23. Plaintiff does not allege any specific conduct by Barry Poole in support \nof the conversion claim. \n24. Preliminarily, Barry Poole argues that to the extent Plaintiff, by titling \nits claim “Conversion/Misappropriation,” purports to make a claim for  \nmisappropriation of trade secrets in violation of the North Carolina Trade Secrets \nProtection Act (“NCTSPA”), N.C. G. S. § 66-152 et seq., the Amended Complaint fails \nto allege the necessary elements.  (ECF No. 20, at pp. 4 –5.)  However, Plaintiff \nconcedes that it is not attempting to state a NCTSPA claim against Defendants,  (ECF \nNo. 37, at p. 15) , and, therefore, any claim for violation of the NCTSPA is \nDISMISSED. \n25. Under North Carolina law, conversion is the “unauthorized assumption \nand exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to \nanother, to the alteration of their condition or the exclusion of an owner's rights.”  \nVariety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs., LLC , 365 N.C. 520, 523, \n \n \n723 S.E.2d 744, 747  (2012) (citation omitted). There are two elements in a claim \nfor conversion: (1) the plaintiff's ownership , and (2) the defendant's wrongful \npossession.  Id.    \n26. In seeking dismissal of the claim for conversion, B arry Poole contends, \ninter alia, that “Plaintiff has failed to allege ownership of the . . . converted property,” \nand instead alleges that the property was owned by the Joint Venture.  (ECF No. 20, \nat pp. 7–8.). \n27. A joint venture is a type of partnership and therefore governed by \npartnership law, as codified in the Uniform Partnership Act.  See Jones v. Shoji, 336 \nN.C. 581, 585, 444 S.E.2d 203, 205 (1994); see also  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 59 -36 (defining \na partnership as “an association of two or more persons to carry on as co -owners a \nbusiness for profit”).  By statute, any property that the Plaintiff “originally brought \ninto the partnership stock” or that was “subsequently acquired by purchase or \notherwise, on account of the partnership, is partnership property.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § \n59-38.  Since the p roperty that was allegedly converted was partnership property, \nonly the partnership–not the individual partners–can assert the claim for conversion.  \nRon Medlin Constr. v. Harris, 364 N.C. 577, 704 S.E.2d 486 (2010) (“[W]hen property \nis owned by a partnership, the partnership is the real party in interest for purposes \nof pursuing a civil action pertaining to the partnership property”); BDM Invs. v. \nLenhil, Inc., 2012 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *27 (N.C. Sup er. Ct. Jan. 18, 2012) (same ).  \nPlaintiff alleges it contribu ted the converted property to the Joint Venture and , \ntherefore the property belonged to the Joint Venture.  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 75.) \n \n \n28. In response to Barry Poole’s argument, Plaintiff does not dispute that \nthe property at issue was owned by the Joint Venture and not by Plaintiff.  Rather, \nPlaintiff contends that it has a right to sue in its individual capacity because it was \nowed a “special duty” and suffered a “separate and distinct injury.”  (ECF No. 37, at \np. 16.)  In Gaskin v. J.S. Procter Co., LLC, the Court of Appeals held: \nThe general rule of partner standing to sue individually is \nstated in  Energy Investors [ Fund, L.P. v. Metric \nConstructors, Inc.]: “It is settled law in this State that one \npartner may not sue in his own name, and for his benefit, \nupon a cause of action in favor of a partnership.”  351 N.C. \n[331], at 336- 37, 525 S.E.2d [441] at 445 (2000)  (citation \nand quotation mark s omitted).  The rule includes a cause \nof action against other partners in the \npartnership, Jackson v. Marshall, 140 N.C. App. 504, 508, \n537 S.E.2d 232, 235 (2000),  disc. review denied,  353 N.C. \n375, 547 S.E.2d 10 (2001), as well as a cause of action \nagainst an unrelated third party,  Energy Investors,  351 \nN.C. at 336 -37, 525 S.E.2d at 445.   “The only \ntwo exceptions to this rule are: (1) a plaintiff alleges an \ninjury ‘separate and distinct’ to himself, or (2) the injuries \narise out of a ‘ special duty ’ running from the alleged \nwrongdoer to the plaintiff.\"  351 N.C. at  335, 525 S.E.2d at \n444 (emphasis added) (recognizing the two exceptions in a \nsuit brought by a limited partner and citing  Barger v. \nMcCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 660, 488 S.E.2d 215, \n220 (1997), which recognized the same two exceptions in a \nsuit brought by shareholders in a corporation). \n \n196 N.C. App. 447, 451, 675 S.E.2d 115, 117-118 (2009). \n \n29. While Plaintiff contends  that the other alleged partners to the Joint \nVenture, PA&K and OBGP, owed Plaintiff fiduciary duties, it  does not allege or \ncontend that Barry Poole owed Plaintiff any duty.  See Energy Investors, 351 N.C. \nat 335, 525 S.E.2d at 444 (stating plaintiff must allege a special duty “running from \nthe alleged wrongdoer to the plaintiff”) (emphasis added). \n \n \n30. Similarly, while Plaintiff claims it has suffered a “separate and distinct” \ninjury from the Joint Venture and from PA&K and OBGP, it does not point the Court \nto any facts alleged in the Complaint supporting this claim.  In f act, it is hard to \nimagine how Barry Poole’s alleged conversion of the Joint Venture’s “intellectual \nproperty, marketing strategy and plans, site planning, slope analysis, zoning \napproval, and other valuable and material components of a viable venture” would not \nequally harm the other partners.  To the extent Plaintiff is attempting to argue that \nbecause Packer is a member of the new entity currently developing the property , \n(KPP), he personally benefits from the alleged conversion and, therefore, was not \nharmed in the same way as Plaintiff, that does not establish that Plaintiff’s injury is \ndistinct from the injury suffered by PA&K and OBGP. \n31. Therefore, to the extent Barry Poole’s Moti on seeks dismissal of the \nclaim for misappropriation/conversion, the motion should be GRANTED. \nii. Tortious Interference with Contract \n32. In its claim for tortious interference with contract, Plaintiff again makes \nno specific allegations regarding Barry Poole or his conduct but instead pleads that \n“[w]ith wrongful intent to induce PA&K and OBGP to breach their joint venture \nagreement and partnership with [Plaintiff], the Defendants, and each of them, \ninterfered in the relationship and induced PA&K and OBGP to breach the Agreement \nto the harm of [Plaintiff], and the [ Joint Venture].”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 93.)  Plaintiff \nfurther alleges that Defendants' conduct was “willful, malicious and wanton.”  (Id. at \n¶ 94.) \n \n \n33. To establish a claim for  tortious interference with contract, a plaintiff \nmust show: “(1) a valid contract between the plaintiff and a third person which confers \nupon the plaintiff a contractual right against a third person; (2) the defendant knows \nof the contract; (3) the defendant intentionally induces the third person not to perform \nthe contract; (4) and in doing so acts without justification; (5) resulting in actual \ndamage to plaintiff.”  United Lab., Inc. v. Kuykendall, 322 N.C. 643, 661, 370 S.E.2d \n375, 387 (1988) (citing Childress v. Abeles, 240 N.C. 667, 84 S.E.2d 176 (1954)). \n34. Barry Poole argues that the claim for tortious interference should be \ndismissed for several reasons, including Plaintiff’s failure to allege that B arry Poole \nacted without justification in interfering with the Agreement .  (ECF No. 20, at pp. \n10–11.)  The North Carolina Supreme Court has held that if the defendant's \ninterference is “for a legitimate business purpose, his actions are \nprivileged.  Competition in business constitutes justifiable interference in another's \nbusiness relations and is not actionable so long as it is carried on in furtherance of \none's own interests and by means that are lawful.”  Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Hooks, \n322 N.C. 216, 220, 367 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1988).  However, the “privilege [to interfere] \nis conditional or qualified; that is, it is lost if exercised for a wrong purpose.  In \ngeneral, a wrong purpose exists where the act is done other than as a reasonable \nand bona fide attempt to protect the interest of the defendant which is involved.”  Id.  \n“If the defendant's only motive is a malicious wish to injure the plaintiff, his actions \nare not justified.”  Id. \n \n \n35. The malice required to overcome a justification of business competition \nis legal malice, and not actual malice.  Childress, 240 N.C. at 675, 84 S.E.2d at 182 (“It \nis not necessary, however, to allege and prove actual malice in the sense of personal \nhatred, ill will, or spite in order to make out a case for the recovery of compensatory \ndamages against the outsider for tortiously inducing the breach of the third person's \ncontract with the plaintiff.   The term ‘ malice’ is used in this connection in its legal \nsense, and denotes the intentional doing of the harmful act without legal \njustification.”); Murphy v. McIntyre, 69 N.C. App. 323, 328- 29, 317 S.E.2d 397, 401 \n(1984) (noting that legal malice “means intentionally doi ng a wrongful act or \nexceeding one’s legal right or authority in order to prevent the making of a contract \nbetween two parties” and the act “must be taken with the design of injuring one of \nthe parties to the contract or of gaining some advantage at the expense of a party”). \n36. The Court of Appeals has held that in order to survive dismissal, a \ncomplaint alleging  tortious interference  “must admit of no motive for interference \nother than malice. ”  Pinewood Homes, Inc. v. Harris, 184 N.C. App. 597, 605, 646 \nS.E.2d 826, 832- 33 (2007); Filmar Racing, Inc. v. Stewart , 141 N.C. App. 668, 674, \n541 S.E.2d 733, 738 (2001)  (“[W]e have held that the complaint must admit of no \nmotive for interference other than malice”); Sides v. Duke Hospital, 74 N.C. App. 331, \n346, 328 S.E.2d 818, 829 (1985) (“[T]he complaint in an action for malicious \ninterference with contract must clearly allege that the actions of the defendant were \nthe cause of the plaintiff's damages and that the complaint admits of no other motive \nfor those actions than malice.”). \n \n \n37. Barry Poole argues that not only does Plaintiff fail to allege facts \nshowing that Barry Poole acted without justification, the Amended Complaint \ncontains allegations establishing that Barry Poole had a legitimate business interest \nin participating in the New Venture.  (ECF No. 20, at pp. 9–10.)  Plaintiff alleges that \nBarry Poole was in the busines s of developing “RV resort properties” and that the \npartners had negotiated with him about acting as the construction manager for the \nJoint Venture project (but apparently did not reach an agreement for his services).  \n(Id.)  Accordingly, the Amended Complaint alleges that Barry Poole had a legitimate \nbusiness interest in the New Venture and a motive other than malice for interfering \nwith the Agreement.  (Id.) \n38. In response, Plaintiff contends that it sufficiently pleads  lack of \njustification by alleging that Barry Poole knew about the Joint Venture and that he \n“succeeded to an equity position in the [N] ew [V]enture as a result of the breach of \nthe . . . Agreement by PA&K and OBGP ,” which was “achievable only as a result of \nactively urging the violation of [Plaintiff]’s rights.”  (ECF No. 37, at p. 19.) \n39. The Amended Complaint , however,  contains only the conclusory \nallegation that the Defendants, including Barry Poole, “induce[d]” PA&K and OBGP \nto breach, and “interfered” with, the Agreement.  (ECF No. 4, at ¶93.)  It does not \nallege facts as to the nature of any conduct by B arry Poole that would have induced \nPA&K and OBGP, or how Barry Poole interfered with the Agreement.  Plaintiff does \nnot expressly allege that Defendants or Barry Poole lacked a justification for the \ninterference, but only that such interference was “willful, malicious, and wanton.”  \n \n \n(Id. at ¶ 94.)  Again, Plaintiff does not allege in what way Defendants’ , or B arry \nPoole’s, conduct was malicious.   In the  absence of “specific, supportive, factual \nallegations, the [C]ourt need not accept as true general conclusory allegations of the \nelements of a cause of action for purposes of a motion to dismiss.”  Plasman v. Decca \nFurniture (USA), Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 80, *43-44 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 21, 2016) \n(quoting Global Promotions Grp., Inc. v. Danas, Inc. , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *12 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. June 22, 2012); see also Livingston v. Bakewell, No. COA13-748, 232 \nN.C. App. 337, 75 7 S.E.2d 525, 2014 N.C. App. LEXIS 141, at *15 (N.C. Ct. App. \n2014) (unpublished) (“By not providing some factual foundation for these conclusory \nallegations, plaintiff's complaint, on its face, is insufficient to defeat defendants ’ \nmotion to dismiss.”). \n40. Plaintiff has not alleged any facts explaining what Barry Poole did to \ninduce PA&K or OBGP to breach the Agreement or facts supporting the assertion \nthat his conduct was without justification or malicious.  Therefore, to the extent Barry \nPoole’s Motion seek s dismissal of the claim for tortious interference with the \nAgreement, the motion should be GRANTED. \niii. UDTPA \n41. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants committed an unfair or deceptive act \nby “concealing” the New Venture  and “excluding” Plaintiff from participation  in the \nNew Venture .  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 83.)  Plaintiff further alleges that “PA&K's and \nOBGP's conduct constitutes breach of fiduciary duties and constructive fraud which \nsupports” the UDTPA claim , but do es not allege how Barry Poole engaged in any \n \n \nunfair or deceptive act other than claim ing that Defendants knew about Plaintiff’s \nprevious involvement in the Joint Venture and acted in “their own selfish interests.”  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 84–87.) \n42. The law regarding the elements of a cognizable claim for violation of the \nUDTPA is well established.  See e.g. Kane v. Moore, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 184, *10- 13 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 4, 2018). Whether an act “constitute[s] an unfair or deceptive \ntrade practice” is a question of law for the court.  RD&J Props. v. Lauralea- Dilton \nEnters., LLC, 165 N.C. App. 737, 748, 600 S.E.2d 492, 501 (2004). \n43. Barry Poole argues that Plaintiff’s failure to allege that Barry Poole had \nany duty to disclose the New Venture to Plaintiff causes Plaintiff’s claim of unfair or \ndeceptive conduct to fail.  (ECF No. 20, at pp. 11– 12.)  Generally, a duty to disclose \narises (a) when the parties have a fiduciary relationship, (b) where a party to an arms-\nlength transaction “has taken affirmative steps to  conceal material facts from the \nother,” or (c) where a party knows of a “latent defect in the subject matter of the \nnegotiations about which the other party is both ignorant and unable to discover \nthrough reasonable diligence.”  Harton v. Harton , 81 N.C. App. 295, 297- 98, 344 \nS.E.2d 117 (1986); see also Friedland v. Gales, 131 N.C. App. 802, 807, 509 S.E.2d 793 \n(1998).  \n44. Plaintiff does not allege that Barry Poole owed a fiduciary duty or any \nother type of legal duty to Plaintiff, nor that Barry Poole engaged  with Plaintiff in \nany negotiations involving the New Venture that might impose an obligation for him \nto disclose facts to Plaintiff.  Instead, Plaintiff asserts that it has pleaded a claim for \n \n \nviolation of the UDTPA against Barry Poole because Defendants  “knew or should \nhave known that the New Venture was being concealed from [Plaintiff].  Each of the \nDefendants nevertheless pursued their  [sic] own respective selfish interests in the \nnew venture to the exclusion of and in violation of [Plaintiff]’s rights .”  (ECF No. 37, \nat pp. 17–18.) \n45. Plaintiff’s argument is frivolous.  There are no facts alleged in the \nAmended Complaint that would support a claim that Barry Poole had an obligation \nto disclose the New Venture to Plaintiff, or that Barry Poole engaged in a ny conduct \ntowards Plaintiff that violated the UDPTA.  Accordingly, to the extent Barry Poole’s \nMotion seeks dismissal of the claim for violation of the UDTPA, the motion should be \nGRANTED. \niv. Civil Conspiracy \n46. “There is no independent cause of action for civil conspiracy.  Only when \nthere is an underlying claim for unlawful conduct can a plaintiff state a claim for civil \nconspiracy by also alleging the agreement of two or more parties to carry out the \nconduct and injury resulting from the agreement.”  Toomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. App. \n462, 483, 574 S.E.2d 76, 92 (2002).  “The charge of conspiracy itself does nothing more \nthan associate the defendants together and perhaps liberalize the rules of evidence \nto the extent that under proper circumstances the acts and conduct of one might be \nadmissible against all. ”  Shope v. Boyer, 268 N.C. 401, 405, 150 S.E.2d 771, 774 \n(1966); see also GoRhinoGo, LLC v. Lewis, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *20 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Sept. 9, 2011) (“Having joined the conspiracy, [two individual defendants] became \n \n \nexposed to liability with [co- defendant] and any other co -conspirators for damages \ncaused by any act in furtherance of the common scheme.”). \n47. To plead a  claim for  civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege: “(1) An \nagreement between two or more individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful \nact in an unlawful way; (3) resulting in injury to plaintiff inflicted by one or more of \nthe conspirators; and (4) pu rsuant to a common scheme.”  Piraino Bros., LLC v. \nAtlantic Fin. Grp., Inc., 211 N.C. App. 343, 350, 712 S.E.2d 328, 333 (2011). \n48. With regard to the claim for civil conspiracy, Plaintiff alleges the \nfollowing: \n97. The Defendants all entered an agreement to pursue the \n[New Venture], with knowledge that their actions were \nunlawful as relating to [Plaintiff ] and its interest in the \n[Joint Venture]. \n \n98. Each of the Defendants willfully and wantonly \nparticipated in pursuit of the goal of their agreement. \n \n99. Each of the Defendants, acting in concert with the \nothers, caused damage to [Plaintiff]. \n \n(ECF No. 4, at ¶¶ 97–99.) \n \n49. Barry Poole  argues that “[b]ecause dismissal is proper as to the \nPlaintiff’s other claims against Barry Poole, it should also be granted as t o the \nancillary claim of civil conspiracy, ” citing Piraino Bros., LLC, 211 N.C. App. at 350, \n712 S.E.2d at 334 in support.  (ECF No. 20, at p. 13.) Barry Poole’s  argument is \nincorrect.  In Piraino Bros. , the underlying tort claim had been dismissed by the \nCourt.  Id. at 350, 712 S.E.2d at 333-334.  Therefore, there was no underlying claim \nof wrongful conduct on which the civil conspiracy claim could be sustained. Id. \n \n \n50. In this case, while the Court is dismissing the tort claims against Barry \nPoole, there  remain unresolved claims of tortious conduct against the other \nDefendants.  In Chisum v. MacDonald, this Court held: \nHardison argues that Plaintiff cannot maintain a claim for \ncivil conspiracy because the other claims against Hardison \nfail . . . Hardison's . . . argument is incorrect. The dismissal \nof the claims against Hardison for breach of fiduciary duty \nand professional negligence does not bar him from liability \nfor damages resulting from the other conspirators’ acts. \n \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 34, *32 (N.C. Super. Ct. April 18, 2018) \n \n51. Nevertheless, as with the other claims Plaintiff has brought against \nBarry Poole, the Amended Complaint does not contain any factual allegations  \ninvolving him that support the conclusory allegations of civil conspiracy.  Even if \nPlaintiff has sufficiently alleged tort claims against other Defendants, the allegations \ndo not suggest how Barry Poole was involved in an agreement to commit any wrongful \nconduct.  Thus, the Court concludes that the allegations fail to state a cause of action \nfor civil conspiracy against Barry Poole.  See Bottom v. Bailey , 238 N.C. App. 202, \n213, 767 S.E.2d 883, 890 (2014) ( affirming dismissal of claim for civil conspiracy  \nholding that while “[t]he claim suggests that defendants . . . conspired, [it] fails to \nallege how this conspiracy came to be, or when, or where, or why. The complaint \nasserts mere conclusions concerning the elements of civil conspiracy, without offering \na scintilla of factual allegation in support of the claim.”). \n52. Therefore, to the extent Barry Poole’s Motion seeks dismissal of the \nclaim for civil conspiracy, the motion should be GRANTED. \nC. Laura Poole’s Motions  \n \n \n53. The only allegations regarding Laura Poole in the Amended Complaint \nare that she “is an individual residing in Alleghany County, North Carolina” and “is \na licensed real estate broker involved in marketing and selling RV resort properties, \nincluding the real property involved in this lawsuit.”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 9.)  Although \nthe Amended Complaint makes certain allegations against unspecified Defendants  \nand purports to make claims against Laura Poole for conversion , (Id. at ¶¶ 73 –79), \nunfair and deceptive trade practices,  ( Id. at ¶¶ 80-90), “tortious interference with a \nbusiness contract and relationship” ( Id. at ¶¶ 91- 95), and civil conspiracy ( Id. at ¶¶ \n96-100),  Plaintiff does not allege that Laura Poole engaged in any specific conduct or \ntook any action.  Laura Poole moves for dismissal on the grounds that the Amended \nComplaint fails to allege any claims against her.   She also contends that she is \nentitled to an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to N.C.G.S. §§ 6 -21.5 and 75- 16.1 \nand/or for an award of sanctions (including the reasonable expenses incurred by her \nbecause of the filing of this claim) pursuant to Rule 11.  (ECF No. 22, at pp. 1–2.) \n54. Plaintiff’s only response to Laura Poole’s contentions is its claim that it \npossesses facts suggesting that she “participated in meetings with the partners in the \n[Joint Venture ] where the concepts and ideas for the Luxury RV Resort were \ndiscussed,” and that she is listed on an internet website for the New Venture as the \ncontact person for interested parties and prospect ive purchasers.  (ECF No. 37, pp. \n22–23.)  Even if these facts were somehow sufficient to bolster Plaintiff’s allegations \nregarding Laura Poole, they are not alleged in the Amended Complaint.  Finally, \nPlaintiff admits that it named Laura Poole as a Defendant in this lawsuit despite the \n \n \nfact that it “has no further specific information of [Laura] Poole’s actual conduct in \nthis matter.”  (Id. at p. 23.) \ni. Motion to Dismiss \n55. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff names Laura Poole as a Defendant \nin this action and makes claims against her for conversion, violation of the North \nCarolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA), tortious interference \nwith contract, and civil conspiracy. \n56. With regard to the claim for conversion, Plaintiff alleges that the “Joint \nVenture” owned “substantial assets” “in the form of intellectual property, marketing \nstrategy and plans, site planning, slope analysis, zoning approval and other valuable \nand material components of a viable venture,”  and that “Defendants joined forces to \nwrongfully appropriate these assets to their own benefit.”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 75). \n57. North Carolina law on conversion is set out above in the discussion of \nBarry Poole’s Motion.  Plaintiff does not allege facts suggesting how Laura Poole could \nconceivably be liable for conversion.  “On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the \ncourt is not . . . required to accept mere conclusory allegations, unwarranted \ndeductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences as true.”  Estate of Vaughn v. Pike Elec., \nLLC, 230 N.C. App. 485, 493, 751 S.E.2d 227, 233 (2013); see also Global Promotions \nGrp., Inc. , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *12 (“Absent specific, supportive, factual \nallegations, the court need not accept as true general conclusory allegations of the \nelements of a caus e of action for purposes of a motion to dismiss”) .  The claim for \nconversion against Laura Poole should be dismissed. \n \n \n58. Regarding the claim for tortious interference, the Amended Complaint \nmakes the conclusory allegation that “the Defendants, and each of the m, interfered \nin the relationship and induced PA&K and OBGP to breach the Agreement to the \nharm of MI.”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶ 93.)  As previously stated, to plead a claim for tortious \ninterference with contract, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) a valid contra ct existed \nbetween the plaintiff and a third party that conferred upon plaintiff contractual \nrights against the third party; (2) the defendant was aware of the contract; (3) the \ndefendant intentionally induced the third party not to comply with the contract; (4) \nthe defendant did so without justification; and (5) actual injury to plaintiff resulted. \nUnited Labs., Inc. , 322 N.C. at 661, 370 S.E.2d at  387.  This Court has interpreted \n“induce” to mean “purposeful conduct,” “active persuasion, request, or petition.”  KRG \nNew Hill Place, LLC v. Springs Inv'rs, LLC , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *14, 15 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb. 27, 2015)  (quoting Inland Am. Winston Hotels, Inc. v. Crockett , 212 \nN.C. App. 349, 354, 712 S.E.2d 366, 369- 70 (2011)); Southeast Anesthesiology \nConsultants, PLLC v. Rose, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 52, *28 -29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 20, \n2019); Charah, LLC v. Sequoia Servs. LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 18, *18 (N.C. Super. \nCt. March 11, 2019). \n59. The Amended Complaint does not allege any facts about how Laura \nPoole engaged in “purposeful conduct,”  or “active persuasion, request, or petition,” or \nin any other way induced, or attempted to induce, PA&K and OBGP to breach the \nAgreement. The claim against Laura Poole for tortious interference should  be \ndismissed. \n \n \n60. The same holds t rue for the claim for unfair and deceptive trade \npractices.  Again, Plaintiff alleges that unspecified Defendants were “actually aware \nof [Plaintiff]’s interest in the [Joint Venture] and its previous efforts in pursuit of the \nRV resort” but “conceal[ed] their actions” in pursuing the project from Plaintiff, and \n“readily participated in pursuing the RV resort in violation of [Plaintiff]’s rights and \ninterests.”  (ECF No. 4, at ¶¶ 83 –85.)  However, Plaintiff does not allege that Laura \nPoole owed any duty to Plaintiff to refrain from acting as the real estate broker for \nthe project, that she had any duty to disclose her involvement to Plaintiff, or how she \n“concealed” any information from Plaintiff.  There simply is no basis for alleging that \nLaura Poole engag ed in an unfair trade practice in violation of the UDTPA.  Thus, \nthis claim against Laura Poole also fails. \n61. Finally, Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations in support of the claim for civil \nconspiracy do not allege any facts that would implicate Laura Poole in any unlawful \nmisconduct, and the civil conspiracy claim against Laura Poole should be dismissed. \n62. Therefore, the Motion to Dismiss should be GRANTED. \nii. Motion for Attorney’s Fees \n63. Laura Poole contends that she is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees \npursuant to N.C.G.S. §§ 6 -21.5 and 75- 16.1 and/or for an award of sanctions \n(including the reasonable expenses incurred by her because of the filing of this claim) \npursuant to Rule 11.  Since the Court concludes that an award of attorneys’ fees under \nN.C.G.S. § 6 -21.5 is warranted, it does not consider Laura Poole’s requests under \nN.C.G.S. § 77-16.1 or under Rule 11, and those motions are therefore DENIED.  \n \n \n64. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21.5 provides, in relevant part, \nIn any civil action, . . . , the court, upon motion of the \nprevailing party, may award a reasonable attorney's fee to \nthe prevailing party if the court finds that there was a \ncomplete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact \nraised by the losing party in any pleading. \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21.5. \n \n65. A justiciable issue is one that is “real and present, as opposed to \nimagined or fanciful.”  Sunamerica Financial Corp. v. Bonham , 328 N.C. 254, 257, \n400 S.E.2d 435, 437 (1991) (citations omitted).  “In order to find a complete absence \nof a justicia ble issue it must conclusively appear that such issues are absent even \ngiving the pleadings the indulgent treatment they receive on motions for summary \njudgment or to dismiss.”  K & K Development Corp. v. Columbia Banking Fed. Savings \n& Loan, 96 N.C. App. 474, 479, 386 S.E.2d 226, 229 (1989) (citations omitted).   The \npresence or absence of justiciable issues in the pleadings is a question of law.  Wayne \nSt. Mobile Home Park, LLC v. N. Brunswick Sanitary Dist. , 213 N.C. App. 554, 561, \n713 S.E.2d 748, 753 (2011). \n66. The Court has reviewed the Amended Complaint  and, based on the \ndiscussion regarding the Motion to Dismiss  above, concludes that Plaintiff wholly \nfails to state anything resembling a cognizable cause of action against Laura Poole. \nPlaintiff has failed to allege any facts regarding  Laura Poole’s involvement  in the \nevents underlying this lawsuit which would give rise to a claim against her.  In \naddition, Plaintiff admits that  it lacked specific information about Laura Poole’s \ninvolvement beyond the fact that she participated in unspecified meetings regarding, \n \n \nand served as the broker for, the New Venture but sued her nonetheless.  (ECF No. \n37, at p. 23.)  Therefore, there is a complete absence of a justiciable issue as to Laura \nPoole, warranting an award of a reasonable attorney’s fee to her , and to the exten t \nthe Motion for Attorneys’ Fees  seeks an award of attorney ’s fees and costs against \nPlaintiff under N.C.G.S. § 6 -21.5, the motion should be GRANTED.  The Court will \naddress the amount of fees and costs by separate order. \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that:  \n1. Barry Poole’s Motion is GRANTED.  \n2. Laura Poole’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED. \n3. Laura Poole’s for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 15th day of October, 2020. \n \n \n \n/s/ Gregory P. McGuire    \nGregory P.
