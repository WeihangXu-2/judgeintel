THIS MATTER is before the Court upon Plaintiffs Keith James Gallaher  \n(“Dr. Gallaher”), Hugh Scott Cameron, II  (“Dr. Cameron”), and Kristen B. Coggin’s \n(“Dr. Coggin”) M otion to D ismiss Defendants Thomas Arthur Ciszek (“Dr. Ciszek”) \nand Cape Fear Neonatology Services, P.A.’s (“Cape Fear Neo”) third counterclaim for \nwrongful interference with existing and prospective business relations filed February \n28, 2020 in the above-captioned case (the “Motion”).  (ECF No. 31.) \n2. Having considered the Motion, the materials submitted in support of and in \nopposition to the Motion, the arguments of counsel at the hearing on the Motion, and \nother appropriate matters of record, the Court hereby GRANTS  the Motion for the \nreasons set forth below  and DISMISSES Defendants’ third counterclaim without \nprejudice. \nThe Law Offices of Lonnie M. Player, Jr., PLLC, by Lonnie M. Player, \nJr., and Player McLean, LLP, by James A. McLean,  for Plaintiffs Keith \nJames Gallaher, Hugh Scott Cameron, II, and Kristen B. Coggin.  \nGallaher v. Ciszek, 2020 NCBC 76. \n \nHutchens, Senter, Kellam & Pettit, P. A., by H . Terry Hutchens,  J. \nHaydon Ellis, and J. Scott Flowers, for Defendant s Thomas Arthur \nCiszek and Cape Fear Neonatology Services, P.A. , a North Carolina \nProfessional Association. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”).  See, e.g., Concrete \nServ. Corp. v. Invs. Grp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).  \nRather, the Court recites only those facts alleged in Defendants’ counterclaims that \nare relevant to the Court’s determination of the Motion. \n4. This matter involves claims and counterclaims arising out of Plaintiffs’ \nresignations from employment with Cape Fear Neo  and their alleged entry into a \ncontract with the Cumberland County Hospital System, Inc. (the “Hospital”) to \nprovide neonatology services .  Of specific interest on this Motion are Defendants’ \ncounterclaims for breach of contract —based on Plaintiffs’ alleged breach of non -\ncompetition agreements  with Cape Fear Neo —and for wrongful interference with \nCape Fear Neo’s existing and prospective business relationships—in particular, with \nthe Hospital.  Plaintiffs bring the Motion seeking to dismiss this latter counterclaim  \n(the “Counterclaim”), contending that the counterclaim should be dismissed both by \noperation of the economic loss rule and for Defendants’ failure to plead that Plaintiffs \ninduced a third party to either breach a contract with Cape Fear Neo or refrain from \ncontracting with Cape Fear Neo. \n5. The relevant background to this dispute is straightforward.  Cape Fear Neo \nhas provided neonatology services to the Hospital since 1985, most recently pursuant \nto an independent contractor agreement executed in 2000 (the “Hospital \nAgreement”).  (Mot. Dismi ss, Answer Compl. & Countercls. ¶  9 [hereinafter \n“Countercls.”], ECF No. 4.)  Payments made pursuant to the Hospital Agreement are \nCape Fear Neo’s “only source of revenue[.]”  (Countercls. ¶ 9.)   \n6. Cape Fear Neo entered into separate employment contract s with Dr. \nGallaher on February 1, 1990, Dr. Cameron on February 23, 2005, and Dr. Coggin on \nAugust 1, 2012 (collectively, the “Employment Contracts”).  (Countercls. ¶¶ 6–8, Exs. \nA–C.)  Defendants allege that “[t]he terms of the Hospital Agreement were expressly \nmade a part of Plaintiffs’ Employment Contracts.”  (Countercls. ¶ 11.)   The  non-\ncompetition provision of each Employment Contract provides that Plaintiffs “will not \nengage in the practice of neonatology, nor be an officer, director, shareholder or \nemployee of a corporation, nor an owner, investor or employee of any other business \nin competition with the business of [Cape Fear Neo in the identified territory ].”  \n(Countercls. ¶ 12, Ex. A ¶ 23, Ex. B ¶ 26, Ex. C ¶ 26.) \n7. According to Defendants, “[i]n or around December 2018, Defendants [Cape \nFear Neo and its sole shareholder, Dr. Ciszek] began negotiating a new contract with \nthe Hospital for the provision of neonatal services at the Hospital. ”  (Countercls. \n¶ 10.)  Shortly thereafter, on or about  January 25, 2019, Plaintiffs tendered their \nresignations to Cape Fear Neo, effective April 30, 2019.  (Countercls. ¶ 15.)  \nDefendants allege that while Plaintiffs were employed by Cape Fear Neo, they \nnegotiated with the Hospital in violation of their Employment Contracts and entered \ninto an agreement with the Hospital to provide neonatology services .  (Countercls. \n¶¶ 18–19.)  Defendants assert that Plaintiffs are currently providing neonatology \nservices at the Hospital in violation of the non -competition provisions  in the \nEmployment Contracts.  (Countercls. ¶ 20.)   \n8. The Motion has been fully briefed, and t he Court held a hearing on the \nMotion by videoconference on July 16, 2020 (the “Hearing”), at which all parties were \nrepresented by counsel.  The Motion is now ripe for resolution. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n9. “An inquiry into the sufficiency of a  counterclaim to withstand a motion to \ndismiss under Rule  12(b)(6) is identical to that regarding the sufficiency of a \ncomplaint to survive the same motion.”   Chesapeake Microfilm, Inc. v. E. Microfilm \nSales & Serv., Inc., 91 N.C. App. 539, 542, 372 S.E.2d 901, 902 (1988); see also, e.g., \nWashburn v. Yadkin Valley Bank & Tr. Co., 190 N.C. App. 315, 325, 660 S.E.2d 577, \n585 (2008) (noting that a counterclaim is subject to “ [t]he same rules regarding the \nsufficiency of a complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss” ); Recurrent Energy Dev. \nHoldings, LLC v. SunEnergy1, LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *20–21 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Mar. 7, 2017) (applying Rule 12(b)(6) legal standard to counterclaim).   \n10. The Court must therefore determine “whether, as a matter of law, the \nallegations of the [counterclaim], treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted under some recognized legal theory. ”  Isenhour v. Hutto, \n350 N.C. 601, 604, 517 S.E.2d 121, 124 (1999)  (citation and brackets omitted).  The \ncounterclaim must be “liberally  construed,” and dismissal is not proper “unless it \nappears beyond doubt that the [defendant]  could prove no set of facts in support of \nhis claim which would entitle him to relief. ”  Turner v. Hammocks Beach Corp., 363 \nN.C. 555, 559, 681 S.E.2d 770, 774 (2009) (citation omitted).   \n11. Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate “(1) when the [counterclaim]  \non its face reveals that no law supports [defendant’s] claim; (2) when the \n[counterclaim] reveals on its face the absence of fact[s] sufficient to make a [ ] claim; \n[or] (3) when some fact disclosed in the [counterclaim] necessarily defeats the \n[defendant’s] claim.”  Intersal, Inc. v. Hamilton, 373 N.C. 89, 98, 834 S.E.2d 404, 411 \n(2019) (quoting Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985)).   \n12. Where, as here, one or both sides rely on documents which are the subject \nof the counterclaim and to which the counterclaim specifically refers, the Court may \nconsider those documents without converting the motion under Rule 12(b)(6) into a \nmotion for summary judgment.  See Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, \n60, 554 S.E.2d 840, 847 (2001) (recognizing this principle even when documents are \npresented by the movant); see also Schlieper v. Johnson, 195 N.C. App. 257, 261, 672 \nS.E.2d 548, 551 (2009) (“When documents are attached to and incorporated into a \ncomplaint, they become part of the complaint and may be considered in connection \nwith a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion without converting it into a motion for summary \njudgment.”).  The  Court, however,  need not accept as true allegations in the \ncounterclaim “that are contradicted by the documents attached, specifically referred \nto, or incorporated by reference in the [counterclaim] .”  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. \nApp. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n13. The Counterclaim that Plaintiffs seek to dismiss on this Motion states, in \nrelevant part, as follows:  \n43. Plaintiffs’ actions as set forth in herein above, including, without \nlimitation, their breach of contract, misappropriation of Cape Fear Neo’s \ntrade secrets and confidential information, and their unfair methods of \ncompetition constitute wrongful interference with Cape Fear Neo’ s \nbusiness relationships and with revenues that Cape Fe ar Neo had \nnegotiated and expected related to its relationship and agreements with \nthe Hospital. \n \n44. Plaintiffs interfered with Cape Fear Neo’ s existing and \nprospective business relations by unlawfully and unj ustly using and \ntaking advantage of Cape Fear Neo ’s Trade Secrets and confidential \ninformation and violating the express terms of the  Employment \nContracts. \n \n(Countercls. ¶¶ 43– 44.)  Although phrased as a single counterclaim for “wrongful \ninterference,” it is clear that Defendants are advancing two  counterclaims—one for \ntortious interference with contract and another for tortious interference with \nprospective economic advantage.1   \n \n1 Nevertheless, to avoid confusion, the Court references the Counterclaim herein as a single \ncounterclaim for wrongful interference, the nomenclature chosen by Defendants.  \n14. To state a counterclaim for tortious interference with contract, a defendant \nmust allege: \n(1) a valid contract between the [ defendant] and a third person which \nconfers upon the [defendant] a contractual right against a third person; \n(2) the [ plaintiff] knows of the contract; (3) the [ plaintiff] intentionally \ninduces the third person not to perform the contract; (4) and in doing so \nacts without justification; (5) resulting in actual damage to [defendant].  \nUnited Labs., Inc. v. Kuykendall , 322 N.C. 643, 661, 370 S.E.2d 375, 387 (1988)  \n(emphasis added).   \n15. To state a counterclaim for tortious interference with prospective economic \nadvantage, a defendant “must allege facts to show that the [plaintiff] acted without \njustification in inducing a third party to refrain from entering into a contract with \n[the defendant] which contract would have ensued but for the interference.”  Window \nGang Ventures, Corp. v. Salinas, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *34 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. \n2, 2019) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Walker v. \nSloan, 137 N.C. App. 387, 393, 529 S.E.2d 236, 242 (2000)).  “[I]t is sufficient for a \nparty to state a claim for interference with ‘relations’ or ‘business relations’ when \nreferring to interference with existing contracts or the prospective likelihood of future \ncontracts.”  Artistic S. Inc. v. Lund, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 113, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nDec. 9, 2015) (quoting Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head & Engquist Equip., L.L.C., 2002 \nNCBC LEXIS 2, at *29 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 10, 2002)).   \n16. As noted, Plaintiffs advance two grounds for dismissal of the Counterclaim.  \nFirst, Plaintiffs argue that the C ounterclaim is barred by the economic loss rule .  \n(Mem. Law Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Dismiss 3 [hereinafter “Pls.’ Supp. Br.”] , ECF No. 32 .)  \nSecond, in an argument advanced for the very first time at the Hearing but without \nobjection by Defendants, Plaintiffs contend that the Counterclaim must be dismissed \nfor failure to allege that Plaintiffs induced the Hospital not to perform its contract \nwith Cape Fear Neo and to refrain from further contracting with Cape Fear Neo.  The \nCourt addresses each contention in turn. \nA. Economic Loss Rule \n17. In North Carolina, t he economic loss rule “prohibits recovery for purely \neconomic loss in tort, as such claims are instead governed by contract law.”  Lord v. \nCustomized Consulting Specialty, Inc. , 182 N.C. App. 635, 639, 643 S.E.2d 28, 30 \n(2007) (citing Moore v. Coachmen Indus. , Inc., 129 N.C. App. 389, 401, 499 S.E.2d \n772, 780 (1998)).  The rule’s rationale posits that while “[t]he average plaintiff in a \ntort lawsuit does not choose his or her tortfeasors[,] [c]ontracting parties, by \ncomparison, have the ability to allocate risk among themselves at the outset of a \ntransaction and are encouraged to do so.”  Crescent Univ. City Venture, LLC v. AP \nAtl., Inc., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 46, at *76 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 8, 2019) (citing Lord, \n182 N.C. App. at 639, 643 S.E.2d at 30).   \n18. The result is that “[t]he tort claim ‘must be grounded on a violation of a duty \nimposed by operation of law, and the right invaded must be one that the law provides \nwithout regard to the contractual relationship of the parties.’ ”  Window Gang \nVentures, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 24, at * 24 (quoting Rountree v. Chowan Cty., 252 N.C. \nApp. 155, 160, 796 S.E.2d 827, 831 (2017)).  In short, “a plaintiff must allege a duty \nowed to him by the defendant [that is] separate and distinct from any duty owed \nunder a contract.”  Artistic S. , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 113, at *24 (quoting Akzo Nobel \nCoatings, Inc. v. Rogers, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *48 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 3, 2011)). \n19. Plaintiffs contend that the Counterclaim is indistinct from Defendants’ \ncounterclaim for breach of contract and is thus barred by the economic loss rule.  \nPlaintiffs argue that because the Hospital Agreement was fully incorporated into the \nEmployment Contracts, the Counterclaim —which is based on Plaintiffs’ alleged \ninterference with the Hospital Agreement —essentially seeks recovery for Plaintiffs’ \nalleged interference with their own Employment Contracts —which is the subject of \nDefendants’ breach of contract counter claim.  Contending that a wrongful \ninterference claim cannot be based on a party’s inducement of a breach of the party’s \nown contract, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ tort and breach of contract \ncounterclaims are fundamentally the same and that dismissal of the tort \ncounterclaim under the economic loss rule is appropriate.   (July 16, 2020 Hr ’g Tr. \n11:22–12:5, 12:17–23, 23:11–23 [hereinafter “Tr.”], ECF No. 44; Pls.’ Supp. Br. 4–5.)  \n20. Defendants’ vigorously dispute Plaintiffs’ contention on both legal and \nfactual grounds.  They argue  that the breach of contract and wrongful  interference \ncounterclaims are identifiable and distinct because the breach of contract \ncounterclaim is based on Plaintiffs’ alleged breach of the Employment Contracts’ non-\ncompetition provisions and the wrongful interference counterclaim  is based on \nPlaintiffs’ alleged interference with Cape Fear Neo’s existing and prospective \ncontractual relationship with the Hospit al.  As such, Defendants contend that the \nduty forming the basis of their  wrongful interference counterclaim—namely, that \nPlaintiffs have a legal duty arising from law to refrain from interfering with Cape \nFear Neo’s contract with the Hospital —is separate and distinct from Plaintiffs’ \ncontractual duties not to compete with Cape Fear Neo.  (Defs.’ Responsive Br. Opp’n \nPls.’ Mot. Dismiss 3–5, ECF No. 37.)   \n21. Defendants also point out that, contrary to Plaintiffs’ core premise, the \nEmployment Contracts expressly provide that they incorporate only “certain terms \nand conditions” of the Hospital Agreement, not the Hospital Agreement in its \nentirety.  ( Tr. 18:10–18, 22:13– 23:1; Countercls. Ex. A  ¶¶ 3, 17, 25 (incorporating \n“certain terms and conditions” of the 1985 agreement between the Hospital and Dr. \nCiszek attached at ECF No. 41), Ex. B ¶¶ 3, 20, 28 (incorporating “certain terms and \nconditions” of the 2000 Independent Contractor Agreement between the Hospital and \nCape Fear Neo), Ex. C ¶¶ 3, 20, 28 (same).)  As such, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ \n“single contract” theory necessarily fails. \n22.  The Court concludes that Defendants have the better of this dispute, \nalthough for somewhat different reasons.  While the Court agrees with Defendants \nthat the Employment Contracts only partially incorporate the Hospital Agreement, \nthe Court does not find the resolution of this dispute dispositive on Plaintiffs’ Motion. \n23. Rather, the question posed by the economic loss rule is whether Defendants’ \nCounterclaim is premised on the same legal duty as Defendants’ breach of contract \ncounterclaim.  See, e.g., Akzo Nobel, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, at *48.  Here, the answer \nis no.   \n24. Defendants’ breach of contract counterclaim is based on Plaintiffs’ alleged \nbreach of their contractual duty to “not engage in the practice of neonatology, nor be \nan officer, director, shareholder or employee of a corporation, nor an owner, investor \nor employee of any other business in competition with the business of [Cape Fear Neo \nin the identified territory].”  (Countercls. ¶ 12, Ex. A ¶ 23, Ex. B ¶ 26, Ex. C ¶ 26.)  By \nthe Employment Contracts ’ plain terms, therefore, the duty not to compete that \nunderlies Defendants’ breach of contract counter claim is limited to Plaintiffs’ \nperformance of neonatology services and Plaintiffs’ participation in a business in \ncompetition with Cape Fear Neo.   \n25. In contrast, Defendants’ wrongful interference counterclaim is based on \nPlaintiffs’ alleged breach of their duty not to interfere with Cape Fear Neo’s existing \nand prospective business relationships —in particular, its relationship with the \nHospital.  Rather than arise from a duty under contract, th is latter counterclaim \n“arises from a common law duty of a third party not to interfere with another’s right \nto freedom of contract or to enjoy the benefits thereof.”  Smith Jamison Constr. v. \nApac-Atl., Inc., 257 N.C. App. 714, 719, 811 S.E.2d 635, 639 (2018).   \n26. As pleaded here, the duties underlying Defendants’ contract and tort \ncounterclaims are not the same.  Significantly, Defendants have not alleged that Cape \nFear Neo’s existing and prospective contracts with the Hospital required that Cape \nFear Neo serve as the Hospital’s sole and exclusive supplier of neonatal services.  As \na result, Plaintiffs’ alleged breach of their contract ual duty not to compete  by \nproviding neonatal services to the Hospital does not necessarily require or imply that \nPlaintiffs have by this same conduct breach ed their duty in tort not to intentionally \ninduce the Hospital to breach the Hospital Agreement.  \n27. The Court thus concludes that Defendants’ wrongful interference \ncounterclaim is based on Plaintiffs’ common law duty to refrain from interfering in \nthe contractual and business affairs of others, which , as pleaded, is a duty separate \nand distinct from any  obligations imposed by the Employment C ontracts.  The \neconomic loss rule therefore does not bar Defendants’ Counterclaim .  See, e.g ., \nProvectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. v. RSM US LLP, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 101, at *55 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 28, 2018) (declining to bar tort claims against accountant under \nthe economic loss rule where accountant “owed a duty to competently perform its \nservices independent of the contractual engagements between the parties”); Austin v. \nRegal Inv. Advisors, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 3, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 8, 2018) \n(declining to bar breach of fiduciary duty claim under the economic loss rule where \nplaintiff had a fiduciary duty under law independent of contract). \nB. Failure to Plead Intentional Inducement \n28. Plaintiffs’ second argument—alleging an absence of requisite pleaded \nfacts—posits that Defendants have not pleaded that Plaintiffs intentionally induced \nthe Hospital both not to perform its contract with Cape Fear Neo and to refrain from \nfurther contracting with Cape Fear Neo.  (Tr. 5: 16–23, 15:9–17.)  Defendants argue \nto the contrary and principally rely on Paragraphs 9 and 37 of the counterclaims for \ntheir support.  (Tr. 21:13–23.) \n29. Defendants allege in Paragraph 9 that the Hospital Agreement was Cape \nFear Neo’s sole contractual relationship and its only source of revenue.  Paragraph \n37 is more expansive and provides: \nUpon information and belief, Plaintiffs have used Cape Fear Neo’s trade \nsecrets and confidential and proprietary information to interfere with \nCape Fear Neo’ s business relationships and clients and have thereby \ndiverted income from Cape Fear Neo to Plaintiffs through the use of \nCape Fear Neo’s trade secrets and confidential information. \n \n(Countercls. ¶ 37  (emphasis added).)   Defendants contend that the “business \nrelationships” referenced in P aragraph 37 refer to Cape Fear Neo’s business \nrelationship with the Hospital and that, read together, these paragraphs provide the \nnecessary allegations of intentional inducement to sustain Defendants’ wrongful \ninterference counterclaim under Rule 12(b)(6).   \n30. The Court disagrees.  At most, Defendants have alleged that Plaintiffs \nentered into a contract with the Hospital and that the Hospital terminated its \ncontract with Cape Fear Neo.  As noted above, Defendants have not alleged facts \nshowing that Cape Fear Neo had  or was negotiating for  an exclusive contract to \nprovide neonatology services at the Hospital, and the C ounterclaim contains no \nallegations of any “purposeful conduct,” “active persuasion,” “request,” or “petition” \nby Plaintiffs to induce the Hospital not to perform its contract with Cape Fear Neo or \nto refrain from entering a future contract with Cape Fear Neo.  Charah,  LLC v. \nSequoia Servs. LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 11, 2019) \n(“This Court has interpreted ‘induce’ to mean ‘purposeful conduct,’ ‘active persuasion, \nrequest, or petition.’ ” (quoting KRG New Hill Place, LLC v. Springs Invs., LLC, 2015 \nNCBC LEXIS 20, at *14–15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, 2015))).   \n31. The Court therefore concludes that the Motion  should be granted and that \nDefendants’ counterclaim for wrongful interference should be dismissed.  See, e.g., Se. \nAnesthesiology Consultants, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 52, at *31, *34–35, *37–38 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Aug. 20, 2019) (dismissing claims for tortious interference with contract \nand prospective business relationships  and economic advantage where plaintiffs \nfailed to sufficiently plead inducement).   Because it appears to the Court that \nDefendants’ pleading deficiencies may potentially be cured by amendment, however, \nthe Court elects to dismiss Defendants’ Counterclaim without prejudice.   See,  e.g., \nFirst Fed. Bank v. Aldridge, 230 N.C. App. 187, 191, 749 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2013) (“The \ndecision to dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the discretion of the trial \ncourt[.]”). \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n32. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby  ORDERS that Plaintiffs’  Motion is  \nGRANTED, and Defendants’ counterclaim for wrongful interference is hereby \nDISMISSED without prejudice. \nSO ORDERED, this the 16th day of October, 2020. \n \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Chief Business Court Judge "
