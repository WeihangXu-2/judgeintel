After considering OK Biotech’s \nMotion, briefs in support of and opposition to the Motion, and the arguments of \ncounsel at a hearing on March 13, 2015, the Court hereby CONVERTS OK Biotech’s \nRule 12(c) Motion into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure and ORDERS supplemental briefing and hearing \non the Motion as provided herein.\n1 \nErwin, Bishop, Capitano & Moss, P.A., by Joseph W. Moss, Jr. and J. Daniel \nBishop, for Plaintiff Taidoc Technology Corporation. \n \nFoley & Lardner LLP, by George C. Be ck, Michael J. Lockerby, and Brian J. \nKapatkin, and Clements Bernard PLLC, by Christopher L. Bernard and \nLawrence A. Baratta, Jr., for Defendant OK Biotech Co., Ltd. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.3 requires the undersigned to issue a written opinion in connection with \nany order “granting or denying” a motion under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 12.  While neither \ngranting nor denying the Rule 12(c) Motion, the Court nonetheless elects to issue this written \nopinion in connection with the Motion because the conversion of the Motion from Rule 12(c) to Rule \n56 is a disposition of the Motion under Rule 12.   \nTaiDoc Tech. Corp. v. OK Biotech Co., Ltd, 2015 NCBC 25.\n \n \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{2} Plaintiff TaiDoc Technology Corporation (“TaiDoc”) commenced this \naction on November 16, 2012 by filing a Rule 3 Summons and Application and \nOrder Extending Time to File Complaint. \n{3} On December 6, 2012, TaiDoc filed its Complaint, alleging that OK \nBiotech was involved in an unlawful scheme and co-conspiracy with Diagnostic \nDevices, Inc. (“DDI”) and Prodigy Diabetes Care, LLC (“Prodigy”) “to obtain and use \nTaiDoc’s confidential and proprietary in formation and trade secrets to unfairly \ncompete with TaiDoc” and that “OK Biotech independently interfered with TaiDoc’s \ncontract with DDI and with prospective business opportunities, misappropriated \ntrade secrets and engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices and unfair \ncompetition.” (Compl. ¶ 10.)   \n{4} TaiDoc brought direct claims against OK Biotech for fraud (liability as \nalleged co-conspirator), facilitating fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, \nmisappropriation of trade secrets under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152 \net seq. , unfair \ntrade practices and unfair competition  under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 et seq. , \ntortious interference with contract, tortio us interference with prospective economic \nadvantage, unjust enrichment, and injunctive relief.  (See Compl.) \n{5} On February 14, 2013, OK Biotech designated this action as a \nmandatory complex business case. \n \n \n{6} On February 20, 2013, the case was assigned to this Court (Murphy, \nJ.) and subsequently assigned to the undersigned on July 1, 2014. \n{7} OK Biotech filed its Answer, Affirm ative Defenses, and Counterclaims \non September 3, 2013, and filed its Amended Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and \nCounterclaims with thirteen (13) attachments (“Amended Answer”) on November \n10, 2014. \n{8}  On November 17, 2014, OK Biotech filed the Rule 12(c) Motion that is \nthe subject of this Order and Opinion. \n{9} The time for briefing, submissions, and arguments has now passed and \nthe Motion is ripe for resolution. \nII. \nANALYSIS \n{10} In its Rule 12(c) Motion, OK Biotech argues that TaiDoc’s claims are \nbarred by a mutual release provision in  a March 30, 2012 Settlement Agreement \nand Release (the “Release Agreement”) between TaiDoc, DDI, Prodigy, Richard \nAdmani (“Admani”) and Ramzi Abulhaj (“Abulhaj”).2 \n{11} OK Biotech was not a signatory to the Release Agreement nor a \nreleased party as of March 30, 2012.  (See Release Agreement.) \n{12} On March 19, 2013, OK Biotech acquired a forty-five (45) percent \nminority membership interest in Prodigy from Admani and Abulhaj.  (Def.’s Reply \nSupp. Mot. p. 6.) \n                                                 \n2 A copy of the Release Agreement is attached to OK Biotech’s Amended Answer as Exhibit H. \n \n \n{13} On April 29, 2014, OK Biotech entered into an Assignment and \nDesignation of Settlement Agreement and Contingent Release of Indemnity \n(“Designation of Release Agreement”)3 with Prodigy.  (Am. Answer, Ex. 1.) \n{14} OK Biotech contends that as a result of its purchase of a forty-five (45) \npercent membership interest in Prodigy and its subsequent execution of a \nDesignation of Release Agreement with Prod igy, it became a “member,” “successor” \nand “designee” under the terms of the Release Agreement.  ( See Def.’s Br. Supp. \nMot.)  As such, OK Biotech contends that it is a beneficiary of Taidoc’s release in the \nRelease Agreement and cannot be held liable for any of the claims alleged in \nTaiDoc’s Complaint.  (\nId. at p. 21.) \n{15} In response, TaiDoc asserts that “OK Biotech’s Rule 12(c) motion must \nbe denied on procedural grounds because it (a) relies upon numerous documents \nand facts not admitted in the pleadings; and (b) is not supported by admissible \nevidence to allow conversion to a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.”  (Pl.’s Br. \nOpp. Mot. p. 1.) \n{16} TaiDoc further argues that the Release Agreement did not vest “in \nProdigy a perpetual power to grant to any third-party an unqualified release from \nliability to TaiDoc” and that OK Biotech’s forty-five (45) percent membership \ninterest in Prodigy, purchased a year after TaiDoc and Prodigy executed the \nRelease Agreement, did not make OK Biotech a “member” of Prodigy under the \nRelease Agreement for purposes of releasing OK Biotech from liability.  (\nId. at p. 2.) \n                                                 \n3 A copy of the Designation of Release Agreement is attached to OK Biotech’s Amended Answer as \nExhibit 1. \n \n \nA. N.C. Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(c)  \n{17} TaiDoc contends that, under a Rule  12(c) analysis, the Court should \nnot consider the Release Agreement, Desi gnation of Release Agreement, or the \nother attachments to OK Biotech’s Amended Answer.  Rather, Taidoc contends that \nOK Biotech’s Rule 12(c) Motion should dismissed, or converted to a Rule 56 motion \nfor summary judgment that is properly supported by admissible evidence.  \n{18} “A motion for judgment on the pleadings is the proper procedure when \nall material allegations of fact are admitt ed in the pleadings and only questions of \nlaw remain.   When pleadings do not resolv e all the factual issues, judgment on the \npleadings is generally inappropriate.” Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. 130, 137, 209 \nS.E.2d 494, 499 (1974) (citatio n omitted).  The trial cour t must “view the facts and \npermissible inferences in the light most fa vorable to the nonmoving party.  All well \npleaded factual allegations in the nonmoving party’s pleadings are taken as true \nand all contravening assertions in the mo vant’s pleadings are taken as false.”  \nId. \n(citations omitted). \n{19} Of particular significance to this ca se:  “[I]f documents are attached to \nand incorporated within a complaint, they  become part of the complaint” and may \nbe considered.  Estate of Means v. Scott Elec. Co. , 207 N.C. App. 713, 717, 701 \nS.E.2d 294, 297 (2010) (citatio n omitted).  However, “‘[a] document attached to the \nmoving party’s pleading may not be considered in connection with a Rule 12(c) \nmotion unless the non-moving party has made admissions regarding the \ndocument.’”  \nId. (quoting Reese v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ. , 196 N.C. \n \n \nApp. 539, 545, 676 S.E.2d 481, 486 (2009)); see also Bigelow v. Town of Chapel Hill , \n745 S.E.2d 316, 319–20 (N.C. Ct. App. 2013) (“‘[A] document attached to the moving \nparty’s pleading may not be considered in connection with a Rule 12(c) motion \nunless the non-moving party has made admissions regarding the document.’”) \n(quoting \nWeaver v. St. Joseph of the Pines, Inc. , 187 N.C. App. 198, 205, 652 S.E.2d \n701, 708 (2007)); Horne v. Town of Blowing Rock, 732 S.E.2d 614, 617 (N.C. Ct. App. \n2012) (same); Fisher v. Town of Nags Head , 220 N.C. App. 478, 480–81, 725 S.E.2d \n99, 102 (2012) (same); Reese v. City of Charlotte, 196 N.C. App. 557, 561, 676 S.E.2d \n493, 496 (2009) (same). \n{20} If the trial court considers matters that are outside the pleadings in \ndeciding a Rule 12(c) Motion, “the motion  shall be treated as one for summary \njudgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56[.]”  Horne, 732 S.E.2d at 617 \n(quoting N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(c) (2011)). \n{21} OK Biotech argues that the Court should consider the Release \nAgreement in deciding its Rule 12(c) Motion , but admits that in order for the Court \nto determine whether the Release Agreement “bars TaiDoc’s claims requires \nreference to other documents relevant to its applicability.”  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. \n11.) \n{22} In particular, in addition to the Release Agreement, OK Biotech asks \nthe Court to consider the December 24, 2012 Transfer and Assignment of 510(k) \nOwnership and Registrations (“Transfer Agreement”),\n4 the March 19, 2013 \n                                                 \n4 A copy of the Transfer Agreement is attached to OK Biotech’s Amended Answer as Exhibit K. \n \n \n \nPurchase and Sale of LLC Membership In terest Agreement (“Purchase and Sale \nAgreement”),5 the January 14, 2014 Supply Agreement, 6 and the Designation of \nRelease Agreement, in construing the Re lease Agreement and deciding the Rule \n12(c) Motion, all of which OK Biotech has attached to its Amended Answer.7 \n{23} Although OK Biotech acknowledges that the documents it seeks to \nhave the Court consider are “outside the pleadings,” OK Biotech contends that they \nare properly before the Court under Rule 12(c) because Taidoc has not challenged \ntheir authenticity (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 1), they are “attached to or referred to in \nthe pleadings” (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p.  10), and they “do not contradict or \notherwise challenge any of Taidoc’s allegations,” (Def.’s Reply Supp. Mot., p. 3).   \n{24} OK Biotech’s arguments are unavailing.  None of the documents OK \nBiotech relies upon were attached or referenced in the Complaint.  Indeed, except \nfor the Release Agreement, which OK Biotech did not sign, none of these documents \nwere executed before TaiDoc’s Complaint was filed.  Although some were made part \nof the pleadings as attachments to OK Biotech’s Amended Answer, others were not \nattached but were simply referenced, and all are advanced as support for OK \nBiotech’s affirmative defense that Taid oc’s claims are barred by the Release \nAgreement.  Such facts and contentions were nowhere raised or anticipated in \n                                                 \n5 A copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement is attached to OK Biotech’s Amended Answer as \nExhibit L. \n \n6 A copy of the Supply Agreement is attached to OK Biotech’s Amended Answer as Exhibit B. \n \n7 OK Biotech asks the Court to consider several documents on the Motion that it did not attach to its \nAmended Answer and that Taidoc did not attach to its Complaint, including (i) the December 7, 2012 \n“Letter of Intent” (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 4); (ii) the January 2013 “Private Placement \nMemorandum” (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 5); and (iii) the March 19, 2013 Operating Agreement (Def. \nBr. Supp. Mot. p. 5).     \n \n \nTaiDoc’s Complaint.  OK Biotech’s arguments ignore the clear directive from our \nappellate courts that this Court may not consider documents attached to the \nAmended Answer unless TaiDoc has made admissions regarding the documents in \nits Complaint.\n  Weaver, 187 N.C. App. at 205, 652 S.E.2d  at 708.  That Taidoc may \nhave made admissions concerning these docu ments in its brief or in its arguments, \nas OK Biotech suggests, is of no consequence.  See, e.g.,  Minor v. Minor , 70 N.C. \nApp. 76, 78, 318 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1984) (holdi ng with respect to Rule 12(c) motions \nthat “no evidence is to be heard, and the tr ial judge is not to consider statements of \nfact in the briefs of the parties or the testimony of allegations by the parties in \ndifferent proceedings”) (citations omitted); Groves v. Cmty. Hous. Corp. , 144 N.C. \nApp. 79, 86, 548 S.E.2d 535, 540 (2001) (hol ding arguments by counsel are “matters \noutside the pleadings” under Rule 12(c)). \n{25} As a result, the Court concludes that the documents upon which OK \nBiotech relies in the Motion are “outside the pleadings” and may not be considered \nby the Court under Rule 12(c).  E.g., Weaver , 187 N.C. App. at 20 5, 652 S.E.2d at \n708 (document “attached to” pleading “must be disregarded when it was not the \nsubject of any admission by the non-mo ving” party) (citation and quotations \nomitted).  Rule 12(c) therefore requires th at the Motion “shall be treated as one for \nsummary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be \ngiven reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a \nmotion by Rule 56.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56;\n see Horne, 732 S.E.2d at 617. \n \n \n \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n{26} WHEREFORE, the Court hereby CONVERTS OK Biotech’s Rule 12(c) \nMotion into a Rule 56 Motion for Summary Judgment , see N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, \nRules 12(c) and 56, and ORDERS as follows: \na. OK Biotech shall file any additional submissions in support of \nits Rule 56 Motion for Summary Judgment on or before March \n20, 2015; \nb. TaiDoc shall file its Response in opposition to the Rule 56 \nMotion for Summary Judgment on or before May 1, 2015; and \nc. OK Biotech shall file its Reply in  support of its Rule 56 Motion \nfor Summary Judgment on or before May 12, 2015. \n{27} The parties shall appear before the Court for a hearing on OK \nBiotech’s Rule 56 Motion for Summary Judgment at 9:30 AM on May 15, 2015 in \nCourtroom 6370 of the Mecklenburg County Courthouse, 832 East Fourth Street, \nCharlotte, North Carolina. \nSO ORDERED, this the 16th day of March, 2015. \n "
