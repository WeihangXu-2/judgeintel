  "raw_text": "Franklin County Bd. of Educ. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 2010 NCBC 12. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nWAKE COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE   \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n09-CV-20861 \n \nFRANKLIN COUNTY BOARD OF \nEDUCATION, \n \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nNORTH CAROLINA DEPARTMENT  \nOF REVENUE, \n \nRespondent. \n \nORDER ON PETITIONER’S OBJECTION \nTO BUSINESS COURT FILING FEE \n \n \nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on Petitioner’s Objection and Motion \nin the Cause Regarding Business Court Filing Fee.  Petitioner contends that the \nadditional one thousand dollar filing fee for cases assigned to the Business Court \nshould not be assessed in cases where an aggrieved taxpayer seeks judicial review \nof a final agency decision in a contested tax case under section 105-241.16 of the \nNorth Carolina General Statutes.  Petitioner emphasized the distinction between \ncases where a party voluntarily chooses to designate an action as a mandatory \ncomplex business case and cases where filing a Notice of Designation is the party’s \nonly option.  Respondent, the North Carolina Department of Revenue, declined to \nfile a response to Petitioner’s objection, and the time for doing so has expired.   \nSection 105-241.16 provides that “a petition for judicial review must be filed \nin the Superior Court of Wake County and in accordance with the procedures for a \nmandatory business case set forth in G.S. 7A-45.4(b) through (f).”  N.C. Gen. Stat.   \n§ 105-241.16.  Section 7A-45.4(b) requires an aggrieved taxpayer seeking judicial \nreview to designate its petition as a mandatory complex business case by filing a \nNotice of Designation.\n  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4(b).  Once the case “is assigned to a \nspecial superior court judge as a complex business case,” a one thousand dollar filing \nfee is assessed on the party who filed the Notice of Designation.  See  N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§§ 7A-305(a)(2), (c).  The plain language of the “cost” statute makes no provision that \nwould exclude aggrieved taxpayers seeking judicial review from its reach.  If the \nLegislature had intended to exempt petitions for judicial review from the one \nthousand dollar filing fee, then it could have provided for such. \nBased on the foregoing, Petitioner’s Motion is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 28th day of June, 2010.
