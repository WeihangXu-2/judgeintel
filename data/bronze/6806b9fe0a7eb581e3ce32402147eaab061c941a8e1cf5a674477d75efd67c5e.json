For the reasons stated below, the \nMotion is GRANTED.   \nAlice Carmichael Richey, PLLC by Alice Carmichael Richey and Sarah J. \nKromer PLLC by Sarah J. Kromer for Plaintiff Lake House Academy for \nGirls LLC. \n \nDavid R. Payne, P.A. by David R. Payne for Defendant Catherine Jennings.   \n \nGale, Judge.   \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n This case arises out Defendant Ca therine Jennings’ (“Mrs. Jennings” or \n“Defendant”) membership interest in and employment with Plaintiff Lake House \nAcademy for Girls LLC (“Lake House”).  Plaintiff contends that while serving as a \nmember-manager and Executive Director of Lake House, and in violation of \nemployment covenants, Defendant engaged in deleterious actions that caused \nirreparable injury to the organization.  Lake House asserts claims against Mrs. \nJennings for breach of fiduciary duty by a member-manager, constructive fraud, \nconversion, breach of contract, misappropriation and threatened misappropriation \nof trade secrets, tortious interference with a contract, unfair and deceptive trade \npractices, and injunctive relief under Rule 65.  Mrs. Jennings opposes the Motion \nasserting that she neither owed nor breached any fiduciary duty to Lake House in \npursuing her right to earn a livelihood.   \n As a member-manager of a limited liability company and as its Executive \nDirector, Mrs. Jennings owed certain fiduciary duties to Lake House.  Plaintiff \ncontends Mrs. Jennings breached those fiduciary duties by (1) engaging in a \ncalculated scheme to open and/or operate a competing entity; (2) soliciting former \nemployees of Lake House; and (3) using Lake House’s confidential and proprietary \ninformation for her own benefit.  While these same acts were asserted as breaches \nof employment covenants, the Court focuses on the breach of fiduciary duty claim to \naddress Plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits.   \n \nII.  FINDINGS OF FACT \n THE COURT, having considered live te stimony at an evidentiary hearing, \naffidavits, briefs, arguments, and supporting materials, makes the following \nFINDINGS OF FACT, only for the limited purpose of determining the Motion:   \n {1}  Plaintiff Lake House Academy fo r Girls LLC is a North Carolina limited \nliability company with a principal place of business in Flat Rock, North Carolina.  \nLake House owns and operates Lake House Academy for Girls, a residential \ntherapeutic program for girls between the ages of ten (10) and fourteen (14).  Lake \nHouse Academy for Girls is located in Flat Rock, North Carolina.  Roy B. Cook \n(“Cook”) is a citizen and resident of Mecklenburg County and is a member-manager \nand the majority interest holder in Lake House. \n \n \n {2}  Defendant Catherine Jennings is a citizen and resident of McDowell \nCounty, North Carolina.  Mrs. Jennings is a member-manager1 and the minority \ninterest holder in Lake House.     \n \n  A. The Genesis of Lake House Academy for Girls LLC \n {3}  Cook and Mrs. Jennings have a long  standing relationship, and both have \ncommitted substantial time and resources to children in need of therapeutic and \nbehavioral treatment.  (Testimony of Cook; Testimony of Mrs. Jennings.)2  \n {4}  Mrs. Jennings has prov ided services for children in need of residential \ntherapeutic treatment for nearly 30 years.  Throughout that time, she has been \nemployed by and affiliated with a number of institutions including the New Leaf \nAcademy of North Carolina (“New Leaf”) where she served as Executive Director \nuntil its close in June 2010.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 8.)  Upon its close, Mrs. Jennings \nbecame the Executive Director of Lake House Academy, which was owned by Peter \nNewman (“Newman”) through Lake House Academy, LLC (“LHA”).   (Am. Compl. ¶ \n8.)  The relationship between Newman and Mrs. Jennings quickly soured, and \nNewman began to explore the sale of LHA’s assets.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings.)  \n {5}  In June 2010, Mrs. Jennings appr oached Cook and inquired about his \ninterest in investing in LHA.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 10.)  On August 11, 2010, Mrs. \nJennings and Newman presented Cook with a Confidential Private Placement \nMemorandum (“Prospectus”) which identified LHA as one of only two (2) programs \nin the entire country that provided residential therapeutic treatment to girls \nbetween the ages of ten (10) and fourteen (14) (“Target Population”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ \n10.)  The other program was located in Bend, Oregon.  The Prospectus provided that \n                                                 \n1 Mrs. Jennings wrote a letter dated October 2, 2011 purporting to resign as a manager while \nremaining as a member.  The Court questions whether that resignation was effective because the \nOperating Agreement provides that “[e]ach Member of the Company, by virtue of its status as a \nMember, shall also be a Manager of the Company for all purposes,” but there is no provision relating \nto a managers ability to resign and maintain member status.  (Operating Agreement § 3.1(a).)  It is \nuncontroverted that Mrs. Jennings was a manager prior to October 2, 2011, although she claims she \nwas a manager in name only without the authority of a manager.   \n \n2 References to “Testimony” refer to live testimony produced at the Preliminary Injunction Hearing \nheld on October 4, 2011.   \nLHA was the only program convenient for the Target Population east of the Rocky \nMountains.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 10.)  When Cook was considering the investment, LHA \nwas in the process of opening its school and had no operating history.  (Prospectus \n9.)     \n {6}  Based on Mrs. Jennings’ affirmat ive representation that Lake House \nAcademy for Girls would be the only program on the east coast providing services to \nthe Target Market, Cook decided to invest and Lake House was formed to facilitate \nthe purchase of LHA’s assets.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.)  The Lake House Operating \nAgreement provided that Cook and Mrs. Jennings would be the sole member-\nmanagers of the limited liability company, with Cook owning a seventy-five percent \n(75%) interest and Mrs. Jennings owing the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) \ninterest.  (Operating Agreement 3, 30)  Under its terms, “[e]ach Member of the \nCompany, by virtue of its status as a Member, shall also be a Manager of the \nCompany for all purposes.”  (Operating Agreement § 3.1(a).)  Cook would provide \nthe working capital,\n3 and Mrs. Jennings would serve as the Executive Director of \nthe school.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12.)  In her capacity as Executive Director, Mrs. Jennings \nwould be responsible for the management and operations of Lake House.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 12.)  She would be required to exercise control over the hiring and firing of \nemployees and the selection of vendors, and serve as the primary contact for \nparents, guardians, students, referral services, clinicians, therapists, educational \nconsultants, and employees of the school.    \n  {7}  On October 20, 2 010, Lake House and LHA executed an Asset Purchase \nAgreement (“APA”).  (Preliminary Injunction Hr’g (“PI Hr’g”), Ex. 30, Oct. 4, 2011.)  \nThe APA contained several restrictive covenants prohibiting Newman from \ncompeting with the school in certain territories for a period of three (3) years, but no \nsimilar provisions relating to Mrs. Jennings.  (PI Hr’g, Ex. 30 at § 6.2.)  \n {8}  As part of her employment with  the new school, Mrs. Jennings signed a \nBusiness Confidentiality Agreement (“Confidentiality Agreement”).  (Am. Compl. \nEx. 2.)  The Confidentiality Agreement obligated Mrs. Jennings to keep certain \n                                                 \n3 Cook testified that he has invested at least $600,000.00 in Lake House since its inception.   \nLake House information confidential and prevented her from soliciting or \nencouraging any employees to terminate their employment with Lake House during \nher service as Executive Director and for one year thereafter.  (Am. Compl. Ex. 2.)  \nShe was provided with a laptop computer which contained confidential Lake House \ndocuments including parent contact information, student information, and \ndocuments used in the operation of Lake House.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.)  The laptop \ncomputer also contained proprietary and confidential information protected from \ndisclosure under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n(“HIPPA”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 19.) \n \n  B. Mrs. Jennings’ Plan to Open a Co mpeting Residential Therapeutic Treatment \nFacility \n  {9}  Mrs. Jennings’ relati onship with Cook quickly began to deteriorate.  Mrs. \nJennings testified that she grew frustrated with her lack of autonomy and began to \nlose confidence in Lake House as an organization.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings.)    \nCook heard rumors of Mrs. Jennings’ plan to open a competing school and began to \nquestion her dedication to Lake House.  (Testimony of Cook.)  Cook then increased \nhis involvement in the day to day operations of the school.  (Testimony of Cook.) \n {10}  Mrs. Jennings asserts that she was a manager of Lake House in name \nonly and was never vested with individual decision making authority.  (Testimony \nof Mrs. Jennings.)  She testified that she participated in meetings with employees, \nvendors, parents, guardians, students, referral services, clinicians, and therapists \nand provided suggestions regarding Lake House operations; but complained that \nCook made the ultimate decision with respect to all management issues.  \n(Testimony of Mrs. Jennings.)  She further suggested that Cook uses Lake House as \nan alter ego to his other company, Duo-Fast Carolinas, Inc., but failed to provide \ndocumentary evidence to support her contention.  The Court is not convinced that \nMrs. Jennings was denied a meaningful opportunity to manage Lake House and \nfinds that the decision making processes employed by Cook is entirely consistent \nwith the terms of the written Operating Agreement and Cook’s status as owning the \nmajority-in-interest.      \n {11}  In June 2011, Mrs. Jennings acted on her frustrations and set in motion \na plan to open a competing entity in Weaverville, North Carolina serving the same \nTarget Population.  She did not resign as the Executive Director or as a manager of \nLake House at that time.   \n {12}  On June 5, 2011, Mrs. Jenning s sent an e-mail to her husband Keith \nJennings (“Mr. Jennings”) which forwarded Lake House documents entitled “LHA \nBusiness Plan.doc,” “Parent Manual 5-11.pdf,” “Operations Plan New School 2010 \nFinal.docx,” “LHA Program Description 9.20.10.doc,” “Lake House Academy \nBrochure.pdf,” and “Competitor Analysis 03 2010 New School.doc.”  (Am. Compl. \nEx. 5.)  It is unclear when these documents were prepared and who prepared them.   \n {13}  On June 6, 2011, Mrs. Jennings called Beth Padgett (“Padgett”) into her \noffice, closed the door, and threatened her employment with Lake House.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 25.)  She accused Padgett and Shannon Worley (“Worley”) of trying to “get \nrid of” Rebecca Jeffries (“Jeffries”), who was the acting Program Manager.  (Aff. of \nBeth Padgett (“Padgett Aff.”) ¶ 3.)4  Padgett asserts  \n[Mrs. Jennings] stated vehemently and emotionally that [Jeffries] was \nhere to stay and that if [Jeffries] did go, she would go, and take \neveryone with her.  She said the school would shut down, the girls \nwould not have a place to go and everyone would lose their jobs.  She \nsaid “there would not be an educational consultant in the country who \nwould make a referral to [Lake House]; I will make sure of that.”   \n \n(Padgett Aff. ¶ 3.)  Padgett asked what she meant by everybody, and Mrs. Jennings \nsaid Bryan Tomes (“Tomes”), Lake House’s Academic Director.  She told Padgett \nthat “she was giving ‘this 30 days to straighten out’ and if it did not she was going \nand the school would shut down.”  (Padgett Aff. ¶ 3.)   \n {14}  On the afternoon of June 6, 2011, Mrs. Jennings called Worley into her \noffice, closed the door, and threatened her employment with Lake House.  (Am. \n                                                 \n4 Padgett testified at the evidentiary hearing, was cross-examined by Defense counsel, and affirmed \nher testimony by affidavit.  \n  \nCompl. ¶ 26.)  She accused Worley and Padgett of being disrespectful to Jeffries and \ntold her that “no matter how hard [you] try to get rid of [Jeffries], [she] was not \ngoing anywhere, and if she did, [Mrs. Jennings] would go as well.”  (Aff. of Shannon \nWorley (“Worley Aff.”) ¶ 3.)5  Worley asserts  \n[Mrs. Jennings] then stated if within 30 days, we did not start treating \n[Jeffries] better, [she] would leave [Lake House] and take [Jeffries] and \n[Tomes] with her.  She began to yell and said that if she, [Jeffries], and \n[Tomes] left, they were going to start up another school and that they \nwould make sure that no one would ever enroll another student at \nLake House Academy and that she would make sure the school shut \ndown and that we would all lose our jobs. \n \n(Worley Aff. ¶ 3.)   \n {15}  On June 29, 2011, Mrs. Jennings had a telephone conversation with Dr. \nBrooke Judkins (“Judkins”), Lake House’s Clinical Director.  (Aff. of Brooke Judkins \n(“Judkins Aff.”) ¶ 3.)6  According to Judkins, \n[Mrs. Jennings] told me that she was planning on “things not working \nout” for her with Lake House Academy.  She stated that she was \nplanning to start a new school and had found a new location.  The \nschool was to be a residential therapeutic program like the program at \nLake House Academy.  She told me that Rebecca Jeffries and Bryan \nTomes were “on board.”  [Mrs. Jennings] said she wanted to hire me to \nbe the Clinical Director of the school.  [Mrs. Jennings] was leaving to \ngo on vacation the next day and said she was going to work on getting \na lease in place for the location while on vacation.   \n \nFollowing the conversation, [Mrs. Jennings] sent me an email with a \nlink to the property which was to be the new school.  The Property \nshown in the link is the same property currently shown on the website \nfor Glen Willow Academy.  \n  \n(Judkins Aff. ¶ 3−4.)     \n                                                 \n5 Worley did not testify at the evidentiary hearing but was tendered for cross-examination, which \ntender was declined.   \n \n6 Judkins testified at the evidentiary hearing, was cross-examined by Defense counsel, and affirmed \nher testimony by affidavit. \n \n {16}  On July 22, 2011, Judkins info rmed Mrs. Jennings that she would not \nbe joining the new school.  (Judkins Aff. ¶ 5.)  Judkins asserts “[Mrs. Jennings] told \nme that if I stayed I needed to know that she was ‘going to try and shut Lake House \ndown.’  I responded that maybe both programs could survive.  [Mrs. Jennings] said: \n‘Two programs in Asheville?  No, that won’t work.’”  (Judkins Aff. ¶ 5.)   \n {17}  On July 27, 2011, Cook me t with Mrs. Jennings “to confirm her \nintentions to ‘get out’ [of Lake House] and set a date for her termination.”  (PI Hr’g, \nEx. 31.)  Mrs. Jennings’ employment as Executive Director of Lake House Academy \nfor Girls ended7 effective July 28, 2011.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 32.)  Mrs. Jennings did not \nattempt to resign as a manager of the limited liability company at that time, and in \nfact, exercised her right to request financial information after her employment as \nExecutive Director ended.   \n {18}  As discussed more fully below, negotiations for the sale of Lake House to \nthe Innerchange Group (“Innerchange”) were on-going at this time.  Mrs. Jennings \nacknowledges these negotiations may be adversely impacted if she opens a \ncompeting school serving the same Target Population.  (Testimony of Mrs. \nJennings.) \n {19}  No later than mid-July 2011,  Mrs. Jennings contacted Steve Servais \n(“Servais”), a real estate broker with Keller Williams and Carolina Country Realty, \nand asked him to help facilitate the lease of a property to house the new school.  \n(Testimony of Servais.)   \n {20}  Servais is not an attorney, but on August 9, 2011, he submitted a Letter \nof Intent on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Jennings for a property located at 530 Upper \nFlat Creek Road, Weaverville, North Carolina 28787 (“Glen Willow Property”).  (PI \nHr’g, Ex. 23.)  Servais proceeded to form a North Carolina limited liability company \ncalled Fawkes Tears LLC (“Fawkes Tears”) which listed Mr. Jennings as the sole \n                                                 \n7 Plaintiff contends Mrs. Jennings resigned and Defendant contends that Mrs. Jennings was \nterminated by Cook.  The distinction is immaterial to the determination of the present Motion \nbecause undisputed evidence establishes that Mrs. Jennings continued in her capacity as a member-\nmanager of Lake House until at least October 2, 2011.  As detailed below and by virtue of her \nposition as a member-manager of Lake House, Mrs. Jennings’ fiduciary relationship extended \nbeyond her employment as the Executive Director of the school.   \nmember-manager.  (Testimony of Servais.)  The new school is Fawkes Tears d/b/a \nGlen Willow Academy.   \n {21}  On August 15, 2011, Mr. Jennings executed a Consulting Contract with \nServais on behalf of Fawkes Tears which provided that Carolina Country Realty \nwould “supervise all work Necessary to Assist with the Opening of Glen Willow \nAcademy and to act as the Operation Director for Fawkes Tears LLC DBA Glen \nWillow Academy.  To assist Keith Jennings and Catherine Jennings with all \noperation and facets of opening an all-girls Boarding School.”  (PI Hr’g, Ex. 22.)  \n {22}  On August 23, 2011, Mrs. Jenni ngs, individually as “tenant,” and \nFawkes Tears executed a lease with PMG Properties LLC for the Glen Willow \nProperty.  (PI Hr’g, Ex. 26.)  Mr. and Mrs. Jennings’ initials or signatures appear on \nall sixteen (16) pages of the lease.  The property is located approximately 41 miles \nfrom Lake House Academy for Girls.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 51.)   \n {23}  During this same time, while Mrs. Jennings had been removed as \nExecutive Director, she continued as a member-manager of Lake House.  On August \n1, 2011, she informed Lake House that she would continue visiting the school \nbecause it was her right as a member-manager to do so.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.)  On \nAugust 6 and 7, 2011, Mrs. Jennings requested financial information as a member-\nmanager of Lake House.  (Am. Compl. Ex. 9.)   \n {24}  On August 9, 2011, Mrs. Jenni ngs circulated confidential and HIPPA-\nprotected parent contact information by e-mail to Lake House parents and certain \n“friends” of the school directing them to a “Family Light” website which contained \ndisparaging information about the veracity and competence of the Lake House \nfaculty.  (Am. Compl. Ex. 7.)  On August 19, 2011, a classified advertisement for a \nnew residential school for girls was circulated in the \nMountain Xpress.  (Aff. of \nKimball DeLaMare (“DeLaMare Aff.”) Ex. E.)8   \n {25}  On August 22, 2011, Lake Ho use discovered e-mail correspondence \nbetween Mrs. Jennings and former Lake House employee Tomes, discussing his \n                                                 \n8 DeLeMare testified and was cross-examined at the evidentiary hearing.   \n \nintention to leave Lake House and accept a job with Glen Willow Academy.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 56.)  Tomes resigned from employment with Lake House on August 25, \n2011, signed an employment contract with Glen Willow Academy, and is listed as \nthe Academic Director on the Glen Willow Academy website.9   \n {26}  Since August 2011, Lake House made several attempts to repossess the \nlaptop computer issued to Mrs. Jennings by virtue of her employment as Executive \nDirector of Lake House.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 48−50.)  Both Mrs. Jennings and Servais \ntestified that they retained the laptop computer because it contained confidential \npersonal information relating to Mrs. Jennings.  (Testimony of Servais; Testimony \nof Mrs. Jennings.)  Rather than turning the computer over to a third-party forensic \nexpert, or discussing the issue with counsel for Lake House to arrange the \ncooperative removal of information, at Servais’ instruction, they deleted a number of \ndocuments from the laptop before Servais unilaterally arranged to have the hard \ndrive wiped clean on or about August 29, 2011.  (Testimony of Servais; Testimony of \nMrs. Jennings.)   Mrs. Jennings acknowledges that she began deleting matters \nbefore arranging for a supervised cleaning of the hard drive.  Ultimately, no e-mails \nfrom the hard drive were preserved.  The laptop computer was returned to Lake \nHouse some time after the matter was called for hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) on September 22, 2011.  Only three (3) \ndocuments related to Lake House had been preserved from that computer.   \n {27}  Under the terms of a consensu al standstill agreement reached by the \nParties on September 22, 2011 in lieu of a TRO hearing, Glen Willow Academy was \nprecluded from operating as a residential therapeutic treatment facility until a \npreliminary injunction hearing.  The parties agreed to continue the standstill \nagreement after the evidentiary hearing pending the Court’s ruling on the Motion.  \nMrs. Jennings maintains that she intends to be an employee of Glen Willow \nAcademy and that she does not have any ownership interest in the school.  The \n                                                 \n9 Over Plaintiff’s objection, the Court accepted an affidavit from Tomes which was not submitted to \nthe Court or opposing counsel before the evidentiary hearing.  Tomes was not present at the hearing \nand was not available for cross-examination.   \ntestimonial evidence establishes that Glen Willow Academy is a joint venture \nbetween Fawkes Tears, which is owned exclusively by Mr. Jennings, and \nWilderness Properties, LLC, an entity owned by Mrs. Jennings’ mother and sister.  \n(Testimony of Mr. Jennings.)  Those parties have clearly acted in concert with Mrs. \nJennings during the time preceding the evidentiary hearing, while Mrs. Jennings \nwas employed as Executive Director, and while she remained a manager of Lake \nHouse.    \n {28}  On October 2, 2011, Mrs. Jennings purported to resign as a manager of \nLake House with the intent to maintain her twenty-five percent (25%) ownership \ninterest.  \n {29}  There is no indication that Mrs. Jennings or those in active concert with \nher have solicited any student to terminate their relationship with Lake House.  \nHowever, it is clear that Glen Willow Academy will pursue the exact same Target \nPopulation if the school should open.    \n \n  C. The Innerchange/Lake House Relationship    \n {30}  Lake House executed a consulting contract with Innerchange 10 in the \nSpring of 2011 seeking its assistance in the preparation of key documents central to \nthe school’s accreditation.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings; Testimony of Cook; \nTestimony of Kimball DeLaMare.)  After Mrs. Jennings was terminated as \nExecutive Director of Lake House, Innerchange’s Kimball DeLaMare (“DeLaMare”) \nwas appointed as her successor.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings; Testimony of Cook; \nTestimony of DeLaMare.)   \n {31}  Cook and Innerchange have been  negotiating the sale of Lake House \nsince June or July 2011.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings; Testimony of Cook; \nTestimony of DeLaMare.)  Mrs. Jennings participated in activities incidental to \nthose negotiations while employed as the Executive Director.  Plaintiff and \nDefendant both testified that the opening of Glen Willow Academy will likely \nmaterially alter the market value and purchase price of Lake House Academy for \n                                                 \n10 Innerchange operates at least three (3) residential treatment facilities in the United States. \nGirls and perhaps cause the sale to fail entirely.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings; \nTestimony of Cook; Testimony of DeLaMare.)  The sale to Innerchange, if \nconsummated, may benefit both Mrs. Jennings and Cook as members, and Mrs. \nJennings has been in favor of the sale.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings; Testimony of \nCook.) \n BASED UPON the foregoing FINDINGS OF FACT, the Court reaches the \nfollowing CONCLUSIONS OF LAW: \n \nIII.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n {32}  “A preliminary injunction is an  extraordinary measure taken by a court \nto preserve the status quo of the parties during litigation.”  A.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. \nMcClure, 308 N.C. 393, 401, 302 S.E.2d 754 (1983).  Issuance is proper only:  \n(1) if a plaintiff is able to show likelihood of success on the merits of his \ncase and (2) if a plaintiff is likely to sustain irreparable loss unless the \ninjunction is issued, or if, in the opinion of the Court, issuance is \nnecessary for the protection of a plaintiff’s rights during the course of \nlitigation. \n \nId.  (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).  The burden is on the moving party to \nestablish its right to a preliminary injunction, but the remedy “should not be lightly \ngranted.”  GoRhinoGo, LLC v. Lewis, 2011 NCNC 38 ¶ 29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 29, \n2011),http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/ opinions/2011_NCBC_38%20.pdf (citations \nomitted); Travenol Lab., Inc. v. Turner, 30 N.C. App. 686, 692, 228 S.E2d 478, 483 \n(1976).   \n {33}  The grant of a preliminary injunction is binding upon the parties to the \naction, and upon “those persons in active concert or participation with them who \nreceive actual notice in any manner of the order by personal service or otherwise.”  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 65 (2011).   \n \n \n  A. Breach of Fiduciary Duty 11\n {34}  To establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, “there must first exist a \nfiduciary relationship between the parties.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651, 548 \nS.E.2d 704, 707 (2001) (citations omitted).  The North Carolina Supreme Court has \ndefined a fiduciary relationship as  \none in which “there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in \nequity and good conscious is bound to act in good faith and with due \nregard to the interests of the one reposing confidence . . . , [and] it \nextends to any possible case in which a fiduciary relationship exists in \nfact[.]”  \n \nKaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 472, 675 S.E.2d 133, 136 (2009).    \n {35}  Under the North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act, N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 57C-1-01 et seq., members of a limited liability company are treated like \ncorporate shareholders and do not owe fiduciary duties to other members or the \ncompany.  Kaplan, 196 N.C. App. at 473, 675 S.E.2d at 137.  A manager of a limited \nliability company, however, “shall discharge his duties as manager in good faith, \nwith the care an ordinary prudent person in a like position would exercise under \nsimilar circumstances, and in the manner the manager reasonably believes to be in \nthe best interest of the limited liability company.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-22(b)  \n(2011).  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-22(e) further provides \n[e]xcept as otherwise provided in the articles of organization or a \nwritten operating agreement, every manager must account to the \nlimited liability company and hold as trustee for it any profit or benefit \nderived without the informed consent of the members by the manager \nfrom any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or \nliquidation of the limited liability company or from any personal use by \nthe manager of its property.   \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-22(e) (2011). \n {36}  These fiduciary duties “are owed  by the manager to the company, rather \nthan to other managers.”   Kaplan, 196 N.C. App. at 474, 675 S.E.2d at 137.  A \n                                                 \n11 As noted, for purposes of this Motion, the Court has focused on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.  \nWhile the Confidentiality Agreement may provide a basis for preventing solicitation of students or \nemployee’s, or using some documents, it does not contain a restrictive covenant against competition.   \ndirector or executive in a limited liability company “shall be subject to the same \nrequirements and afforded the same rights as . . . a manager when the director or \nexecutive exercises authority in the management of a limited liability company’s \naffairs that would otherwise be vested in the managers[.]”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-\n22(f) (2011).   \n {37}  The Lake House Operating Ag reement designates Cook and Mrs. \nJennings as its sole members and provides “[e]ach Member of the Company, by \nvirtue of its status as a Member, shall also be a Manager of the Company for all \npurposes.”12  (Operating Agreement § 3.1(a).)  By virtue of her manager status, Mrs. \nJennings owed Lake House a duty of good faith to act in the best interest of the \ncompany and a duty to account as trustee for any benefit derived without the \ninformed consent of the other members.   \n {38}  The North Carolina Limited Liability Company Act allows parties to \nvary a number of default statutory provisions in their written Operating \nAgreement.  Allowing Mrs. Jennings to resign as manager while remaining as a \nmember may well be equivalent to allowing her the unilateral right to amend the \nOperating Agreement.  Again, the Court need not now resolve whether she was \nsuccessful in resigning as a Lake House manager.  Mrs. Jennings and those in \nactive concert with her set in motion a plan to open a competing school, which was \nnot in the best interest of Lake House, while Mrs. Jennings owed fiduciary duties to \nLake House.  Mrs. Jennings seeks to carry out that course of injurious conduct and \nrequests that the Motion be denied to allow her to do so. \n \n  B. Likelihood of Success on the Merits of Plaintiff’s Claims \n {39}  The evidence before the Court supports Plaintiff’s contention that Mrs. \nJennings breached her fiduciary duties to Lake House, by herself and in active \n                                                 \n12 Although the duty of good faith is imposed by law, a written operating agreement can alter a \nmanager’s duty to account as trustee.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-22(e) (2011).  Mrs. Jennings did not \nelect to limit her duty to account as trustee in the Lake House Operating Agreement and now must \nsuffer the consequences attendant to such an omission.    \n \nconcert with Mr. Jennings, Fawkes Tears, Wilderness Properties, LLC, and Servais, \nby taking the following actions as Executive Director or as a member-manager of \nLake House: \n (a)  On June 5, 2011, Mrs. Jennings e-mailed Mr. Jennings as many as \nsix (6) documents used by Lake House in its operation of Lake House \nAcademy for Girls.13  \n (b)  On June 6, 2011, Mrs. Jennings informed Padgett and Worley of \nher plan to leave Lake House Academy for Girls and solicit key Lake House \nemployees to terminate their employment contract with the organization.   \n (c)  On June 29, 2011, Mrs. Jennings contacted Lake House’s Clinical \nDirector and solicited her to leave her employment with Lake House in favor \nof Glen Willow Academy.   \n (d)  In July 2011, Mrs. Jennings co ntacted Servais and prompted him \nto conduct a property search and facilitate a lease agreement for a property to \nhouse Glen Willow Academy.   \n (e)  On August 9, 2011, Mrs. Je nnings caused Servais to submit a \nLetter of Intent on behalf of Mrs. Jennings and Mr. Jennings for the Glen \nWillow Property.   \n (f)  On August 9, 2011, Mrs. Je nnings circulated confidential and \nHIPPA protected parent contact information to Lake House parents and \ncertain “friends” directing them to a website containing disparaging \ncomments about the veracity and competence of the Lake House staff. \n (g)  On August 15, 2011, Mrs. Je nnings and Mr. Jennings executed a \nConsulting Contract with Servais under which Carolina Country Realty \nwould assist Mrs. Jennings and Mr. Jennings with “the operation and all \nfacets of opening an all-girls Boarding School.”  (PI Hr’g, Ex. 22.)   \n (h)  On August 23, 2011, Mrs. Je nnings and Fawkes Tears executed a \nlease with PMG Properties LLC covering the Glen Willow Property. \n                                                 \n13 Lake House has not presented evidence adequate for the Court to conclude at this time that the \ndocuments in question are confidential.     \n (i)  Mrs. Jennings solicited Tomes to resign as Academic Director of \nLake House Academy for Girls and executed an employment contract with \nhim on behalf of Glen Willow Academy on August 25, 2011.   \n (j)  On August 29, 2011, Mrs. Je nnings caused Servais to improperly \ndelete Lake House documents from the laptop computer issued to her as \nExecutive Director of Lake House.   \n {40}  At the trial of this action, it ma y well be that Lake House is entitled to \nan adverse inference against Mrs. Jennings based on spoliation of evidence.  The \nCourt need not address this issue, but it is troubled by Mrs. Jennings and Servais’ \ntestimony regarding the laptop computer.     \n {41}  All of the foregoing acts of Mrs. Jennings, Mr. Jennings, Fawkes Tears, \nWilderness Properties, LLC, and Servais are consistent with the alleged scheme to \nopen a competing entity that Mrs. Jennings laid out to Padgett and Worley in June \n2011 when Mrs. Jennings undisputedly was both Executive Director and a member-\nmanager of Lake House.   \n {42}  Accordingly, Lake House has establ ished that it is likely to prevail on \nthe merits of its breach of fiduciary duty claim against Mrs. Jennings.14  \n \n  C. Irreparable Injury \n {43}  A party may show that it will suffer “irreparable injury” for which it has \nno adequate remedy at law where damages are difficult and cannot be ascertained \nwith certainty.  See e.g., A.E.P., 308 N.C. 393, 406−07, 302 S.E.2d 754, 762 (“[O]ne \nfactor used in determining the adequacy of a remedy at law for money damages is \n                                                 \n14 The Court does not address Lake House’s likelihood of success on the merits of its claims for \nconstructive fraud, breach of contract, tortious interference with a contract, misappropriation and \nthreatened misappropriation of trade secrets, and unfair and deceptive trade practices due to the \nstrength of the underlying breach of fiduciary duty claims.  Plaintiff’s claim for breach of the \nConfidentiality Agreement would appear meritorious, at least in part, but that claim is duplicative of \nthe alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  The Court does however, express suspicion as to the legal \nviability of some of Plaintiff’s remaining claims.  Specifically, the Court is suspect as to the validity of \nLake House’s claims against Mrs. Jennings for tortious interference with student enrollment \ncontracts and misappropriation and threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.   \nthe difficulty and uncertainty in determining the amount of damages to be awarded \nfor defendant’s breach.”).   \n {44}  To establish irrepar able injury under Rule 65,  \nit is not essential that it be shown that the injury is beyond the \npossibility of repair or possible compensation in damages, but that the \ninjury is one to which the complainant should not be required to \nsubmit or the other party permitted to inflict, and is of such continuous \nand frequent recurrence that no reasonable redress can be had in a \ncourt of law. \n \nA.E.P., 308 N.C. at 407, 302 S.E.2d at 763 (citing Barrier v. Troutman, 231 N.C. 47, \n50, 55 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1949)) (emphasis in original).    \n {45}  Clearly Lake House has been harmed.  Mrs. Jennings actively solicited \nLake House employees to terminate their employment and work for Glen Willow \nAcademy, and she caused the release of confidential and proprietary parent contact \ninformation leading to parental unrest.  When Mrs. Jennings was asked how the \nTarget Population of Glen Willow differed from that of Lake House, she responded \nthat the Target Population for the two schools is exactly the same.15  (Testimony of \nMrs. Jennings.)   \n {46}  If Glen Willow Academy were to open its doors and compete with Lake \nHouse under these circumstances, such actions would unquestionably cause \nirreparable injury to organization.  The opening of Glen Willow Academy, standing \nalone, would increase the competitive market for residential therapeutic boarding \nschools serving the Target Population by fifty percent (50%) and would likely halt or \nadversely affect the pending sale of Lake House to Innerchange.   \n {47}  It is difficult, if not impossible,  to assign a dollar figure to the damages \nLake House may suffer in this case.  The Court cannot quantify the economic loss \nattendant to the pattern of conduct revealed by the record.  The Court cannot assess \n                                                 \n15 Cook is not listed as an individual plaintiff in this case.  Mrs. Jennings’s actions have caused \nsimilar injury to Cook.   The evidence establishes that Cook’s investment was predicated on Mrs. \nJennings’ representation that Lake House would be the only school on the east coast convenient to \nthe Target Population.  Within months of making this representation, Mrs. Jennings set in motion a \ndetailed and calculated scheme to organize a competing school.   \nthe impact of Glen Willow Academy’s opening on the pending sale of Lake House, \nbut all Parties agree that purchase price would be materially affected.   \n {48}  The Confidentiality Agreement signed by Mrs. Jennings acknowledges \nthe uncertainly of monetary losses flowing from the misappropriation of proprietary \nand confidential information by stating: \n[i]n the event of a breach of the covenants contained within this \nSection 3, EMPLOYEE acknowledges that injury to EMPLOYER \nwould be significant, but damages from such breach would be difficult \nto determine.  Therefore, the parties hereby agree that should \nEMPLOYEE breach any provision of Section 3, EMPLOYER shall have \nthe following rights, individually and collectively, but not exclusive of \nany other legal or equitable remedies that may be available: (i) \nmonetary damages, insofar as they can be determined, including \nattorney’s fees and expenses; (ii) injunctive relief and/or decree of \nspecific performance to enforce this Agreement; and (iii) all other \napplicable remedies at law and in equity.   \n \n(Am. Compl. Ex. 2, ¶ 3(c).)  Similar language has been recognized as evidence of the \ninadequacy of monetary damages, and such an inference is supported by the \nevidence presented in this case.  A.E.P., 308 N.C. at 406, 302 S.E.2d at 762; See \nAmdar, Inc. v. Satterwhite, 37 N.C. App. 410, 246 S.E.2d 165, disc. rev. den. 295 \nN.C. 645 (1978).   \n {49}  Based on the foregoing, Plaint iff has carried its burden of proof and \nestablished a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim for breach of fiduciary \nduty and a likelihood of irreparable harm if an injunction does not issue.   \n \n  D. Weighing the Respective Interests \n {50}  Mrs. Jennings and Glen Willow Academy will suffer materially less \ndamage or injury than Lake House if Glen Willow Academy is permitted to open \nand compete with Lake House during the pendency of this litigation.   \n {51}  Glen Willow Academy has no stud ent population, no operations, and no \npaid employees.  (Testimony of Mrs. Jennings; Testimony of Servais.)  Its only \noutstanding monetary obligation is the Glen Willow Property lease which was \nexecuted on August 23, 2011.  Under its terms, Mrs. Jennings and Fawkes Tears \nwere obligated to deliver a security deposit of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) \nupon the execution of the lease, and remit periodic rent payments of thirteen  \nthousand dollars ($13,000.00) for the first three (3) months and sixteen thousand \ndollars ($16,000.00) for months four (4) through sixteen (16).16  (PI Hr’g, Ex. 26.)    \n {52}  Nevertheless, Mrs. Jennings argues  that her interest in operating Glen \nWillow Academy is paramount and that enjoining her from doing so abridges her \nConstitutional right to earn a livelihood and provide for her family.  While the \nCourt recognizes the rights Mrs. Jennings asserts, the North Carolina Supreme \nCourt has chosen not to enforce such an interest when it is asserted to obtain gains \nachieved by illegitimate and unscrupulous means.  In \nA.E.P., our Supreme Court \nstated \n‘it is just as important to protect the enjoyment of an establishment in \ntrade or profession, which its possessor has built up by his own honest \napplication to every-day duty and the faithful performance of tasks \nwhich every day imposes on the ordinary man.  What one creates by \nhis own labor is his.  Public policy does not intend that another than \nthe producer shall reap the fruits of labor.  Rather it gives to him who \nlabors the right by every legitimate means to protect the fruits of his \nlabor and secure the enjoyment of them for himself.  Freedom of \ncontract must not be unreasonably abridged.  Neither must the right to \nprotect by reasonable restrictions that which a man by industry, skill \nand good judgment has built up, be denied.’   \n \nA.E.P., 308 N.C. at 407−08, 302 S.E.2d at 763.   \n {53}  Mrs. Jennings remains free to pu rsue her chosen profession so long as \nshe does so without infringing obligations owed to Lake House.  She is free to \npursue her interests in the field of residential therapeutic treatment, but her \ncontinuing fiduciary obligation to Lake House inhibits her ability to organize and \noperate a competing facility serving the same Target Population.     \n {54}  Consequently, a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo \npending the final adjudication of this matter is likely to cause Mrs. Jennings and \nGlen Willow Academy materially less damage or injury in comparison to the risk or \n                                                 \n16 The Court is not sympathetic to the fact that Mrs. Jennings executed the lease with knowledge of \nor conscious ignorance to the possibility that litigation would ensue.   \nirreparable injury faced by Lake House if Glen Willow Academy is permitted to \nopen as scheduled.     \n \n  E. Security  \n {55}  Rule 65(c) requires  that the grant of a preliminary injunction shall be \nconditioned upon the giving of security by the moving party in a sum determined by \nthe Court to be proper for the payment of costs and damages that may be suffered \nby a party ultimately determined to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. \n {56}  Neither Party has presented evidence  as to the amount of the security in \nthis case and the Court has no way to anticipate the course or duration of this \nlitigation.   \n {57}  In its discretion, the Court conc ludes that to protect the interests of \nthose impacted by this injunction, security in the amount of one-hundred thousand \ndollars ($100,000.00) is reasonable and appropriate as a condition of granting a \npreliminary injunction in this matter.      \n NOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing FINDINGS of FACT and \nCONCLUSIONS of LAW, it is hereby ORDERED that: \n {1}  Pending final resolution of this civil action, and unless and until \notherwise ordered by this Court, Mrs. Jennings and any persons or entities in active \nconcert or participation with her are hereby RESTRAINED, ENJOINED, and \nFORBIDDEN from  \n (a)  Using, disclosing, or distributi ng any Confidential Information, as \nthat term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, that Mrs. Jennings \nreceived by virtue of her status as a member-manager of Lake House;  \n (b)  Using, disclosing, or distributi ng any Confidential Information, as \nthat term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, that Mrs. Jennings \nreceived by virtue of her status as the Executive Director of Lake House; \n (c)   Further soliciting any Lake House employees; \n (d)  Soliciting any current La ke House student or family;  \n (e)   Establishing, opening, owni ng, or operating Glen Willow Academy \nor taking any further actions to advance the purpose of Glen Willow \nAcademy;  \n (f)  Taking any further actions wh ich violate Mrs. Jennings’ fiduciary \nduties as a member-manager of Lake House;  \n (g)  Destroying any documents, data , information, or property now or \nformerly in or under Mrs. Jennings’ custody, possession, or control, including \nbut not limited to electronic data and correspondence, which constitutes or \ncould constitute evidence of any kind in this lawsuit.   \n {2}  Pursuant to the provisions of Rule  65(c), this Order shall become effective \nwhen Plaintiff Lake House Academy for Girls LLC has posted security (“Security”) \nin the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000.00).  Said \nSecurity shall be in the form of a surety bond or other undertaking satisfactory to \nthe Clerk of Superior Court of Henderson County, for the payment of such costs and \ndamages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been \nwrongfully enjoined or restrained by this Order.  \n {3}  Except as GRANTED by the terms of this Order, the Motion is DENIED. \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED, this 13t h day of October, 2011.  \n \n \n "
