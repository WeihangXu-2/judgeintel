(“Fund II”), a Delaware limited partnership, was organized on November 16, 1998 and operated pursuant to\nthe Fund II Partnership Agreement.\n[1]\n  \n(Compl. at ¶¶ 7, 26.)\n  \nFund I and Fund II are collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Funds,” unless referred to individually.\n  \nThe\nFund I Partnership Agreement and the Fund II Partnership Agreement are collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Partnership Agreements,” unless referred to\nindividually.\n \n{9}\n      \nThe Funds were organized for the purpose of making venture capital investments.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 25.)\n{10}\n    \nThe Funds were managed by a General Partner.\n  \nPiedmont Venture Management, Inc. (“PVM”) served as the General Partner for Fund I.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 9.)\n  \nPiedmont\nVenture Capital Management, L.L.C. (“PVCM”) served as the General Partner for Fund II.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 10.)\n  \nPVM and PVCM are collectively referred to hereinafter as\nthe “General Partners,” unless referred to individually.\n{11}\n    \nStacy E. Anderson (“\nAnderson\n”) and William W. Neal (“Neal”) were, at all relevant times, the managing principals of PVM and PVCM.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶¶ 11-12.)\n  \nThe\nComplaint uses the term “Management” to refer to PVM, PVCM, Anderson, and Neal collectively.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 12.)\nB.\nOVERVIEW OF THE FACTS\n{12}\n    \nPlaintiffs allege the following facts which, for purposes of the Motion to Dismiss, will be treated as true.\n{13}\n    \nPlaintiffs seek to pursue derivative claims on behalf of the Funds against Deloitte for its acts and/or omissions while serving as the independent auditor for the\nFunds.\n  \nGenerally stated, Plaintiffs allege that “Deloitte failed to communicate to the Plaintiffs, among other things, the widespread malfeasance and acts of self-dealing\nbeing committed by the Funds’ Management despite being on notice of and/or having actual knowledge of such.”\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 15.)\n{14}\n    \nThe Plaintiffs, along with approximately one hundred and sixty other qualified individual and institutional investors, invested a total of more than $45,000,000 in the\nFunds.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶¶ 27, 29.)\n{15}\n    \nPlaintiffs allege that Management retained Deloitte, as an independent auditor, during the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, “to provide the Plaintiffs with audited\nfinancial statements.”\n[2]\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 30.)\n  \nPlaintiffs further allege that Deloitte performed the auditing services annually until it withdrew during the 2001 audit.\n  \n(Compl.\nat ¶ 36.)\n{16}\n    \nWith respect to Deloitte’s alleged wrongdoing, Plaintiffs allege that “Deloitte \nbecame aware of Management’s malfeasance[,]” but “never brought this information\nto the Limited Partners’ attention.”\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 38.)\n  \nPlaintiffs further allege that “Deloitte also discovered . . .\n  \nthat the information and/or assumptions underlying the\nFunds’ 1999 and 2000 financial statements were erroneous.\n  \nDespite this knowledge, Deloitte failed to take any action to correct the errors in these financial reports.”\n[3]\n \n(Compl. at ¶ 39.)\n{17}\n    \nPlaintiffs concede in the Complaint that they made no demand on the Funds prior to filing this action.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 21.)\n  \nInstead, Plaintiffs allege that making such a\ndemand would have been futile because the General Partners were themselves engaged in the malfeasance described in the Complaint.\n[4]\n  \n(Compl. at ¶¶ 21-24.)\n{18}\n    \nOn May 27, 2005, three (3) months before this action was filed, the General Partners of Fund I and Fund II, PVM and PVCM respectively, filed Chapter 7 petitions\nfor bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina.\n[5]\n{19}\n    \nThe Partnership Agreements of both Funds specifically set forth what is to occur in the event of a bankruptcy filing by the General Partner.\n  \nSection 5.2 of the Fund\nI Agreement establishes that if the General Partner becomes bankrupt, “its successor shall be chosen as set forth in Section 10.1(a)(iv).”\n  \nFund I Agreement § 5.2.\n  \nUnder\nSection 10.1(a)(iv), a two-thirds majority of the Limited Partners have ninety (90) days to agree to continue the Fund and to elect a new General Partner.\n  \nFund I Agreement\n§ 10.1(a)(iv).\n  \nIf after ninety (90) days the Limited Partners have failed to do so, the Agreement provides for the Limited Partners to elect a Liquidator to dissolve and wind\nup the affairs of the Fund.\n  \nFund I Agreement, § 10.1(c).\n \n{20}\n    \nThe Fund II Agreement lays out a similar procedure.\n  \nSpecifically, Section 14.2 provides that “[t]he Partnership shall be dissolved” upon the bankruptcy of a\nGeneral Partner.\n  \nFund II Agreement § 14.2; \nDel.\n Code Ann. tit. 6, § 17-402(a).\n  \nIn the event that there is no General Partner at dissolution (as was the case here), the\nAgreement provides that\n “a Limited Partner Majority may designate one or more persons to act as the Liquidator” to wind up the partnership’s affairs.\n  \nFund II Agreement\n§ 14.5.\n  \nSection 14.5 provides further that “[a]ny such Liquidator which is not the General Partner shall be a ‘liquidating trustee[.]’”\n  \nFund II Agreement § 14.5; \nDel.\n Code\nAnn. tit. 6, § 17-101(10).\n \n{21}\n    \nThe Plaintiffs do not allege in the Complaint that they attempted to comply with the Partnership Agreements by appointing a new General Partner or a Liquidator\nfollowing the bankruptcy of the Funds’ General Partners.\nIII.\nAPPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD\n{22}\n    \nThe essential question on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) “‘is whether the complaint, when liberally construed, states a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted on \nany\n theory.’”\n  \nOberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, \n147 N.C. App. 52, 56, 554 S.E.2d 840, 844 (2001) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).\n  \nOn a motion to\ndismiss, the complaint’s material factual allegations are taken as true.\n  \nId.\n (citing \nHyde v. Abbott Lab., \n123 N.C. App. 572, 575, 473 S.E.2d 680, 682 (1996)).\n{23}\n    \nDefendants argue first that the Complaint should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead demand futility.\n  \nSecond, Defendants argue that\nPlaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to establish any claims by the Funds against the Defendants.\n  \nThird, Defendants assert that the derivative claims are barred\nbecause of the wrongdoing or contributory negligence of the Funds’ General Partners.\n  \nBecause I find that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead demand futility, the\nCourt does not reach the Defendants’ other arguments.\n[6]\nIV.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nA.\nTHE NATURE OF DERIVATIVE ACTIONS AND CHOICE OF LAW\n{24}\n    \nA derivative action “permits an individual shareholder to bring ‘suit to enforce a \ncorporate\n cause of action against officers, directors, and third parties.’”\n  \nKamen v.\nKemper Fin. Servs.\n, 500 \nU.S.\n 90, 95, 114 L. Ed. 2d 152, 163 (1991) (quoting \nRoss v. Bernhard\n, 396 \nU.S.\n 531, 534, 24 L. Ed. 2d 729, 734 (1970)).\n  \nThe underlying theory of\na derivative action is that of redressing a wrong to the corporation and not to the shareholder individually.\n  \nThus, any harm suffered must be to the corporation, and all\nrecovery, including damages, belongs to the corporation.\n  \nSee Norman v. Nash Johnson & Sons’ Farms, Inc.\n, 140 N.C. App. 390, 396, 405, 537 S.E.2d 248, 254, 259\n(2000).\n  \nAccordingly, the decision to bring a derivative suit “generally lies within the judgment and control of management.”\n  \nAlford v. Shaw\n, 318 N.C. 289, 301, 349\nS.E.2d 41, 48 (1986) (citation omitted).\n \n{25}\n    \nBoth the North Carolina Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and the Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act (hereinafter collectively “the Acts”) provide\nthat a limited partner may bring a derivative action on behalf of a limited partnership to seek relief for harm suffered by the partnership.\n  \nSee\n N.C. Gen. Stat. § 59-1001; \nDel.\nCode Ann. tit. 6, § 17-1001; \nsee also\n \nCabaniss v. Deutsche Bank Secs., Inc.\n, 170 N.C. App. 180, 182-83, 611 S.E.2d 878, 880-81 (2005), \ndisc. rev. denied\n, 359 N.C. 850\n(2005), \ncert. denied\n, 360 N.C. 61, 621 S.E.2d 176 (2005).\n \n{26}\n    \nThe laws of the state where the limited partnership was organized control for the purpose of determining whether the requirements for bringing a derivative action\nhave been satisfied.\n  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 59-901; \nDel.\n Code Ann. tit. 6, § 17-901.\n  \nAccordingly, Fund I, a \nNorth \nCarolina\n limited liability partnership, is governed by \nNorth\nCarolina\n law, and Fund II, a \nDelaware\n limited liability partnership, is governed by \nDelaware\n law.\nB.\nTHE DEMAND REQUIREMENT\n{27}\n    \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss seeks dismissal primarily on the grounds that Plaintiffs failed to make a pre-suit demand on the Funds’ General Partners or, in the\nalternative, demonstrate that such demand should be excused.\n  \nPlaintiffs counter that demand should be excused in this case because demand on the General Partners would\nhave been futile.\n{28}\n    \nUnder North Carolina and Delaware law, a plaintiff is required to\n make a “demand” on the general partner prior to bringing a derivative action on behalf of a limited\npartnership, unless such demand would be futile.\n  \nSpecifically, the Acts provide that a limited partner may file a derivative action if the “general partners with authority to\ndo so have refused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those general partners to bring the action is not likely to succeed.”\n  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 59-1001; \nsee\n Del. Code\nAnn. tit. 6, § 17-1001 (using almost identical language); \nsee also\n \nCabaniss\n, 170 N.C. App. at 183, 611 S.E.2d at 881 (“Under Delaware law, a plaintiff may not bring a\nderivative claim in the right of a limited partnership unless the general partner has refused to do so, or any demand that the general partner do so would be futile.”).\n{29}\n    \nThis Court recently discussed the demand requirement (in the corporate context) in \nIn re Pozen S’holders Litig.\n, 2005 NCBC 7 (N.C. Super. \nCt.\n Nov. 10, 2005).\n  \nIn\nPozen\n, Judge Ben Tennille emphasized that “demand” is a prerequisite to a shareholder bringing suit on behalf of a corporation, noting that “\nstates universally require\nshareholders to exhaust all intracorporate remedies before taking advantage of the derivative action and show that ‘the corporation itself had refused to proceed after\nsuitable demand.’”\n  \nSee Pozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 42 (citing \nRoss\n, 396 \nU.S.\n at 534, \n24 L. Ed. 2d \nat 734).\n  \nSpecifically, with respect to Delaware’s demand requirement,\nJudge Tennille explained that “‘the right of a stockholder to bring a derivative action does not come into being until he has made a demand on the corporation to institute\nsuch an action, such a demand has been refused, or until the plaintiff stockholder has demonstrated that such a demand would have been futile.’”\n  \nSee Pozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7,\nat ¶ 43 (quoting \nStepak v. Dean\n, 434 A.2d 388, 390 (Del. Ch. 1981)).\n{30}\n    \nIn a derivative action, a plaintiff’s failure to satisfy the statutory demand requirement is an insurmountable bar to recovery.\n  \nAllen v. Ferrera\n, 141 N.C. App. 284,\n287, 540 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2000); \nBeam ex rel. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. v. Stewart\n, 833 A.2d 961, 982 (Del. Ch. 2003), \naff’d\n, 845 A.2d 1040 (Del. 2004).\n{31}\n    \nThe purpose behind the statutory demand requirement is the same in both \nNorth Carolina\n and \nDelaware\n.\n  \nNorth Carolina\n law requires plaintiffs “to pursue and\nexhaust intra-corporate remedies through demand on directors [to] assure corporate management the opportunity to pursue alternative remedies, thus avoiding unnecessary\nlitigation.”\n  \nSee Alford\n, 318 N.C. at 297, 349 S.E.2d at 46.\n  \nDelaware\n’s statutory demand requirement is based on the same principles:\n \nThe demand requirement is premised on the idea that the decision of whether to bring a lawsuit is a business one that is properly in the hands of the\ncorporation’s directors, \nwhose role it is to manage the business and affairs of the corporation.\n  \nIts purpose is to ensure that the derivative action remains an\nexception to the general rule that the appropriate party to bring suit is the corporation acting through its directors.\n \n \nSee Pozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 43 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); \nsee also Cabaniss\n, 170 N.C. App. at 183, 611 S.E.2d at 881 (“The purpose of this rule is\nto allow the general partner, on behalf of the limited partnership, ‘the opportunity to rectify the alleged wrong without suit or to control any litigation brought for its\nbenefit.’”) (citation omitted).\n{32}\n    \nTo avoid dismissal of the complaint in a case where no pre-suit demand is made on the limited partnership, a plaintiff must allege in the complaint “with\nparticularity\n the effort of the plaintiff to secure initiation of the action by a general partner or the reasons for not making the effort.”\n  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 59-1003 (emphasis\nadded); \nsee\n Del. Code. Ann. tit. 6, § 17-1003 (using almost identical language).\n  \nThus, in a derivative action, the “‘pleadings must comply with stringent requirements of\nfactual particularity that differ substantially from [traditional pleading requirements.\n  \nThe demand requirement] is not satisfied by conclusory statements or mere notice\npleading.’”\n  \nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 45 (citations omitted).\n  \nIf a plaintiff fails to meet this heightened pleading requirement through particularized factual allegations in\nthe complaint, then the complaint must be dismissed.\n  \nId.\n \nat ¶ 46 (citation omitted).\n{33}\n    \nPlaintiffs here neither allege that they complied with the procedures set forth in the Partnership Agreements for electing a substitute General Partner or Liquidator,\nnor why compliance with those procedures was impractical.\n  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not address these issues at all, focusing instead on the alleged malfeasance\nof the Funds’ former Management as the ground for bypassing the statutory demand requirement.\n  \nFor the reasons explained below, this omission is fatal to the Plaintiffs’\nability to proceed with this action.\nC.\nBANKRUPTCY OF GENERAL PARTNERS\n{34}\n    \nBoth North Carolina and \nDelaware\n have statutory provisions that address the effect of a general partner’s bankruptcy on the limited partnership.\n  \nSpecifically, the\nActs provide that the bankruptcy of a general partner results in the dissolution and commencement of the winding up of the limited partnership’s affairs.\n  \nSee\n \nN.C. Gen.\nStat. §§ 59-402, 59-801, 59-803; \nDel.\n Code Ann. tit. 6, §§ 17-101(10), 17-402, 17-801, 17-803.\n  \nThe Delaware Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that the limited\npartners may appoint a liquidator with specific powers, including the authority to bring suit on behalf of the partnership.\n  \nDel. Code Ann. tit. 6, §§ 17-101(10), 17-402, 17-\n803.\n        \n{35}\n    \nIndependent of these statutory provisions, the Partnership Agreements of both Funds (as previously discussed) provide a process for appointing a new General\nPartner, or a Liquidator, in the event of the General Partner’s bankruptcy.\n  \nThe Fund I Agreement states that if the General Partner becomes bankrupt, the Limited Partners\n“shall” elect a new General Partner as provided in Section 10.1(a)(iv).\n  \nFund I Agreement §§ 5.2, 9.5, 10.1(a)(iv).\n  \nThe Fund I Agreement further provides that if the\nLimited Partners fail to elect a new General Partner, the Fund shall then be dissolved, in which case the Limited Partners shall elect a Liquidator to wind up the Fund’s\nbusiness and affairs.\n  \nId.\n \n§§ 10.1(a)(iv), 10.1(c), and 10.2.\n  \nSimilarly, the Fund II Agreement states that, in the event of the bankruptcy of the General Partner, a majority of\nthe Limited Partners may designate a Liquidator, which shall be a “liquidating trustee” with the capacity to bring suit.\n  \nFund II Agreement §§ 14.2, 14.5; \nDel.\n Code Ann. tit.\n6, §§ 17-101(10), 17-402.\n \n{36}\n    \nIn light of these provisions in the Partnership Agreements, the General Partners were removed from office when they filed for bankruptcy in May of 2005, three (3)\nmonths before this lawsuit was filed.\n  \nConsequently, the General Partners lacked authority to consider the merits of this lawsuit.\n  \nThus, the Plaintiffs’ argument that demand\non the General Partners should be excused because such a demand was futile is factually incorrect as the General Partners were no longer the proper representatives of the\nFunds upon whom demand should have been made.\nSee Johnson v. Arthur Espey, Shearson, Hammill & Co.\n, 341 F. Supp. 764, 767 (S.D.N.Y. 1972) (recognizing that “[i]t is irrelevant that [plaintiff] has made informal\ndemand on the former president and controlling director\n  \n. . . since that man is no longer in a position to control [the corporation’s] decision to bring suit”).\n{37}\n    \nFor the reasons explained below, I conclude that the Plaintiffs—bef\nore bringing this derivative action—were required by law to do as the Partnership Agreements\ncontemplated, that is, have the Limited Partners decide who would manage the Funds (whether as going concerns or in liquidation) and then make demand on that new\nmanagement.\n \nD.\nEFFECT OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS\n \n{38}\n    \nTo date, neither the \nNorth Carolina\n nor the \nDelaware\n courts have addressed the scope of a plaintiff’s duty to make a demand where the corporation (or as here, a\nlimited partnership) on whose behalf the suit was brought was defunct or otherwise inoperative.\n{39}\n    \nSeveral courts, however, have held \nthat such allegations are insufficient to excuse demand on the other shareholders to pursue the suit.\n  \nFor example, in \nJohnson v.\nArthur Espey, Shearson, Hammill & Co.\n, the corporate entity was essentially defunct with no managing body upon whom demand could have been made.\n  \nSee Johnson\n, 341\nF. Supp. 764.\n  \nIn \nJohnson\n, as in this case, the issue was whether or not the shareholders had exhausted their intracorporate remedies prior to bringing the derivative action.\n \nSee id.\n  \nIn dismissing the suit, the court concluded that the plaintiff’s allegation—that there was no one upon whom demand could be made—was insufficient to excuse\ndemand on the other shareholders.\n  \nInstead, the court reasoned that:\n[s]ince a demand upon directors is an impossibility, plaintiff must call a shareholders’ meeting and there seek action against defendant before he will be\npermitted to institute suit.\n  \nOnly when the shareholders refuse to take action can it be said that the corporate entity has breached its duty.\n \nId.\n at 767 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); \ns\nee also Taylor v. Holmes\n, 127 U.S. 489, 492, 32 L. Ed. 179, 180 (1888) (affirming dismissal of a derivative suit\non the basis that “[n]o effort was made to call together the stockholders to take any action on the part of the company, or to elect other directors, or to obtain any united\naction in the assertion of the claims”); \nWatts v. Vanderbilt\n, 45 F.2d 968, 969 (2d Cir. 1930) (finding that a demand upon the shareholders to elect directors or other officers\nto pursue the derivative suit was a condition precedent to the plaintiffs’ right to bring the action, even though there had not been a functioning board of directors for five (5)\nyears, and that because no allegation was made explaining \nthe plaintiff's failure to make such demand, the insufficiency of the complaint with regard to any attempt by the\nplaintiffs to obtain action by the shareholders justified dismissal of the action);\n \nPourroy v. Gardner\n, 122 Cal. App. 521, 527-28, 10 P.2d 815, 817-18 (Cal. App. 1932)\n(affirming dismissal of a derivative suit brought on behalf of a bankrupt corporation on the grounds that plaintiffs failed to make a demand upon the officers or the trustee\nin bankruptcy to institute the action, and that the excuse for not making such a demand—that the alleged wrongdoing was not discovered until after the termination of the\nbankruptcy proceedings and that since that time there had been no officers or directors upon whom demand could have been made—was insufficient because the plaintiffs,\nas shareholders, had the authority to elect a board of directors and other officers to pursue the action).\n{40}\n    \nIn sum, these cases demonstrate that futility may not be assumed merely because there was no one upon whom demand could be made.\n  \nAs applied to this case,\nPlaintiffs must instead show why it was, in fact, impractical to comply with the procedures set out in the Partnership Agreements for appointing a successor General Partner\nor Liquidator.\n{41}\n    \nPlaintiffs do not allege in their Complaint that they attempted to comply with the procedures set forth in the Partnership Agreements; rather, they assert futility\nmerely on the basis that the former General Partners are not disinterested parties and therefore could not objectively evaluate the merits of the litigation.\n  \nAs previously\nnoted, even if this is true, the General Partners’ position vis-à-vis the litigation is irrelevant as they are no longer in a position to make decisions for the Funds.\n[7]\n{42}\n    \nIn their briefing papers, Plaintiffs now allege that the demand requirement should be excused because there was no one upon whom the Plaintiffs could make\ndemand.\n  \nEven if I could properly consider a claim that appears nowhere on the face of the Plaintiffs’ Complaint, the alleged futility is a result of Plaintiffs’ failure to\ncomply with the procedures set forth in the Partnership Agreements for appointing new management for the Funds.\n  \nIf the process of calling a meeting of the Limited\nPartners pursuant to the Partnership Agreements presented some unusually onerous burden for the Plaintiffs, they were obligated to allege as much in their Complaint.\n  \nSee\nJohnson\n, 341 F. Supp. at 767 (noting that “[w]hatever may be the practical difficulties of making demand on the shareholders in some situations, plaintiff here has not\ndemonstrated that he could not easily attempt to call a shareholders meeting.”).\n{43}\n    \nHaving failed to allege that demand was made on any current management of the Funds, or that it was impractical to elect a substitute General Partner or Liquidator\nto consider the merits of this litigation in the first instance, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed.\n[8]\nE.\nDISMISSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n{44}\n    \nThis Court recently applied Delaware law in the demand futility context to dismiss a shareholder derivative action with prejudice, stating that “it is well-settled under\nDelaware law that, as a general rule, a plaintiff should not be afforded the opportunity to amend the complaint where he or she fails to properly plead demand futility.”\n  \nSee\nPozen\n, 2005 NCBC 7, at ¶ 82 n. 4 (quoting \nWhite v. Panic\n, 783 A.2d 543, 555 (Del. 2001) (noting that the rationale for this rule is to encourage plaintiffs “to investigate\ntheir claims before filing a complaint so that they have a basis at the outset to make particularized factual allegations in the complaint”)).\n  \nAccord Egelhof v. Szulik, et al.\n,\n2006 NCBC 4, at ¶ 68, n. 5 (N.C. Super. \nCt.\n March 13, 2006).\n{45}\n    \nNotwithstanding \nPozen\n, I find that the proper remedy here (under both \nDelaware\n and \nNorth Carolina\n law) is dismissal \nwithout prejudice\n.\n  \nFirst, the present action is\nnot a “typical” futility of demand case where the complaint is dismissed for the plaintiff’s failure to plead facts with sufficient particularity due to an inadequate\ninvestigation before filing suit.\n  \nRather, my decision to dismiss the Complaint is based on the Plaintiffs’ failure to identify and then make a pre-suit demand on the proper\nrepresentatives of the Funds.\n{46}\n    \nSecond, the present action involves an unusual set of facts.\n  \nSpecifically, this case concerns two nonfunctioning entities with no leadership due to the bankruptcy of\nthe managing bodies.\n  \nMoreover, the court in \nJohnson\n, under similar factual circumstances, dismissed the shareholder’s derivative action without prejudice to allow the\nplaintiff to amend the complaint to demonstrate that he had exhausted all intracorporate remedies, or explain why such efforts would have been futile.\n  \nSee Johnson\n, 341 F.\nSupp. at 767; \nsee also\n \nWatts\n, 45 F.2d at 971 (affirming dismissal of the shareholders’ derivative action without prejudice to a new action after plaintiffs “have exhausted\ntheir remedies \nthrough the corporation, or its liquidating trustees, or receiver”\n).\n{47}\n    \nFinally, contrary to the Defendants’ contention, Plaintiffs may in fact be able to cure the statutory defects in their pleading.\n  \nIn that regard, I do not read the Fund I\nPartnership Agreement as narrowly as do the Defendants.\n  \nIn particular, even if (as Defendants contend), the ninety (90)-day window for appointment of a General Partner\nfor Fund I has expired, the Limited Partners retain the right to appoint a Liquidator, who would be authorized to perform the duties of a General Partner, including\nresponding to a demand from the Plaintiffs to pursue litigation on the Fund’s behalf.\n{48}\n    \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs shall have an opportunity to correct the defects in their pleading with respect to the demand requirement.\nCONCLUSION\n{49}\n    \nBased upon the foregoing, it is hereby \nORDERED\n, \nADJUDGED\n, and \nDECREED\n that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \nGRANTED\n and Plaintiffs’ claims are\ndismissed \nwithout prejudice\n.\nThis the 21st day of April, 2006.\n \n                                                                                   \n                                                                                   \n[1]\n Both Limited Partnership Agreements are cited in the Complaint and copies of the Agreements are attached to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as Exhibits A & B.\n  \nAt the hearing on this Motion, Plaintiffs\nstated that they had no objection to the Court considering the Partnership Agreements.\n[2]\n \nA copy of the 2001 Engagement Letter is attached to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as Exhibit C.\n  \nAt the hearing on the Motion, Plaintiffs stated that they had no objection to the Court considering the\nEngagement Letter.\n[3]\n Plaintiffs allege that Deloitte became aware of Management’s malfeasance and the errors in the 1999 and 2000 financial statements, at the latest, in 2002 during its audit of the Funds’ 2001 financial\nstatements.\n  \n(Compl. at ¶¶ 38-39.)\n[4]\n Plaintiffs’ allegations of malfeasance against the General Partners are set forth in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the Complaint.\n  \nPlaintiffs allege that the General Partners’ malfeasance caused the Funds’ investment\ncapital to be “reduced from $45,000,000 to almost nothing.”\n  \n(Compl. at ¶ 35.)\n[5]\n Case Nos. 05-32243, 05-32242.\n  \nThe Defendants have asked the Court to take judicial notice of the bankruptcy filings.\n  \nAt the hearing on this Motion, the Plaintiffs stated that they had no objection to the\nCourt considering as fact that the bankruptcy proceedings were filed three (3) months before this lawsuit was filed.\n  \nThe Plaintiffs have also filed two (2) adversary proceedings cases against Neal and Anderson.\n \nThose suits remain pending.\n \n[6]\n Should Plaintiffs elect to re-file this action, however, they would be well-served to consider the arguments raised by the Defendants regarding the sufficiency of the claims as pled in the Complaint.\n[7]\n Plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of R. Keith Johnson, the Bankruptcy Trustee for the two General Partners.\n  \nAlthough the Defendants have objected to the Court considering the Trustee’s affidavit on the\nground that it is outside the pleadings, the Court finds that the affidavit does not assist Plaintiffs on this issue because the Trustee expressly disavows any authority to manage the Funds or otherwise pursue the\nlitigation at issue.\n  \n(Aff. ¶¶ 4, 7.)\n[8]\n Moreover, if, in fact, the Funds are (as Plaintiffs contend) essentially defunct and without management, this raises the issue of who would administer the distribution of any judgment ultimately obtained since\nsuch judgment would belong, not to the individual Plaintiffs, but to the Funds.\n  \nSee\n \nPourroy\n, 122 Cal. App. at 528, 10 P.2d at 818 (“[P]laintiffs assert in their brief that the corporation is ‘actually dead’ . . .[,] but\nif such be the fact, they are in no better position to maintain the action in behalf of the corporation because in the event judgment were given in their favor there would be no corporation to receive the benefit of the\nlarge sum of money awarded thereby.”)\n "
