Defendant \nWachovia filed a Petition for Aw ard of Costs on December 30, 2005 and filed a Supplement to \nFee Petition on January 6, 2006.  The Court heard oral arguments on th e Petition on April 13, \n2006.   \nII. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. \nTHE PARTIES \n{4} Plaintiff Beulah R. Heinitsh is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina.   \n{5} Defendant Wachovia Bank, National Associa tion f/k/a First Un ion National Bank, \nN.A. (“Wachovia”) is a national banking associat ion with its principal place of business in \nMecklenburg County, North Carolina.   \n{6} Defendant Agnes H. Willcox is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina. \n{7} Defendant John S. Heinitsh is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina. \n{8} Defendant Isabel H. Nichols is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina. \n{9} Defendant Reginald D. Heinitsh, Jr. (“Reg., Jr.”) is a resident of Transylvania County, \nNorth Carolina. \n{10} Plaintiff is the widow of Reginald D. Heinitsh, Sr. (“Reg., Sr.”). \n{11} Defendants Willcox, John Heinitsh, Nichols, and Reg., Jr. (“the children”) are the \nchildren of Reg., Sr. and Isabel Sloan Heinitsh (“Isabel”). \nB. \nFACTS  \n{12} A detailed statement of the facts of this case can be found in paragraphs 16–28 of the \nCourt’s Order on Motions for Summary Judgment.   \n \n \n \n \n \nIII. \nPETITION FOR AWARD OF COSTS \nA. \nTRUSTEE’S AUTHORITY TO DELEGATE AND LIABILITY FOR LITIGATION COSTS \n{13} In years past, the law frowned upon dele gation of management and investment \nresponsibilities from trustees to others.  Th e “nondelegation rule” imposed on the trustee “a duty \nto the beneficiary not to delegate to others th e doing of acts which the trustee can reasonably be \nrequired personally to perform.”  Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 171 (1959); see also John H. \nLangbein, Tribute to William F. Fratcher, Reversing the Nondelegation Rule of Trust-Investment \nLaw, 59 Mo. L. Rev. 105 (1994).   The Prudent Inve stor Rule of the Restatement of Trusts \n(Third) rejected the nondelegation rule.  Th e Restatement (Third) approach approves of \ndelegation and requires a trustee to “act with prudence in deciding whether and how to delegate \nauthority.”  Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 22 7(c)(2) (1992).  North Carolina’s version of the \nUniform Trust Code adopts this approach, providing that “[a] trustee may delegate duties and \npowers that a prudent trustee of comparable  skills could properly delegate under the \ncircumstances.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 36C-8-807 (2005).  The trustee has a duty of reasonable care \nand caution in selecting the agent, establishing  the terms of the agency relationship, and \nmonitoring the agent’s activities.  Id. § 36C-8-807(a)(1)–(3).  The policy favoring delegation \nrecognizes that trustees often face complex legal, investing, and accounting decisions.  It is in the \nbest interests of all parties to a trust that these decisions be made with th e advice and assistance \nof experienced professionals.   \n{14} Since trustees hire agents to help them carry out their duties for the benefit of the trust, \ntrustees are not expected to bear the e xpenses incurred in the hiring of agents.  Id. § 36C-7-709 \nofficial cmt.  This is an outgr owth of the general principle that  “[a] trustee is entitled to be \nreimbursed out of the trust prope rty for expenses properly incurred in the administration of the \ntrust . . . .”  Id. § 36C-7-709; see also 76 Am. Jur. 2d Trusts § 564 (2006).   \n{15} Applying these general principles to the issue of litigation costs and attorneys’ fees, \ncommentators note that “a trustee ma y use trust funds to pay for le gal advice regarding the trust \nadministration and may recover attorney’s fees and costs incurred in carrying out purposes of the \ntrust, including all reasonable expenses incurred in the trust’s management or protection . . . .”  \n76 Am. Jur. 2d Trusts § 572.  In order to be recoverable by the trustee, such fees and expenses \n \nmust be for the benefit of the trust.  If they ar e solely for the benefit of the trustee, the trustee \nmay have to bear  the expense.  Id.  This issue arises, for example,  when a trustee incurs legal \nbills associated with defending himself against charges of maladministration by trust \nbeneficiaries.  If a trustee has breached his dutie s to the beneficiaries, he  cannot look to the trust \nproperty to pay for his defense.  On the other hand, “[a] trustee is entitled to look to the trust fund \nfor the reasonable cost of making a successful defense against charges of maladministration \nbrought against him or her without fau lt on his or her part.”  90A C.J.S. Trusts § 398 (2007).  \nWhen a trustee acts in good faith and is not at fault in the ev ents leading to charges of \nmaladministration, he may recover the costs of defending himself from the trust property.   \n{16} In North Carolina, the decision as to whethe r to tax such costs and fees against the \ntrust is within the discretion of the trial court.   In “any action or proc eeding which may require \nthe construction of any will or trust agreement, or fix the rights and duties of parties thereunder,” \nthe costs “shall be taxed against either party, or  apportioned among the parties, in the discretion \nof the court.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 6-21(2).  The statute goes on to clarify that “[t]he word ‘costs’ as \nthe same appears and is used in this section sh all be construed to include reasonable attorneys’ \nfees in such amounts as the court shall in its discretion determine and allow . . . .”  Id. § 6-21.   \nB. \nANALYSIS \n{17} Wachovia was trustee of the Trusts at issue here.  Th e Trusts were a minority \nshareholder in Lake Toxaway Co mpany (“LTC”).  Reg., Jr. was the majority shareholder.  LTC \nchanged its business model from a real estate development company to a real estate brokerage \ncompany.  This change in business practices generated far more income than LTC had realized in \nthe past or projected to earn in the future .  After consulting w ith legal and accounting \nprofessionals, Wachovia concluded that part  of the distributions for 2000–2003 should be \ncharacterized as principal.  That decision led to a dispute between the income and remainder \nbeneficiaries which ultimately re sulted in the filing of a decl aratory judgment action by the \nincome beneficiary, Beulah Heinit sh.  Beulah Heinitsh also filed claims for breach of fiduciary \nduty and unfair and deceptive trade practices against Wachovia.   \n{18} In response to the filing of the lawsuit, W achovia as trustee engaged the services of \nBell, Davis & Pitt, P.A., and Johnston, Allison & Hord, P.A. to advise on both the declaratory \njudgment and the maladministration claims.  As tr ustee, Wachovia had the authority to delegate \n \nresponsibility for handling the litigation to thes e attorneys.  Institutional trustees, such as \nWachovia, may have less of a need to delegate au thority than individual tr ustees because of the \npresence of legal, accounting, and financial prof essionals within their organization.  However, \ninstitutions often rely on the expertise and experience of outside law firms when litigation arises, \nrarely using their internal legal personnel to handle  such matters.  In light of this practice, it was \nprudent for Wachovia to engage outside legal counsel to provide advice and assistance.   \n{19} The complaint in this action raised two sets of claims.  The first was a declaratory \njudgment claim in which Beulah Heinitsh asked th e Court to declare that the distributions were \nincome and should have been distributed to her.  The second alleged (1) breach of fiduciary duty \nand (2) unfair and deceptive trade practices against Wachovia as trustee.  These are \nmaladministration claims against the trustee based on its decision to characterize the LTC \ndividends as principal and place the Retained Funds in a money market account until the dispute \nover their proper characterization could be resolved.   \n{20} The Court notes that at the time Wachovia wa s faced with the issues arising under the \ntrusts, it had ongoing responsibilities and future obliga tions to manage the trusts.  In light of the \nhistory of litigation in this family, it was prudent to get advice and proceed with caution.   \n1. \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT CLAIM \n{21} Wachovia is entitled to be reimbursed for any costs arising out of the declaratory \njudgment claim because this issue clearly falls w ithin the category of “trust administration,” and \ntrustees are “entitled to be reimbursed out of the trust property for expenses properly incurred in \nthe administration of the trust.”  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 36C-7-709.  In response to Wachovia’s fee \npetition, the children argue that Wachovia had no stake in the outcome of the declaratory \njudgment action and that the trust ee’s obligation was to simply hold the disputed assets until the \nCourt directed how they were to  be distributed.  The Court disa grees with the proposition that \nWachovia’s role as trustee in this litigation should have been  passive.  As trustee, Wachovia had \na duty to protect the interests of all parties, including the grantor, the income beneficiary, and the \nremainder beneficiaries.  As explained in more detail below, the billing records submitted with \nthe fee petition indicate that th e activities undertaken by Wachovia’ s agents were in line with \nthese duties.   \n \n{22} In early 2003, counsel spent considerable time familiarizing themselves with this \nmatter and its history.  This was necessary in or der for counsel to gain an understanding of the \nissues and effectively advise and act on behalf of  the trustee.  The fact s underlying this case are \ncomplicated.  There is a long history of litigation within the Heinitsh family.  These disputes \nhave produced a number of contracts, a will, and two trusts.  As the Court recognizes from its \nown experience in reviewing the materials from this  case, significant time a nd effort is required \nto comprehend the facts and legal issues.   \n{23} Following this initial phase of the case, the tr ustee and the beneficiaries agreed that an \nearly mediation would be in the best interests of  all the parties.  Couns el for the trustee spent \nsignificant amounts of time in the spring and summer of 2003 pr eparing for mediation.  \nWachovia was responsible for orchestrating the informal discovery process necessary to conduct \na meaningful settlement conference.  Wachovia id entified and gathered much of the information \nand dealt with the disputes that arose.  Counsel also spent time preparing for and participating in \nthe mediation.  Wachovia drafted a protective order and retained an expert to develop settlement \nscenarios and advise the parties of their likely tax consequences.  The siblings argue that they \nwere represented by experienced li tigation counsel and that the e fforts of the trustee’s counsel \nwere not needed and were ultimately of no benef it to anyone.  However, as trustee, Wachovia \nwas uniquely suited to carry out these tasks.  Unlike the individual beneficiaries’ counsel, \nWachovia had a legal duty to repr esent the interests of  all parties.  The trustee was a natural \nintermediary between two vigorously opposed gr oups and an essential participant in the \nmediation process.  The children were correct in their observati on that Wachovia had no stake in \nthe outcome of the declaratory j udgment action.  Whether the f unds were income or principal \nwas of no consequence to Wachovia.  But it is  precisely this fact which made Wachovia’s \nparticipation in the process so  important.  Simply because Wachovia was indifferent to the \noutcome of the dispute did not mean there was not a role for them to play in the litigation.   \n{24} The siblings also complain that Wachovi a’s counsel spent too much time completing \ncertain tasks.  After reviewing the billing records, the Court finds that the time spent was \nreasonable given the complexity of the work faci ng the trustee.  As noted above, the trustee did \nnot have the luxury of only represen ting the interests of one party.  Rather, it had to consider the \nconsequences for all parties.  This case involves complex matters of trust, corporate, and tax law.  \nUnderlying all of this is a family with a contenti ous history of litigation lasting more than twenty \n \nyears.  Given these facts, the Court believes the time and effort expended on behalf of the trustee \nwere reasonable and necessary to proper admini stration of the trust.  These expenses were \nproperly incurred in the administration of the trust, and Wachovia is entitled to be reimbursed out \nof the trust property under section 36C-7-709.            \n2. \nMALADMINISTRATION CLAIMS \n{25} The children argue that fees related to the second set of issues—the maladministration \nclaims against Wachovia—are not recoverable because they cannot be considered “trust \nadministration” activities.  The Court notes that it must proceed with caution.  Trustees are not \nalways entitled to recover their litigation relate d expenses from trust prop erty.  If the expenses \nwere related to services that were only of benefit to the trustee and not to the trust, then the \ntrustee will not be entitled to reimbursement of those expenses.   \n{26} The Court finds that in this case, Wac hovia is entitled to reimbursement of its \nlitigation related expenses on the maladministrati on claims.  Beulah Heinitsh’s claims for breach \nof fiduciary duty and unfair and deceptive trade practices did not arise independent of the dispute \nover the LTC dividends.  Rather, th e maladministration claims came about as a direct result of \nthe dispute over the funds and Wac hovia’s response to it.  But for the dispute, the claims would \nnot have arisen.  This is  not a case of a trustee randomly engagi ng in some sort of fraud or other \nmismanagement that prompts a beneficiary to f ile a lawsuit alleging breach of fiduciary duty \nagainst the trustee.  Here, Wachovia did not do a nything in bad faith to bring about the events \nwhich precipitated the maladministration claims.  In having to choose whether to characterize the \nLTC dividends as either income or principal, Wachovia found itself sail ing between Scylla and \nCharybdis.  As counsel mentioned at oral argument, the trustee felt it was facing a lawsuit no \nmatter what its decision.  (Mot. Hr’g Tr. 19: 21–23, Apr. 13, 2006.)  A decision to characterize \nthe dividends as income was likely to raise the ire of the remaindermen, just as the decision to \ncharacterize the dividends as principal resulted in this action by the income beneficiary.  As the \nCourt found in ruling for Wachovia on summary judgment, the trustee did not act in bad faith.   \n{27} The Court has dismissed the maladministration claims against Wachovia, finding there \nto be no genuine issue of material fact as to th e trustee’s breach of fiduciary duty.  The Court \nrelies on the principle that “[a] trustee is entitled  to look to the trust fund for the reasonable cost \nof making a successful defense against charges of  maladministration brought against him or her \n \nwithout fault on his or her part.”  See 90A C.J.S. Trusts § 398.  Wachovia was without fault in \nthese events.  They were caught in the middle of  a dispute, attempted a solution, and were sued \nby the party who suffered financial loss by virtue of that solution.  The trustee should not have to \nbear its own expenses in defending against claims arising out of a situation it did not create.   \n{28} Under section 6-21(2) of the General Statutes , the Court has discretion to tax costs, \nincluding attorneys’ fees, to either party in an action which ma y require the fixing of rights and \nduties under a trust agreement.  The central issues in this case involve determining the rights and \nduties of parties to the Trusts.  Indeed, the Plaintiff asked the Court to declare to the trustee \nexactly what its duties were with respect to the Retained Funds, and whether they should be \nallocated to principal or income.   \n{29} For these reasons, the Court or ders that the trustee be reimbursed for fees in the \namount of $261,141.30 and costs in the amount of $38,692.61 out of the trust property.   \n \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n{30} Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that \nDefendant Wachovia’s Petition for Award of Costs is granted.  Defendant Wachovia is entitled \nto reimbursement of previously incurred costs to include fees in the amount of $261,141.30 and \nexpenses in the amount of $38,692.61. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 11th day of June, 2007. \n \n "
