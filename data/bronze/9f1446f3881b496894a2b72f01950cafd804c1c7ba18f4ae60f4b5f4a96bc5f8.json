  "raw_text": "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nORANGE COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n22 CVS 255 \n \nBIOMILQ, INC., \n \nPlaintiff and \nCounterclaim Defendant, \n \nv. \n \nSHAYNE GUILIANO and 108LABS, \nLLC, \n \nDefendants and \nCounterclaim Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nMICHELLE EGGER; \nBREAKTHROUGH ENERGY \nVENTURES, LLC; BEV JOHN DOES; \nand BIOMILQ JOHN DOES, \n \nCounterclaim Defendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nGUILIANO’S MOTION FOR RULE 60 \nRELIEF FROM JUDGMENT  \n1. THIS MATTER  is before the Court on the 1 9 December 2023 filing of \nDefendant Shayne Guiliano ’s (“Mr. Guiliano”) Motion f or Rule 60 Relief From \nJudgment (the “Motion”).1  (ECF No. 239 [“Mot.”].)  Pursuant to Rule 60 of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure (the “Rule(s)”), the Motion requests reconsideration \nof “the Order and Opinion on Defendants’ joint partial motion to dismiss [P]laintiff’s \nsecond amended complaint and reconsideration  of Rule 12(b) Motions a lready filed, \nor in the alternative [,] consider a new motion for  Rule 12(g) dismissal by adopting \nalready filed Rule 12(h)(2) defenses herein.”  (Mot. 1.) \n \n1 Pursuant to North Carolina Business Court Rule (“BCR”) 7.4, the Court, in its discretion, \nelects to decide the Motion without oral argument.  \nBIOMILQ, INC. v. Guiliano, 2024 NCBC 16. \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A., by J. Dickson Phillips and Stephen \nD. Feldman, and Goodwin Procter, LLP , by Rachel M. Walsh , for \nPlaintiff BIOMILQ, Inc. \n \nShayne Guiliano, pro se. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \n2. As an initial matter, Rule 60(b)  applies only to relief “from a final \njudgment.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 60(b).  To be clear, Rule 60(b)  “has no application \nto interlocutory judgments, orders, or proceedings of the trial court.  It only applies, \nby its express terms, to final judgments.”  Sink v. Easter, 288 N.C. 183, 196 (1975) \n(citation omitted); Rupe v. Hucks-Follis, 170 N.C. App. 188, 191 (2005). \n3. The Court’s order denying Defendants’ motion to dismiss , (ECF No. 145),  \nwas an interlocutory order,  (see ECF No. 221).  Therefore, the Court does not have  \nthe authority to grant relief from it under Rule 60(b).  Rupe , 170 N.C. App. at  191.  \nThe Motion is therefore DENIED in part to the extent it seeks reconsideration under \nRule 60(b). \n4. Next, the Court addresses Mr. Guiliano’s request that the Court enter an \norder “ which either treats Guiliano’s most recent Rule 12(b)(6) as a \nRule 12(g)+Rule 12(h)(2) defense, or otherwise grants [Mr.]  Guiliano an opportunity \nto enter a clean and simpler Rule 12(g)+Rule 12(h)(2) Motion[.]”  (Br. Supp. Mot. 17, \nECF No. 240 [“Br. Supp.”].) \n5. Rule 12(g) provides that  “[i]f a party makes a motion under [Ru le 12] but \nomits therefrom any defense or objection then available to him which this rule \npermits to be raised by motion, he shall not thereafter make a motion based on the \ndefense or objection so omitted, except a motion as provided in section (h)(2) hereof \non any of the grounds there stated. ”  N.C.G.S. §  1A-1, Rule 12(g).   Rule 12(h)(2) \nprovides, in relevant part,  that “[a] defense of failure to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted, a defense of failure to join a necessary party, and an objection \nof failure to state a legal defense to a claim may be made in any pleading permitted \nor ordered under Rule 7(a)[.]”  Id. Rule 12(h)(2). \n6. Plaintiff BIOMILQ, Inc. argues that a new motion under Rule 12(b)(6) \npursuant to Rules 12(g) and (h)(2) would be improper because those rules  “do not \nauthorize or permit a party to make a pre -trial motion under Rule 12(b)(6) after the \nparty has answered.”  (Br. Opp’n Mot. 3, ECF No. 249 [“Br. Opp.”].)  The Court agrees \nand otherwise declines to reconsider its 13 November 2023 Order and Opinion.  (See \nECF No. 221.) \n7. THEREFORE, the Court, in its discretion, DENIES the Motion. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 29th day of February, 2024. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson  \n Michael L.
