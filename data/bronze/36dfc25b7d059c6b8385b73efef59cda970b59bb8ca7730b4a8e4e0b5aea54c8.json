The Court does not make findings of fact when deciding a motion to \namend.  The following background is derived from Plaintiffs’ allegations in the \nProposed Amended Complaint that are relevant to the Motion before the Court.   \n5. Plaintiffs are trustees of the  Ronald E. Howard Revocable Trust (the \n“Trust”).  Prior to his death on 12 June 2017, Ronald E. Howard (“Ron Howard”) was \nthe majority member of IOMAXIS with a 51% ownership interest  in the company.   \n(Prop. Am. Compl. ¶ 1.)  \n6. Plaintiffs contend that IOMAXIS is a North Carolina LLC controlled by \na November 2001  operating agreement (as amended)  (the “N.C. Operating \nAgreement”), and that attempts in 2015 to convert it to a Texas LLC and adopt a new \noperating agreement were ineffective.  (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 18, 33, 61-77.)  \n7. Plaintiffs allege that pursuant to the N.C. Operating Agreement, w hen \nRon Howard died, his membership interest in IOMAXIS became  a 51% economic \ninterest.  In addition, h is death was considered an involuntary wit hdrawal that \ntriggered the N.C. Operating Agreement’s buy-sell provisions. (Compl., Ex. C [“N.C. \nOperating Agreement”] §§ 4.6, 8.4, 9.1-9.9, ECF No. 3.) \n8. Section 9.2 of the N.C. O perating Agreement required the executor of \nRon Howard’s estate (the “Estate”) to give the remaining IOMAXIS members notice \nof Ron Howard’s death , a buy -sell event,  within ten (10) days of  its occurrence .  \nSection 9.3 of the N.C. Operating Agreement g ave IOMAXIS’s members thirty (30 ) \ndays following receipt of the buy -sell notice to notify the Estate if they intended to \nexercise their option to purchase Ro n Howard’s interest.  Plaintiffs allege that n o \nmember of IOMAXIS exercised the option  within the thirty-day period.  (Prop. Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 79-83.) \n9. Section 9.5 of the N.C. Operating Agreement, amended in 2004, sets out \nthe method for valuing a  member’s ownership interest for purposes of the  buy-sell \nprovisions.  If the parties do not agree on a  value, the seller (here,  the Estate) is \nrequired to present an offer to the remaining members, who then have ten days to \naccept or reject the offer .  If the offer is rejected, the seller is required to buy the \nremaining members’ interests at the price the seller  offered to sell its own interest.   \n(Compl., Ex. F [“First Amendment to N.C. Operating Agreement”], ECF No. 3.) \n10. The parties did not agree on a value for Ron Howard’s interest.  But the \nEstate did not make the offer contemplated by Section 9.5 .  The Estate complains \nthat it could not make the offer  because IOMAXIS did not provide it with the \nnecessary financial information to determine the value of the interest .  (Prop. Am. \nCompl. ¶ 92.) \n11. Section 9.6 of the N.C. Operating Agreement requires that any sale that \ntakes place pursuant to its buy -sell provisions close within ninety (90)  days of the \nbuy-sell event. (N.C. Operating Agreement § 9.6.) \n12. After the ninety -day period had elapsed, i n late October or early \nNovember 2017, the Estate proposed, and IOMAXIS agreed, to retain RSM US LLP \n(f/k/a “RS M McGladrey”) (“RSM”) to a ppraise Ron Howard’s interest.  RSM was \nselected because it had an existing relationship with IOMAXIS.  When  IOMAXIS \nallegedly refused to provide RSM  with the financial information it requested , \nhowever, the Estate terminated its effort to retain RSM , and RSM did not complete \nthe valuation.  (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 94-96.) \n13. Instead, IOMAXIS unilaterally decided to retain Valuation Services, \nInc. (“VSI”).  VSI conducted an appraisal but allegedly applied significant minority \nand illiquidity discounts  when determining the  value of R on Howard’s interest .  \nPlaintiffs contend that VSI’s valuation was not “ full, fair, or accurate .”  (Prop.  Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 97-101).  \n14. Pursuant to his will, on 8 December 2017,  Ron Howard’s  interest in \nIOMAXIS passed as part of his residuary Estate to the Trust.  (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n13-14.) \n15. The dispute before the Court centers on the Trust’s right to the economic \nbenefits flowing from Ron Howard’s 51% interest in IOMAXIS .  A central issue is \nwhether the N.C. Operating Agreement or a Texas operating agreement controls.   \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n16. Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on 18 June 2018, asserting claims for (a) \nbreach of the right to receive interim distributions from IOMAXIS; (b) an accounting \nto receive information regarding  the value of their interest in IOMAXIS; and ( c) a \njudgment declaring that the purported conversion of IOMAXIS from a North Carolina \nlimited liability company to a Texas limited liability company was void and t hat the \nN.C. Operating Agreement  controls.  (Compl. ¶¶ 71 -97, ECF No. 3.)  On 6 August \n2018, Defendants filed an Answer to the Complaint.  (Answ., ECF No. 14.)   \n17. Since then, discovery in this case ha s undergone an unusual series of \nstops and starts.  Initially, after discussion with the parties, the Court deferred the \nentry of a case management order to allow the parties to explore the possibility of an \nearly resolution.  When that effort proved unsuc cessful, the Court ordered a six -\nmonth discovery period commencing 1 February 2019.  The fact discovery period was \nlater extended to 16 September 2019.   (Case Mgmt. Order, ECF No. 32; Order \nGranting Second Mot. Modify Case Mgmt. Order, ECF No. 38.) \n18. During depositions conducted on 12 September 2019, the parties \nengaged in impromptu settlement discussions that resulted in a two- page \nmemorandum of settlement (“MOS”).  (See Pls.’ Joint Mot. Enforce Settlement Memo., \nEx.1, ECF No. 50.1.)   At the parties’ request, the Court stayed discovery to allow time \nto document the agreement.  (Consent Third Am. Case Mgmt. Order, ECF No. 48.)   \n19. Unfortunately, the parties’ efforts did not result in a mutually \nacceptable document.  On 18 October 2019, after Plai ntiffs filed a Motion to Enforce \nMemorandum of Settlement, the Court continue d to stay discovery while it decided \nthe motion.  (Not. of Hr’g and Order on Pls.’ Joint Mot. File under Seal and Entering \nPartial Stay, ¶ 6, ECF No. 53.) \n20. The Court ruled on the Motion to Enforce Memorandum of Settlement \non 1 May 2020  and directed the parties to submit a case management report \nproposing a discovery schedule.  (Order and Op.  on Pls.’ Joint Mot. Enforce Memo. \nSettlement, ¶¶ 32-33, 58, ECF No. 70.)  Thereafter, the Court lifted the stay and set \n30 October 2020 as the deadline for completing fact discovery.  (Fourth Am . Case \nMgmt. Order, ECF No. 71.) \n21. On 25 September 2020, almost a month before fact discovery was to \nclose, Defendants’ counsel sought to withdraw as counse l for Defendant Hurysh.  \n(Order on Consent Mot. Withdraw and Substitute Counsel, ECF No. 76.)  A fter a \nstatus conference, the Court stayed all depositions and expert witness disclosures \nuntil further court order.  (Scheduling Order, ECF N o. 78.)  On 30 November 2020,  \nDefendants’ counsel moved to withdraw completely.  Discovery remained stayed. \n(Mot. Withdraw and Substitute Counsel, ECF No. 93; Order Following Status \nConference, ECF No. 95.) \n22. Thereafter, on 26 January 2021, Plaintiffs sought the appointment of a \nreceiver for IOMAXIS .  ( Pls.’ Mot. Appoint Receiver, ECF No. 106. )2  Defendant \nHurysh, one of IOMAXIS’s former members, filed an affidavit in support of Plaintiffs’ \nmotion in which he alleged, among other things, that Defendant Buhr h ad \nmisappropriated funds from IOMAXIS in the past using separate entities such as \nFast Rabbit, LLC and Global Vector, LLC, and that Buhr was making plans to set up \nother entities to continue the misappropriation.  (Aff. Nicholas Hurysh [“Hurysh \nAff.”] ¶¶ 64-70, 75-78, ECF No. 97.)3 \n23. When his credibility was challenged in a responsive affidavit from Buhr, \nHursyh revealed that he had recorded two  July 2020 telephone conference s, one on \n17 July 2020 and a second on 22 July 2020, in which the IOMAXIS Defendants  \nallegedly discussed a plan to siphon IOMAXIS’s assets to other entities in order to \ndecrease the value of the Trust’s interest and pay themselves disguised distributions. \n(Def. Hurysh’s Mot. In Camera Inspection and Leave to File Affs., Recordings, and \n \n2 Plaintiffs subsequently requested that the Court continue the motion pending resolution of \ncertain issues pertaining to Hurysh’s affidavit. (Order Following H’rg, ECF No. 150.) \n \n3 The case was reassigned from the Honorable James L. Gale to the undersigned on 6  May \n2021. (Reassignment Order, ECF No. 137.) \n \nTrans. under Seal, ECF No. 156.)   IOMAXIS objected to disclosure of the recorded \ntelephone conferences on grounds of attorney-client privilege.4  \n24. In the meantime, based on Hurysh’s allegations, Plaintiffs sought to \namend their Complaint.  (Pls.’ Mot. Leave File First Am. Compl., ECF No. 118.)  The \nCourt permitted the addition of claims for fraud and violation of the Uniform Voidable \nTransactions Act, N.C.G.S. § 39-23.1, et seq. (“UVTA”) to the extent these claims arose \nafter Ron Howard’s death, and it ordered the parti es to submit a c ase management \nreport proposing a plan for discovery.  See Howard v. IOMAXIS, LLC , 2021 NCBC \nLEXIS 116, at *27-29, 37 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 22, 2021).  \n25. Thereafter, the Court amended the Case Management Order to extend  \nthe deadline s for fact and expert discovery to 5 July 2022 and 7 November 2022, \nrespectively.  (Fifth Am. Case Mgmt. Order, ECF No. 214.)  A flurry of motions \nfollowed, including the IOMAXIS Defendants’ motion to dismiss the newly-amended \ncomplaint. (IOMAXIS Defs.’ Consol. Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 223 .) In addition, \nIOMAXIS appealed this Court’s ruling denying its motion for protective order and \npermitting disclosure of the 22 July 2020 telephone conference call.  (Notice of Appeal, \nECF No. 181.) \n26. Given the heavy litigation activity, the parties requested additional time \nto complete fact discovery in a case management report dated 12 January 2023.  (Case \nMgmt. Report, ECF No. 295.)  The Court agreed and entered a Sixth Amended Case \nManagement Order permitting limited discovery with respect to the first three claims \n \n4 It was later determined that an attorney was present on the 22 July 2020 call only. \nand setting 15 June 2023 as the deadline for fact discovery . (Sixth Am. Case Mgmt \nOrder, ECF No. 296 .)  As a result of the interlocutory appeal, however, the Court \nentered a stay with respect to the fraud claims.  ( Order Mot. Sever and Stay, ECF \nNo. 283.)  The stay remained in place for approximately eighteen months while the \nappeal was pending.  \n27. The Supreme Court issued an opinion on 16 June 2023, affirming this \nCourt’s order regarding the  22 July 2020 telephone conference.  See Howard v. \nIOMAXIS, LLC, 384 N.C. 576, 584 (2023).   After confirmation that Hurysh had, in \nfact, waived the privilege and that he intended for the content of the telephone \nconference to be on the record, this Court ordered IOMAXIS, which had taken \npossession of the recording in the meantime,  to file a transcript of the 22 July 2020 \ntelephone conference call on the record.  ( Scheduling Order, ECF No. 320 .)  \nIOMAXIS’s filing of the transcript on 7 August 2023 was Plaintiffs’ first opportunity \nto review the content of the 22 July 2020 telephone conference.  (IOMAXIS’s Mot.File \nunder Seal, July 22 Document, ECF No. 334.1.) \n28. During a status conference on 26 June 2023, Plaintiffs sta ted that, in \naddition to having only recently reviewed the 22 July 2020 telephone conference, they \nhad discovered during  the depositions of Defendants Buhr, Spade,  and Griffin that \n(a) IOMAXIS had sold one of its divisions, Ingressive, to Millennium, Inc. in April or \nMay 2023 on undisclosed financial terms that did not result in a distribution to the \nTrust, ( b) the IOMAXIS Defendants had transferred their ownership interests to \nanother LLC , Five Insights , in late 2022 or early 2023,  making Five Insights \nIOMAXIS’s sole member, and (c) Five Insights, with Buhr as its managing member, \nwas now managing IOMAXIS pursuant to  a management agreement  that had not \nbeen disclosed to the Trust.  (See Pls.’ Am. Mot. Appoint Receiver, Ex. 3 [“Buhr Dep.”] \n35:17-21, 57:14-58:4, ECF No. 330.4; Pls.’ Am. Mot. Appoint Receiver, Ex. 4 [“Griffin \nDep.”] 131:15-132:9, ECF No. 330.5.)  In addition, Spade confirmed that he did not \nratify the Texas conversion and operating agreement until after Ron Howard died.  \n(Pls.’ Am. Mot. Appoint Receiver, Ex. 2 [“Spade Dep.”] 61:5-14, ECF No. 330.3.) \n29. As a consequence of these developments and given the staccato nature \nof discovery efforts  to this point,  the Court entered an order affording the parties \nforty-five days to file any motions to amend their pleadings.  Plaintiffs indicated that \nthey would file a motion to amend their Compla int.  Therefore, a t the IOMAXIS \nDefendants’ request, the Court continued to stay discovery with respect to the fraud \nand UVTA claims pending resolution of the anticipated motion.  (Scheduling Order ¶ \n15, ECF No. 320.)   \n30. On 21 September 2023, the Plaintiffs, within the forty -five day period \nset forth in the Court’s Scheduling Order, filed this Motion in which they seek to ( a) \namend and supplement their factual allegations; (b) add Five Insights as a party; (c) \nadd claims for conversion and civil conspiracy; and ( d) amend their contract and \ndeclaratory judgment claims.  (See generally Prop. Am. Compl., ECF No. 360.3.)  The \nIOMAXIS Defendants oppose the Motion.  (IOMAXIS Defs.’ Br. Opp’ n Mot. Am. \n[“Defs.’ Br.”], ECF No. 368.) \n31. After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motion on 13 \nNovember 2023 during which all parties participated through counsel. (Not ice of \nHr’g, ECF No. 370.)  The Motion is now ripe for disposition.  \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \n32. Rule 15(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that \nleave to amend “shall be freely given when justice so requires.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, \nR. 15(a).  The rule “encourages trial courts to permit amendment liberally and evinces \nour State’s ‘general policy of allowing an action to proceed to a determination on the \nmerits.’ ”  Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC v. AG Ins. SA/NV, 2019 NCB C LEXIS 105, \nat *4 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 10, 2019) (quoting House of Raeford Farms, Inc. v. Raeford, \n104 N.C. App. 280, 282 (1991)). \n33. However, the right to amend is not unfettered.  Reasons to deny a motion \nto amend include “undue delay, bad faith, dilatory  motive, repeated failure to cure \ndeficiencies, undue prejudice and futility of the amendment.” Bartlett Milling Co. , \nL.P. v. Walnut Grove Auction & Realty Co. , 192 N.C. App. 74, 89 (2008) (quoting \nNationsbank of N.C., N.A. v. Baines, 116 N.C. App. 263, 268 (1994)).   \n34. As for undue delay, i t has long been the law that “a trial court may \nappropriately deny a motion for leave to amend on the basis of undue delay where a \nparty seeks to amend its pleading after a significant period of time has passed since \nfiling the pleading and where the record or party offers no explanation for the delay.”  \nRabon v. Hopkins, 208 N.C. App. 351, 354 (2010) (affirming a trial court’s denial of a \nmotion to amend when the plaintiff moved to amend nine months after filing the \ncomplaint without providing a sufficient explanation for the delay) ; Strickland v. \nLawrence, 176 N.C. App. 656, 667 (2006) (affirming trial court’s denial of a motion to \namend when plaintiffs presented no evidence to support their claim that the \namendment was based upon information obtained in discovery). \n35. As for undue prejudice, i t is not uncommon for a  proposed amendment \nto impact the status quo in a way that the nonmovant opposes.  But not every impact \nconstitutes undue prejudice.  Further, undue prejudice is not presumed, even when \nthe proposed amendments are extensive.  “The burden is upon the opposing party to \nestablish that that party would be prejudiced by the amendment.”  Mauney v. Morris, \n316 N.C. 67, 72 (1986).   \n36. The Court may disall ow on grounds of bad faith a mendments that are \nabusive or “made in order to secure some ulterior tactical advantage.”  Columbus Life \nIns. Co. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , 2022 NCBC LEXIS 40 , at **11 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMay 3, 2022) (quoting Vitaform, Inc. v. Aeroflow, Inc., 2021 NCBC LEXIS 79, at **16 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 16, 2021).  Likewise, amendments made with dilatory motive \nthat seek improperly to delay the Court’s administration of justice  may be \ndenied.  See, e.g., Azure Dolphin, LLC v. Barton, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 229, at *3-4 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. May 30, 2017), aff’d, 371 N.C. 579 (2018) (finding dilatory motive when the \nproposed amendment made it “impossible” for the defendants to understand the \nallegations against them and removed parties that the plaintiffs  had added only a \nfew weeks earlier). \n37. Finally, “[t]he futility standard under Rule 15 is essentially the same \nstandard used in reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), but [it] provides \nthe court liberal discretion to find that an amendment lacks futility.”  Simply the Best \nMovers, LLC v. Marrins’ Moving Sys. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 28, at **5- 6 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Apr. 6, 2016).  Thus, a motion to amend is not futile  when “the allegations of the \n[amendment], treated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may \nbe granted under some legal theory , whether properly labeled or not.”  Harris v. \nNCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 N.C. App. 669, 670 (1987) \n38. In addition, “upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just,” \nRule 15(d) allows a party “to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions \nor occurrences or events which may have happened since the date of the pleading \nsought to be supplemented[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, R. 15(d).  The rule for allowing \nsupplementation is also liberally construed , and supplementation should be \npermitted absent substantial injustice.  See Miller v. Ruth’s of N.C., Inc. 69 N.C. App. \n153, 156 (1984) (“[M]otions to allow supplemental pleadings should be freely granted \nunless their allowance would impose a substantial injustice upon the opposing \nparty.”); Draughon v. H arnett Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 166 N.C. App. 449, 454 (2004) \n(“Motions to allow supplemental pleadings should ordinarily be granted because by \ndefinition they encompass matters that arose after the date of the original pleading, \nunless a substantial injustice would result to the opposing party.”). \n39. In the end, a “motion for leave to amend is addressed to the sound \ndiscretion of the trial judge[.]”  Chicopee, Inc. v. Sims Metal Works, Inc., 98 N.C. App. \n423, 430 (1990); see House of Raeford Farms, Inc. v. Raeford, 104 N.C. App. 280, 282 \n(1991).    \nIV. ANALYSIS \nA. Standing \n40. The IOMAXIS Defendants  object to Plaintiffs’ Proposed Amended \nComplaint on the basis of standing.  They first argue that the Trust  lacks standing \nto sue because the movement of Howard’s economic interest from his Estate  to the \nTrust without member approval violated the operating agreement’s provisions on \nassignment.5  Additionally, the IOMAXIS Defendants contend that the Trust cannot \nbring claims for the alleged devaluing of its interest because the claims are derivative, \nand an economic interest holder lacks standing to bring derivative claims. \n41. “Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court’s proper exercise of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.”  Aubin v. Susi, 149 N.C. App. 320, 324 (2002).  Without \nstanding, a party lacks a “sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy such \nthat he or she may properly seek adjudication of the matter.”  Am. Woodland Indus., \nInc. v. Tolson , 155 N.C. App. 624, 626 (2002).  Accordingly, before discussing the \nmerits of the Plaintiffs’ amended and supplemented claims, the Court must \ndetermine whether the Plaintiffs have standing to bring them. \n \n5 The IOMAXIS Defendants seek to incorporate their earlier Rule 12(c) motion and brief.  \nSuch a practice is contrary to BCR 7.8 (“A party may not incorporate by reference arguments \nmade in another brief . . . to circumvent these [ word] limits.”).  Nevertheless, the Court, in \nits discretion, has considered the IOMAXIS Defendants’ earlier brief in this instance.   \n \n42. The IOMAXIS Defendants ’ first argument is repetitive of their earlier \nposition that the Estate ’s transfer of Ron Howard’s  interest to the Trust is void \nbecause it violated the “anti-assignment provision” in the operating agreement.  They \nargue that it was the Estate that breached the buy-sell provision by failing to make \na timely offer of sale, and that it was up to the Estate  to take affirmative steps to \nobtain the financial information it needed to make that offer befor e the buy -sell \nwindow closed.  (Defs.’ Br. 5 -6.)  Having failed to do so, the IOMAXIS Defendants \nargue, the Estate was not at liberty to distribute Ron Howard’s interest to the Trust \nwithout their approval.  Consequently, the y contend that the  Trust does n ot have \nstanding to sue. \n43. Plaintiffs disagree.  They contend that it was incumbent on IOMAXIS’s \nmembers to exercise their option to buy within thirty days of delivery of the buy -sell \nnotice, and their failure to do so meant th at the Estate was free to distr ibute Ron \nHoward’s interest to the Trust without member approval.  To the extent the operating \nagreement could be read as requiring the Estate to take the first step and make a sell \noffer before IOMAXIS’s members decided whether to exercise their option, Plaintiffs \nargue that the operating agreement contemplates that IOMAXIS would provide the \nEstate with the financial information it needed to do so.  When that did not happen, \nPlaintiffs contend that the Estate  had no further obligation under the buy -sell \nprovision and was free to distribute Ron Howard’s interest to the Trust.  (Pls.’ Reply \nFurther Supp Mot. Leave File Suppl. and Second Am. Compl. [“Pls.’ Reply”] 1-3, ECF \nNo. 377.) \n44. The Court previously determined that the Trust’s allegations were \nsufficient to establish standing.  See Howard v. IOMAXIS, LLC, 2022 NCBC LEXIS \n146, at **13 -17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 5, 2022).  Nothing about Plaintiffs’ proposed \namendments changes the Court’s determination. \n45. In the Proposed Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Ron Howard \ndied on 12 June 2017 .  Three days later, on 15 June 2017,  his executor notified the \nIOMAXIS Defendants of Howard’s  death.  It was not until  20 September 2017 , \nhowever, that “Buhr sent a Notice to the Estate (“Notice”) purporting to ‘exercise its \noption to purchase  the Interest formerly held by  Ronald Howard.’ ”  Consequently, \nPlaintiffs allege that the thirty -day period for IOMAXIS’s members to elect the \npurchase option afforded by the N.C. Operating Agreement had expired well before \nBuhr’s notice was sent.   Plaintiffs allege that “[ a]fter the Estate  questioned \nIOMAXIS’s entitlement to unilaterally exercise a purchase option and asked to \nreview IOMAXIS’s financial records to assess and respond to the redemption offer, \nIOMAXIS declined to provide the requested documents, claiming, among other \nthings, that the Estate had no right to such information as a non- member.”  (Prop. \nAm. Compl. ¶¶ 79-84, 92.)  These allegations are sufficient to support the Trust’s \nassertion that it has standing. \n46. Next, the IOMAXIS Defendants assert that the Trust cannot bring its \nfraud claim for the alleged devaluing of its economic interest because the harm is to \nIOMAXIS generally, and any such claim would be derivative  in nature.   The \nIOMAXIS Defendants argue that the Trust has failed to assert the claim derivatively \nand, in any event, as an economic interest holder and not a member, the Trust has \nno standing to  bring a derivative action  on behalf of IOMAXIS.   (Defs.’ Br. 17 -18.)  \nPlaintiffs disagree, citing Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650 (1997), and \ncontending that the Trust can pursue a direct claim because its injury is separate and \ndistinct from the any injury suffered by IOMAXIS or its members.  (Pls.’ Reply 12 -\n13.) \n47. Like partners in a limited partnership, an LLC’s members “cannot \npursue individual causes of action against third parties for wrongs or injuries to the \n[company].”  Energy Investors Fund, L.P. v. Metric Constructors, Inc. , 351 N.C. 331, \n335 (2000)  (quoting Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 658 (1997)).   \nSuch claims are derivative, and the right to bring them on behalf of the LLC is \nreserved to the members.  N.C.G.S. § 57D-8-01(a).  See Dodge v. Appalachian Energy, \nLLC, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 52, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 27, 2021).   \n48. But when determining whether Plaintiffs’ fraud claim is derivative, the \nquestion is not whether the allegations are that IOMAXIS has been devalued.  The \nquestion is whether IOMAXIS has suffered an injury resulting from the  violation of \na duty owed it.  In this case, the claim is for fraud ulent concealment.  As discussed \nbelow, Plaintiffs allege that the claim belongs to the Trust alone because only the \nTrust was kept in the dark.  They allege that Buhr, as manager, and the remaining \nmembers of IOMAXIS were both aware of, and participated in, the actions that \nresulted in the transfers of IOMAXIS’s assets.  Consequently, IOMAXIS, fully \ncognizant of what was happening to it, cannot pursue a claim for fraud, and Barger \ndoes not apply.  See Panzino v. 5Church, Inc., 2020 NCBC LEXIS 17, at **17-18 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Feb 12, 2020) (determining that the Barger rule was inapplicable because \nthe plaintiff’s claim was to enforce his own rights, not the company’s rights);  see also \nEpic Chophouse, LLC v. Morasso, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 55, at *7- 9 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nSept. 3, 2019) (discussing standing generally, including the right of an individual \nowner to bring a claim for a wrong peculiar to that owner); 759 Ventures, LLC v. GCP \nApt. Investors, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 82, at * 10-11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 13, 2018) \n(discussing the distinction between individual and derivative claims and observing \nas to the latter that “[t]o the extent the relevant term in an operating agreement gives \nrise to a duty owed to the company, a claim for breach of that duty is one belonging to \nthe company[.]” (emphasis added)).  \n49. For these reasons, the Court concludes  that Plaintiffs have standing to \nassert their fraud claim.\n6 \nB. Breach of Contract \n50. Moving to the propos ed amendments themselves, in addition to \nlanguage clarifying and supplementing the facts, Plain tiffs seek to  divide their \ncontract allegations into separate claims for breach of the operating agreement’s \nprovisions regarding distributions, the buy-sell process, and the implied duty of good \nfaith and fair dealin g. (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 161 -90.)  Relatedly, they seek a \ndeclaration that IOMAXIS repudiated the N.C. Operating Agreement.  (Prop. Am. \n \n6 To the extent the IOMAXIS Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs’ UVTA claim is derivative, \nthe argument fails because the creditor in this instanc e is the Trust, not IOMAXIS.   See \nN.C.G.S.§ 39-23.1(4). \nCompl. ¶¶ 158 -60.)  In response, t he IOMAXIS Defendants contend that the \nrequested amendments are too late, made in bad faith, unduly prejudicial, and futile. \n(Defs.’ Br. 6-14.)  The Court addresses these objections in turn. \n51. The IOMAXIS Defendants argue that the contract amendments are late, \nand therefore unduly prejudicial, because Plaintiffs have long been aware of the facts \nthey now seek to add and have offered no explanation for their  delay.  (Defs.’ Br. 7 -\n8.)  However, as Plaintiffs observe,  the converse is also true:  the IOMAXIS \nDefendants have long been on notice  of the same facts.  “Rule 8(a)(1) requires only \nthat the Complaint contain a ‘short and plain statement of the claim’ being asserted.”  \nWijewickrama v. Christian, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 98, at **9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 11, \n2023) (concluding that claim with “minimal details” adequately alleged breach by \nboth non-performance and repudiation). IOMAXIS has contended since shortly after \nRon Howard’s death that the Texas Operating Agreement , not the N.C. Operating \nAgreement, was in effe ct and controlled.  These facts have been the subject of \ndiscovery since the case began.   Thus, Plaintiffs’ decision to add breach of the N.C. \nOperating Agreement by repudiation should come as no surprise.   \n52. Further, it does not offend notions of fairness to allow Plaintiffs to divide \nthe alleged breaches of the N.C. Operating Agreement into separate claims.  In short, \nnothing about the amendments would cause the litigation to veer “dangerously close \nto going off the rails” as the IOMAXIS Defendants argue on the first page of their \nopposition brief.7   \n \n7 The IOMAXIS Defendants’ objections based on bad faith are similarly unavailing.  They \nargue that no breach of the N.C. Operating Agreement could have occurred because emails \n53. As for the timing of Plaintiffs’ motion, the procedural history of this case \ndemonstrates that it has not progressed in the customary way.  D iscovery has been \nstop-and-go to allow for early s ettlement efforts, Plaintiffs’ motion to enforce a \npurported settlement, multiple withdrawals of counsel, and an interlocutory appeal.  \nGiven this unusual procedural history, as well as recent developments that Plaintiffs \ncontend provide both  additional context  for, and supplement, their claims, it is \nprudent to allow the parties to revisit their pleadings.8  \n54. The IOMAXIS Defendants’ final objection to the Plaintiffs’ amended \ncontract claims is on the basis of futility .  Specifically, they assert that adding the \ntheory of breach by repudiation would be  futile because a party cannot plead \nrepudiation and ask for specific performance a s a remedy  at the same time . They \ncontend that to do so would be contrary to the requirement that Plaintiffs treated the \n \nproduced in discovery support their contention that Ron Howard ratified the Texas Operating \nAgreement. However, issues of fact remain regarding  whether the Texas Operating \nAgreement was ratified, and these unresolved issues cannot support an argument that the \nMotion was brought in bad faith.   \n \n8 This Court’s prior decision in United Therapeutics Corp. v. Liquidia Techs. , 2023 NCBC \nLEXIS 107 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 31, 2023) does not require a different result.  In United \nTherapeutics, the plaintiff referenced the individual defendant’s employment agreement in \nits initial complaint but did not include claims against the individual defendant for breach of \nthat contract.  Instead, the case centered on the plaintiff’s misappropriation of trade secrets \ntheory.  Discovery proceeded without breaks and was extended at the request of the plaintiff.   \nOn the eve of discovery closing,  the plaintiff sought to backtrack and amend its complaint \nagainst the individual defendant to add claims for breach of the employment contract, as well \nas for unfair and deceptive trade practices.  The Court denied the motion to the extent it \nsought to ad d these claims  because the facts were plainly known at the time the lawsuit \nbegan, and the addition of a Chapter 75 claim against the individual defendant, in particular, \nwould have “greatly change[d] the nature of the defense and greatly increase[d] the stakes of \nthe lawsuit.”  Id. at **7 (quoting Kixsports v. Munn, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 92, at *6 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Jan. 24, 2019)).  \n \nIOMAXIS Defendants’ conduct as a repudiation of the N.C. Operating Agreement  \nfrom the beginning. (Defs.’ Br. 12-14.)   \n55. As the IOMAXIS Defendants observe, “[r]epudiation is merely a breach \nof contract theory. (Defs.’ Br. 12.)  See Mills Constr. Co. v. Fairfield Sapphire Valley, \nInc., 86 N.C. App. 506, 510 (1987) (“Repudiation is a positive statement by one party \nto the other party indicating that he will not or cannot substantially perform his \ncontractual duties.”) (citations omitted).  \n56. The IOMAXIS Defendants are also correct that for repudiation to occur, \nPlaintiffs are required to treat it as such and bring their action accordingly.  See, e.g., \nD.G. II, LLC  v. Nix, 211 N.C. App. 332, 338-39 (2011).  However, the facts alleged \nhere, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, would support either a \nclaim for breach by non-performance seeking specific performance or, alternatively, \na claim for breach by repudiation  seeking damages.  See, e.g., Wijewickrama, 2023 \nNCBC LEXIS 98, at **15 -16 (recognizing a “claim” for specific performance as an \nalternative to a claim for breach of contract by repudiation);  Brannock v. Fletcher, \n271 N.C. 65, 73 (1967) (identifying three avenues a non-breaching party may take to \nremedy a breach of contract: (1) sue for damages; (2) seek specific performance; or (3) \ntreat the breach as abandonment and rescind the contract).  At this stage, Plaintiffs \nmay plead alternatively.  Further determination will require a fuller record.  Cf. \nProfile Invs. No. 25, LLC v. Ammons East Corp., 207 N.C. App. 232 , 241 (2010) \n(reversing summary judgment because  undisputed facts did not support theory of \nrepudiation).   \n57. Accordingly, Plaintiffs shall be permitted to amend to a llege breach of \nthe N.C. Operating Agreement by repudiation and to divide their contract allegations \ninto separate claims for breach of the operating agreement’s provisions regarding \ndistributions, the buy-sell process, and the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. \nC. Fraudulent Concealment \n58. Next, the IOMAXIS Defendants assert that the proposed amendments \nto Plaintiffs’ fraudulent concealment  claims are futile because Plaintiffs do not \nadequately allege that (a) the IOMAXIS Defendants had a duty to disclose  the \ninformation that Plaintiffs claim was concealed, or (b) Plaintiffs reasonably relied on \nthe IOMAXIS Defendants’ silence.  (Defs.’ Br. 15-17).   \n59. Plaintiffs respond that (1) IOMAXIS had a duty to disclose because it \nengaged in affirmative steps to conceal material facts from the Trust; and (2) reliance \non the IOMAXIS Defendants’ silence was  reasonable because the IOMAXIS \nDefendants’ actions  prevented Plaintiffs from discovering the alleged fraud. (Pls.’ \nReply 8-10.)  \n60. “[F]raudulent concealment, or fraud by omission is, by its very nature, \ndifficulty to plead with particularity.”  Breeden v. Richmond Cmty. Coll. , 171 F.R.D. \n189, 195 (M.D.N.C. 1997) (adopted by Lawrence v. UMLIC -Five Corp., 2007 NCBC \nLEXIS 20, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 18, 2007)).  Plaintiffs must include: \n(1) the relationship giving rise to the duty to speak , (2) the event or \nevents triggering the duty to speak, and/or the general time period over \nwhich the relationship rose and the fraudulent conduct occurred, (3) the \ngeneral content of the information that was withheld and the reason for \nits materiality, (4) the identity of those under a duty who failed to make \nsuch disclosures , (5) what [the defendant] gained by withholding \ninformation, (6) why plaintiff’s reliance on the omi ssion was both \nreasonable and detrimental , and (7) the damages proximately flowing \nfrom such reliance. \n \nId. at 195. \n61. In their P roposed Amended C omplaint, Plaintiffs allege that the \nIOMAXIS Defendants and Five Insights had a duty to disclose “all transaction s and \nproposed transactions through which IOMAXIS proposed to fundamentally alter the \nTrust’s status as economic interest holder.” (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶ 194.)  They contend \nthat the duty arose as a result of affirmative actions the IOMAXIS Defendants and \nFive Insights allegedly undertook to conceal material facts from the Trust.  Plaintiffs \nallege that those affirmative actions range from a conspiracy to create other entities \nto which IOMAXIS would divert its assets, to making sham loans and other disguised \ndistributions to the IOMAXIS Defendants and related parties, to the use of  covert \ndata messaging platforms to  keep their plans secret from the Trust and this Court  \n(all as discussed in the July 2020 telephone conferences recorded by Hurysh ), to the \nIOMAXIS Defendants’ continued refusal to produce relevant financial information  \neven in discovery , to the sale of IOMAXIS ’s assets and the IOMAXIS Defen dants’ \nrefusal to account to the Trust for  the value received , t o changing the company’s \ncorporate form to “create chaos and confusion,” to “backdating and/or forging \ndocuments in an attempt to legitimize bad acts.” (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 114-28.) \n62. The Court determines that these allegations  of affirmative steps \nundertaken to conceal material facts  are sufficient to give rise to a duty to disclose.   \nSee Herrera v. Charlotte Sch. of L., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 35, at *38- 39 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Apr. 20, 2018)  (quoting Hardin v. KCS Int'l, Inc., 199 N.C. App. 687, 696 \n(2009)).   \n63. Moreover, the Plaintiffs have alleged that, despite reasonable diligence, \nthey have been unable to ascertain the truth.  They allege that IOMAXIS has been \nsteadfast in its refusal to provide them information the Trust needs to value its \neconomic interest, to determine whether and how much it is due in distributions since \nRon Howard’s death  more than six years ago , and to confirm the conversion of \nIOMAXIS to a Texas LLC .  ( See, e.g, Prop. Am. Compl. ¶  118.)  These allegations \nsuffice to satisfy Plaintiffs’ pleading requirements for fraudulent concealment.  See  \nHartsell v. Mindpath Care Ctrs., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. \n8, 2022) (“where Plaintiff has alleged that information was purposeful ly kept from \nher so that she was unable to lear n the truth despite reasonable attempts to \ninvestigate, Plaintiff’s allegations of detrimental reliance are sufficient[.]”); Aldridge \nv. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *110 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 31, 2019) \n(declining to dismiss fraud ulent concealment claim for failure to plead reasonable \nreliance at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage). \n64. Accordingly, Plaintiffs  shall be permitted to amend their  claim for \nfraudulent concealment allegedly occurring after Ron Howard’s death.9  \n \n9 On the other hand, the Court has previously determined that the Trust’s attempt to assert \na claim for fraudulent concealment allegedly occurring during Ron Howard’s life is futile.  See \nHoward v. IOMAXIS, LLC, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 116, at *20-22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 21, 2022.)  \nIn addition to the reasoning in its earlier ruling, the Court observes that Plaintiffs have not \nalleged that Ron Howard discovered the secret diversion of IOMAXIS’s assets that allegedly \nbegan in 2013 while he was alive. (Prop. Am. Compl. 6, 47.)  Instead, they allege that “[t]hese \ndiversions of funds were concealed from Howard, and later the Estate and the Trust ,” and \nD. U niform Voidable Transactions Act, N.C.G.S. §§ 39-23.1 et seq. \n65. Plaintiffs seek to expand their UVTA claim to include transfers  that \nthey allege have recently occurred, including, but not limited to, the sale of Ingressive \nto Millennium and other transfers of IOMAXIS ’s assets to Defendants, “other \ninsiders, and holding companies, and/or Sham Entities owned by them.” (Prop. Am. \nCompl. ¶ 220.) \n66. Plaintiffs allege that these transfers were undertaken to implement the \nalleged “scheme” discussed in the July 2020 telephone conference calls “to move \nfunds, stocks, and assets out of IOMAXIS to Sham Entities, and to disguise \ndistributions as other forms of remuneration (the “Conspiracy”).”  (Prop. Am. Compl. \n¶ 114.) \n67. The IOMAXIS Defendants argue that the proposed amendments should \nbe denied on futility grounds.  They contend that the Five Insights transaction \ninvolved the sale of each member’s ownership interest rather than the transfer of \nIOMAXIS’s assets.  But this assertion is contrary to Plaintiffs’ pleading that \nIOMAXIS’s “investment interests” were also transferred. (Prop. Am. Comp. ¶ 127 .)  \n \nthat the “fraudulent diversions continued after Howard’s death[.]” (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 49, \n52.)    \n \nBy statute, with limited exceptions, the right to prosecute an action existing at the time of \ndeath survives.  See N.C.G.S. § 28A-18-1.  However, an action for fraud does not accrue until \nit is discovered.  See N.C.G.S. § 1-52(9); Carlisle v. Keith, 169 N.C. App. 674, 683 (2005) ( “A \ncause of action alleging  fraud is deemed to accrue upon  discovery by plaintiff of facts \nconstituting the fraud.”).  Thus, no cause of action survived Ron Howard’s death that could \nthen have become part of his residuary e state and passed to the Trust.   To the extent \nPlaintiffs move to reassert a claim for fraud occurring prior to Ron Howard’s death, their \nmotion is DENIED. \n \nMoreover, Plaintiffs allege that management functions shifted from IOMAXIS to Five \nInsights, and they question whether the management agreement between Five \nInsights and IOMAXIS is being used as a mechanism for the transfer of IOMAXIS’s \nassets. (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶ 133.)  Plaintiffs conclude that the “Five Insights Transfer \nwas, at least in  part, effected to avoid or attenuate liability to the Trust to pay \ndistributions and to redeem or recognize its 51% interest in IOMAXIS.”  (Prop. Am. \nCompl. ¶ 130.)   \n68. As for the sale of Ingressive to Mill ennuim, the IOMAXIS Defendants \nargue that Plaintiffs fail to allege that Millennium is owned by any of the IOMAXIS \nDefendants or that the sold assets remain under any defendant’s control.  \nConsequently, they argue, the claim fails to allege transfer to an insider.  In addition, \nthe IOMAXIS Defendants point out that the Trust does not allege that proceeds from \nthe sale were distributed to IOMAXIS’s members or anyone else.  (Defs.’ Br. 19-20.) \n69. Plaintiffs respond that whether the sale was to an insider is only one of \nthirteen non-exclusive factors used to asce rtain whether a transfer w as made with \nan intent to “ hinder, delay or defraud”  under the UVTA.   N.C.G.S. § 39 -23.4(a)(1).    \nThey argue that they have sufficiently alleged , “time and time again” that the \nIOMAXIS Defendants pursued, and continue to pursue, a “coordinated scheme to \nhinder, delay, and defraud the Trust.”  (Pls.’ Reply  12.)  As for  the sale proceeds, \nPlaintiffs complain that Ingressive was sold without notice to them and without any \nexplanation for what became of the proceeds .  They repeatedly allege that the \nIOMAXIS Defendants have transferred IOMAXIS’s assets to themselves as disguised \ndistributions to avoid their obligation to the Trust, IOMAXIS’s  creditor.  (Prop. Am. \nComp. ¶¶ 117-25, 130-38.)  \n70. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to survive \nthe IOMAXIS Defendants’ objection on futility grounds.  Plaintiffs’ Motion with \nrespect to the UVTA claim shall be GRANTED.       \nE. Conversion \n71. As for Plaintiffs’ proposed new claim for conversion, the IOMAXIS \nDefendants contend that because the Trust’s economic interest arises from an \noperating agreement, any loss or impairment to that interest implicates a contract \nright, not a tort.  They contend, therefore, that the proposed conversion claim violates \nthe economic loss rule and is futile.  (Defs.’ Br. 20 -21.)  The Plaintiffs disagree, \narguing that (a) the IOMAXIS Defendants violated duties to the Trust  that arose \noutside of the operating agreement and (b) the economic loss rule should not apply to \nan economic interest holder.  (Pls.’ Reply 13-14.) \n72. The economic loss rule limits “recovery in tort when a contract exists \nbetween the parties that defines the standard of conduct[.]”  Akzo Nobel Coatings, \nInc. v. Rogers, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, at **47- 48 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 3, 2011).  \nTherefore, failing to perform pursuant to the terms of a contract cannot ordinarily be \nthe basis for a tort claim.  See N.C. State Ports Auth. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing, Co., 294 \nN.C. 73, 81 (1978) (“Ordinarily, a breach of contract does not give rise to a tort action \nby the promisee against the promisor.”); Spillman v. Am. Homes of Mocksville, Inc., \n108 N.C. App. 63, 65 (1992) (“A tort action does not lie agai nst a party to a contract \nwho simply fails to properly perform the terms of the contract, even if that failure to \nproperly perform was due to the negligent or intentional conduct of that party[.]”). \n73. Instead, any tort claim must arise from a duty that the breaching party \nowed the promisee by operation of law, distinct from any contractual duty.  See \nAsheville Contracting Co. v. City of Wilson, 62 N.C. App. 329, 342 (1983).  The purpose \nof the rule is to “encourage[  ] contracting parties to allocate risks for economic loss \nthemselves, because the promisee has the best opportunity to bargain for coverage of \nthat risk[.]” Lord v. Customized Consulting Specialty, Inc. , 182 N.C. App. 635, 639 \n(2007).    \n74. When one party to a contract claims that another party to the contract \nhas wrongfully taken possession of property  that is the subject of the contract , the \nappropriate claim is for breach of contract, not conversion .  See, e.g. , Window Gang \nVentures, Corp. v. Salinas, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *28-31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 2, \n2019) (dismissing a conversion claim because the duty to return property arose under \na franchise agreement). \n75.  Here, Plaintiffs assert that the Trust’s “right to capital, income, losses, \ncredits, and other economic rights and interests” in IOMAXIS has been converted by \nthe IOMAXIS Defendants.  (Pls.’ Reply 13.)  But Plaintiffs also allege that this right \nexists by virtue of its status as an economic interest holder pursuant to IOMAXIS’s \nN.C. Operating Ag reement. (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶  35, 162- 67.)  Thus, Plaintiffs’ \nconversion claim arises from contractual duties that IOMAXIS and its manager owe \nthe Trust and is therefore barred by the economic loss rule.10 \n76. Because the economic loss rule bars Plaintiffs’ attempted claim for \nconversion, Plaintiffs’ proposed amendment to add this claim  is futile and shall be  \nDENIED. \nF. Conspiracy \n77. Finally, the IOMAXIS Defendants oppose  Plaintiffs’ civil conspiracy \nclaim on futility grounds  because it is not a standalone claim .  (Defs.’ Br. 21.)   \nPlaintiffs concede that civil conspiracy is not itself a claim, but they assert that they \nhave alleged both the existence of a common scheme to defraud  the Trust and acts \ncommitted in furtherance of that common scheme.  (Pls.’ Reply 14-15.) \n78. Civil conspiracy is not a n independent claim.  See Dove v. Harvey, 168 \nN.C. App. 687, 690 (2005) (“there is not a separate action for civil conspiracy in North \nCarolina.”).  It is a theory that “does nothing more than associate the defendants \ntogether and perhaps liberalize the rules of evidence to the extent that under proper \ncircumstances the acts and conduct of one might be admissible against all.”  Shope v. \nBoyer, 268 N.C. 401, 405 (1966) .  By  pleading and proving a civil conspiracy , a \nplaintiff is able to  recover from anyone who facilitated the alleged wrongs “by \n \n10 Plaintiffs argue that the economic loss rule should not be applied to economic interest \nholders because economic interest holders do not have an opportunity to negotiate the terms \nof an operating agreement.  (Pls.’ Reply 14.)  The Trust must recognize , however, that–at \nmost–it can receive by assignment only that which Ron Howard was able to transfer to his \nEstate.  In that sense, the Trust steps into Ron Howard’s shoes and is bound to the contract \nhe negotiated. \nagreeing for [the wrongs] to be accomplished.”  Nye v. Oates, 96 N.C. App. 343, 346 -\n47 (1989). \n79. To plead civil conspiracy, a party must allege “(1) an agreement between \ntwo or more individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act in an unlawful \nway; (3) resulting in injury to [the] plaintiff inflicted by one or more conspirators; and \n(4) pursuant to a common scheme.”   Privette v. Univ. of N. Carolina at Chapel Hill , \n96 N.C. App. 124, 139 (1989).   \n80. Plaintiffs have alleged that the IOMAXIS’ Defendants, along with \nproposed Defendant Five Insights, agreed to and engaged in a coordinated scheme to \nunlawfully deprive the Trust of distributions and reduce the value of its  economic \ninterest.  (Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 114-117, 120-134.)  Plaintiffs allege that, among other \nthings, the IOMAXIS Defendants and Five Insights hid assets in affiliated entities, \nsold Ingressive, backdated documents, refused to disclose relevant financial \ninformation to the Trust, and attempted  to retroactively establish IOMAXIS as a \nTexas LLC.  They claim that as a result of these actions, the Trust has been harmed.  \n(Prop. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 230-33, 235.)  Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the existence \nof a conspiracy. \nG. Addition of Five Insights as a Defendant \n81. In a footnote, the IOMAXIS Defendants protest the proposed addition of \nFive Insights as a defendant because “it is a De laware company with no connection \nto North Carolina” such that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Five Insights.  \n(Defs.’ Br. 14 n.11.)   Plaintiffs allege, however, that Five Insights is a successor -in-\ninterest and the sole member of IOMAXIS, which they contend remains a North \nCarolina LLC.  (Prop. Am. Comp. ¶ 24.) \n82. “The failure to plead the particulars of jurisdiction is not fatal to the \nclaim so long as the facts alleged permit the inference of jurisdiction under the \nstatute.\" Williams v. Inst. for Computational Stud. at Colo. State Univ., 85 N.C. App. \n421, 428 (1987).  Given the allegations of the proposed amended complaint, the Court \ncannot, at this stage, conclude that the addition of Five Insights would be futile. \n83. Moreover, given that Plaintiffs allege that the existence of Five Insights, \nas well as the common ownership between the individual defendants, IOMAXIS, and \nFive Insights, was only recently disclosed to them in discovery, the Court determines \nthat Plaintiffs’ motion to add Five Insights as a party is timely and not unduly \nprejudicial.   \n84. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Motion to name Five Insights as a defendant \nshall be GRANTED.   \nV. CONCLUSION \n85. WHEREFORE, the Court in its discretion, hereby ORDERS as \nfollows: \na. Plaintiffs’ Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part .
