The Court recites in this Order and Opinion only those facts \nnecessary for the determination of the Motion. \n3. Defendant Window World, Inc. (“Window World”) is a North Carolina \ncorporation with its principal place of business in Wilkes County, North Carolina.  \n(Pls.’ Third Am. Compl. ¶ 15, [hereinafter “Baton Rouge TAC”], ECF No. 252 (15 CVS \n1); Pls.’ Third Am. Compl. ¶ 50, [hereinafter “St. Louis TAC”], ECF No. 275 (15 CVS \n2).)  Window World is in the business of franchising its business to franchisees, who \npurchase materials such as windows, doors, and siding from third-party suppliers at \nwholesale and install the products under the Window World  name.  ( Baton Rouge \nTAC ¶ 20; St. Louis TAC ¶ 55.)  Window World also licenses the use of Window World \ntrademarks and other Window World intellectual property to its franchisees.  (Baton \nRouge TAC ¶ 20; St. Louis TAC ¶ 55.)   \n4. WWI is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of \nbusiness in Wilkes County, North Carolina.  (Baton Rouge T AC ¶ 16; St. Louis TAC \n¶ 51.)  WWI was organized on June 22, 2010, (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 289; St. Louis TAC \n¶ 394), and is owned solely by Defendant Tammy Whitworth (“Ms. Whitworth”), \n(Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 199; St. Louis TAC ¶ 298).   \n5. Plaintiffs in these actions  are various Window World franchisees and \nfranchisee owners.  ( See Baton Rouge TAC ¶¶  11–14; St. Louis TAC ¶¶ 12 –49.)  St. \nLouis Action Plaintiff s James T. Lomax III (“Lomax”) and Jonathan Gillette \n(“Gillette”) own Plaintiffs Window World of St. Louis, Inc., Window World of Kansas \nCity, Inc., and Window World of Springfield/Peoria, Inc. (collectively with Lomax and \nGillette, the “Lomax Plaintiffs”).  (St. Louis TAC ¶ 17.)  Baton Rouge Plaintiff James \nW. Roland (“Roland”) owns Plaintiffs Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC, Window \nWorld of Dallas, LLC, and Window World of Tri State Area, LLC (collectively with \nRoland, the “Roland Plaintiffs” and, together with the Lomax Plaintiffs, the “Lomax \nand Roland Plaintiffs”).  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶¶ 11–14.) \n6. On March 22, 2010, Ms. Whitworth became the sole shareholder of Window \nWorld after the death of her husband, Todd, and appointed herself Window World’s \nCEO at a time when Window World had no board of directors .  (Baton Rouge T AC \n¶ 176; St. Louis TAC ¶ 275.)  On June 21, 2010, Ms. Whitworth transferred all of her \nWindow World stock to the Tammy E. Whitworth Revocable Trust, an entity solely \nunder her control.  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 178; St. Louis TAC ¶ 277.)  \n7. According to Plaintiff s, Ms. Whitworth created WWI on June 22, 2010  to \nreceive Window World’s intellectual property in a scheme to defraud Window World’s \ncreditors, including Plaintiffs .  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 289 ; St. Louis TAC ¶ 394 .)  In \nparticular, Plaintiffs allege that the “sole purpose for which [Ms. Whitworth] created \nWWI was as a repository for [Window World’s] intellectual property assets . . . in the \nevent of . . . an ‘unfriendly suit.’”  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 200; St. Louis TAC ¶ 299.)3   \n8. On June 23, 2010, the day after W WI was organized, Window World \ntransferred to WWI all of its intellectual property assets  (the “2010 Transfer”) , \nincluding but not limited  to the Window World trademarks (the  “Transferred \nAssets”).  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 289; St. Louis TAC ¶ 394.)   WWI paid nothing to \nWindow World in exchange for the Transferred Assets.  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 201; St. \n                                                      \n3  On June 22, 2010, the same day that WWI was organized, Marie Whitworth, the mother of \nTodd Whitworth, filed a civil action in Wilkes County Superior Court against Window World, \nthe Estate of Todd Whitworth, and Ms. Whitworth, individually and as Executor of the Estate \nof Todd Whitworth.  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 291; St. Louis TAC ¶ 396.) \nLouis TAC ¶ 300.)  Window World later paid WWI a total of $120,000 for a license to \ncontinue using the Transferred Assets.  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 201; St. Louis TAC \n¶ 300.)   \n9. Sometime in 2010, WWI registered its ownership in some or all of the \nTransferred Assets with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \n“USPTO”).4 \n10. Sometime prior to April 2011, Plaintiffs allege that Window World’s intent \nto defraud credit ors “was confirmed in statements made to [Roland] and to \n[Lomax]  . . . by upper management of [Window World] about the purpose of the [2010 \nTransfer].”  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 292; see St. Louis TAC ¶ 397.)  The Third Amended \nComplaints contain no allegations suggesting that any of the other Plaintiffs (the \n“Remaining Plaintiffs”)5—apart from the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs —were made \naware of the 2010 Transfer before the Actions were filed. \n                                                      \n4  In ruling on a motion under Rule 12(c), the Court may properly consider matters of which \njudicial notice may be taken.  See Wood v. J. P. Stevens & Co., 297 N.C. 636, 641, 256 S.E.2d \n692, 696 (1979); see also Zloop, Inc. v. Parker Poe Adams & Bernstein, LLP , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 16, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 16, 2018) (“[A] court may properly consider matters \nof which it may take judicial notice without converting a Rule 12(c) motion to one for \nsummary judgment.”).  In addition, the Court may take judicial not ice of matters available \nfrom the USPTO’s electronic database.   See N.C. R. Evid. 201(b) (“A judicially noticed fact \nmust be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within \nthe territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination \nby resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”); see also  Clear \nDefense, LLC v. Cleardefense Pest Control of Greensboro, LLC, No. 1:17-cv-01139, 2018 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 182065, at *1 n.1 (M.D.N.C. Oct. 23, 2018) (“Because all of Defendants’ exhibits \n. . . are public records (primarily, [USPTO] records), the court judicially notices them for the \nfact that such filings were made.”). \n \n5  For purposes of this Order and Opinion, the “Rema ining Plaintiffs” shall include the \nfollowing persons and entities: B&E Investors, Inc.; Window World of North Atlanta, Inc.; \nWindow World of Central Alabama, Inc.; Michael Edwards; Melissa Edwards; Window World \nof Central Pa, LLC; Angell P. Wesnerford; Kenneth R. Ford, Jr.; World of Windows of Denver, \n11. On April 23, 2013, the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs entered into a tolling \nagreement with Window World (the “Tolling Agreement”).  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 157; \nSt. Louis TAC ¶  256; see WWI’s Br. Supp. M ot. J . Pleadings Ex. A  [hereinafter \n“Tolling Agmt.”], ECF No. 365.1 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 385.1 (15 CVS 2).)6  The Tolling \nAgreement provided that “all time-based defenses, including without limitation any \napplicable statutes of limitations, statutes of repose, and the doctrine of laches with \nrespect to the Co vered Claims7 are hereby tolled effective April 23, 2013.”  (Tolling \nAgmt. ¶ 2.)  WWI was not a party to the Tolling Agreement, (see Tolling Agmt.), and \nthe Remaining Plaintiffs did not enter into a similar agreement with Window World. \n12. Plaintiffs commenced  these Actions on January 2, 2015 , and  filed their \nThird Amended Complaint  in each  on January 11, 2017 .  (See Baton Rouge TAC \n¶¶ 222–300; St. Louis TAC ¶¶ 321–405.)  Although Plaintiffs assert numerous claims \nin each Action, the only claim lodged against WWI is for fraudulent transfer under \nthe North Carolina Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (the “NCUVTA”).  (See Baton \n                                                      \nLLC; Rick D. Rose; Christina M. Rose; Window World of Rockford, Inc.; Window World of \nJoliet, Inc.; Scott A. Williamson; Jennifer L. Williamson; Brian C. Hopkins; Window World \nof Lexington, Inc.; Tommy R. Jon es; Jeremy T. Shumate; Window World of Phoenix LLC; \nJames Ballard; and Toni Ballard. \n \n6  Although the Tolling Agreement was not attached to either Third Amended Complaint, the \nagreement was specifically referenced in each, ( see Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 157; St. L ouis TAC \n¶ 256), and thus may be considered on the Motion, see Reese v. City of Charlotte , 196 N.C. \nApp. 557, 558, 676 S.E.2d 493, 494 (2009) (holding trial court properly considered documents \nreferred to in complaint in deciding Rule 12(c) motion). \n \n7  The Tolling Agreement defined Covered Claims as “any and all claims, causes of action, or \ndefenses, whether asserted or unasserted, that presently exist between the Franchisees or \nany Franchisee on the one hand and [Window World] on the other.”  (Tolling  Agmt. ¶ 1.)  \nFranchisees were defined to include each of the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs.  (Tolling Agmt. \n¶ 1.)   \n \nRouge TAC ¶ ¶ 286–300; St. Louis TAC ¶ ¶ 391–405).8  Plaintiffs’ NCUVTA claim s \nseek to void the 2010 Transfer.  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 300; St. Louis TAC ¶ 405.)   \n13. On March 29, 2018, WWI filed the Motion,  contending that Plaintiffs’ \nfraudulent transfer claims must be dismissed as a matter of law because  they were \nnot filed within the time period prescribed by the applicable statute of repose.  (WWI’s \nMot. J. Pleadings, ECF No. 364 (15 CVS 1), ECF No. 384 (15 CVS 2).)   \n14. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on May 24, 2018, at which all parties \nwere represented by counsel.  The Motion has been fully briefed and heard and is now \nripe for determination. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n15. Under Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, “[a]fter the \npleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may \nmove for judgment on the pleadings.”   N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(c).   A motion under Rule \n12(c) “is the proper procedure when all the material allegations of fact are admitted \nin the pleadings and only questions of law remain.”  Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. \n130, 137, 209 S.E.2d 494, 499 (1974).  The Court must “view the facts and permissible \n                                                      \n8  Plaintiffs also seek to “recover from Tammy Whitworth individually and from WWI on each \nof the causes of action Plaintiffs assert against [Window World] pursuant to the doctrines of \npiercing the corporate veil, mere instrumentality and/or alter ego.”  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 163; \nSt. Louis TAC ¶ 262; see Baton Rouge TAC ¶¶ 172, 197–201; St. Louis TAC ¶¶ 271, 296–302.) \nWWI did not seek dismissal of this remedy in its Motion and opening brief, and thus, despite \nWWI’s conclusory request —made only in its reply bri ef—that WWI be dismissed from the \nActions, the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ veil-piercing allegations against WWI are not properly a \nsubject of the current Motion.  See N.C. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1) (providing that motions “shall be \nmade in writing, shall state wi th particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the \nrelief or order sought”). \ninferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” id., and may consider \n“only the pleadings and exhibits which are attached and incorporated into the \npleadings[,]” Davis v. Durham Mental Health/Dev. Disabilities/Substance A buse \nArea Auth., 165 N.C. App. 100, 104, 598 S.E.2d 237, 240 (2004) (quoting Helms v. \nHolland, 124 N.C. App. 629, 633, 478 S.E.2d 513, 516 (1996)).   \n16. “All well pleaded factual allegations in the nonmoving party’s pleadings are \ntaken as true and all contravening assertions in the movant’s pleadings are taken as \nfalse.”  Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499.  “When the pleadings do not \nresolve all the factual issues, judgment on the pleadings is generally inappropriate.”  \nId.  “[W]hen a complaint does not allege ‘facts sufficient to state a cause of action or \npleads facts which deny the right to any relief[,]’” the Court should grant a Rule 12(c) \nmotion.  Reese v. Brooklyn Vill., LLC , 209 N.C. App. 636, 641, 707 S.E.2d 249, 253 \n(2011) (quoting Robertson v. Boyd, 88 N.C. App. 437, 440, 363 S.E.2d 672, 675 (1988)). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n17. WWI’s sole contention on the Motion is that Plaintiffs’ fraudulent transfer \nclaims are untimely as a matter of law under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39-23.9.   \n18. The NCUVTA provides two different methods by which a creditor can void \na transfer made by a debtor.   See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 39 -23.4(a).  Specifically, section \n39-23.4(a) of the NCUVTA provides as follows: \nA transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is voidable as to a creditor, \nwhether the creditor’ s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or \nthe obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the \nobligation:  \n \n(1) With intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or  \n \n(2) Without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the \ntransfer or obligation, and the debtor:  \n \na. Was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction \nfor which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably \nsmall in relation to the business or transaction; or  \n \nb. Intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts \nbeyond the debtor’s ability to pay as they became due. \n \nId.  Plaintiffs seek to void Window World’s 2010 Transfer to WWI under subsections \n39-23.4(a)(1) and (a)(2).  \n19. Section 39-23.9, the statute of repose for claims under section 39-23.4(a), see \nKB Aircraft Acquisition, LLC v. Berry , 249 N.C. App. 74, 83, 790 S.E.2d 559, 566 \n(2016), provides that a claim is extinguished unless an action is brought:  \n(1) Under G.S. 39-23.4(a)(1), not later than four years after the transfer was \nmade or the obligation was incurred or, if later, not later than one year \nafter the transfer or obligation was or could reasonably have been \ndiscovered by the claimant; [or] \n \n(2) Under G.S. 39 -23.4(a)(2) . . . , not later than four years after the transfer \nwas made or the obligation was incurred[.] \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. §§  39-23.9(1)–(2).  Thus, claims generally must be asserted within \nfour years of a transfer unless they are brought pursuant to the savings clause \napplicable to section 39-23.4(a)(1) and within one year after the transfer “was or could \nreasonably have been discovered by the claimant[.]”  Id. § 39-23.9(1).   \n20. The North Carolina Court of Appeals has interpreted “transfer” in section \n39-23.9 to refer to “the date that the transfer actually occurred, and not the date that \nthe fraudulent nature of the transfer became apparent.”  KB Aircraft Acquisition, \nLLC, 249 N. C. App. at 81, 790 S.E.2d at 564.  The parties agree that the alleged \nfraudulent transfer here—the 2010 Transfer—occurred on June 23, 2010.  Thus, for \npurposes of section 39-23.4(a)(2) and the four-year provision applicable to section 39-\n23.4(a)(1), the statute of repose began to run from that date.   \n21. It is undisputed that Plaintiffs’ NCUVTA claims were filed on January 2, \n2015 and thus not within four years after the 2010 Transfer.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs \ncontend that certain NCUVTA claims are  timely because (i) Plaintiffs did not \ndiscover, nor could they have reasonably discovered, the 2010 Transfer more than one \nyear prior to filing suit in 2015 (i.e., before January 2, 2014), thus satisfying the one-\nyear savings clause in section 39-23.9(1) and thereby permitting the timely assertion \nof their claims under section 39 -23.4(a)(1), and (ii) as to the Lomax and Roland \nPlaintiffs only, the April 23, 2013 Tolling Agreement tolled operation of section 39 -\n23.9’s statute of repose as to their claims under both sections 39-23.4(a)(1) and (a)(2).    \n22. WWI argues that two separate events provided Plaintiffs with sufficient \nnotice of the 2010 Transfer to trigger the one-year savings clause in section 39-23.9(1) \nas a matter of law for purposes of their claims under section 39-23.4(a)(1).  First, WWI \npoints to allegations in Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaints indicating that Window \nWorld’s upper management made statements to Lomax and Roland no later than \nApril 2011 confirming Window World’s intent to defraud  creditors through the 2010 \nTransfer.  (See Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 292; St. Louis TAC ¶ 397.)  Second, WWI contends \nthat its filings with the USPTO in 2010 attesting to its ownership of the Transferred \nAssets establishes that each Plaintiff reasonably could hav e discovered the 2010 \nTransfer at any time after those filings became a matter of public record in 2010. \n23. Because the allegations and arguments related to the Lomax and Roland \nPlaintiffs differ from those related to the Remaining Plaintiffs, the Court will analyze \nthem separately.   \n The Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs \n24. The Court turns first to WWI’s contention that the Lomax and Roland \nPlaintiffs’ claims under section 39 -23.4(a)(1) are barred under the one-year savings \nclause in section 39-23.9(1)9 because Plaintiffs allege Lomax and Roland learned of \nthe 2010 Transfer prior to April 2011 but failed to file their claims under section 39-\n23.4(a)(1) by April 2012.  In particular, WWI points to the Third Amended Complaint \nin each Action, which asserts that Window World’s intent to defraud its creditors “was \nconfirmed in statements made to [Roland] and to [Lomax] prior to April 2011 by upper \nmanagement of [Window World] about the purpose of the June 23, 2 010 transfers.”  \n(Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 292; see St. Louis TAC ¶ 397.)   \n25. Taking these allegations as true , as it must , the Court concludes that the \nLomax and Roland Plaintiffs have satisfactorily pleaded that Lomax and Roland each \n“discovered” the 2010 Tran sfer no later than April 2011.   As Plaintiffs appear to \nconcede, Lomax’s and Roland’s discoveries are imputed to the remaining Lomax and \nRoland Plaintiffs as a matter of law .  (See Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. J. Pleadings 10 n.4, \n                                                      \n9  It is worth emphasizing that the one-year savings clause appears only in section 39-23.9(1) \nand is applicable only to claims brought under section 39 -23.4(a)(1).  Claims brought under \nsection 39-23.4(a)(2) are not subject to a similar savings clause and instead must be brought \nin all instances within four years of the transfer sought to be avoided. \nECF No. 4 58 (15 CVS 1) (“There is  no basis to impute any knowledge Lomax may \nhave had to any other Plaintiff other than the entities for which he is an officer, and \nWWI does not suggest otherwise.”)); see also Reinninger v. Prestige Fabricators, Inc., \n136 N.C. App. 255, 262, 523 S.E.2d 72 0, 725 (1999) ( “[T]he principal is chargeable \nwith the knowledge of his agent.”).   \n26. Given that the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs have pleaded facts showing that \nthey discovered the 2010 Transfer “prior to” April 2011, the one-year savings clause \nin section 39-23.9(1) began to run no later than April 2011.  The Court concludes that \nbecause the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs did not file their claim s under section 39-\n23.4(a)(1) or enter the Tolling Agreement  prior to  April 201 2, these claims are \nuntimely to the extent the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs rest their timeliness \nargument on the one-year savings clause in section 39-23.9(1).10   \n27. The Court next turns to the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs ’ contention that \ntheir NCUVTA claims are timely because the Tolling Agreement tolled the four-year \nstatute of repose applicable to their claims under both sections 39 -23.4(a)(1) and \n(a)(2).  As noted above, the Tolling Agreement was entered between the Lomax and \nRoland Plaintiffs and Window World on April 23, 2013  and provided that “all time-\nbased defenses, including without limitation any applicable statutes of limitations, \nstatutes of repose, and the doctrine of laches with respect to the Covered Claims are \nhereby tolled effective April 23, 2013.”  (Tolling Agmt. ¶ 2 (emphasis added) .)  \n                                                      \n10  In light of the Court’s conclusion, the Court need not consider whether the USPTO filings \nconcerning the Transferred Assets also afforded the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs notice of \nthe 2010 Transfer for purposes of the one-year savings clause in section 39-23.9(1). \nPlaintiffs seek to enforce the Tolling Agreement against WWI as an alter ego of \nWindow World. \n28. While it is undisputed that the Tolling Agreement was executed within four \nyears after the 2010 Transfer, WWI contends that the Agreement did not effectively \ntoll the statute of repose , arguing that  (i) a period of repose cannot be tolled by \nagreement, (ii) “the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil does not and cannot operate \nto make an alter ego a party to a contract,” and (iii) “equitable grounds cannot be used \nto avoid a statute of repose.”  (WWI’s Br. Supp. Mot. J. Pleadings 13, 11 ECF No. 365 \n(15 CVS 1), ECF No. 385 (15 CVS 2).) \n29. In contrast to statutes of limitations, which operate to limit the time a \nplaintiff has to file a claim, “statutes of repose function as more rigid stops.”  KB \nAircraft Acquisition, LLC, 249 N.C. App. at 84, 790 S.E.2d at 566 (citing Boudreau v. \nBaughman, 322 N.C. 331, 340, 368 S.E.2d 849, 856 (1988)).   Rather than running \nfrom the time a cause of action accrued, a statute of repose i s generally measured \nfrom a “defendant’s last act giving rise to the claim.”  Id. (quoting Boudreau, 322 N.C. \nat 340, 368 S.E.2d at 856).  “A statute of repose creates an additional element of the \nclaim itself which must be satisfied in order for the claim to be maintained.”  Id. at \n85, 790 S.E.2d at 567  (quoting Goodman v. Holmes & McLaurin Attorneys at Law , \n192 N.C. App. 467,  474, 665 S.E.2d 526, 531 (2008)).  “If the action is not brought \nwithin the specified period, the plaintiff literally has no cause of action.”  Id. (quoting \nGoodman, 192 N.C. App. at 474, 665 S.E.2d at 531).  \n                                                      \n11  For ease of reference, all pinpoint citations to the parties’ briefs shall refer to filings in the \nBaton Rouge Action. \n30. Although WWI argues to the contrary, North Carolina courts have explicitly \nrecognized that a statute of re pose may be tolled by agreement.   See Christie v. \nHartley Constr., Inc., 367 N.C. 534, 540, 766 S.E.2d 283, 288 (2014); Charlotte Motor \nSpeedway, Inc. v. Tindall Corp., 195 N.C. App. 296, 302, 672 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2009) \n(holding contract containing tolling provision “operated to toll the statute of repose”).  \nIndeed, our Supreme Court has found “no public policy reason why the beneficiary of \na statute of repose cannot b argain away, or even waive” the advantages of claim \nextinguishment.  Christie, 367 N.C. at 540, 766 S.E.2d at 287–88 (“[T]he beneficiaries \nof the statute of repose may choose to forgo that protection [afforded by the statutory \nperiod] without violating any  rule of public policy.”).  Particularly i n light of the \n“broad policy of the law which accords to contracting parties freedom to bind \nthemselves as they see fit,” id. at 540, 766 S.E.2d at 28 7, the Court concludes that \nthe statute of repose set forth in section 39-23.9 may be tolled by agreement. \n31. Turning then to the Tolling Agreement here, t he Lomax and Roland \nPlaintiffs seek t o enforce the Tolling Agreement against WWI as an alter ego of \nWindow World under the equitable doctrine of piercing the corporate veil.  WWI \nargues that dismissal is required because the Tolling Agreement cannot be enforced \nagainst WWI, which was not a party to the Agreement’s terms.   \n32. Piercing the corporate veil “is not a theory of liability” but instead “provides \nan avenue to pursue legal claims against [those] who would otherwise be shielded by \nthe corporate form.”  Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 146, 749 S.E.2d 262, 271 (2013).  \n“Disregarding the corporate form is not to be done lightly[,]” id. at 145, 749 S.E.2d at \n270, but when the corporate form enables some fraudulent end, the responsible party \nshould be estopped from achieving an unacceptable consequence, State ex rel. Cooper \nv. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, 362 N.C. 431, 439, 666 S.E.2d 107, 112–13 (2008). \n33. In North Carolin a, piercing the corporate veil is achieved through \napplication of the instrumentality rule.   Estate of Hurst v. Moorehead I, LLC , 228 \nN.C. App. 571, 577, 748 S.E.2d 568, 573 (2013).  “ [T]he instrumentality rule allows \nfor the corporate form to be disregard ed if ‘the corporation is so operated that it is a \nmere instrumentality or alter ego of the sole or dominant shareholder and a shield for \nhis activities in violation of the declared public policy or statute of the State[ .]’”  Id. \nat 577, 748 S.E.2d at 573–74 (quoting Cooper, 362 N.C. at 440–41, 666 S.E.2d at 113–\n14).  If a corporate entity is determined to be an alter ego, it “will be disregarded and \nthe corporation and the shareholder treated as one and the same person.”  Id. at 577, \n748 S.E.2d at 574 (quoting Cooper, 362 N.C. at 441, 666 S.E.2d at 114).   \n34. Under the instrumentality rule, a plaintiff must prove the following \nelements before a court will pierce the corporate veil:  \n(1) Control, not mere majority or complete stock control, but complete \ndomination, not only of finances, but of policy and business practice in \nrespect to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this \ntransaction had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own; \nand  \n \n(2) Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or \nwrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal \nduty, or a dishonest and unjust act in contravention of plaintiff's leg al \nrights; and  \n \n(3) The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the \ninjury or unjust loss complained of.  \n \nGlenn v. Wagner, 313 N.C. 450, 455, 329 S.E.2d 326, 330 (1985).    \n35. When considering whether to pierce a corporate veil, North Carolina courts \nexamine the following factors: (i) whether the controlled entity is inadequately \ncapitalized; (ii) the extent to which the controlled company has disregarded corporate \nformalities; (iii) complete domination of the controlled company by the controlling \ncompany; and (iv) excessive fragmentation of a single enterprise into separate \ncorporations.  Glenn, 313 N.C. at 445, 349 S.E.2d at 330–31.  \n36. When the requisite elements and factors are present, courts will impose \nalter ego liability for a breach of contract.  See, e.g., S. Shores Realty Servs. v. Miller, \n796 S.E.2d 340, 353 –54 (N.C. Ct. App. 2017) (concluding that plaintiff offered \nsufficient evidence to hold individual liable for LLC defendants’ breach of contractual \nobligations and affirming trial court’s denial of motions for directed verdict or JNOV); \nEstate of Hurst, 228 N.C. App. at 577–80, 748 S.E.2d at 574–75 (concluding alter ego \nliability was properly imposed against sole member of an LLC for LLC’s breach of \ncontract damages where member controlled LLC with respect to transactions that \ndamaged plaintiffs); Fischer Inv.

App. \n644, 656, 689 S.E.2d 143, 150 –51 (2009) (concluding trial court erred in dismissing \nreverse veil-piercing claim under Rule 12(b)(6) and stating “we are not persuaded \nthat Plaintiff’s claim amounts to an impermissible attempt to make [the corporate \ndefendant] liable for [a note executed by an individual owner of the corporate \ndefendant] despite the fact that [the corporate defendant]  is not a party to that \ninstrument”); E. Mkt. St. S quare, Inc. v. Tycorp Pizza IV, Inc. , 175 N.C. App. 628, \n640, 625 S.E.2d 191, 201 (2006) ( concluding owner of corporate defendant was \nindividually liable for the acts and obligations of the corporate defendant  under a \nlease agreement ); Kerry Bodenhamer F arms, LLC v. Nature’s Pearl Corp. , 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 84, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 15, 2018 ) (“[O]ur courts have pierced \nthe veil in a case for breach of contract only where the evidence revealed other \ncompelling factors apart from the breach itself.”); Insight Health Corp., 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 56, at * 36–40; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle , 556 U.S. 624, 631 \n(2009) (“[T]raditional principles of state law allow a contract to be enforced by or \nagainst nonparties to the contract through . . . piercing the corporate veil [and] alter \nego theories[.]” (internal quotation marks omitted)).   \n37. Indeed, under the instrumentality rule, the alter ego “and the shareholder \n[are] treated as one and the same person.”  Estate of Hurst, 228 N.C. App. at 577, 748 \nS.E.2d at 574 (emphasis added) (quoting Cooper, 362 N.C. at 441, 666 S.E.2d at 114). \n38. WWI relies heavily on Cherry v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 162 N.C. \nApp. 535, 590 S.E.2d 925 (2004) , for the proposition that “veil-piercing cannot \n‘rewrit[e]’ a contract to substitute the alleged alter ego as a party.”  (WWI’s Br. Supp. \nMot. J . Pleadings 13 –14.)  In that case , the plaintiffs in a wrongful death action \narising out of a car accident sought a declaration that they were entitled to coverage \nunder a commercial insurance policy issued by State Farm to B&L, a company owned \nand operated by the driver of the other vehicle, an individual named Jump.  Cherry, \n162 N.C. App. at 536, 590 S.E.2d at 927.  The plaintiff asked the court to pierce the \nveil between  B&L and Jump for  the purpose of reaching State Farm’s insurance \ncoverage, arguing that Jump could be treated as the insured under the policy issued \nto B&L.  Id.  In refusing to “disregard B&L’s separate corporate identity . . . for the \npurpose of reaching  State Farm’s coverage,” the court stated that “[g]ranting \nplaintiffs’ request would be tantamount to rewriting the terms of the subject policy \nby requiring State Farm . . . to cover someone other than the named insured.”  Id. at \n539, 590 S.E.2d at 929.   \n39. As the Court of Appeals subsequently explained, \n[h]ad the Court approved the “veil piercing” proposed in Cherry, the effect of \nthat decision would have been to expand the liability of State Farm even \nthough State Farm was not in any way involved in the conduct that allegedly \nsupported the piercing of the corporate veil or in any alleged fraudulent \ntransfer. \n \nFischer Inv. Capital, Inc., 200 N.C. App. at 655, 689 S.E.2d at 150.  Thus, Cherry does \nnot stand for the proposition , as WWI suggests,  that the doctrine of piercing the \ncorporate veil cannot operate to subject an alter -ego party to a contract’s terms .  \nRather, the decision merely posits that it would be improper to do so when the result \nwould be to expand the liability of a third party uninvolved in the alleged transfer or \nabuse of the corporate form. \n40. Here, unlike the plaintiff in Cherry, the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs are not \nseeking to gain the benefit of a contract by imposing liability on a third party who \nhad no involvement in the conduct giving rise to their fraudulent transfer claims and \nveil-piercing remedy.  To the contrary, Plaintiffs specifically allege that “WWI was \ncreated at Tammy Whitworth’s direction because she and [Window World] \nanticipated litigation from Window World franchi sees such as Plaintiffs over \n[Window World’s] unlawful business practices and wished to shield [Window World’s] \nassets from such litigation.”  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 200; St. Louis TAC ¶ 299.)  As such, \nPlaintiffs allege that WWI was involved in the fraudulent transfer at issue and in the \nconduct giving rise to the veil-piercing remedy sought.   \n41. WWI’s other arguments against enforcement are equally unavailing.  First, \nWWI argues that the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs’ failure to make WWI a party to \nthe Tolling Agreement even though they were aware of the 2010 Transfer when they \nentered into the Agreement precludes enforcement.  Our courts have held in similar \ncircumstances, however, that such knowledge, standing alone, is insufficient to \npermit the Court to conclude as a matter of law under Rule 12(c) that enforcement is \nimproper.  See Fischer Inv. Capital, Inc. , 200 N.C. App. at 656, 689 S.E.2d at 151 \n(“[T]he fact that Plaintiff initially chose to do business with HCL and Defendant Mark \nLewis rather than with [the  alleged alter ego corporate entity] does not constitute \nsuch an insurmountable barrier to the maintenance of the present action as to require \nits dismissal pursuant to .  . . Rule 12(b)(6).”);  see also E. Mkt. St. Square, Inc. , 175 \nN.C. App. at 640, 625 S.E.2d at 200–01 (piercing corporate veil in breach of contract \naction even though contract was the product of “an arm’s length transaction \nnegotiated between two corporations and their respective attorneys”); Insight Health \nCorp., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 56, at *36 –40 (rejecting individual defendants’ argument \nthat plaintiff “should be denied veil -piercing relief because it chose to contract only” \nwith one of the corporate defendants). \n42. Moreover, that Plaintiffs do not allege wrongful conduct surrounding the \nexecution of the Tolling Agreement is not dispositive.  “‘[D]omination sufficient to \npierce the corporate veil need not be limited to the particular transaction attacked,’ \nthough it will rarely be the case that ‘the domination does not extend to the \ntransaction attacked.’”  Insight Health Corp. v. Marquis Diagnostic Imaging of N.C., \nLLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 56, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 5, 2018) (quoting Glenn, \n313 N.C. at 456, 329 S.E.2d at 331); see State ex rel. Utils. Comm’n v. Nantahala \nPower & Light Co. , 313 N .C. 614, 729, 332 S.E.2d 397, 464 (1985) (“[T]he separate \ncorporate entity would be disregarded in those cases in which one affiliated \ncorporation is shown to be without a separate and distinct corporate identity and is \noperated as a mere shell, created to  perform a function for an affiliated corporation \nor its common shareholders without the necessity of proving that the control was also \nexercised over the particular transaction attacked.” (internal quotation marks \nomitted)), rev’d on other grounds , Nantahala Power & Light Co. v. Thornburg , 476 \nU.S. 953 (1986). \n43. Plaintiffs here allege that Ms. Whitworth exerted complete domination over \nWindow World and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including WWI.  (Baton Rouge TAC \n¶ 221; St. Louis TAC ¶ 320.)  According to Plaintiffs, at the time of the 2010 Transfer, \nWindow World “had no functioning board of directors, and its actions were directed \nsolely and dominantly by [Ms.] Whitworth.”  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 202; St. Louis TAC \n¶ 298).  The Third Amended Complaints further allege that Ms. Whitworth, Window \nWorld, and WWI observed few corporate formalities, com mingled funds, failed to \nadequately capitalize the respective corporate entities, and maintained the same \nprincipal offices.  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶¶  205, 206, 211, 212, 213, 214, 288; St. Louis \nTAC ¶¶ 304, 305, 310, 311, 312, 313, 393.)  Indeed, Plaintiffs allege that “WWI relied \nupon [Window World] to pay its bills” and that Window World “had control over all \nmoney in the coffers of WWI[.]”  (Baton Rouge TAC ¶ 212(a); St. Louis TAC ¶ 311(a).)  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts that, \ntaken as true, would support enforcement of the Tolling Agreement against WWI as \nthe alter ego of Window World.     \n44. WWI also contends that the language in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the Tolling \nAgreement precludes enforcement.  The Court disagrees.  Although WWI argues that \nparagraph 9 “expressly provides that [the Tolling Agreement] is only the ‘binding \nobligation of the Parties’ t o the agreement,” (WWI’s Br. Supp. Mot. J. Pleadings 12 \n(emphasis added)), that provision, titled “Full Capacity,” merely provides that “[t]he \npersons executing this Agreement hereby represent and warrant that they have full \nauthority and representative ca pacity to execute the Agreement in the capacities \nindicated below and that this Agreement constitutes the binding obligation of the \nParties on whose behalf they signed.”  (Tolling Agmt. ¶ 9.)  The Court does not read \nthe last part of the clause—“the binding obligation of the Parties on whose behalf \nthey signed”—as necessarily precluding Plaintiffs’ veil -piercing remedy on the facts \npleaded here.    \n45. Similarly, the full text of paragraph 10 undercuts WWI’s argument .  That \nprovision, titled “No Third Party Beneficiaries,” provides that “[a]ll undertakings, \nagreements, representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are solely \nfor the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and there are no other parties who \nare intended to be benefited in any way  by this Agreement.”  (Tolling Agmt. ¶ 10.)   \nBecause the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs do not seek to make WWI a beneficiary of \nthe Tolling Agreement, paragraph 10 has no application to the present dispute. \n46. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the pleaded facts, viewed in the light \nmost favorable to Plaintiffs, are sufficient to permit a conclusion that WWI may be \nbound to the Tolling Agreement.  See Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499 \n(noting that facts and inferences are to be viewed in the light most favorable to the \nnonmoving party and that “[w]hen the pleadings do not resolve all the factual issues, \njudgment on the pleadings is generally inappropriate”); Fischer Inv. Capital, Inc., 200 \nN.C. App. at 652–53, 689 S.E.2d at 149 (reversing trial cour t’s dismissal under Rule \n12(b)(6) and concluding that the plaintiff “alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for \nrelief as to whether [the defendant’s] corporate veil should be pierced”).   \n47. Notwithstanding the above, WWI argues that the combination of an  \nequitable doctrine—piercing the corporate veil —and the Tolling Agreement cannot \noperate to toll the statute of repose  as the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs seek to do \nhere.  The Court disagrees.   \n48. Statutes of repose are not subject to equitable tolling doctrines.  See Christie, \n367 N.C. at 539, 766 S.E.2d at 287 (“While equitable doctrines may toll statutes of \nlimitation, they do not toll substantive rights created by statutes of repose.” (quoting \nMonson v. Paramount Homes, Inc. , 133 N.C. App. 235, 240, 515 S.E.2d 445, 449 \n(1999)); KB Aircraft Acquisition, LLC , 249 N.C. App. at 87, 790 S.E.2d at 568 (“We \nhold that Section 39-23.9 is a statute of repose and includes no language creating an \nexception f or equitable doctrines, thereby precluding equitable remedies such as \nequitable tolling[.]”). \n49. Piercing the corporate veil is an equitable doctrine.  Cooper, 362 N.C. at 440, \n666 S.E.2d at 113; Glenn, 313 N.C. at 458, 329 S.E.2d at 332 (“[T]he theory of liability \nunder the instrumentality rule is an equitable doctrine.”); see Insight Health Corp., \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 56, at *26–32.  As discussed above, however, our appellate courts \nhave explicitly recognized that statutes of repose may be tolled by agreement.  See \nChristie, 367 N.C. at 540, 766 S.E.2d at 287–88; Charlotte Motor Speedway, Inc., 195 \nN.C. App. at 302, 672 S.E.2d at 695. \n50. Here, the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs do not invoke the instrumentality \nrule to toll the statute of repose set forth in section 39 -23.9 as a matter of equity.  \nRather, they allege that the Tolling Agreement operated to toll the statute of repose \nagainst Window World and its alter ego, WWI, as a matter of contract  right.  Thus, \nthose cases holding that equitable doctrines cannot toll statutes of repose have no \napplication on the facts pleaded here.     \n51. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs have \npleaded sufficient facts to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the Tolling \nAgreement tolled the four-year statute of repose in sections 39-23.9(1) and (2) on their \nclaims under sections 39-23.4(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the NCUVTA.  As a result, the Court \nconcludes that WWI’s Motion should be denied as it relates to these claims. \n The Remaining Plaintiffs \n52. The Court turns first to the four-year statute of repose in 39-23.9(1) and (2) \nand its application to the Remaining Plaintiffs’ claims.  It is undisputed that the \nRemaining Plaintiffs’ claims were filed more than four years after the 2010 Transfer.  \nIt is als o undisputed that the  Remaining Plaintiffs were not parties to the Tolling \nAgreement.  As such, the Court concludes that the Remaining Plaintiffs’ claims under \nsection 39-23.4(a)(2) are untimely as a matter of law and should be dismissed.12 \n53. WWI also contends that the Remaining Plaintiffs’ claim s under section 39-\n23.4(a)(1) are untimely to the extent they rely on the one -year savings clause in \nsection 39-23.9(1).  In contrast to their allegations concerning the Lomax and Roland \nPlaintiffs, Plaintiffs omit any allegation in the Third Amended Complaint that the \nRemaining Plaintiffs discovered the 2010 Transfer prior to April 2011 or were \notherwise made aware of the 2010 Transfer prior to initiating these Actions.  \nNevertheless, WWI argues that the Remaining Plaintiffs reasonably could have \ndiscovered the 2010 Transfer prior to January 2, 2014 (i.e. , one year before these \nActions were  filed) based on WWI’s registration of ownership concerning the \nTransferred Assets with the USPTO in 2010.  (WWI’s Br. Supp. Mot. J. Pleadings 8–\n10.) \n54. Claims under section 39-23.4(a)(1) that rely on section 39-23.9(1)’s one-year \nsavings clause are extinguished unless action is brought “not later than one year after \nthe transfer or obligation was or could reasonably have been discovered by the \n                                                      \n12  The Remaining Plaintiffs appear to concede that dismissal of their claims under section \n39-23.4(a)(2) as untimely is appropriate.  (See Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. J. Pleadings 9 (15 CVS 1).) \nclaimant[.]”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  39-23.9(2).  WWI does not cite, and the Court’s own \nresearch has not disclosed, any case, in North Carolina or otherwise, in which a court \nhas concluded that registration of ownership with the USPTO is sufficient to put a \ncreditor on notice under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (the “UVTA”).  WWI \ncontends generally, however, that the disclosure of a transfer on the public record—\nhere, the USPTO register —establishes, as a matter of law, that the transfer could \nreasonably have been discovered by a creditor for purposes of the one -year savings \nclause.   \n55. Courts considering whether a public filing “could have been discovered” as \na matter of law under the UVTA have reached conflicting results.  Compare Menotte \nv. Gassan (In re Tabor) , Nos. 14 -20731-EPK, 15 -01577-EPK, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS \n2315, at *12 (Bankr. S.D. Fla.

App. 2012) (“We now hold that the act of recording a deed does not \nwithout more, as a matter of law, start the ‘savings clause year.’”) , Bueneman v. \nZykan, 181 S.W.3d 105, 111 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005) (“We don’t believe that [a]ppellants \nreasonably could be expected to search the recorder of deeds before they even obtained \na judgment against Zykan, or before they realized their judgment was not going to be \npaid by Zykan.” ), Gulf Ins. Co. v. Clark , 20 P.3d 780, 788 (Mont. 2001) (“The act of \nrecording a transfer of real property in and of itself does not absolutely establish that \na creditor has acquired actual or constructive knowledge of a transfer. Rather, we \nconclude that the ‘reasonable discovery’ of the transfer is a discretionary ruling, one \nthat must be adjudicated on a case -by-case basis.”) , SASCO 1997 NI, LLC v. \nZudkewich, 767 A.2d 469, 476 (N.J. 2001) (concluding that savings clause ran from \ntime a reasonable commercial creditor would have done an asset search and not from \nwhen deed was recorded), superseded by statute, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 25:2-31(a), Supreme \nBakery, Inc. v. Bagley , 742 A.2d 1202, 120 4–05 (R.I. 2000) (“[T]he mere filing of the \ndeed alone may not have been enough to alert [the plaintiff -creditor] to the \ntransfer[.]”), and Johnston v.

App. 2002) \n(“Registration of a fraudulent conveyance at a certain date, however, is merely one \ncircumstance bearing on the creditor’s actual or presumed knowledge.”) , with \nEpperson v. Entm’t Express, Inc. , 338 F. Supp. 2d 328, 344 (D. Conn. 2004) \n(concluding savings clause was triggered when UCC-1 statements were filed as public \nrecords), and Montoya v. Tobey (In re Ewbank ), 359 B.R. 807, 810 (Bankr. D.N.M. \n2007) (“Upon recordation, the deeds became part of the public record, and, therefore, \ncould reasonab ly have been discovered by searching the Bernalillo county real \nproperty records.”). \n56. In KB Aircraft, the most relevant North Carolina case the Court’s research \nhas discovered, the Court of Appeals eschewed a per se rule of the sort followed in \nEpperson and Montoya above.  In that case , the plaintiff asserted  a fraudulent \ntransfer claim based on a transfer of real property from the individual defendant to \nthe corporate defendant after the individual defendant defaulted on a contractual \nobligation.  KB Aircraft Acquisition, LLC , 249 N.C. App.  at 78, 790 S.E.2d at 563.  \nWhile the transfer was recorded in the public record and could have been discovered \nthrough a title search, the court focused on the circumstances which put the plaintiff \non notice in assessing whether the fraudulent transfer “could reasonably” have been \ndiscovered: \n[A] plaintiff has a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to discover the fraud \nor misrepresentations that give rise to [its] claim.  [W]hen an event occurs to \nexcite the aggrieve d party’s suspicion or put [it] on such inquiry as should \nhave led, in the exercise of due diligence , to a discovery of the fraud,  that \nparty is deemed to have inquiry notice of the same.  \n \nId. at 89, 790 S.E.2d at 569–70 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).13     \n57. In light of KB Aircraft and the greater weight of the relevant authority, the \nCourt cannot conclude, as WWI contends, that recording ownership in public records, \nstanding alone, establishes as a matte r of law that a creditor could reasonably \ndiscover a fraudulent transfer under section 39 -23.9(1).  That our courts have \nfrequently recognized that “[r]easonableness is a quintessential jury question ,” \nDysart v. Cummings , 181 N.C. App. 641, 653, 640 S.E.2d  832, 840 (2007) , further \nsupports the Court’s conclusion, see also Piles v. Allstate Ins. Co., 187 N.C. App. 399, \n405, 653 S.E.2d 181, 186 (2007) (“The date of [the plaintiff’s] discovery of the alleged \nfraud or negligence - or whether she should have discovered it earlier through \nreasonable diligence - is a question of fact for a jury[.]”).14   \n                                                      \n13  On the facts of that case, after noting that the individual defendant’s “personal financial \nstatements [were] enough to cause a reasonable person with an interest in  the Property to \ninquire further into its present status,” the court held that the plaintiff’s claim was untimely \nunder the one-year savings clause.  KB Aircraft Acquisition, LLC, 249 N.C. App. 89–90, 790 \nS.E.2d at 570. \n \n14  Additional support may also be fo und in pre-NCUVTA case law.  See Cowart v. Whitley, \n39 N.C. App. 662, 664, 251 S.E.2d 627, 629 (1979) (analyzing claim under former fraudulent \n58. In support of its argument that filing with the USPTO affords “notice to all” \nand makes any section 39 -23.4(a)(1) claim filed more than one year thereafter  \nuntimely, WWI relies  heavily on federal decisions, all of which involve a party \nclaiming an ownership interest in or a violation of its own intellectual property rights.  \nSee Sontag Chain Stores Co. v. Nat’l Nut Co. of Cal., 310 U.S. 281, 295 (1940) (noting \nthat recording a patent with the USPTO amounts to constructive notice in a patent \ninfringement action); Rebel Debutante LLC v. Forsythe Cosmetic Grp., Ltd. , 799 F. \nSupp. 2d 558 , 575 (M.D.N.C. 2011); Motha v. Time Warner Cable, Inc. , No. 16 -cv-\n03585-HSG, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166893, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2016) (holding \nstatute of limitations on conversion claim began to run when allegedly fraudulent \nassignment of plaintiff’s intellectual property rights was recorded with USPTO ); see \nalso 15 U.S.C. § 1072 (“Registration of a mark on the principal register .  . . shall be \nconstructive notice of the registrant’s claim of ownership thereof.”).   \n59. On the facts pleaded here, however, none of the Plaintiffs claim to hold an \nownership interest in the Transferred Assets, and each has less incentive to discover \na transfer through public records searches than the interest-owning plaintiffs in the \ncases on which WWI relies.  As a result, the Court is not persuaded that a third-party \ncreditor who does not claim ownership  of, or an interest in , transferred assets, like \nthe Plaintiffs here,  should be held to the same demanding standard  as interest \n                                                      \ntransfer statute and concluding “the mere registration of the deed to the defendant \ncorporation cannot be said to  be sufficient to start the running of the statute of limitations \non plaintiff’s claim”); see also FDIC v. Mingo Tribal Pres. Tr. , No. 5:13 -CV-113, 2015 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 49777, at *17 (W.D.N.C. Apr. 14, 2015) (relying on Cowart to deny dismissal of \nNCUVTA claim arising out of a conveyance of property which served as guaranty on a loan).  \nowners.  See, e.g., KB Aircraft Acquisition, LLC , 249 N.C. App. at 89 , 790 S.E.2d at \n570 (noting that discrepancies in the defendant’s financial statements  were “enough \nto cause a reasonable person with an interest in the Property  to inquire further into \nits present status” (emphasis added)) ; see also, e.g. , Desak, 98 So.3d at 714 \n(distinguishing “between subsequent purchasers and creditors alleging fraudulent \ntransfers” and concluding that “[i]t is not reasonable to require a defrauded creditor \nto monitor the land records in all 67 counties or, indeed, outside the state, as well, as \na routine practice”).  As such, the Court concludes that WWI’s 2010 USPTO filings \nare not sufficient, standing alone, to put the Remaining Plaintiffs on notice of the \n2010 Transfer. \n60. Consequently, the Court cannot conclude on the pleaded facts that the 2010 \nTransfer could reasonably have been discovered by the Remaining Plaintiffs  as a \nmatter of law.  See Menotte, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 2315, at *12 (“The determination of \nwhen a particular triggering creditor could reasonably have discovered a fraudulent  \ntransfer is a factual issue that may require consideration of various evidence in \naddition to the recorded Transfer.   It is not appropriate for the Court to determine \nthis issue at the motion to dismiss stage.”).  Therefore, WWI’s Motion shall be denied \nto the extent WWI seeks dismissal of the Remaining Plaint iffs’ fraudulent transfer \nclaims under section 39-23.4(a)(1).  See Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 S.E.2d at 499 \n(“When the pleadings do not resolve all the factual issues, judgment on the pleadings \nis generally inappropriate.”).15 \n                                                      \n15  WWI vaguely suggests in a footnote to its reply brief in the St. Louis Action that Plaintiffs’ \nlicensing agreements with WWI put Plaintiffs on notice of the 2010 Transfer.  (WWI’s Reply \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n61. WHEREFORE, the Court, for the foregoing reasons, hereby ORDERS as \nfollows: \na. Defendant Window World International, LLC’s Motion for Judgment on \nthe Pleadings is hereby DENIED to the extent it seeks judgment as to \nthe Lomax and Roland Plaintiffs’ claim s under N.C. Gen. Stat. §  39-\n23.4(a)(1) and (a)(2); and \nb. Defendant Window World International, LLC’s Motion for Judgment on \nthe Pleadings is hereby DENIED to the extent it seeks judgment as to \nthe Remaining Plaintiffs’ claims under N.C. Gen.

Gen. Stat. §  39-23.4(a)(2) are hereby \ndismissed with prejudice.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 11th day of February, 2019. \n         \n    /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n    Louis A.

None of these agreements, however, were \nattached as exhibits to the pleadings or otherwise filed in connection with the Motion.  The \nCourt, therefore, does not consider any such agreements on  this Motion and concludes that \nWWI has failed to carry its burden on this argument.  See Ragsdale, 286 N.C. at 137, 209 \nS.E.2d at 499 (stating that a Rule 12(c) movant “is held to a strict standard and must show \nthat no material issue of facts exists and that he is clearly entitled to judgment”).
