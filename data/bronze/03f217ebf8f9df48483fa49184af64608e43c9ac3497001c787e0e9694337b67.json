CHARLES RICHARDSON and \nTRANSWORLD MED, LLC, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nFRANZ KELLAR; RED RAVEN, \nLLC; and TRANSWORLD MEDICAL \nDEVICES, LLC, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR \nPARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n \n1. For a decade, Plaintiff Dr. Charles Richardson and Defendant Franz Kellar \nhave been involved  in efforts, long since stalled,  to bring certain artificial heart \ntechnology to market through their jointly owned company, TransWorld Medical \nDevices, LLC (“TW Devices”) .  This litigation arises from  disputes between \nRichardson and Kellar regarding the management of TW Devices.  Defendants have \nmoved for partial summary judgment as to Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of TW Devices’ \nOperating Agreement and for a declaratory judgment.  For the reasons stated below, \nthe Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the motion.   \nNexsen Pruet, PLLC, by Kathleen D.B. Burchette and Paul A. Dominick, \nfor Plaintiffs.  \n \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. , by Thomas P. Holderness , for \nDefendants.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \n \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \n2. The Court does not make findings of fact in ruling on motions for summary \njudgment.  The following background, drawn from the evidence submitted in support \nof and opposition to Defendants’ motion, is intended to provide context for the Court’s \nanalysis and ruling.   \n3. In July 2007, Richardson and Kellar formed TW Devices .  (V. Compl.  ¶  9.)  \nTW Devices has two members: Plaintiff Transworld Med, LLC (Richardson’s personal \nentity) and Defendant Red Raven, LLC (Kellar’s personal entity).  (V. Compl. ¶¶ 2, 4, \n7, 8.)  Transworld Med and Red Raven each own a 50 percent interest in TW Devices.  \n(Third Aff. Holderness, Ex. 9 at Plfs_000277 [“Op. Agrmt.”], ECF No. 61.2.) \n4. TW Devices’ Operating Agreement, effective September 30, 2007, details the \nrights and obligations of the company’s members and managers.  (See Op. Agrmt. \n§ 4.1(a).)  “Except as otherwise expressly provided,” the Operating Agreement vests \n“full, exclusive and complete discretion to manage and control the business and \naffairs of the Company” in a Board of Managers (“Board”).  (Op. Agrmt. § 4.1(a).)  The \nBoard consists of two managers, neither of whom holds individual “authority to bind \nthe Company ” or to “take any action on behalf of the Company”  without the \nauthorization of the Board as a whole.  (Op. Agrmt. § 4.1(b).)   \n5. The Operating Agreement also provides for the appointment of officers.  (See \nOp. Agrmt. § 4.12(a)–(b).)  The officers may exercise “only such authority and perform \nsuch duties as the Board .  . . expressly delegate[s] to them.”  ( Op. Agrmt. § 4.12(a).)  \nIn the event an  officer is assigned a title “commonly used for officers” of North \n \n \nCarolina corporations, the assignment “shall constitute the delegation to such officer \nof the authority and duties that are customarily associated with such office.”  (Op. \nAgrmt. § 4.12(a).)  This aut hority, in turn, is expressly limited by a list of thirteen \nsignificant, enumerated actions that require Board approval (such as the sale of \nproperty worth more than $50,000).  (See Op. Agrmt. § 4.12(a)(i)–(xiii).) \n6. Richardson and Kellar, through their resp ective entities, appointed \nthemselves to serve as the company’s managers and members of the Board.  (Op. \nAgrmt. §§  4.1(b), 4.2 , 4.3(a); see also Op. Agrmt. at Plfs_000274 .)  The Operating \nAgreement named Richardson as Chairman of the Board and Kellar as President and \nChief Executive Officer.  (Op. Agrmt. §§ 4.5, 4.12(b).) \n7. In December 2007, TW Devices,  the Cleveland Clinic Foundation , and \nseveral smaller investors  formed Cleveland Heart, Inc.   (See Third Aff. Holderness \nEx. B [“Richardson Dep.”] at 35:23–36:23, ECF No. 63; Aff. Marshall ¶ 6, ECF No. 65; \nsee also Aff. Richardson ¶ ¶ 12–13, ECF No. 18.1 .)  The purpose of Cleveland Heart \nwas to develop “devices for patients suffering from irreversible end -stage heart \nfailure.”  (Aff. Kellar ¶ 7, ECF No. 24; see also Aff. Richardson ¶ 12 (“established to \ndevelop cardiac circulatory assist devices”).)  Cleveland Heart’s primary asset was a \ntechnology license from the Clinic and TW Devices.  (See Richardson Dep. 91:12–23; \nAff. Kellar Exs. A at ¶ 4(b), D at 2, U, ECF No. 25; Aff. Kellar ¶ 30.)   \n8. According to Kellar, by 2012, Cleveland Heart “ha[d] met several milestones \nin the development of its products but needed additional cash.”   (Aff. Kellar ¶ 9.)  In \nJuly 2012, Cleveland Heart agreed to sell $30 million of new s tock to Wizit Power \n \n \nHeart Health Consortium, Inc. (“Wizit”).  (Third Aff. Holderness Exs. 30, 33, ECF No. \n61.1.)  As a condition of purchasing the stock, Wizit requested  that Cleveland Heart \nappoint Richardson to be its CEO, President, and Chairman of the Board.  (Aff. Kellar \n¶ 10; Third Aff. Holderness Ex. 33 at 15, §  7.1(c).)  Wizit also received two seats on  \nCleveland Heart ’s board, displacing Kellar and another incumbent director .  \n(Compare Third Aff. Holderness Ex. 30 at § 7.1(b)–(d), with Third Aff. Holderness Ex. \n24 at § 7.1(b)–(c), ECF No. 61.1.)  After the sale to Wizit, TW Devices held a 42.37% \nstake in Cleveland Heart.  (Aff. Kellar, Ex. L at 3, ECF No. 25; Aff. Richardson ¶ 12.)  \n9. Around this time, Cleveland Heart’s product development stalled.  (See Aff. \nKellar ¶¶ 12, 29–30.)  Wizit delivered only $3 million of its promised investment.   \n(Second Aff. Kellar ¶  7, ECF No. 64; see also Third Aff. Holderness Ex. 30 .)  \nExacerbating matters, according to Kellar, Richardson became  increasingly \nunresponsive as an officer and director of Cleveland Heart, holding no shareholder \nmeetings and ignoring Kellar’s requests for information .  (See Aff. Kellar ¶¶ 13, 27; \nThird Aff. Holderness Exs. 88, 89, ECF No. 62.)  \n10. During 2013, Kellar began to explore whether he “was authorized to act on \nbehalf of [TW Devices] with respect to matters related to ” Cleveland Heart .  (Aff. \nMarshall ¶ 8; see also Second Aff. Dominick Ex. A [“Kellar Dep.”] at 33:8–10, ECF No. \n78.)  Kellar states that he reviewed the Operating Agreement and consulted  with \nHarrison Marshall, the attorney who drafted the Operating Agreement.  (See Second \nAff. Kellar ¶ 12; Aff. Marshall ¶¶ 6, 8.)   \n \n \n11. According to his affidavit, Marshall advised that  Kellar could take \nunilateral action.  I n his capacity as a manager,  Kellar’s hands were tied , but his \nauthority as President was “coextensive with the authority of a president of a North \nCarolina corporation” to act in the company’s “ordinary course of business.”   (Aff. \nMarshall ¶ 7, Ex. B at 2, ECF No. 65.)  Taking the view that TW Devices’ “only course \nof business” is “to manage its interest in Cleveland Heart,” (Aff. Marshall Ex. B at 2), \nMarshall concluded that the Operating Agreement provides Kellar with “sufficient \nauthority” to designate TW Devices’ Cleveland Heart board member and to vote its \nCleveland Heart stock.  (Aff. Marshall ¶ 8.)   \n12. In 2014 and 2015, Kellar began taking actions as TW Devices’ President and \nCEO and without the consent of its B oard.  Kellar  removed Richardson as TW \nDevices’ representative on Cleveland Heart ’s board and designated himself as \nRichardson’s replacement.  (See Third Aff. Holderness Ex. 54, ECF No. 62; Aff. Kellar \n¶ 28.)  He later voted TW Devices’ Cleveland Heart shares in support of resolutions \nto increase the size of the Cleveland Heart board from five to seven  and to appoint \nnew board members.  (See Third Aff. Holderness Ex. 121 at 2, Ex. A; Aff. Kellar ¶ 28.)  \nCleveland Heart’s new board officially notified Richardson of his removal as president \nand CEO on December 1, 2015.  (See Aff. Kellar Ex. T, ECF No. 25; Third Aff. \nHolderness Ex. 91, ECF No. 62.1.) \n13. Richardson objected to Kellar’s  unilateral actions.  ( Aff. Richardson ¶  19; \nSecond Aff. Richardson Ex. D, ECF No. 80.5.)  Until this time, TW Devices had voted \nits Cleveland Heart shares only upon agreement by Richardson and Kellar.  (Second \n \n \nAff. Richardson ¶ 6, ECF No. 80; Richardson Dep. 62:3–25; Kellar Dep. at 33:11–18.)  \nAccording to Richardson, Kellar lacked authority to act on behalf of TW Devices, and \nthe actions to r emove him as an officer and director of Cleveland Heart  and to \nrestructure Cleveland Heart ’s board were invalid as a result .  (See Third Aff. \nHolderness Ex. 33 at § 7.4(f); Third Aff. Holderness Ex. 121 at 3.)   \n14. Richardson filed this suit on March 24, 2016.  His complaint asserts causes \nof action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, dissolution of TW Devices, \nand declaratory judgment.   \n15. On June 17, 2016, Richardson moved for a preliminary injunction .  (ECF \nNo. 14.)  In that motion, Richardson sought  to prevent Kellar from voting , without \nRichardson’s consent, the shares of Cleveland Heart  owned by TW Devices .  The \nHonorable Gregory P. McGuire granted the motion on August 2, 2016.  (Order on Mot. \nfor Prelim. Inj. [“PI Order”], ECF No. 27.)  \n16. Defendants moved for summary judgment on June 9, 2017.  (Mot. for Part. \nSumm. J. [“Mot.”] , ECF No. 56.)  The motion is fully briefed, and the Court held a \nhearing on September 7, 2017, at which all parties were represented by counsel.  The \nmotion is ripe for determination. \nII. \nDISCUSSION  \n \n17. Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of \ncontract, stated against Kellar and Red Raven, and declaratory judgment, stated \nagainst all Defendants.  ( See Mot. 1 –2.)  Although Defendants also moved for \n \n \nsummary judgment on Plaintiffs’ claim for  breach of fiduciary duty, Plaintif fs have \nsince dismissed that claim with prejudice.  (See ECF No. 82.) \nA. Legal Standard \n18. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In deciding a motion for summary \njudgment, the Court views the evidence  “in the light m ost favorable to the \nnonmov[ant],” taking the non -movant’s evidence as true and drawing inferences in \nits favor.  Furr v. K-Mart Corp., 142 N.C. App. 325, 327, 543 S.E.2d 166, 168 (2001).  \n19. The moving party “bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of \na genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, \n579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002) .  If the moving party carries this burden, t he \nresponding party “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings,” \nKhashman v. Khashman , 2017 N.C. App. LEXIS 715, at *15 (Sept. 5, 2017)  \n(unpublished), but must instead “come forward with specific facts establishing the \npresence of a genuine factual dispute for trial,” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 356 N.C. at 579, \n573 S.E.2d at 124.  A “genuine issue” exists when “‘it is supported by substantial \nevidence,’ which is that amount of relevant evidence necessary to persuade a \nreasonable mind to accept a conclusion.”  Id. at 579, 573 S.E.2d at 124 (quoting DeWitt \nv. Eveready Battery Co. , 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002) ) (internal \ncitation omitted).   \n \n \nB. Breach of Contract \n20. A party establishes that a breach of contract has occurred when (1) a  valid \ncontract exists and (2) a term of the contract is breached.  See Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. \nApp. 19, 26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000).  Here, the relevant contract is TW Devices’ \nOperating Agreement.  See N.C. State Bar v. Merrell , 777 S.E.2d 103, 114 (N. C. Ct. \nApp. 2015) (“An [LLC] operating agreement is a contract.”).  It is undisputed that the \nOperating Agreement is a valid contract, but the parties dispute whether any term \nwas breached. \n21. The parties’ briefing largely reprises the arguments made in support of and \nin opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs contend that \nDefendants breached the Operating Agreement by unilaterally voting TW Devices’ \nshares of Cleveland Heart.  ( See Pls.’ Response in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. [ “Opp’n”] 8, \nECF No. 72 .)  Defendants respond that Kellar, in his capacity as TW Devices’ \nPresident, was authorized to vote the shares.  (See Br. in Supp. of Defs.’ Mot. [ “Br.”] \n9–12, ECF No. 58.)  \n22. At the hearing, Defendants raised two new arguments:  first, that Kellar is \nnot a party to the Operating Agreement and, second, that any breach by Kellar does \nnot also constitute a breach  by Red Raven .  With the Court’s permission, Plaintiffs \nfiled a supplemental brief.  (ECF Nos. 92, 93.)   The Court addresses these threshold \narguments first. \n \n \n1.  Arguments Raised at the Hearing \n23. Defendants contend that Kellar is not a party to the Operating Agreement.  \nIf so, Kellar would be entitled to summary judgment.  When a defendant is “not a \nparty to the contract,” then “as a matter of law he cannot be held liable for any breach \nthat may have occurred.”  Canady v. Mann, 107 N.C. App. 252, 259, 419 S.E.2d 597, \n601 (1992). \n24. According to section 4.2  of the Operating Agre ement, however, “any \nManager” who “is not a Member . . . must execute a copy of this Agreement agreeing \nto become bound by the provisions hereof.”  Kellar, who  is not a member of TW \nDevices, signed the Operating Agreement in his capacity as a manager.  ( See Op. \nAgrmt. at Plfs_000272, Plfs_000276; see also Pls.’ Suppl. Br. 2, ECF No. 93.)  Kellar \ntherefore appears to be “bound by the provisions” of  the Operating Agreement,  as \nrequired by section 4.2.  At a minimum, a jury could reasonably reach that conclusion.  \nTherefore, Kellar is not entitled to summary judgment on this ground. \n25. Defendants also argue that there is no evidence of a breach by Red Raven.  \nThe Court agrees.  Plaintiffs ’ claim for breach of contract is based solely on Kellar’s  \nactions in voting the Cleveland Heart shares.  The undisputed evidence shows that \nKellar purported to vote the shares in his capacity as President or CEO of TW Devices \nand not on behalf of Red Raven.  (See Third Aff. Holderness Ex. 121 at 4, Ex. C; Third \nAff. Holderness Ex.  130 at CCF000414 ; see also Second Aff. Kellar ¶¶ 12, 14; Aff.  \nMarshall ¶ 8.)  Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs , there is \nno genuine issue of material fact as to whether Red Raven breached the Operating \n \n \nAgreement.  The Court therefore grants summary judgment in favor of Red Raven on \nthe claim for breach of contract. \n2.  Kellar’s Authority Under the Operating Agreement \n26. The next issue concerns Kellar’s argument  that he did not breach  the \nOperating Agreement because he “had the authority  to vote” TW Devices’ shares in \nCleveland Heart in his capacity as “President and Chief Executive Officer.”  (Br. 10.)  \nThe parties agree that, under  section 4.12(a) of t he Operating Agreement , TW \nDevices’ officers have “the authority and duties that are customarily associated with \nsuch office.”  In North Carolina, a corporation’s president has the customary authority \nto “act for it in matters that are within the corporation’s ordinary course of business \nor incidental to it .”  First Union Nat’l Bank v. Brown , 166 N.C. App. 519, 528, 603 \nS.E.2d 808, 815  (2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted) .  Accordingly, the \nrelevant question is whether voting the Cleveland Heart shares is within TW Devices’ \n“ordinary course of business or incidental to it.”  Id. \n27. Kellar contends that  it is.  In his view,  TW Devices’ “only business” is to \nserve as a holding company for the Cleveland Heart  shares, such that  voting the \nshares is incidental to the company’s ordinary business.  (Br. 11 (emphasis omitted).)  \nIn support, Kellar offers evidence suggesting that the parties formed TW Devices for \nthe purpose of creating Cleveland Heart.  (See Richardson Dep. 35:23–36:23; Second \nAff. Kellar ¶ 4; Aff. Marshall ¶ 6.) \n28. Plaintiffs respond that “TW Devices’ ordinary business clearly does not \ninclude unilaterally voting TW Devices’ interest in a related company or altering an \n \n \naffiliated company’s governance.”  (Opp’n 10–11.)  They point to evidence showing \nthat TW Devices’ business purpose related to the development of artificial heart \ntechnology, not simply to serve as a holding company for a minority interest in \nCleveland Heart.  ( See Op. Agrmt. at Plfs_000273 ¶  1.)  Plaintiffs further contend \nthat Defendants’ argument conflicts with TW Devices’ “organizational construct,” \nwhich places “full, exclusive, and complete” authority in the company’s managers \nwhile expressly restricting the authority of its officers .  (Opp’n 11 –12 (citing O p. \nAgrmt. §§ 4.1, 4.7).)  \n29. These arguments echo the preliminary -injunction briefing, and all were \nthoroughly addressed by Judge McGuire in the order granting Plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary injunction.  Judge McGuire found the evidence that TW Devices “was \nformed and is operated  solely as a holding company”  to be “insufficient” and \n“inconsistent.”  (PI Order 12 –15.)  He concluded that Plaintiffs had succeeded in \nestablishing “a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim for br each of the \nOperating Agreement.”  (PI Order 14.)  \n30. Judge McGuire’s ruling, while not binding on the Court at this stage of the \nproceeding, is  nonetheless highly relevant.  In opposing  summary judgment, \nPlaintiffs need not demonstrate a likelihood of success.  T hey need only offer “more \nthan a scintilla of evidence” that Kellar was not authorized to vote the shares.  DeWitt, \n355 N.C. at 681, 565 S.E.2d at 146.  The evidence presented by Plaintiffs, which was \nalso presented to and considered by Judge McGuire, meets that minimal threshold.   \n \n \n31. Among other things, the Operating Agreement  includes a statement of \npurpose identifying TW Devices’ business as  “the conception, design, production, \nsales and promotion of [certain] mechanical heart assist devices .”  (Op. Agrmt. at \nPlfs_000273 ¶ 1.)  Some evidence also suggests that TW Devices, which was formed \nbefore Cleveland Heart, holds intellectual property assets and has had other business \nactivities apart from holding the Cleveland Heart shares.  (Third Aff. Holderness Exs. \n24 at 2, 33 at 2; Richardson Dep. 91:12 –23; Aff. Kellar Ex. A at ¶¶  1(c), 4(b); Aff. \nKellar Ex. U.)  In addition, prior to Kellar’s unilateral actions, Richardson and Kellar \nhad a  history of voting the shares by consent .  (Second Aff. Richardson ¶  6; \nRichardson Dep. 62 :3–25; Kellar Dep. 33:11 –18.)  From this evidence, a jury could \nreasonably conclude that TW Devices was not formed merely to hold shares in \nCleveland Heart and that voting those shares is not incidental to the company’s \nordinary course of business. \n32. To the extent Kellar has introduced new evidence that was not part of the \npreliminary-injunction record, it deepens the parties’ factual dispute but does not \nwarrant summary judgment.  For example, Kellar contends that Richardson, in his \ndeposition, “admitted that [TW Devices] did business only through” Cleveland Heart.  \n(Br. 1 n.2 ; see also  Br. 11 ; Richardson Dep., 36:23 –37:7, 93 :8–13.)  But a s Judge \nMcGuire cogently explained, the fact that “activities may have been undertaken by \nRichardson and Kellar in their roles as officers of” Cleveland Heart “does not preclude \nsuch activities from also being on behalf of TW Devices’ business.”  (PI Order 13.) \n \n \n33. At bottom, this dispute presents a jury question.  The Operating Agreement \ndoes not expressly delegate au thority to Kellar to vote the Cleveland Heart shares \nwithout Board approval.  Plaintiffs have offered sufficient evidence to create a  \ngenuine issue of material fact  as to whether doing so was incidental to TW Devices’ \nordinary business and, therefore, whet her Kellar was implicitly authorized to vote \nthe shares in his capacity as President.  Kellar is not entitled to summary judgment \non this basis. \n3.  Kellar’s Additional Arguments \n34. Kellar makes three additional arguments  that summary judgment is \nappropriate even if he was not authorized to unilaterally vote the Cleveland Heart \nshares as TW Devices’ President.   \n35. First, Kellar contends that  no provision in the “Operating Agreement \naffirmatively prohibit[s] Kellar as an officer from voting the shares.”  (Br. 12.)  Thus, \nin Kellar’s view , even assuming he acted outside the scope of his authority as an \nofficer, his actions would be void or voidable but would not be a breach of the \nOperating Agreement.  (Br. 12–13.)  The Court disagrees.  Kellar’s alleged overreach, \nif proven, impinged on the Board’s “full, exclusive, and complete” authority to control \nthe business of the Company.  ( See Op. Agrmt. § 4.1(a).)  A jury could reasonably \nconclude that Kellar , acting outside his authority as an officer, breached the \nprovisions requiring joint governance by the company’s managers.  (See Br. 10 \n(acknowledging that the “Operating Agreement prohibits a manager from taking any \naction on behalf of [TW Devices] without the approval of the other manager”).)   \n \n \n36. Next, Kellar argues that section 4.13(b) of the Operating Agreement shields \nhim from liability.  Section 4.13(b) “fully protect[s]” a manager who “rel[ies] in good \nfaith upon” information or opinions “presented to the Company” by a professional in \nhis professional capacity.   Kellar contends he acted  in reliance on the advice of \nMarshall, the attorney who draf ted the Operating Agreement and served as TW \nDevices’ counsel.  Plaintiffs observe that Marshall has also  represented Kellar \npersonally (see Opp’n 19), and Marshall’s affidavit does not say in what capacity he \nadvised Kellar, (Aff. Marshall ¶¶ 6–7; see also Aff. Marshall Ex. A (“our firm is counsel \nto Red Raven LLC”) ).  As a result , there is a question of fact regarding whether \nMarshall “presented” the relevant advice “to the Company ,” as required by section \n4.13(b).  (Op. Agrmt. § 4.13(b); see also Second Aff. Richardson ¶ 7.)   \n37. Finally, Kellar cites N.C. Gen. Stat. §  57D-2-32(b), which states that  a \n“person who is a party to or bound by” an LLC’s operating agreement cannot be “liable \nto . . . another person who is a party to the operating agreement” based on actions \ntaken in “reliance on the provisions of the operating agreement.”  Although the \nparties dispute whether section 57D -2-32(b) requires reasonable or good -faith \nreliance, or only actual reliance ( see Reply 8, ECF No. 83), the Court need not reach \nthat question because this statute applies only “[u]nless otherwise provided in the \noperating agreement.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  57D-2-32(b).  Here, the Operating \nAgreement includes detailed provisions regarding limitations of liability for \nmanagers and officers.  (See Op. Agrmt. § 4.13(a)–(b).)  Accordingly, Kellar must rely, \nif at all, on the terms provided in the Operating Agreement. \n \n \nC. Declaratory Judgment \n38. Plaintiffs’ declaratory-judgment claim requests three declarations:  that \nRichardson has authority to vote the Cleveland Heart stock, that Defendants do not \nhave the authority to vote the stock, and that any prior votes of the stock, made \nwithout Richardson’s approval and consent, are null and void.  (See V. Compl.  ¶¶ 32–\n34.)  As Defendants point out, Richardson testified at his deposition that any vote  of \nthe Cleveland Heart stock required a “meeting of the minds” between Richardson and \nKellar.  (Br. 20 (citing Richardson Dep. at 62); see also Second Aff. Richardson ¶  5 \n(“[N]either Defendant [Kellar] nor me had the right to vote the CHI shares owned by \nTW Devices without being in agreement on the vote.”).)  Accordingly, the undisputed \nevidence shows  that Richardson does not possess  unilateral authority to  vote the \nCleveland Heart stock, and he is not entitled to a declaration to that effect.   \n39. Plaintiffs’ remaining requests for declaratory relief depend on whether \nKellar wa s authorized to vote the shares  in his capacity as President.  Having \nconcluded that this factual dispute presents a jury question as to the claim for breach \nof contract, the Court also denies Kellar’s motion for summary judgment as to the \ndeclaratory-judgment claim for the same reasons. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n \n40. For these reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment as to Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract against Red Raven and as to \nPlaintiffs’ claim for a declaration that Richardson holds unilateral authority to vote \n \n \nTW Devices’ Cleveland Heart shares.  In all other respects , Defendants’ motion is \nDENIED. \n \nThis the 27th day of November, 2017. \n /s/ Adam M. Conrad   \nAdam M.
