Scott, for Defendant Hallmark Specialty \nInsurance Company. \n \nDavis, Judge. \nINTRODUCTION \n1. A fire at a chicken processing plant has caused a dispute over insurance \nproceeds that has left millions of dollars hanging in the balance .  After the fire, the \npurchaser of the plant received an assignment from the original owner of its right to \ncollect insurance proceeds under various insurance policies taken out by the original \nowner.  Consent to the assignment was obtained from the insurer that had issued an \ninsurance policy providing primary coverage for the plant.  No consent was obtained, \nhowever, from any of the insurers that had issued excess insurance policies covering \nthe plant .  The question of whether the purchaser is entitled to sue the se excess \ninsurers in an effort to make them  “pay up” despite the lack of prior consent to the \n \n \nassignment is the primary issue before the Court.   In analyzing this question , the \nCourt must wade through a complex web of insurance polic y provisions and legal \nissues.  \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n2. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and instead recites those \nfacts contained in the complaint (and in documents attached , referred to , or \nincorporated by reference  in the complaint ) that are relevant to the Court’s \ndetermination of the motion.  See, e.g., Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs Grp., Inc., 79 \nN.C. App. 678, 681 (1986); Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, \nInc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 12, 2017). \n3. On December 14, 2017,  a fire caused substantial damage to a chicken \nprocessing facility located in Mocksville, North Carolina.  (Complaint, ECF No. 3, at \n¶ 2.)  At the time of the fire, t he facility was owned by House of Raeford Farms, Inc. \n(“Raeford”), but Plaintiff Brakebush Brothers, Inc. (“Brakebush”) “was in the process \nof purchasing the [facility] from Raeford when the fire occurred.”  (Id.)  \n4. As of the date of the fire, Raeford had obtained two layers of commercial \nproperty insurance coverage for the facility: (1) a primary insurance policy issued by \n“Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London  and various syndicates subscribing to \nthat policy” with a limit of $20,000,000 (“the Primary Policy”) ; and (2) eight e xcess \n \n \ninsurance policies that provided, in total, limits of $30,000,000 in “excess of the $20 \nmillion primary policy limits.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 30–31.)1  \n5. The insurers who issued the Excess Policies are the named Defendants \nin this action : Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London –  Novae 2007 Syndicate \nSubscribing to Policy With Number 93PRX17F157 ( “Novae”), Hallmark Specialty \nInsurance Co. ( “Hallmark”), Evanston Insurance Co.  (“Evanston”), Maxum \nIndemnity Co. (“Maxum” ), Hudson Specialty Insurance Co.  (“Hudson”), Liberty \nSurplus Insurance Corporation (“Liberty ”), Ironshore Specialty  Insurance Co. \n(“Ironshore”), and Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London –  Brit Syndicate 2987 \nSubscribing to Policy With Number PD-10972-00 (“Brit”).  (Id. at ¶ 31.)2 \n6. Brakebush and Raeford executed an Asset Purchase Agreement \n(“A.P.A”) on July 3, 2018.  ( Id. at ¶ 28.)  As a part of the transaction , Brakebush \n“secur[ed] the assignment of Raeford’s right  to all insurance benefits, including all \nrights and proceeds under its property insurance policies relating to the loss ” \nresulting from the fire .  (Id. at ¶ 2.)  Approximately five days before the A.P.A. was \nexecuted, the insurers who had issued the Primary Policy gave written consent to this \nassignment.  (Id. at ¶ 29.)3   \n \n1 Throughout this opinion, these eight policies are at times referred to collectively as the \n“Excess Policies.” \n \n2 Defendants are referred to collectively throughout this opinion as the “Excess Insurers.” \n \n3 As discussed later in this opinion, however, it appears that the Primary Policy did not, in \nfact, actually require the consent of the insurers to the assignment of the proceeds under that \npolicy.  (Primary Policy, ECF No. 84.1.) \n \n \n7. Neither Brakebush nor Raeford, however, obtained consent from any of \nthe Excess Insurers prior to the assignment to Brakebush of Raeford’s right to collect \ninsurance proceeds under these policies.  (Id.) \n8. On February 3 , 2020, Brakebush submitted a report to Crawford  and \nCompany, a claims management company hired by one or more of the insurers , \nclaiming that the overall fire damage loss to the insured property totaled $41,274,429.  \n(Id. at ¶ 32, 34.)  As Raeford had already received $ 4,241,277.18 under the Primary \nPolicy prior to the sale , Brakebush asserted that it was entitled to the remaining \n$15,758,722.82 of the policy limits under the Primary Policy “for amounts it incurred \nafter the sale was completed.”  (Id. at ¶ 35.)  On or about April 29, 2020, Brakebush \nreceived a final payment exhausting the  $20 million in coverage under the Primary \nPolicy.  (Id. at ¶ 35.)  Brakebush then contacted counsel for the Excess Insurers and \ndemanded payment of insurance proceeds in the amount of $25,515,706.31 , a figure \nthat consisted of the total alleged loss minus  the $15,758,722.82 that had already \nbeen paid to Brakebush under the Primary Policy.  (Id. at ¶ 34–36.) \n9. The Excess Insurers expressed an unwillingness to pay the full amount \ndemanded by  Brakebush, instead offer ing only  a combine d $4,221,465.83, a \nsubstantially smaller amount than Brakebush’s demand.  (Id. at ¶ 37.)  The Excess \nInsurers initially took the position that  they would make th is payment only if \nBrakebush agreed that said payment  constituted “full and final payment for all \ncovered damages.”  (Id.)  In addition, the Excess Insurers required that Brakebush \nexecute proof of l oss forms with each insurer.  (Nuss Aff. Ex. 1 , ECF No. 52.)  The \n \n \nproof of loss forms were signed by Brakebush’s representative above the line entitled \n“Insured’s Assignee.”  (Id.) \n10. Since May 1, 2020, Brakebush has repeatedly requested that the Excess \nInsurers explain why they refused to pay the remaining $21 million that Brakebush \nhad demanded.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 39.)  At some point,  the Excess Insurers provided \nBrakebush with “Claim Work Papers ,” which Brakebush alleges “showed that the \nExcess Insurers owed at least $5,782,089.14 to Brakebush.”  (Id. at ¶ 39–41.)   \n11. Counsel for the Excess Insurers sent Brakebush’s counsel a letter on \nJune 18, 2020 stating , among other things, that the Excess Insurers  “reserve all \nrights to deny or limit coverage pursuant to the relevant policy language regarding \nan assignment of right s under the subject policy.”   ( June 18, 2020 Letter, ECF No. \n44.6.) \n12. On July 1, 2020, Brakebush notified the Excess Insurers  of additional \nlosses and expenses from the fire totaling $2,206,532.84, increasing its total demand \nto $27,722,239.15.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 44–45.) \n13. The Excess Insurers ultimately agreed to pay $4 ,221,465.83 to \nBrakebush without requiring Brakebush to agree that  this payment constituted a \n“full and final payment,” thereby allowing Brakebush to continue pursuing the total \namount it sought under the Excess Policies for the fire damage.  (Id. at ¶ 40.) \n14. On October 8, 2020, Brakebush filed a complaint initiating this action \nin Superior Court, Davie County , against the Excess Insurers.  In its Complaint, \nBrakebush asserted a claim for a declaratory judgment regarding the obligations of \n \n \nthe Excess Insurers along with claims for  breach of contract, bad faith, and unfair \nand deceptive trade practices (UDTP).  (Id. at ¶¶ 47–79.)  This case was designated a \nmandatory complex business case on December 2, 2020  and assigned to the \nHonorable Gregory P. McGuire.  (ECF Nos. 1, 2.)  \n15. On January 6, 2021, Defendants filed a Joint Motion to Dismiss  or \nStrike in which they sought the dismissal of the claims asserted by Brakebush on \nvarious grounds and that  one of the claims be stricken .  (ECF No. 42.)   After \nDefendants filed their reply brief in support of the Joint Motion to Dismiss or Strike, \nBrakebush moved to strike portions of the Defendants’ reply brief on March 8, 2021.  \n(ECF No. 60 .)  A hearing on Defendants’ Joint Motion to Dismiss or Strike and \nPlaintiff’s Motion to Strike was held on April 15, 2021 but a decision on the motions \nwas not rendered. \n16. On July 1, 2021, this matter was reassigned to the undersigned .  (ECF \nNo. 79.) \n17. At the Court’s direction, the parties submitted supplemental briefs  on \nAugust 26, 2021  as to certain specified issues .  The parties were offered the \nopportunity for a new hearing before t he undersigned, but the parties declined the \noffer based on the undersigned’s ability to review a complete transcript of the April \n15, 2021 hearing.  The motions are now ripe for resolution. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n18. The arguments asserted by the parties  in the various motions pending \nbefore the Court are based on several distinct provisions of the North Carolina Rules \n \n \nof Civil Procedure.  The Excess Insurers have moved to dismiss each claim contained \nin the Complaint unde r Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  on the \ntheory that Brakebush does not possess standing to bring any of the claims it has \nasserted against them.  The Excess Insurers also seek dismissal of all claims under \nRule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a valid claim for relief.  Finally, the Excess Insurers \nhave moved to strike the declaratory judgment claim  asserted by Brakebush \npursuant to Rule 12(f)  on the ground that it is redundant .  Brakebush, in turn, has \nmoved to strike portions of the Excess Insurers’ reply brief in support of their Joint \nMotion to D ismiss or Strike on the ground that portions of the brief improperly \ncontain new arguments not set out in the Excess Insurers’ origina l brief.  Each of \nthese respective provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure has its own standard of \nreview.  \n19. “A plaintiff ’s standing to assert its claims may be challenged under \neither Rule 12(b)(1) or Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. ”  \nRaja v. Patel, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 25, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 23, 2017).  A Rule \n12(b)(1) motion challenges a court ’s “jurisdiction over the subject matter ” of the \nplaintiff’s claims.   N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).   “Subject matter jurisdiction is the \nindispensable foundation upon which valid judicial decisions rest ,” In re T.R.P., 360 \nN.C. 588, 590 (2006), and “has been defined as ‘the power to hear and to determine a \nlegal controversy; to inquire into the facts, apply the law, and to render and enforce \na judgment,’ ” High v. Pearce, 220 N.C. 266, 271 (1941).  “[T]he proceedings of a court \n \n \nwithout jurisdiction of the subject matter are a nullity. ”  Burgess v. Gibbs, 262 N.C. \n462, 465 (1964) (citation omitted).   \n20. “As the party invokin g jurisdiction, plaintiff[] ha[s] the burden of \nestablishing standing.”  Queen’s Gap Cmty. Ass’ n v. McNamee,  2011 NCBC LEXIS \n37, at * *3 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 23, 2011 ).  In determining the existence of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, the Court may consider matters outside the pleadings.  Emory v. \nJackson Chapel First Missionary Baptist Church , 165 N.C. App. 489, 491 (2004).  \nHowever, “if the trial court confines its evaluation [of standing] to the pleadings, the \ncourt must accept as true the [claimant]’s allegations and construe them in the light \nmost favorable to the [claimant]. ”  Munger v. State, 202 N.C. App. 404, 410 (2010) \n(quoting DOT v. Blue, 147 N.C. App. 596, 603 (2001)).  \n21. “It is well-established that dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper \nwhen ‘(1) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff ’s claim; \n(2) the complaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good \nclaim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’ s \nclaim.’ ”  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoting Wood \nv. Guilford Cty. , 355 N.C. 161, 166 (2002)).   The Court may also “ reject allegations \nthat a re contradicted by the documents attached, specifically referred to, or \nincorporated by reference in the complaint. ”  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, \n577 (2009).   \n22. Rule 12(f) permits a judge, upon motion or sua sponte, to “strik[e] from \nany pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, \n \n \nimpertinent, or scandalous matter.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(f).  The purpose of this rule is \nto “avoid expenditure of time and resources before trial by removing spurious issues, \nwhether introduced by original or amended complaint. ”  Estrada v. Jaques, 70 N.C. \nApp. 627, 642 (1984).  A motion to strike is addressed to the sound discretion of the \ntrial court.  Broughton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., 161 N.C. App. 20, 25 (2003).  \nANALYSIS \nA. Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) Motion \n23. The most significant bone of contention between the parties concerns \nthe Excess Insurers ’ challenge to Brakebush’s standing to seek coverage under the \nExcess Policies.   The Excess Insurers argue that each policy contains a provision \nrequiring the consent of the insurer before a policyholder (such as Raeford) may \nvalidly assign its right to collect proceeds under the policy  to a third party (such as \nBrakebush) and that no  such consent was ever obtained  in the present case .  The \nExcess Insurers further contend  that an assignee of insurance proceeds lacks  \nstanding to sue for bad faith or unfair and deceptive trade practices because the \nassignee is a “stranger” to the insurance contract. \n24. In response, Brakebush  asserts that (1) North Carolina law does not \nallow for the enforcement of anti -assignment clauses in an insurance policy  with \nregard to the  post-loss assignment of proceeds; (2) even if such anti-assignment \nclauses are enforceable as a general proposition, none of the Excess Policies actually \ncontain language that serve to prohibit the post -loss assignment of insurance \nproceeds without the co nsent of the insurer ; and ( 3) even if otherwise enforceable \n \n \nanti-assignment language was contained in the policies, the Excess Insurers waived \ntheir right to rely on such language by paying Brakebush $4,221,465.83 and by \nproviding proof of loss forms that referred to Brakebush as the “Insured’s Assignee.”   \n1. Standing for Declaratory Judgment and Breach of Contract \nClaims \n \na. Threshold Arguments \n \n25. “[S]tanding to seek a declaration as to the extent of coverage under an \ninsurance policy requires that the party seeking relief have an enforceable \ncontractual right under the insurance agreement.”  DeMent v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. \nCo., 142 N.C. App. 598, 601 (2001).  As a general proposition, “ [t]he right to receive \nmoney due or to become due under an existing contract may be assigned.  An assignee \nof a contractual right is a real party in interest and may maintain the action.”  Gr&S \nAtl. Beach, LLC v. Hull, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 35, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 26, 2013) \n(citations omitted).  Thus, Brakebush must establish that it was properly assigned \nthe right by Raeford to collect the proceeds under each of the Excess Policies in order \nto establish standing for its declaratory judgment and breach of contract claims. \n26. The parties have each raised two threshold issues relating to standing.  \nThe Court deems it appropriate to address these issues at the outset. \ni. Brakebush’s Threshold Arguments \n27. First, Brakebush argues that it is irrelevant whether the Excess Policies \ncontain provisions purporting to prohibit the assignment of post -loss insurance \nproceeds because such clauses are unenforceable under North Carolina law  as a \nmatter of public policy.  Brakebush argues that our Court of Appeals’ decision in First-\n \n \nCitizens Bank and Trust Co. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. , 113 N.C. App. 792 \n(1994), establishes that the validity of a post -loss assignment of proceeds can never \nbe restricted by the language of an insurance policy.  The Excess Insurers , in turn, \ncite Terrell v. Lawyers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., 131 N.C. App. 655 (1998), a later decision \nfrom the Court of Appeals, for the proposition that North Carolina courts do, in fact, \nenforce such provisions.   \n28. In First-Citizens Bank, an automotive dealership and a bank entered \ninto a contract in which the dealership assigned “ ‘all rights, title, and interest (both \nlegal and equitable)’ in [ the dealership’s] insurance policy” in order for the bank to \nreceive the proceeds of a policy insuring a car belonging to the bank that was stolen  \nwhile on the dealership’s premises.   First -Citizens Bank, 113 N.C. App. at  792–95.  \nThe policy contained the following statement: “ASSIGNMENT –  No assignment of \ninterest will affect this Policy unless WE  [defendant] change the policy.”  Id. at 796.  \nThe policy also contained the following clause:  \nChanges- The only way this policy can be changed is OUR \nissuing an endorsement(s) or substituting the declarations.  \nThey must be signed by one of OUR representatives when \nrequired by law.  Nothing else will change this policy, \nwaive any of its terms, or stop U.S. [sic] from asserting any \nof OUR rights, not even notice to or knowledge learned by \none of OUR representatives.  If WE change any of the terms \nof this policy, which broadens or extends the coverage, this \npolicy will automatically be broadened or extended as if it \nwere actually endorsed, if the change (a) was approved by \nYOUR state insurance regulatory authority, during the \npolicy period or 45 days before the policy became effective; \nand (b) is available to YOU without additional premiums.  \n \nId. at 796. \n \n \n29. The Court of Appeals rejected the defendant’s argument that the \nattempted assignment was invalid based on the above- quoted language  from the \npolicy.  The Court of Appeals explained its reasoning as follows: \n[W]e conclude that the assignment of the mere right to \npayment after loss in no way broadened the scope of the \ncoverage of insurable risks provided by defendant ’s policy.  \nWe particularly note that this policy did not expressly \nprohibit assignments: rather, our disposition here turns on \nthe express words chosen by the defendant-insurer in this \npolicy.  We note further that most of the cases from other \njurisdictions regard such express prohibitions as generally \nineffective when applied to assignments which occur after \nthe loss has been incurred[.]4  \n \nId. (internal citations omitted).   \n \n30. In Terrell, an attorney subject to a potential malpractice claim “assigned \nany rights he had against [the defendant insurer] under the policy or under tort law” \nto the malpractice claimant.  Terrell , 131 N.C. App. at 656– 57.  The malpractice \nclaimant sued the attorney’s insurer, “alleging that, as [the attorney’s] assignee, she \nwas entitled to recover aga inst [the insurer] for [its] alleged breach of contract with \n[the attorney] or any tort rights that [the attorney] had against [the insurer].”  Id. at \n657. \n31. The Court of Appeals concluded that the plaintiff’s attempt to hold the \ninsurer liable on a contractual theory was defective  because of anti -assignment \n \n4 “In most jurisdictions, courts have held that an anti -assignment clause ordinarily will not \napply to a post-loss assignment under a first-party insurance policy. . . . Although widely held \nand applied, this rule is not universal.”  3 N EW APPLEMAN ON INSURANCE LAW LIBRARY \nEDITION § 16.05 (2021). \n  \n \n \nlanguage in the policy.  Id. at 660.  The Court of Appeals explained the basis for its \ndecision as follows: \nViewing the facts and permissible inferences under Rule \n12(c) in the light most favorabl e to plaintiff and taking \nplaintiff’s factual allegations as true, plaintiff ’s claims \nagainst defendant arising out of contract are barred \nbecause any rights of [the attorney] under the policy cannot \nbe assigned.  The insurance policy in the instant action  \nstates, “The interest of any Insured in this policy is not \nassignable.”  Under the terms of the policy, [the attorney’s] \ninterest in the policy and any coverage or benefits that \notherwise might exist are not assignable. \n \nId.  \n \n32. Based on a careful review of  applicable case law , the Court concludes \nthat insurance policy provisions prohibiting or restricting post -loss assignments are \nenforceable under North Carolina law.  Brakebush’s reliance on First-Citizens Bank \nis misplaced as the decision in that case was based on an interpretation of the specific \nlanguage used in the insurance policy at issue.   The Court does not interpret  First-\nCitizens Bank  as standing for the broad proposition that such clauses are per se \nunenforceable as applied to a post -loss assignment of proceeds .  Any statements \ncontained in First-Citizens Bank  about the public policy implications of anti-\nassignment clauses are merely dicta.  Any such anti-assignment clauses are therefore \nto be construed based on the actual language contained in the insurance policy.  See \nCapital City Ins. Co.  v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co. , 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154221, at *6– 7 \n(E.D.N.C. June 15, 2009) (“Here, as in Terrell, the Policy spells out in certain terms \nthe limitations on assignment of an insured’s interests under the Policy: the rights of \n \n \nthe insured are not assignable without [the insurer’s] written consent.”).  Accordingly, \nBrakebush’s first threshold argument fails.  \n33. The second threshold argument advanced by Brakebush is that the \nExcess Insurers waived any anti -assignment provisions in the Excess Policies when \nthey paid $4, 221,465.83 to  Brakebush prior to the initiation of this litigation  and \nprovided proof of loss forms that contained a line for Brakebush to sign as “Insured’s \nAssignee.”  In response, the Excess Insurers deny that any such waiver occurred and \ncontend that the payments were made under a clear reservation of rights that \nspecifically preserved their right to challenge the validity of the assignment under \nthe Excess Policies.  \n34. “A waiver is a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known \nright or benefit. ”  Adder v. Holman & Moody, Inc. , 288 N.C. 484, 492 (1975).  Our \nappellate courts have held that a party’s conduct  may under certain circumstances \ngive rise to a legal waiver.  See, e.g., Son-Shine Grading, Inc. v. ADC Constr. Co., 68 \nN.C. App. 417 , 422 (1984) (citations omitted) (“The provisions of a contract  may be \nmodified or waived by . . . conduct which naturally and justly leads the other party to \nbelieve the provisions of the contract have been modified or waived, even though the \ninstrument involved provides that only written modifications shall be binding.”), disc. \nreview denied, 312 N.C. 85 (1984). \n35. In this case, the Excess Insurers issued their payment  to Brakebush \npursuant to an express reservation of rights.  In a letter to Brakebush’s counsel dated \nJune 18, 2020, counsel for the Excess Insurers stated that “ [t]he Insurers have and \n \n \ncontinue to reserve all rights under the relevant policy language regarding an \nassignment of rights under the subject Policies.”  (ECF No. 44.6.)   \n36. Courts in other jurisdictions have  held that when an insurer issues a \npayment subject to a reservation of rights, the insurer ha s not waived its right to \nsubsequently deny coverage.  See, e.g., Polizzi Meats v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co , 931 F. \nSupp. 328, 337 (D.N.J. 1996) (“There has been no waiver in this case.  [ The insurer] \nexpressly reserved its rights in the . . . letter from [the insurer] to [plaintiff’s] adjuster, \nwhich immediately followed the $100,000 payment.”); see also 1426 Wisconsin, L.L.C. \nv. Travelers Indem. Co. of Am., 110 F. Supp. 3d 259, 269 (D.D.C. 2015) (“[The insurer] \nhas not conceded liability.  Rather, it properly reserved its rights under the policy.”).5  \nAlthough the Court has been unable to identify a North Carolina case involving the \nissue of whether a reservation of rights letter was effective to  preclude waiver of an \nanti-assignment clause in an insurance policy, North Carolina courts have recognized \nthe ability of an insurer to take action favorable to the insured subject to a reservation \nof rights.  See Fortune Ins. Co. v. Owens, 351 N.C. 424, 431 (2000) (“Generally an \ninsurer is not barred from later denying coverage when it defends its insured with a \nreservation of its rights to deny coverage.”).   \n37. Moreover, the Court is not persuaded by Brakebush’s  contention that \nthe Excess Insurers’ utilization of a standard proof of loss form constituted a waiver \nof their right to contest the validity of the assignment at issue.  Even though the proof \n \n5 Although cases from other states are, of course, not binding on issues of North Carolina law, \nthey may be considered to the extent they are deemed instructive.   See Carolina Power & \nLight Co. v. Employment Sec. Comm’n of N.C., 363 N.C. 562, 569 (2009).  \n \n \nof loss form s may have identified Brak ebush as “Assignee,” the mere use of this \nform—without more —is simply insufficient to show an intentional waiver by the \nExcess Insurers of their right to challenge Brakebush’s status as an assignee .  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that Brakebush’s second threshold argument based \non waiver is without merit. \nii.       The Excess Insurers’ Threshold Arguments \n38. The first threshold argument made by the Excess Insurers  can be \nsummarized as follows: (a ) Brakebush’s Complaint alleges that “in accordance with \nthe polic ies’ terms, each of the primary carriers consented to this assignment in \nwriting” (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 29); (b) as a result of this allegation, Plaintiff has conceded \nthat consent of the Primary Insurers was required under the Primary Policy; and (c) \nbecause the Excess Policies “follow form”6 to the Primary Policy, each of the Excess \nPolicies necessarily likewise require written consent by the Excess I nsurers with \nregard to any assignments.  (Id. at ¶ 31.)   \n39. The most basic flaw in this argument is that based on the Court’s review \nof the P rimary Policy, it does not appear to actually contain  any anti-assignment \nlanguage (or any policy language that would otherwise require the consent of the \nPrimary Insurers to any assignment  of rights under the policy ).  To the extent the \nComplaint states that the Primary Policy does, in fact, require the consent of the \ninsurer to any assignments, that assertion is erroneous, and the Court is clearly not \n \n6 “Following-form excess policies state that except for the policy limits, all of the provisions, \nconditions, and exclusions of the underlying policy are incorporated into and adopted by the \nexcess policy.”  1 LNPG: NEW APPLEMAN NC INSURANCE LITIGATION § 10.09(2) (LexisNexis \n2021). \n \n \nbound by such a statement that is contr adicted by the language of the actual \ninsurance policy at issue.  See Laster, 199 N.C. App. at 577 (holding that courts may \n“reject allegations that are contradicted by the documents attached, specifically \nreferred to, or incorporated by reference in the complaint. ”)  Therefore, the Excess \nInsurers’ “follow form” argument lacks merit.  \n40. The second threshold argument advanced by the Excess Insurers is that \nthe A.P.A. contained language restricting any assignment of insurance proceeds.  The \nCourt disagrees.   In making this argument, the Excess Insurers rely upon the \nfollowing language in t he A.P.A.: “Anything in this Agreement to the contrary \nnotwithstanding, the Seller shall not be obligated to transfer to the Buyer any \nRestricted Interests without the Buyer or the Seller first having obtained all \nConsents necessary for such transfers.”  ( ECF No. 44.2, at 4.)  However, the A.P.A. \ncontains no independent restriction on the assignability of the right to collect \nproceeds under the Excess Po licies, and the Excess Insurers’ argument begs the \nquestion as to whether the Excess Policies themselves actually contained language \nrequiring such consent before an assignment of post-loss proceeds could occur.  \nb. Anti-Assignment Language in the Excess Policies \n41. Having disposed of the parties’ threshold arguments, the Court now \nturns to the pertinent language in each of the Excess Policies.   Initially, the Court \nnotes that a lthough the Excess Insurers take the position  that each of the Excess \nPolicies contains language requiring insurer consent before any valid assignment of \n \n \nproceeds under the policy c an occur, the  Court—as discussed in detail below —\nconcludes that some of the policies contain such language while others do not.   \n42. “It is well established that contracts for insurance are to be interpreted \nunder the same rules of law as are applicable to other written contracts.”  Estrada v. \nTimber Structures, Inc., 237 N.C. App. 202, 206 (2014) ( quotation omitted).  “When \ninterpreting the relevant provisions of the insurance policy at issue, North Carolina \ncourts have long held that any ambiguity or uncertainty as to the words used in the \npolicy should be construed against the insurance company and in favor of the \npolicyholder or beneficiary.”  Accardi v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co., 373 N.C. 292, \n295 (2020) (citation omitted). \n43. The Court must, therefore, examine the specific policy provisions relied \nupon by the Excess Insurers in support of their argument that each policy contains \nlanguage that required insurer consent before the assignment at issue between \nRaeford and Brakebush could become legally effective.   \ni. Brit Policy \n44. The Brit Policy states, in pertinent part, as follows:  \nAssignment. This Certificate shall not be assigned either \nin whole or in part without the written consent of the \nCorrespondent7 endorsed hereon. \n \n(ECF No. 44.8, at p. 2.)  \n \n45. This provision requires that any assignment of rights under the Brit \nPolicy is subject to a consent requirement.  An assignment of the right to obtain post-\n \n7 Brit Global Specialty USA is identified as the “Correspondent” in the policy.  (ECF No. 44.8, \nat p. 1.)  \n \n \nloss proceeds under the policy is a type of assignment —albeit a limited one.   \nTherefore, Brakebush lacks standing to seek proceeds under the Brit Policy based on \nthe absence of such required consent.   \nii. Liberty Policy \n46. The Liberty Policy contains the following provision:  \nTransfer of Your Rights and Duties Under This \nPolicy \n \nYour rights and duties under this policy may not be \ntransferred without our written consent. \n \n(ECF No. 44.9, at p. 9.) \n \n47. The broad language used in this section of the policy  unambiguously \nrequires the insurer’s written consent to e ffect any transfer of rights , including an \nassignment of the right to seek post-loss proceeds.  Accordingly, Brakebush’s failure \nto obtain Liberty’s written consent deprives Brakebush of standing to seek proceeds \nunder this policy. \niii. Evanston Policy \n48. The Evanston Policy contains the following provision: \nTransfer Of Your Rights And Duties Under This \nPolicy \n \nYour rights and duties under this policy may not be \ntransferred without our written consent except in the case \nof death of an individual named insured. \n \n(ECF No. 44.10, at p. 28.) \n \n49. Once again, the broad language of this provision required insurer \nconsent before an effective transfer of Raeford’s right to seek post-loss proceeds under \n \n \nthe policy c ould be made to Brakebush .  Therefore, Brakebush lacks standing with \nregard to this policy as well. \niv. Maxum Policy \n50. The Excess Insurers attempt to rely on three separate provisions of the \nMaxum Policy to challenge Brakebush’s standing.  The first reads as follows: \nChanges \n \n. . .   You are only authorized to make changes in the terms \nof this policy with the Companies [sic] consent.  The policies \n[sic] terms can be amended or waived only by endorsement \nissued by Us and made part of this policy. \n \n(ECF No. 44.11, at p. 14.) \n \n51. The Maxum Policy does not contain a definition of the word “terms.”  “In \ndetermining the ordinary meaning of a word [in an insurance policy], it is appropriate \nto look to dictionary definitions.  Our Supreme Court has held that ‘use of the plain, \nordinary meaning of a term is the preferred construction.’ ”  Herri ng v. Liner , 163 \nN.C. App. 534, 538 (2004) (quoting C.D. Spangler Constr. Co. v. Industrial Crankshaft \n& Eng. Co ., 326 N.C. 133, 151 (1990)).   The word “terms” refers to “ provisions that \ndetermine the nature and scope of an agreement .”  Terms, Merriam Webster \nDictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/terms.   \n52.  The Court is of the view that an ambiguity exists as to whether this \nprovision requires the consent of the insurer to an assignment of the right to recover \npost-loss proceeds.  As noted above, it is well-settled that ambiguities in an insurance \npolicy must be construed against the insurer.   See Accardi, 373 N.C.  at 295.  \n \n \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that this provision did not require Brakebush to \nobtain Maxum’s consent in the present case. \n53. The second provision of the Maxum P olicy relied upon by the Excess \nInsurers provides: \nNo Benefit to Bailee \n \nNo person or organization, other than you, having custody \nof Covered Property will benefit from this insurance. \n \n(ECF No. 44.11, at p. 15.) \n \n54. The “No Benefit to Bailee” clause is not an anti-assignment clause.  “The \ngenerally accepted definition of a bailment is that it is a delivery of goods in trust \nupon a contract, express or implied, that the trust shall be duly executed,  and the \ngoods restored by the bailee as soon as the purposes of the bailment shall be \nanswered.”  Modern Electric Co. v. Dennis, 255 N.C. 64, 72 (1961) (citation omitted).  \nTherefore, this clause is directed to those persons who may have temporary custody—\nbut not title—to insured property.  In this case, Brakebush is not a bailee and instead \nis the legal owner of the property at issue.  Therefore, the “No Benefit to Bailee” clause \ndid not serve to restrict Raeford’s ability to assign its right to post-loss proceeds under \nthe Maxum Policy to Brakebush. \n55. The final provision  in the Maxum P olicy relied upon by the Excess \nInsurers states as follows: \nContract of Sale \n \n1. The Loss Payee shown in the Schedule or in the \nDeclarations is a person or organization you have entered \na contract with for the sale of Covered Property. \n \n \n \n(ECF No. 44.11, at p. 47.) \n \n56. The Excess Insurers have offered no persuasive argument that this \nclause serves as an anti -assignment clause.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that \nBrakebush possesses standing to seek proceeds under the Maxum Policy.  \nv. Ironshore Policy \n57. The Ironshore Policy does not contain any anti-assignment language at \nall.  However, it does contain the following provision:  \nPerils Insured Against \nThis Policy insures against “All Risks” of direct physical \nloss or  damage to the Insured’s property, subject to the \nsame exclusions, warranties, terms, definitions and \nconditions as are contained in or as may be added or \nendorsed to the primary and underlying policy(ies) covering \nthe Insured’s identical property .  Coverage as provided \nherein shall also be subject to the premium, policy limits of \nliability, and all other exclusions, warranties, terms , \ndefinitions and conditions of this policy, which shall \nsupersede any exclusion s, warranties, terms , definitions \nand conditions of the primary and underlying policy(ies) in \nconflict with this  policy.  The coverage provided by this \npolicy shall in no event provide broader coverage than the \ncoverage provided by such primary and underlying policies.  \n \n(ECF No. 44.12, at p. 5) (emphasis added). \n \n58. The Excess Insurers contend that this “follow form” clause means that \nthe same restrictions on assignments that are contained in the Primary Policy apply \nequally to the Ironshore P olicy as well.  However, implicit in this argument is the \nassertion that the P rimary Policy actually contains an anti-assignment clause.  As \n \n \ndiscussed earlier, no such language appears therein.  Therefore, the Excess Insurers’ \n“follow form” argument as applied to the Ironshore Policy is meritless.  \nvi. Novae Policy \n59. The Novae Policy contains a provision that provides:   \nAssignment \n \nAssignment or transfer of this P olicy will not be valid \nexcept with the prior written consent of the Company. \n \n(ECF No. 44.14, at p. 32.) \n \n60. This clause, on its face, requires prior written consent before the policy \nitself may be assigned or transferred.  However, the assignment between Raeford and \nBrakebush was not of the entire policy.  Rather, it was an assignment as to one \nparticular right under the policy —that is, the right to recover post -loss proceeds.  \nTherefore, the Court does not interpret this provision as requiring insurer consent \nbefore Brakebush could be assign ed the right to collect proceeds , and Brakebush  \npossesses standing to seek such benefits under the Novae Policy. \nvii. Hallmark Policy \n61. The Hallmark Policy states in pertinent part: \nAssignment \n \nAssignment or transfer of this Policy will not be valid \nexcept with the prior written consent of the Company. \n \n(ECF No. 44.15, at p. 30.) \n \n \n \n62. This language is identical to the above -quoted provision of the Novae \nPolicy.  As such, for the same reasons discussed above, Brakebush possesses standing \nto seek post-loss proceeds under the Hallmark Policy.    \nviii. Hudson Policy \n63. Finally, the Hudson Policy provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \nWhen Hudson Specialty Insurance Company is \nparticipating on a layer with one or more other carriers, \nand more favorable terms or conditions are granted to one \nor more of such other carrier (s), it is a condition of this \nPolicy that such more favorable terms and conditions be \nextended to Hudson Specialty Insurance Company.  More \nfavorable terms and conditions shall mean additional \nexclusionary verbiage, larger deductibles, reduced limits, or \nincreased premium.\n8 \n \n(ECF No. 44.13, at p. 22) (emphasis added). \n \n64. Based on the above-quoted language from the Hudson Policy, the Excess \nInsurers argue that because at least some of the  Excess Policies contain anti-\nassignment provisions that are written broadly enough to have required insurer \n \n8 Brakebush suggests that New York law—rather than North Carolina law—may govern the \nHudson Policy because of a clause contained in the policy which states, “This Policy shall be \ninterpreted solely according to the law of the State of New York without regard to the choice \nof law provisions of New York.”  (ECF No. 44.13, at p. 16).  The Court concludes, however, \nthat the Hudson Policy is instead governed by North Carolina law.  North Carolina’s General \nStatutes provide that “[a]ll contracts of insurance on property, lives, or interests in this State \nshall be deemed to be made therein, and all contracts of insurance the applications for which \nare taken within the State shall be deemed to have been made within this State and are \nsubject to the laws thereof .”  N.C.G.S. § 58 -3-1 (2019) ; see Cordell v. Brotherhood of \nLocomotive Fireman & Enginemen, 208 N.C. 632, 640 (1935) (citation omitted) (holding that \na “provision in a contract of insurance that ‘ [t]his contract shall be governed by, subject to \nand construed only according to the laws of the State of New York, the home office of said \nassociation,’ is void in so far as the courts of this State are concerned”).  Therefore, the Hudson \nPolicy is deemed to be made in North Carolina, and North Carolina law applies to this case.  \nSee Davis v. Davis, 269 N.C. 120, 124 (1967)  (“[T]he validity and construction of a contract \nare to be determined by the law of the place where it is made.”). \n \n \nconsent in this case, those same provisions must necessarily be deemed applicable to \nthe Hudson Policy as well.  However, the Court is not persuaded  by this argument.  \nAlthough one can argue that a provision that  limits the right of assignment favors \nthe insurer because it takes away a right the insured would otherwise possess , one \ncan also argue that such a provision does not qualify as “exclusionary verbiage” since \nit does not actually restrict or diminish coverage under the policy.  An “exclusionary \nclause” generally refers to “a provision in an insurance policy listing the exceptions \nto coverage and circumstances that prohibit recovery under the policy.”  Exclusionary \nclause, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2004).  An anti-assignment clause does not \nfit within this definition.  Indeed, as discussed above, our Court of Appeals in First -\nCitizens Bank expressly stated that “the assignment of the mere right to payment \nafter loss in no wa y broadened the scope of the coverage of insurable risks provided \nby defendant’s policy.”  First-Citizens Bank, 113 N.C. App. at 796.   \n65. The Court therefore concludes that the phrase  “exclusionary verbiage” \nin this context is , at best, ambiguous and must therefore be construed against the \nExcess Insurers.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that  Brakebush has standing to \npursue its claims under the Hudson Policy. \n66. In summary, Brakebush has established standing to assert its claims \nfor breach of contract and declaratory judgment under the Maxum, Ironshore, Novae, \nHallmark, and Hudson Policies, but not under the Brit, Evanston, or Liberty Policies.  \nAccordingly, the Excess Insurers’ Motion to Dismiss the declaratory judgment and \nbreach of contract claims pursuant to 12(b)(1) is GRANTED with respect to the Brit, \n \n \nLiberty, and Evanston Policies and DENIED as to the Maxum, Ironshore, Novae, \nHallmark, and Hudson Policies. \n2.  Standing to Assert Bad Faith and UDTP Claims \n67. The Excess Insurers also argue that under North Carolina law \nBrakebush lacks standing to sue the Excess Insurers for bad faith or UDTP because \nBrakebush—unlike Raeford—was not a party to the policies issued by these insurers.  \nBrakebush disagrees, contending that North Carolina law does not prohibit an \nassignee from asserting bad faith or UDTP claims where—as here—such claims are \nbased on the assignee’s own interactions with an insurer.  \n68. As an initial matter, the Court has already ruled that Brakebush lacks \nstanding to assert claims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment under the \npolicies issued by Brit, Liberty, and Evanston.  Therefore, it logically follows that any \nattempt by Brakebush to bring claims for bad faith or  UDTP against those \nDefendants is likewise barred .  Accordingly, Brit, Liberty, and Evanston  are \nDISMISSED as parties to this action.9  \n69. The Court reaches a different conclusion, however, with regard to \nBrakebush’s bad faith and UDTP claims against Maxum, Ironshore, Novae, \nHallmark, and Hudson. \n70.  Initially, t he Excess Insurers rely in their briefs on  case law \nestablishing that tort claims  in North Carolina  are not assignable  as a matter of \n \n9 Accordingly, the Court’s use of the term Excess Insurers or Excess Policies for the remainder \nof this opinion refers only to Maxum, Ironshore, Novae, Hallmark, and Hudson and their \npolicies. \n \n \n \npublic policy.  See, e.g., Atl. Coast Mech., Inc. v. Arcadis, Geraghty & Miller of N.C. \nInc., 175 N.C. App. 339, 343 (2006)  (citation omitted) (“It is well-established in this \nstate that personal tort claims are not assignable because such assignments would \nbe void against public policy because they promote champerty. ”); see also Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Hosp. Auth. v. First of Ga. Ins. Co ., 340 N.C. 88 , 91 (1995)  (citation \nomitted) (“There is a distinction between the assignment of a claim for personal injury \nand the assignment of the proceeds of such a claim.  The assignment of a claim gives \nthe assignee control of the claim and promotes champerty.”).  \n71. These cases, however, are inapposite.  Here, the bad faith and UDTP \nclaims at issue are not claim s that previously belonged to Raeford  and were then \nassigned to Brakebush.   Rather, they are  claims that never belonged to Raeford .  \nInstead, Brakebush seeks to bring these claims based on the insurers’ conduct toward \nBrakebush in the course of its attempt to collect post-loss proceeds under the policies \nas an assignee.  Indeed, the conduct forming the basis for Brakebush’s bad faith and \nUDTP claims occurred after the assignment from Raeford to Brakebush.  \n72. The Excess Insurers next seek to rely upon a line of cases holding that \na bad faith claim cannot lie against an insurer when brought by a n adverse third-\nparty claimant.   In making this argument, however, the Excess Insurers fail t o \naccount for the differences between first-party and third-party insurance coverage.   \nIn the first -party situation, the insurance covers a claim \ndirectly made by the insured and examples of first -party \ncoverage are life, health, disability, property, and fidelity \ninsurance.  In the third-party situation, a liability claim is \nbrought by a third party which triggers  the insurer’s duty \nto defend and indemnify.  Examples of third-party coverage \n \n \nare professional malpractice insurance and commercia l \nliability insurance.  \n \n8 NEW APPLEMAN ON INSURANCE LAW LIBRARY EDITION § 90.1 (2021).  \n73. The cases relied upon by the Excess Insurers all arose in the context of \na claim against an insurer brought by an adverse third -party claimant.   In those \ncases, our Court of Appeals held that a  bad faith claim is unavailable to a n adverse \nthird-party claimant suing under an insurance policy of another.  See, e.g., Craven v. \nDemidovich, 172 N.C. App. 340, 341– 43 (2005).  Similarly, the Court of Appeals has \nstated that “North Carolina law does not recognize a cause of action for third -party \nclaimants against the insurance company of an adverse party based on unfair  and \ndeceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1.”  Id. at 341–42 (quoting Wilson v. \nWilson, 121 N.C. App. 662, 665 (1996)).   \n74. In Craven, the plaintiff was injured as the passenger in a vehicle driven \nby the defendant.  Craven , 172 N.C. App. a t 340–41.  The p laintiff made a demand \nupon the defendant’s liability insur er and ultimately sued on theories of bad faith \nand UDTP based on the insurer’s “ refusal to timely adjust his claim[.]”  Id.  at 341.  \nThe Court of Appeals held that the plaintiff lacked the ability to assert such claims \nbased on the rule that third-party adverse claimants cannot sue under the insurance \npolicy of another.  Id. at 341–43.   \n75. In Wilson, the plaintiff was injured by her husband’s alleged negligence \nwhile driving an automobile.  Wilson, 121 N.C. App. at 663.  She brought a negligence \nclaim against her husband and a UDTP claim against his liability insurance carrier \nafter the plaintiff “rejected [a settlement offer from the insurer] as inadequate.”  Id.  \n \n \nThe Court of Appeals ruled that the plaintiff could not pursu e the UDTP claim as \nsuch a claim “may not be asserted by a third-party claimant against the insurer of an \nadverse party.”  Id. at 665. \n76. Critically, neither of these cases involved first-party claims.  Here, as an \nassignee of the named insured who possessed a contractual right to collect proceeds \nunder the policy, Brakebush is in a materially different position than the plaintiffs in \nthe cases relied upon by the Excess Insurers.  \n77. The above-referenced cases cited by the Excess Insurers  stand for the \nproposition that a third -party claimant cannot pursue a bad faith  or UDTP  claim \nagainst the insurer of an adverse party.  The Excess Insurers are essentially arguing \nthat the Court should construe the term “third party claimant” to include anyone who \ndid not actually contract with the insurer.  Under such a construction , Brakebush \nwould not be able to assert a claim for bad faith or UDTP because Raeford —not \nBrakebush—was the named insured under the policies issued by the Excess Insurers \nand Brakebush was a “stranger” to the policies.   \n78. However, the Court  rejects this argument  because Brakebush cannot \nproperly be viewed as a third-party claimant.  See Bartlett v. Allstate Ins. Co., 929 P. \n2d 227, 231 (Mont. 1996) (citation omitted) (“[I]n the context of bad faith tort actions, \na third-party claimant is typically a person who has a claim against the insured party \nfor certain injuries. ”); Lee v. Sapp, 234 So. 3d 122, 130  (La. App. 2017)  (quotation \nomitted) (“In the world of insurance, a first-party claim is a claim filed by an insured \nagainst his own insurer for damage to property or person; whereas a third-party claim \n \n \nis made by a claimant against the insured for damages allegedly caused by the \ninsured.”).   \n79. By virtue of the assignment from  Raeford, Brakebush stepped into \nRaeford’s shoes with respect to the right to collect post-loss proceeds under the Excess \nPolicies.  See Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc’y, FSB v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., \n265 N.C. App. 593, 599 (2019) (recognizing that an assignee “step[s] into the shoes of \n[its assignor]”).  The Excess Insurers have not cited any case from North Carolina ’s \nappellate courts holding  that a  bad faith or UDTP claim was barre d under the \ncircumstances presented here.10 \n80. Additionally, it is important to note that the public policy concerns \nunderpinning the  holdings in Wilson and Craven do not apply to the facts of th e \npresent case.  In Wilson , the Court of Appeals cautioned that “allowing such third -\nparty suits against insurers would encourage unwarranted settlement demands,” \ncould lead to “undesirable social and economic effects (i.e., multiple litigation, \nunwarranted bad faith claims, coercive settlements, excessive jury awards,  and \nescalating insurance, legal and other transaction costs) [,]” and might “result in a \nconflict of interest for the insurance company .”  Wilson, 121 N.C. App. at 666– 67 \n(citation omitted). \n \n10 Moreover, to the extent that privity between Brakebush and the Excess Insurers is \nrequired in order for Brakebush to possess standing to assert a bad faith or UDTP claim, \nsuch privity arguably exists as a result of the assignment from Raeford to Brakebush.  See \nJones Motor Co. v. Holtkamp, Liese, Beckemeier & Childress, P.C., 197 F.3d 1190, 1192 (7th \nCir. 1999) (“[A]n assignee is in privity with the other party to its assignor’s contract”). \n \n \n81. None of those policy concerns apply when the  assignee of the named \ninsured asserts a bad faith claim based on its own interactions with the insurer.  As  \nRaeford’s assignee, Brakebush is the only party who possesses a valid legal interest \nin collecting post-loss proceeds from the fire.  As a result, the Excess Insurers are not \nfaced with the prospect of receiving demands from both the named insured under the \npolicy and an adverse claimant.   The potential for harms in the form of multiple \nlitigation and conflicts of interest are completely absent here.  \n82. Moreover, a contrary ruling would mean that even though a party in \nBrakebush’s position possessed a legal right as an assignee to seek proceeds under \nan insurance policy, it would lack any  remedy in tort for bad faith conduct by the \ninsurer.  Such a result would run counter to the goal of preventing unlawful conduct \nby insurers with regard to the adjusting and payment of insurance claims.   \n83. For these reasons, the Excess Insurers’ m otion to dismiss the bad faith \nand Chapter 75 claims under Rule 12(b)(1) is DENIED as to  Maxum, Ironshore, \nNovae, Hallmark, and Hudson.   \nB. Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) Motion \n84. Having ruled upon the standing issues underlying the Excess Insurers’ \nRule 12(b)(1) motion, the Court must now turn its attention to their motion to dismiss \nfor failure to state a valid claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6).  \n1.  Declaratory Judgment and Breach of Contract \n85. The Excess Insurers’  sole contention regarding the declaratory \njudgment and breach of contract claims set out in the Complaint is that Brak ebush \n \n \nhas no legally enforceable interest in the insurance policies at issue.  It appears that \nthis argument is largely —if not completely—derivative of their standing argument.  \nTherefore, because the Court has held that Brakebush does, in fact, possess standing \nto assert claims under the Maxum, Ironshore, Novae, Hallmark, and Hudson policies, \nthe Excess Insurers ’ motion to dismiss the breach of contract and declaratory \njudgment claims as to these Defendants pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is DENIED.  \n2.  Bad Faith \n86. The Excess Insurers also seek dismissal of Brakebush’s bad faith claim, \narguing that the Complaint fails to allege the essential elements of such a claim.  \nBrakebush, conversely, contends that the allegations concerning the Excess Insurers’ \n“low-ball settlement offer,”  initial refusal to provide their internal documents \nregarding Brakebush’s claim, and refusal to pay the entirety of the amount shown as \nrecoverable losses in those documents are sufficient to state a valid bad faith claim.  \n87. “In order to recover . . . for the tort of an insurance company’s bad faith \nrefusal to settle, the plaintiff must prove (1) a refusal to pay after recognition of a \nvalid claim, (2) bad faith, and (3) aggravating or outrageous conduct. ”  L ovell v. \nNationwide Mut Ins. Co., 108 N.C. App. 416, 420 (1993) (citation omitted).  \n88. Among other allegations, the Complaint asserts that th e Excess \nInsurers’ own documents showed that the extent of the damage incurred from the fire \nwas approximately $1.5 million higher than the amount they paid to Brakebush and \nthat the Excess Insurers subsequently refused to provide an explanation for  their \nrefusal to pay the higher amount .  Construing the allegations in the light most \n \n \nfavorable to Brakebush, as the Court is required to do at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the \nCourt concludes that Brakebush’s allegations are sufficient to state a claim for bad \nfaith.   \n89. In their briefs, t he Excess Insurers  invite the Court to delve into the \ncontents of the ir internal documents and determine whether their refusal to issue \npayment in a higher amount was reasonable.  The Court must decline this invitation \nas this argument goes well beyond the limited scope of a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry. \n90. The Excess Insurers  also argu e that Brakebush has improperly  \nattempted to bring a bad faith claim under N.C.G.S. § 58-63-15 because that statue \ndoes not provide for a private cause  of action.  Such an argument misconstrues \nBrakebush’s bad faith  claim.  Although this section of the Complaint contains a \nreference to N.C.G.S. § 58-63-15(11), the Court interprets the bad faith claim asserted \nby Brakebush as being based under North Carolina common law.   \n91. Therefore, the Excess Insurers’ motion to dismiss the bad faith claim \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is DENIED.  \n3.  Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \n92.   The Excess Insurers also contend that Brakebush has not stated a \nvalid claim for UDTP.  \n93. “To state a claim under G.S. § 75 -1.1, Plaintiff must allege facts \nsufficient to show (1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of \ncompetition; (2) in or affecting commerce; (3) that proximately causes actual injury to \n \n \nthe Plaintiff.”  JTG Equip. & Supply, LLC v. EBay, Inc., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 9, at *19 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 23, 2015). \n94. Based on the Court’s careful reading of the Complaint, it concludes \nthat— for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6)— the allegations contained therein with regard \nto this claim are sufficient  to state a valid claim for relief .  See Kielbania v. Indian \nHarbor Ins. Co., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127849, at *34 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 10, 2012) (“[A] \nviolation of Section 58-63-15(11) constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice in \nviolation of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 as a matter of law.”).  \n95. Therefore, the Excess Insurers ’ motion to dismiss Brakebush’s UDTP \nclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is DENIED.  \n4.  Consequential Damages \n96. The Excess Insurers  also contend that Brakebush ’s claim for \nconsequential damages should be dismissed because Brakebush “fail[ed] to plead that \ndefendants contemplated  that they would have any liability to anyone other than \nRaeford.”  (ECF No. 43, at p. 20.) \n97. The Court concludes that it is too early in this litigation to decide \nwhether Brakebush would be entitled to recover consequential damages if it \nultimately prevails in this action.  Therefore, the Excess Insurers’ motion to dismiss \nthe claim for consequential damages is DENIED.  \n  \n \n \nC.  Defendants’ Motion to Strike \n98. The Excess Insurers have also moved to strike Brakebush’s claim for a \ndeclaratory judgment pursuant to Rule 12(f) on the basis that declaratory relief will \nbe unnecessary in light of the Court’s resolution of the breach of contract claims.  For \nthis reason, they contend, the declaratory judgment claim is merely redundant.   \nBrakebush disagrees, arguing that a declaratory judgment will assist in clarifying \nthe obligations of the various Excess Insurers.   \n99. The Court c oncludes that  a declaratory judgment claim is an \nappropriate mechanism for resolution of key disputes between the parties  in this \ncase.  Brakebush is seeking an adjudication regarding the various obligations under \neight different insurance policies.  The issues upon which Brakebush seeks such \ndeclaratory relief are distinct—at least in part —from the issue of whether a breach \nof contract occurred. \n100. Therefore, the Excess Insurers’ Motion to Strike is DENIED.  \nD.  Brakebush’s Motion to Strike \n101. Finally, Brakebush moves to strike certain  portions of the Excess \nInsurers’ reply brief based on its contention that they are in violation of Rule 7.7 of \nthe North Carolina Business Court Rules .  Brakebush contends that the reply brief \ngoes beyond merely addressing arguments raised in its response brief and instead \nimproperly raises new issues.  In the alternative, Brakebush requests leave to submit \na surreply brief. \n \n \n102. The Court is satisfied that the parties have been given a full and fair \nopportunity to brief all issues in this case, including the submission of supplemental \nbriefs subsequent to the filing of the Excess Insurers’ reply brief .  The parties were \nalso afforded the opportunity to request an additional hearing in this matter , which \nthey declined.  \n103. Accordingly, Brakebush’s Motion to Strike is DENIED.  \nCONCLUSION \nTHEREFORE, it is hereby ORDERED that the parties’ pending motions are \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as follows: \n1. Defendants’ Motion  to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) against \nDefendants Brit, Evanston , and Libert y is GRANTED, and all claims \nagainst those Defendants are hereby DISMISSED without prejudice.   \n2. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1)  as to all claims  \nagainst Defendants Maxum, Ironshore, Novae,  Hallmark, and Hudson  is \nDENIED.  \n3. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is DENIED as to \nall claims against Defendants Maxum, Ironshore, Novae, Hallmark,  and \nHudson.  \n4. Defendants’ Motion to Strike is DENIED.  \n5. Brakebush’s Motion to Strike is DENIED. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 1st day of November, 2021.  \n       /s/ Mark A. Davis    \n       Mark A. Davis \n       Special Superior Court Judge for \n       Complex Business Cases "
