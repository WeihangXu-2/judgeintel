On December 16, 2013, Plaintiff initiated this case by filing its Complaint with \nthe Wake County Clerk of Court. Plaintiff a lleges that the Defendants have collaborated in \na scheme to make usurious loans to North Carolina consumers, in violation of North Carolina \nlaw, and claim to be immune from State la w as Native American tribal entities.  The \nComplaint alleges claims against Defendants for Violations of the North Carolina Consumer \nFinance Act, Violations of the North Carolina Usury Statute, and Violations of the North \nCarolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices A ct. As part of Plaintiff’s requested relief, \nPlaintiff seeks prohibitory and mandatory injunctions on Defendants.  \n2. On January 17, 2014, this case was designated to the North Carolina Business \nCourt. \n3. On March 24, 2015, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss.1  The Defendants \nmove to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint on the grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over \nthe claims in this case because “North Caro lina does not have the power to regulate the \nconduct at issue in this case, which occurred  within the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe [ ] \nReservation in South Dakota.” 2 Defendants further contend that the State’s attempt to \nregulate the conduct at issue violates the Do rmant Commerce Clause, that the Court lacks \npersonal jurisdiction over Defendant John P aul Reddam (“Reddam”), and that the certain \nclaims raised by the Complaint for violation of the usury statute and the Unfair and \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act (“UDTPA”) fail to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted.\n3 \n                                                 \n1 From approximately February 2014 to January 2015,  the parties obtained multiple extensions of \ntime to file responsive pleadings and conduct a case management meeting, based on the parties’ \nrepresentation that they were engaged in settlement discussions. The case was effectively stayed \nduring this time period. The parties did not reach a settlement. \n2 Mot. Dismiss ¶ 1. \n3 Id. ¶¶ 2-4. \n \n \n4. On March 24, 2015, Plaintiff also filed the Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \nThe Plaintiff’s Motion requests an order from this Court prohibiting Defendants from, inter \nalia, advertising, soliciting for, offering, servicing, collecting payment from, or selling or \ntransferring any loans with No rth Carolina borrowers. The Plai ntiff’s Motion further seeks \nan order prohibiting Defendants from “[t]r ansferring, withdrawing, concealing, or \nencumbering any assets outside of [Defendants’] normal course of business.” The Plaintiff’s \nMotion also seeks an order requiring De fendants to produce certain financial and \ninstitutional information regarding loans issued to North Carolina consumers within the past \nsix years. Finally, Plaintiff seeks an order requiring Defendants to establish an escrow \naccount to pay full restitution to all affected consumers. \n5. The Motions have been briefed and argued and are ripe for determination. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n6. Plaintiff is the State of North Carolina, acting through the Attorney General \nand the Commissioner of Banks.  \n7. Defendant Western Sky Financial, LLC (“Western Sky”) is a South Dakota \nlimited liability company. Western Sky’s office s are located on the Cheyenne River Indian \nReservation.  Martin Webb (“Webb”) is the sole owner of Western Sky.  Webb is a member of \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (“CRST”).  Webb is not a CRST official or representative of \nthe tribe’s government. \n8. The CRST does not have any ownership interest in Western Sky, nor is \nWestern Sky operated by the CRST.  Western Sky was not created by any tribal governing \nbody or formed under tribal law, and the CRST does not receives any direct financial benefit \nfrom Western Sky.  Instead, all profits made by Western Sky are distributed solely to Webb.4 \n                                                 \n4 Compl. ¶¶ 30-31; Defendants do not contest these allegations in the Motion to Dismiss. \n \n \n9. Defendants CashCall, Inc. (“CashCall”), WS Funding, LLC (“WS Funding”), \nand Delbert Services Corporation (“Delbert”) all have the same business address: 1600 South \nDouglass Road, Anaheim, California 92806. CashCa ll is a licensed mortgage lender in the \nState of North Carolina. Delbert is a licensed collection agency in the State of North Carolina. \nWS Funding does not hold any North Carolina licenses. There are no allegations, and \nDefendants do not contend, that Cash Call, WS Funding, or Delbert conducted any business \non or had any other connection to the CRST Reservation. \n10. Defendant John Paul Reddam is a California resident. At all times relevant to \nthis case, Reddam was the sole shareholder, President, and CEO of CashCall; the sole \nmember, President, and manager of WS Funding; and the Director and owner of Delbert. \n11. Since at least 2010, Defendants have made and collected on consumer loans to \nNorth Carolina consumers.\n5 Defendants promoted these loans through Western Sky’s website \nand through television advertising in North Carolina.  Western Sky offered loans ranging in \namounts from $850 to $10,000, and charged interest rates on the loans between 89.68% and \n342.86%.  Borrowers were requi red to repay the loans in monthly installments with \nrepayment periods ranging from 12 to 84 months.  \n12. To obtain the loans, consumers were invited to submit an online application \nthrough Western Sky’s website or to call Western Sky’s toll free number. Western Sky then \ntypically required the consumer to provide personal financial information relevant to the loan \napplication, such as bank statements and pay stubs.\n6  After reviewing the consumer’s \napplication and financial information, Western Sky approved the loan, usually within a few \nhours, and communicated the approval by email or telephone.  Western Sky then \n                                                 \n5 Defendants contend that they stopped offering new loans to North Carolina consumers prior to \ninitiation of this lawsuit. \n6 Compl. Exs. C-1, C-3, and C-4. \n \n \nelectronically provided the borrower a Consumer Loan Agreement (“Loan Agreement”).7 The \nborrower signed the Loan Agreement online and returned it electronically to Western Sky. 8  \nThe borrower was required to check a box in the Loan Agreement acknowledging their \nagreement to the following: “YOU HAVE READ ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS \nOF THIS PROMISSORY NOTE AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AND AGREE TO BE \nBOUND THERETO.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR EXECUTION OF \nTHIS NOTE SHALL HAVE THE SAME LE GAL FORCE AND EFFECT AS A PAPER \nCONTRACT.”\n9 Upon approval, loans were electronically deposited into the consumer’s bank \naccount. Those same accounts were subsequently debited for monthly payments. \n13. The Loan Agreement contained the following language on the first page: \nThis Loan Agreement is subject solely to the exclusive laws and jurisdiction of \nthe Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.  By \nexecuting this Loan Agreement, you, the borrower, hereby acknowledge and \nconsent to be bound to the terms of th is Loan Agreement, consent to the sole \nsubject matter and personal jurisdiction  of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal \nCourt, and that no other state or federa l law or regulation shall apply to this \nLoan Agreement, its enforcement or interpretation.10  \n \n14. In a separate section entitled “Governing Law,” the Loan Agreement provided \nthat: \nThis Agreement is governed by the Indian Commerce Clause of the \nConstitution of the United States of America and the laws of the Cheyenne \nRiver Sioux Tribe. We do not have a presence in South Dakota or any other \nstates of the United States. Neither th is Agreement nor Lender is subject to \nthe laws of any state of the United St ates of America. By executing this \nAgreement, you hereby expressly agree that this Agreement is executed and \nperformed solely within the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Indian \nReservation, a sovereign Native Americ an Tribal Nation. You also expressly \nagree that this Agreement shall be subject to and construed in accordance only \nwith the provisions of the laws of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, and that no \n                                                 \n7 Attachment A to Compl. Exs. C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4. \n8 Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 4. As will be described below in detail, Defendants argue that final \napproval of the loan did not occur until after the consumers submitted their signed loan agreements \nto Western Sky. Plaintiff disagrees. \n9 Attachment A to Compl. Exs. C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4 (emphasis and capitalization in original). \n10 Emphasis in original. \n \n \nUnited States state or federal law app lies to this Agreement. You agree that \nby entering into this Agreement you ar e voluntarily availing yourself of the \nlaws of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe,  a sovereign Native American Tribal \nNation, and that your execution of this  Agreement is made as if you were \nphysically present within the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River \nIndian Reservation, a sovereign Native American Tribal Nation.11 \n \n15. Once a loan was finalized, Western Sky immediately sold and transferred the \nloan to WS Funding. Upon sale to WS Funding,  the loan was serviced by CashCall. In some \ninstances, the loan was later sold or transferr ed to Delbert for servicing and collections. \nPlaintiff alleges, incorporating findings of  the New Hampshire Banking Commission in a \nseparate proceeding against Defendants, that CashCall, and not Western Sky, is the primary \nparty operating the lending business, and that Western Sky “is nothing more than a front to \nenable CashCall to evade licensure by state agencies and to exploit Tribal Sovereign \nImmunity to shield its deceptive business pra ctices from prosecution by state and federal \nregulators.”12 \n16. Plaintiff alleges that the interest rate s charged to consumers on the loans at \nissue are in violation of the North Carolina usury law.  North Carolina law provides that the \nmaximum interest rate that can be charged to North Carolina consumers on a loan of $25,000 \nor less is 16% per annum. G.S. § 24-1.1.  Plaintiff also alleges that the interest rates charged \nby Defendants violate the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act, G.S. §§ 53-164 et seq., and \nthe UDTPA, G.S. §§ 75-1.1 et seq. Plaintiff contends that any loans in violation of the \nConsumer Finance Act are void under G.S. § 53-166(d). Plaintiff further argues that the \nAttorney General is entitled, pursuant to G.S. §§ 75-14 and 75-15.1, to obtain a refund of \n                                                 \n11 Id. at 3. \n12 Compl. ¶¶ 4, 17-21 (quoting In re CashCall, Inc., John Paul Reddam, President and CEO of \nCashCall, Inc. and WS Funding, LLC, N.H. Banking Commissioner No. 12-308 (June 4, 2013), \navailable at http://www.nh.gov/banking/orders/enforcement/documents/12-308-cd-20130604.pdf). \n \n \nmoney paid to Defendants plus civil penalties  and injunctive relief to prevent further \nviolations of the UDTPA.  \n17. The loans made by Defendants to North Carolina residents have resulted in \nNorth Carolina consumers being subjected to oppressive repayment requirements, harassing \ncollection tactics, and reports of non-payment to credit agencies.13  Multiple North Carolina \nconsumers have complained to Plaintiff about Defendants. \n18. Plaintiff alleges that “Defendants empl oy what is known as a rent-a-tribe \nscheme, in which unlicensed lender CashCall makes usurious consumer loans, . . . , by \npurporting to affiliate with an Indian tribe to claim federal tribal sovereign immunity.”14 \n19. Since 2010, at least 14 states “have taken action against Defendants for \nunlawfully making loans without proper state lic ensure and in violation of state usury and \nconsumer protection laws” resulting in numerous court and administrative orders requiring \nDefendants to cease and desist from making loans and imposing penalties and fines.15 \n20. Western Sky announced on its website t hat as of September 3, 2013, it was \nsuspending business operations.  There is no evidence in the record that Western Sky has \nadvertised, solicited for, or made loans in North Carolina since that date. \nANALYSIS \nRule 12(b)(2) Motion to Dismiss Reddam for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction \n21. Defendants have moved to dismiss the Co mplaint as to Defendant John Paul \nReddam pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), for lack of personal jurisdiction. Defendants and Plaintiff \nhave submitted affidavits with regard to the motion. \n                                                 \n13 Compl. ¶¶ 24-28. \n14 Id. ¶ 33. \n15 Id. ¶ 5, 36-42 \n \n \n22. The standard for a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction depends on the procedural context confronting the court.  In a motion to dismiss \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction, the facts a lleged in the complaint are taken as true unless \nthe defendants supplement their motion to dismiss with affidavits.  Eluhu v. Rosenhaus, 159 \nN.C. App. 355, 359 (2003) (citation omitted).  Wh en affidavits or other evidence are offered, \n“the plaintiff must respond ‘by affidavit or ot herwise . . . [and] set[] forth specific facts \nshowing that the court has jurisdiction.’”  Id. (quoting Bruggeman v. Meditrust Acquisition \nCo., 138 N.C. App. 612, 615–16 (2000)). Where, as here, the parties have submitted “dueling \naffidavits” regarding the existence of personal jurisdiction, and the Court elects to review the \nMotion based on the affidavits in lieu of receiving oral testimony or depositions, “the trial \njudge must determine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence [presented in the affidavits] \nmuch as a juror.” \nBanc of Am. Sec. LLC v. Evergreen Int’l Aviation, Inc., 169 N.C. App. 690, \n693-94 (2005) (quoting Fungaroli v. Fungaroli, 51 N.C. App. 363, 367 (1981)).  “The burden \nis on the plaintiff to prove by a preponderanc e of the evidence that grounds exist for the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant.” Eluhu, 159 N.C. App. at 359 (citation \nomitted). \n23.  North Carolina courts \nhave adopted a two-part test to determine whether a court in this state may \nexercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. The court first \nmust determine whether our “long-arm” statute authorizes jurisdiction over \nthe defendant. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-75.4 (2005). If the statute does authorize \njurisdiction, the court next must “deter mine whether the court’s exercise of \njurisdiction over the defendant is consistent with due process.” . . . Our primary \ndetermination thus is whether defendant  [  ] had “‘certain minimum contacts \nwith [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \n“traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”’”  A defendant will be \nfound to have sufficient minimum contacts with North Carolina when he has \npurposefully availed [himself] of the priv ilege of conducting activities within \nthe forum state and invoked the benefits and protections of the laws of North \nCarolina. The relationship between the defendant and the forum state must be \nsuch that the defendant should “reasonably anticipate being haled into” a \n \n \nNorth Carolina court. The facts of each case determine whether the defendant’s \nactivities in the forum state satisfy due process. \n \nRauch v. Urgent Care Pharm., Inc., 178 N.C. App. 510, 517-18 (2006) (citations omitted).   \n24. Defendants do not dispute that the long-arm statute, G.S. § 1-75.4, would \nprovide a basis for asserting jurisdiction over Reddam if the concerns of due process were \nsatisfied. Instead, Defendants contend that  Reddam does not have sufficient minimum \ncontacts with North Carolina to provide a basis for this Court to exercise personal jurisdiction \nover him.  It is undisputed that Reddam has never lived in or visited North Carolina, has no \nproperty or bank accounts in the State, and that he never interacted directly with any North \nCarolina residents in relation to the activities of CashCall, WS Funding, or Delbert.16  \n25. Plaintiff argues that the acts of CashCall, WS Funding, and Delbert should be \nattributed to Reddam for determining his mini mum contacts with North Carolina, because \nthose corporations were mere “i nstrumentalities” of Reddam.  See State ex rel. Cooper v. \nRidgeway Brands Mfg., 362 N.C. 431, 438-40 (2008).   Plaintiff alleges that Reddam “was the \nsole owner and shareholder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of CashCall; the \nPresident and sole member, manager, and owner of WS Funding; and the Director and owner \nof Delbert. . . . Mr. Reddam directed, contro lled, and had managerial responsibility for the \nactivities of CashCall, WS Funding, and Delb ert, including the unlawful practices alleged \nherein.”17  Plaintiff contends that through Cash Call, WS Funding, and Delbert, Reddam \n“‘purposefully directed’” his activities at residents of North Carolina, and “the [matter before \nthe Court] resulted from alleged injuries that ‘ar[ose] out of or relate[d] to’ those activities.’” \nMeyer v. Race City Classics, LLC , __ N.C. App. __, __, 761 S.E.2d 196, 201 (2014) (quoting \n                                                 \n16 Aff. of J. Paul Reddam (Mar. 23, 2015). \n17 Compl. ¶ 11. \n \n \nBurger King v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472 (1985)); see also Columbia Briargate Co. v. First \nNat’l Bank, 713 F.2d 1052 (4th Cir. 1983). \n26. In North Carolina, “[t]he general rule is that in the ordinary course of business, \na corporation is treated as distinct from its shareholders.” Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, 362 \nN.C. at 438. In proper circumstances, however,  a court can look behind the corporate form \nand disregard the corporation’s sepa rate and independent existence. Id. at 438-39. Our \nappellate courts have repeatedly cautioned that disregarding the corporate form, or piercing \nthe corporate veil, is a remedy that “should be invoked only in an extreme case where \nnecessary to serve the ends of justice.” Dorton v. Dorton , 77 N.C. App. 667, 672 (1985).  \n“Piercing the corporate veil . . . allows a plainti ff to impose legal liability for a corporation’s \nobligations, or for torts committed by the corporation, upon some other company or individual \nthat controls and dominates a corporation.” Green v. Freeman , 367 N.C. 136, 145 (2013). \nCourts will pierce the corporate veil to prev ent the misuse of the corporate form for a \nfraudulent purpose or to avoid an unconscionable result. See Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC , \n362 N.C. at 438-39. \n27. In order to pierce the corporate veil, a party must show “that the corporation \nis so operated that it is a mere instrumentality or alter ego  of the sole or dominant \nshareholder and a shield for his activities in violation of the declared public policy or statute \nof the State.” Green, 367 N.C. at 145 (citation omitted). The “instrumentality rule” inquiry \ninvolves three elements:  \n(1) Control, not mere majority or comp lete stock control, but complete \ndomination, not only of finances, but of policy and business practice in \nrespect to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this \ntransaction had at the time no separate  mind, will or existence of its own; \nand \n(2) Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or \nwrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, \nor a dishonest and unjust act in contravention of [a] plaintiff’s legal rights; \nand \n \n \n(3) The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury \nor unjust loss complained of. \n \nId. at 145-46 (internal citations omitted).  Facto rs relevant to the Court’s analysis include \n“inadequate capitalization, noncompliance with corporate formalities, lack of a separate \ncorporate identity, excessive fragmentation, siphoning of funds by the dominant shareholder, \nnonfunctioning officers and directors, and absence of corporate records.” Id. at 145 (internal \ncitations omitted). \n28. The Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to make a sufficient showing that \nCashCall, WS Funding, and Delbert were mere instrumentalities of Reddam such that the \n“corporate veil” should be pierced and their acts  imputed to him.  Plaintiff does not allege, \nand has not presented any evidence, that Redd am disregarded corporate formalities, was \nundercapitalized, failed to keep records, or many of the other indicia that a corporation is an \n“alter ego” of a shareholder. In fact, the exhi bits to the affidavit th at Plaintiff offered in \nsupport of exerting jurisdiction suggest t hat Reddam regularly maintained and updated \nbusiness filings required by law, an indication  that corporate formalities were at least \nfollowed to a degree. 18 Nor has Plaintiff alleged specif ic facts regarding how Reddam \nexercised day-to-day domination and control over CashCall, WS Funding and Delbert.  While \nPlaintiff’s allegations and evidence suggest that Reddam was significantly involved in \ndirecting the three companies, they do not es tablish that he so dominated and controlled \nthem that they lost their separate corporate identities. Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss Reddam pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) for la ck of personal jurisdiction should be \nGRANTED.  \n \n                                                 \n18 Aff. of Sara K. Weed (Apr. 13, 2015) Exs. 2-8. \n \n \nMotion to Dismiss Defendants on the Basis of Tribal Sovereign Immunity19 \n29. Defendants next contend in their Motion  to Dismiss that “this Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction because the State lacks legislative and adjudicative authority over \nthe loans at issue here” and “North Carolina does not have the power to regulate the conduct \nat issue” because it “occurred within the [CRST] Reservation in South Dakota.”20 Defendants \ncontend that the Court lacks jurisdiction because (1) Western Sky is a member of the CRST, \n(2) the Loan Agreements contain a choice-of-law  provision making CRST law the governing \nlaw, and (3) the Loan Agreements were entere d on tribal territory, because the agreements \nprovided that they were entered within the CR ST Reservation and the last act necessary to \nformation of the Loan Agreement occurred on  the CRST Reservation. In other words, \nDefendants’ argument is that North Carolina consumers voluntarily entered into the Loan \nAgreements with a member of the CRST on th e CRST Reservation, such that exercising \njurisdiction over this matter, and applying North Carolina’s law to the claims, would infringe \nupon CRST’s tribal sovereign immunity. \n30.  Plaintiff argues that Defendants are no t entitled to the protection of tribal \nsovereign immunity because Western Sky is no t a tribal member, the State is not bound by \nthe “choice-of-law” provision because it is not a party to the contracts, and the contracts were \nformed in North Carolina and are therefore within the reach of the applicable North Carolina \nstatutes.  In addition, Plaintiff contends that  North Carolina’s significant State interest in \n                                                 \n19 In their briefing, Defendants never settle on a specific label for the theory that they advocate, but \nrather at various times discuss doctrines including tribal sovereignty, tribal immunity, and \nabstention. Def. Br. at, e.g., 12, 14, and 16.  Nevertheless, the primary terminology Defendants use, \nand the primary thrust of their argument, seems to fall most squarely under the doctrine of tribal \nsovereign immunity and, accordingly, the Court will use this term when discussing Defendant’s \ninterrelated arguments. \n20 Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss states that it is brought pursuant only to North Carolina Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6), but both the Motion and Defendants’ brief in support expressly \nseek dismissal for lack of “subject matter jurisdiction.” Defs.’ Br. at 6.  Accordingly, the Court treats \nDefendants’ motion as one challenging subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). \n \n \nprotecting its citizens from usurious loan practices provides more than sufficient grounds for \nasserting jurisdiction over the claims raised by this action. \n31. The United States Supreme Court has held  that the “sovereignty that Indian \nTribes retain is of a uni que and limited character.” Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family \nLand and Cattle Co. , 554 U.S. 316, 327 (2008) (quoting United States v. Wheeler , 435 U.S. \n313, 323 (1978)). “It centers on the land held by the tribe and on tribal members within the \nreservation.” \nId.  A tribal sovereign authority generally  does not extend to non-members of \nthe tribe who come within their borders. Id. at 328.  The Supreme Court, however, identified \ntwo exceptions to this general rule: (1) “A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or \nother means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe \nor its members, through commercial dealing, co ntracts, leases, or other arrangements;” and \n(2) “A tribe may also retain inherent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-\nIndians on fee lands within its reservation when  that conduct threatens or has some direct \neffect on the political integrity, the economic se curity, or the health or welfare of the tribe.” \nMontana v. United States , 450 U.S. 544, 565-66 (1981). In other words, while tribal \nsovereignty is limited, it will be  found to apply to “the powers of self-government . . . [that] \ninvolve only the relations among members of a tribe,” so long as it is not the “exercise of tribal \npower beyond what is necessary to pr otect tribal self-government . . . .” Id. at 564-65 \n(emphasis in original). \n32. Defendants contend that Western Sky is a member of the CRST because Webb, \nWestern Sky’s sole owner, is a member of the tribe. 21 Defendants appear to argue that \n                                                 \n21 Defs.’ Br. at 6-7 (citing Cheyenne River Tele. Co. v. Pearman, 89-006-A, at 3 (CRST Ct. App. \n1990)). \n \n \nbecause Western Sky is a tribal member, it is  exempt from the authority of this Court. 22 \nDefendants further contend that CashCall, WS Funding, and Delbert are also protected as \nassignees of the loans and, accordingly, “stand in the shoes” of Western Sky. 23 Plaintiff \ncontends that Western Sky is not member of  the CRST merely by virtue of Webb’s tribal \nmembership, and notes a number of courts in other jurisdictions that have reached this \nconclusion.24  Plaintiff also argues that Western Sky is not a tribal “arm of CRST.”25 \n33. The Court, however, need not decide the question of whether Western Sky \nenjoys status as a tribal member, because even if Western Sky is a tribal member, that status \ndoes not automatically preclude this Court’s jurisdiction. Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U.S. 353, 361-\n62 (2001) (“[T]he Indians’ right to make their own laws and be governed by them does not \nexclude all state regulatory authority on the reservation. . . . When . . . state interests outside \nthe reservation are implicated, states may regula te the activities even of tribe members on \ntribal land.”); Puyallup Tribe v. Dept. of Game , 433 U.S. 165, 171 (1977) (“[R]egardless of \ntribal sovereign immunity, individual defend ant-members of the Puyallup Tribe remain \namenable to the process of the [state] courts in  connection with . . . activities occurring off \ntheir reservation.”). Far more dispositive is wh ere the conduct at issue in the lawsuit took \nplace, and the extent to which North Carolina’ s interests are implicated by that conduct. \nNevada, 533 U.S. at 362; Puyallup, 433 U.S. at 171;  see also Pourier v. S.D. Dep’t of Rev. , \n658 N.W.2d 395 (S.D. 2003), aff’d in part and vacated in part on other grounds, 674 N.W.2d \n314 (2004) (finding that a business incorporated  under South Dakota law, but owned by a \n                                                 \n22 Id. at 7-8 (“Western Sky enjoys the protections and privileges of tribal membership, including \nfreedom from North Carolina’s attempt to assert legislative and adjudicative jurisdiction over on-\nReservation conduct.”). \n23 Id.

Supp. 843, 846 (W.D.N.C. 1986)). \nDefendants do not cite any authority for the proposition that tribal immunity can be assigned by a \ntribal member to a non-member. \n24 Pl.’s Br. at 4-5. \n25 Id. at 6-7. \n \n \ntribal member and operating solely on the re servation, was exempt from a South Dakota \nmotor fuel tax). But see Wash v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. \n134 (1980) (upholding a state tax for on-reservation cigarette sales to consumers who did not \nbelong to the tribe). \n34. In this case, it is the loan transactions between Defendants and the citizens of \nNorth Carolina that are at issue.  Accordingly, in order to determine where the transactions \ntook place, the Court must determine the loca tion that the loan contracts at issue were \nformed.  “The general principle . . . is that ordinarily the execution, interpretation and validity \nof a contract is to be determined by the law of the State or county in which it is made.” Bundy \nv. Comm. Credit Co., 200 N.C. 511, 516 (1931). As Defendants contend, the acceptance by one \nparty of the other party’s offer is usually the “last act” to formation of a contract, and courts \nhave generally identified the location of th is acceptance as the location of contract \nformation.26 Id. at 515; Liberty Fin. Co. v. N. Augusta Computer Store, Inc. , 100 N.C. App. \n279, 285 (1990). \n35. Defendants argue that the loan contract was not formed until Western Sky \nreviewed the signed Loan Agreement returned  by the North Carolina borrower and decided \nto offer funding.  In other words, Defendants contend that the borrower’s electronic return of \nthe Loan Agreement, after they already had  electronically signed and executed the \nagreement, constituted an offer that Western Sky accepted by “approving” the returned Loan \nAgreement.  Because Western Sky’s office is located on tribal grounds, Defendants argue, the \ncontract was formed on the reservation.  Defe ndants’ position, however, does not comport \nwith the allegations in the Complaint or the terms of the Loan Agreement. \n                                                 \n26 Defs.’ Br. at 8. \n \n \n36. Here, consumers applied to Western Sky for a loan either by submitting an \nonline application or by providing informatio n over the telephone.  Western Sky then \nrequested any additional financial information it needed from the consumer, reviewed it, and \ncommunicated its approval of the loan.  The Loan Agreement that Western Sky then sent to \nthe borrower expressly required the borrower to agree that by signing the Agreement, the \nborrower agreed to be bound by its terms, and that the signed Agreement “shall have the \nsame legal force and effect as a paper contract .”   The Loan Agreement did not contain any \nlanguage suggesting that the loan was contingent upon any further approval by Defendants.  \nThere also is nothing in the Complaint or in the record to support the contention that further \napproval or acceptance was required by Weste rn Sky after the borrower signed the Loan \nAgreement. Based on this information, the Court concludes that the allegations support a \nfinding that the last act necessary to format ion of the Loan Agreements occurred in North \nCarolina. Liberty Fin. Co., 100 N.C. App. at 285 (“[A] contract is made in the place where the \nlast act necessary to make it binding occurred.”). \n37. In addition, North Carolina’s usury statut e, which Plaintiff’s claims seek to \nenforce, specifically provides that  \n[f]or purposes of this Chapter, any extension of credit shall be deemed to have \nbeen made in this State, and therefore subject to the provisions of this Chapter \nif the lender offers or agrees in this State to lend to a borrower who is a resident \nof this State, or if such borrower accepts or makes the offer in this State to \nborrow, regardless of the situs of the contract as specified therein .” G.S. § 24-\n2.1(a) (emphasis added).   \n \nThe North Carolina Supreme Court has held t hat a contract “made in a foreign State or \ncountry with the intent and purpose to evade the usury laws of this State” is invalid and “the \ninterest laws of North Carolina are applicable.” \nBundy, 200 N.C. at 517-18 (citations \nomitted). Plaintiff clearly alleges that Defend ants are attempting to evade North Carolina’s \n \n \nconsumer protection and usury laws. 27  Accordingly, even if Defendants were able to prove \nthat the loan contracts were formed on the reservation, the Court finds nothing in the \npleadings or record to preclude North Carolina from exerting jurisdiction and applying North \nCarolina law to the loans at issue. \n38. Defendants also argue that the “choice of law” provision and the provision \nstipulating that that the contract was signed  on tribal grounds and subject to tribal law \npreclude jurisdiction by this Court. Plaintiff was not a party to the Loan Agreement, however, \nand this Court is not persuaded that Plaintiff is bound by a choice of law provision in a \ncontract to which it is not a party. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 294 (2002) \n(finding that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was not barred from bringing \nan enforcement action where the employee in question had signed an arbitration agreement \nwith his former employer, in part because “[i] t goes without saying that a contract cannot \nbind a nonparty”); Pa. Dep’t of Banking v. NCAS of Del. , LLC, 596 Pa. 638, 649, 948 A.2d \n752, 759 (2008) (holding in an action to enjoin defendant from violating state’s usury laws \nthat “the choice of law provision in [defend ant’s] contracts cannot bind the Department in \nthis action to enforce Pennsylvania public policy”); \nBankWest, Inc. v. Oxendine, 266 Ga. App. \n771, 775, 598 S.E.2d 343, 347 (2004) (“The parties to a private contract who admittedly make \nloans to Georgia residents cannot, by virtue of a choice of law provision, exempt themselves \nfrom investigation for potential viol ations of Georgia’s usury laws.”); Melia v. Zenhire, Inc ., \n462 Mass. 164, 172, 967 N.E.2d 580, 589 (2012) (noting the forum selection clause in a \ncontract entered into by a priv ate party would not limit the attorney general from filing an \nenforcement suit under the Massachusetts Wage Act in a Massachusetts court).  Accordingly, \nthe issue presented in this case is fundamentally different from the cases involving \n                                                 \n27 See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 2, 4. \n \n \nDefendants’ loan practices recently decided by federal district co urts in this State and cited \nby Defendants.  Brown v. W. Sky Fin., LLC , No. 1:13 CV 255, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11026 \n(M.D.N.C. Jan. 30, 2015); Spuller v. Cash Call, Inc. , No. 5:13-CV-806-D, 2014 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 181664 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 5, 2014); Milam v. Cash Call, Inc. , No. 5:13-CV-768-D \n(E.D.N.C. Mar. 4, 2014).28  Each of those cases involved private plaintiffs who were parties to \nthe loan agreements at issue, and who had agreed to the tribal forum and application of tribal \nlaw.  The courts enforced the forum selection clauses against the plaintiffs.  Those decisions \nare inapposite where, as here, Plaintiff was not a party to the Loan Agreements, but instead \nis acting as an enforcement arm of the State of North Carolina.   \n39. Finally, the Court notes that North Caro lina will not enforce a choice of law \nprovision in a contract where the chosen law wo uld “violate a fundamental policy of [North \nCarolina] of otherwise applicable law.” Behr v. Behr, 46 N.C. App. 694, 696 (1980). The North \nCarolina usury statute makes clear that “[i]t is the paramount public policy of North Carolina \nto protect North Carolina resi dent borrowers through the application of North Carolina \ninterest laws.” G.S. § 24-2.1(g).  There can be no question that, through this action, Plaintiff \nis seeking to protect important State interests. \n40. Whether the issue presented by Defendant s’ Motion is properly characterized \nas one of tribal immunity, tribal sovereignty,  or preemption (all terms used by Defendants \nbefore various tribunals and courts across th e United States in raising these same \narguments), the result remains the same.  Th e Defendants are not protected, nor is North \nCarolina prevented from asserting jurisdiction over Defendants, by the fact that Western Sky \nis owned by a Native American. “[A]ny atte mpt to broadly construe the extraterritorial \npreemptive force of tribal jurisdiction to govern off-reservation conduct of nonmembers or the \n                                                 \n28 Defs.’ Br. at 1. \n \n \nstates should be rejected – the Montana exceptions are narrow ones and cannot be construed \nin a manner that would swallow the rule.” In re Cash Call, Inc. , DIA Nos. 12IDB002, \n13IDB001, IDOB File No. 2012-NRR 2003-0154 (Iow a Div. of Banking, Apr. 23, 2014) \n(quoting Attorney’s Process & Investigation Servs., Inc. v. Sac & Fox Tribe of Miss. in Iowa , \n609 F.3d 927, 936 (8th Cir. 2010)).  Defendants voluntarily chose to do business in North \nCarolina with its citizens without regard for this State’s laws designed to protect North \nCarolina consumers.  The State’s interests here  justify the exercise of jurisdiction over \nDefendants.  \n41. Accordingly, for purposes of the Defe ndants’ Motion to Dismiss, the Court \nconcludes that the contracts were formed in North Carolina, that North Carolina law applies \nto this Court’s analysis, and that Plaintiff is not bound by the choice of law provisions of the \nLoan Agreement.  To the extent Defendants s eek dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims on the \ngrounds of tribal sovereign immunity, that motion should be DENIED. \nMotion to Dismiss Defendants on the Basis that North Carolina’s Enforcement of Its \nLaws Against Defendants Violates the Dormant Commerce Clause \n \n42. Defendants next argue that North Carolina’s attempt to regulate the loans at \nissue violates the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The \nDormant Commerce Clause “prevents a State from jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as \na whole by placing burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly \nwithin those borders would not bear.” \nAm. Trucking Ass’ns v. Mich. PSC, 545 U.S. 429, 433 \n(2005) (citations, quotations, and alterations omitted). In American Trucking, the Supreme \nCourt upheld a fee charged by the State of  Michigan to trucks engaging in intrastate \ncommerce, finding that the statute did not “unj ustifiably discriminate” against out-of-state \nentities or place a burden on interstate comme rce that was “clearly excessive in relation to \nthe putative local benefits.” 545 N.C. at 433-44.  \n \n \nThe distinction between the power of th e State to shelter its people from \nmenaces to their health or safety and  from fraud, even when those dangers \nemanate from interstate commerce, and its lack of power to retard, burden or \nconstrict the flow of such commerce for their economic advantage, is one deeply \nrooted in both our history and our law. \n \nD.H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara , 486 U.S. 24, 29-30 (1988) (quoting H.P. Hood & Sons v. Du \nMond, 336 U.S. 525, 533 (1949)). \n43. Defendants do not contend that the st atutes Plaintiff seeks to enforce \ndiscriminate against out-of-state lenders in favo r of North Carolina lenders, in violation of \nthe commerce clause.  See e.g., Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor \nAuth., 476 U.S. 573, 578-79 (1986).  Rather, Defendants argue that North Carolina is \nsomehow attempting to regulate  Defendants’ conduct outside of its borders by requiring \nDefendants to abide by North Carolina laws.29 Accordingly, the Court must consider whether \nthe regulations at issue here are excessive in  relation to the putative local benefit. Id. \n(“When . . . a statute has only indirect effe cts on interstate commerce and regulates \nevenhandedly, we have examined whether the State’s interest is legitimate and whether the \nburden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., \n397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). . . . [T]he critical consideration is the overall effect of the statute on \nboth local and interstate activity.”). \n44. Defendants also do not argue that North  Carolina lacks a legitimate interest \nin protecting its citizens from oppressive le nding and harassing collection practices.  The \nconsumer protection, usury and unfair trade practices statutes have been implemented to \nprotect North Carolina consumers, a purpose squar ely within this State’s ability to “shelter \nits people . . . from fraud.” \nSee also Aldens, Inc. v. Packel, 524 F.2d 38, 48-49 (3rd Cir. 1975) \n(“Congress has deferred to the states on the matter of maximum interest rates in consumer \n                                                 \n29 Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 17-18. \n \n \ncredit transactions.”); State of Minn. v. CashCall, Inc. , 2013 Minn. Dist. LEXIS 31, No. 27-\nCV-13-12740 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Sept. 6, 2013) (“[C ]ourts throughout the United States have \nconsistently allowed states to regulate the co ntent of loan contracts made by out-of-state \nlenders to resident borrowers.”). \n45. The statutes at issue do not attemp t to regulate conduct beyond North \nCarolina’s borders and do not unduly burden in terstate commerce.  The statutes do not \npurport to dictate the interest rates or other lending practices that Defendants apply in any \nstate other than North Carolina. See Brown-Forman Distillers Corp., 476 U.S. 573 (finding \nthat a New York law requiring out-of-state liquor producers to file monthly affirmation that \nprices offered to New York wh olesalers were no higher than the lowest prices offered to \nwholesalers in other states was unconstitutional where it had the effect of forcing producers \nto stop offering certain promotional pricing to  wholesalers outside of New York).  The Court \nconcludes, based on this analysis, that the State’s application of the relevant statutes to the \nloans at issue does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. \nDefendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) Motion \n46. Defendants also move to dismiss vari ous claims and parties under Rule \n12(b)(6).30  Specifically, Defendants argue the following: \na.  The Complaint fails to state a claim against CashCall and Delbert for violation of \nthe North Carolina usury statute (Count II) because CashCall and Delbert were \nnot parties to the loan. G.S. § 24-1.1(a).  Instead, they were merely “loan servicers” \nwho are not subject to liability under the Statute. \n                                                 \n30 Defendants also sought dismissal of claims against Reddam under Rule 12(b)(6).  Since the Court \nalready has determined that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Reddam, it will address the 12(b)(6) \nmotions only with regard to the appropriate remaining parties. \n \n \nb.  The two year statute of limitations app licable to claims under the usury statute \nbars Plaintiff from pursuing claims for relief on loans on which consumers ceased \nmaking payments or defaulted before December 16, 2011. \nc. The Complaint fails to state a claim for violation of the North Carolina Unfair and \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act (“UDTPA”) (i) as to all Defendants because it does \nnot allege consumers relied upon the representation that the loans were made by \nan Indian tribe and subject to CRST law, and (ii) as to CashCall, Delbert and WS \nFunding because there cannot be successo r or derivative liability under the \nUDTPA, and the Complaint does not allege that these parties had any connection \nto the alleged usurious loan.  \nThe Court will address each argument in turn. \n47. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion should be granted when the complaint, on its face, \nreveals (a) that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim, (b) the absence of facts sufficient to form \na viable claim, or (c) some fact which necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.  \nJackson v. \nBumgardner, 318 N.C. 172, 175 (1986). The facts and inferences set forth in the complaint \nshould be treated in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party . Ford v. Peaches Entm’t \nCorp., 83 N.C. App. 155, 156 (1986). As our Court of Appeals has noted, the “essential \nquestion” raised by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is “whether the complaint, when liberally \nconstrued, states a claim upon which relief can be granted on any theory.” Barnaby v. \nBoardman, 70 N.C. App. 299, 302 (1984), rev’d on other grounds , 313 N.C. 565 (1985) \n(citations omitted). \n48. The Court will first address the Defend ants’ arguments regarding the claim \nfor violation of the usury statute. The North Carolina usury statute establishes, among other \nthings, limits on the interest that may be charged on various types of loans. “To establish \nthat an agreement is usurious, it must be show n that (1) there was a loan, (2) there was an \n \n \nunderstanding that the money lent would be re turned, (3) for the loan a greater rate of \ninterest than allowed by law was charged, and (4) there was corrupt intent to take more than \nthe legal rate for the use of the money.” Bagri v. Desai , 83 N.C. App. 150, 151 (1986). The \npenalty for a knowing violation of the usury statute is forfeiture of all interest paid. Further, \nthe borrower or legal representatives of the borrower may recover twice the interest rate \npaid. G.S. § 24-2. \n49. Defendants argue that CashCall and Delb ert cannot be liable for violation of \nthe North Carolina usury statute because they are not parties to the contracts at issue. \nDefendants do not dispute that WS Funding, as a subsequent holder of the loans, would be \nliable if the contracts are found to be usurious.31 Plaintiff argues that North Carolina courts \nlook to the “substance” of an allegedly usurio us transaction in deciding whether the loan \nviolated usury law, and that Defendants here engaged in a “web of interrelated entities” \nthrough their common ownership. 32 Plaintiff contends that the Court should therefore find \nthat CashCall and Delbert may be liable under a veil piercing theory. \n50. In support of their argument, Defendants cite to In re Tetterton, 379 B.R. 594, \n600 (E.D.N.C. Bankr. 2007). In Tetterton, the “Notice of Assignment” sent by the defendant, \na loan servicer, to the plaintiff, a borrower who had recently filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, \nspecifically stated that the defendant was an a ssignee only as to the loan’s servicing rights. \nThe Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina declined to hold the servicer \nliable under the plaintiff’s claim that the loan that the servicer was pursuing was usurious. \nThe court found that the plaintiff did “not submit any authority, nor [was] the court aware of \nany, that could support extending successor liability for usury claims to assignees of servicing \n                                                 \n31 Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 19 (citing Auto Fin. Co. v. N.C. v. Simmons, 247 N.C. 724, 727 \n(1958)). \n32 Pl.s’ Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 21. \n \n \nrights who receive no benefi cial interest in the loan.” Id. The court compared the servicer’s \nstatus to a typical principal-agent relationsh ip, and concluded that the servicer was not \nindependently liable for performing within the course and scope of its agency.  \n51. Similarly, Defendants also cite to Dillon v. BMO Harris Bank, N.A., 16 F. Supp. \n3d 605 (M.D.N.C. 2014), in which the court di smissed a claim for aiding and abetting usury \nbrought by a borrower against banks that se rved as originating depository financial \ninstitutions in the loans at issue. In making its ruling, the court explicitly noted that the \nplaintiff “[did] not contend that the defend ants loaned him money at usurious rates,” but \nrather “contend[ed] that the defendants aided and abetted the lenders in making and \ncollecting usurious loans.” Id. at 619. The court concluded that no cause of action existed \nunder North Carolina law for aiding and abetti ng usury, and the claim was accordingly \ndismissed.  \n52. Plaintiff urges the Court to adopt authority finding that the “courts of this state \nregard the substance of a transaction, rather than its outward appearance,” when making a \ndetermination as to whether a loan violates usury law. State ex rel. Cooper v. NCCS Loans, \nInc., 174 N.C. App. 630, 634 (2005). The Court is not persuaded that this is sufficient to \novercome the plain statutory language stating t hat the usury statute applies to “the parties \nto a loan.” G.S. § 24-1.1. See Applewood Props., LLC v. New South Props., LLC, 366 N.C. 518, \n522 (2013) (stating that, when statutory langua ge is clear and unambiguous, courts should \ngive effect to the plain meaning of the statute). \n53.  Nonetheless, the Court finds the facts at bar to be distinguishable from both \nTetterton and Dillon. Here, Plaintiff, bringing this laws uit in its enforcement capacity, has \nalleged that “Defendants have regularly offered, made, collected, and are continuing to collect \n \n \non, illegal unsecured loans to North Carolina consumers.” 33 The Complaint explicitly \nincorporates findings of fact made by th e New Hampshire Banking Commissioner in its \nallegations, among them that CashCall “controls virtually all aspects of the lending process” \nand is the de facto lender for all Western Sky loans. 34 Unlike Tetterton and Dillon, the \nComplaint in this lawsuit explicitly alleges that Defendants have been involved with the \nloans at issue since their inception. \n54. Furthermore, as discussed above, the “ins trumentality rule” allows courts to \ndisregard corporate formalities between affiliated companies when the companies are shown \nto be so interrelated that one controls another , that control is complete and used to commit \nthe fraud or wrong, and the control proximately caused the injury or loss complained of. See, \ne.g., Glenn v. Wagner , 313 N.C. 450 (1985). The Court concludes that allegations in the \nComplaint indicate a relationship between Delbert, CashCall, and WS Funding, particularly \nin light of their shared ownership and busin ess address, that could support a factual \nconclusion that WS Funding is an instrume ntality of CashCall and Delbert. The Court \ntherefore declines to adopt Defendants’ argument that the usury claim should be dismissed \nas to CashCall and Delbert. \n55. Defendants also argue that Plaintiff is  barred from asserting a claim on any \nloan last paid prior to December 16, 2011. The st atute of limitations for claims for usurious \nloans is two years, though the relevant date for calculation of the statute of limitations \ndepends on the type of relief that the plaintiff seeks. G.S. §§ 24-2, 1-53(2), (3). Plaintiff argues \nthat its enforcement action is not limited by the fact that some of the loans were last paid \nprior to the two year statute of limitations, and that case law makes clear that “plaintiffs are \nrequired to show that within tw o years of filing their complaint \ndefendant charged or \n                                                 \n33 Compl. ¶ 12. \n34 Id. ¶¶ 18-21. \n \n \nplaintiffs paid a usurious fee.” Shepard v. Ocwen Fed. Bank, FSB , 361 N.C. 137, 140 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  \n56. “It is well settled that the statute of lim itations on the recovery of twice the \namount of interest paid [as permitted by the usury statute] begins to run upon payment of \nthe usurious interest.” Haanebrink v. Meyer , 47 N.C. App. 646, 648 (1980). However, “[a] \nusurious rate of interest is charged [such that  a creditor should be required to forfeit loan \ninterest] when the debtor agrees or promises to pay it. Hence, the signing of a note calling for \nusurious interest is a charging within the meaning of the statute which would cause the \nperiod of limitation to begin.” Id. at 650; see also Adams v. Beard Dev. Co. , 116 N.C. App. \n105, 108 (1994) (“‘[C]harging which constitutes a forfeiture under section 24-2 is the contract, \npromise, or agreement to a usurious rate of in terest, as opposed to the actual collection or \npayment of that interest.”). It follows that Plaintiff’s claim should be DISMISSED insofar as \nit seeks forfeiture of interest for notes signed on or before December 16, 2011, and insofar as \nit seeks double recovery of unlawful interest paid prior to December 16, 2011. Except as \ngranted herein, the Motion should be DENIED as to this claim. \n57. Next, as to the claim for violation of the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \nAct, Defendants argue that the claim should be dismissed insofar as it applies to CashCall, \nDelbert, and WS Funding, because there is no derivative or successor liability for violations \nof Chapter 75. Defendants further argue that Pl aintiff cannot state a claim for violation of \nChapter 75 based upon the contractual clauses identifying Western Sky as a tribal entity and \nseeking to apply CRST law without also allegi ng actual reliance on those misstatements. \nConversely, Plaintiff argues that Defendants CashCall, Delbert, and WS Funding were not \nunsuspecting successors, but were involved from the start, and that it is not required to show \nactual injury when bringing a claim for violations of Chapter 75 in its enforcement capacity. \n \n \n58. The Court has already found that the Complaint brings allegations against \n“Defendants” for making and collecting on the usurious loans. As discussed above, the \nallegations that Defendants orchestrated a network of loans, that CashCall was the de facto \nlender, and the apparent interrelatedness of th e companies, allow the Court to conclude at \nthis juncture that the UDTPA allegations as to all Defendants are sufficient to survive a \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. \n59. Finally, it has previously been said by the courts of North Carolina that \n“violations of statutes designed to protect the consuming public and violations of established \npublic policy may constitute unfair and deceptive practices.” NCCS Loans, Inc., 174 N.C. App. \nat 641 (quoting Stanley v. Moore, 339 N.C. 717, 723 (1995)) (finding that language in G.S. § \n24-2.1 identifying protection of North Carolina borrowers from usurious loans as “paramount \npublic policy,” combined with “clear violation” of that public policy, was sufficient to support \na violation of Chapter 75). Because a court should  view a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in \nthe light most favorable to the nonmovant, th e Court relies on its conclusion above that \nPlaintiff has stated a viable claim for violation of North Carolina’s usury statute to find that \nPlaintiff may have alleged a violation of the North Carolina UDTPA, and that Plaintiff need \nnot have alleged actual reliance to bring this claim. Accordingly, the Motion to Dismiss is \nDENIED as to the claim for violation of the North Carolina UDTPA. \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction \n60. Having addressed the Motion to Dismiss,  the Court now turns to Plaintiff’s \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiff’ s Motion seeks the following relief from the \nCourt:  \na. “[A] preliminary injunction [issued] pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-14 \nprohibiting Defendants, their agents, em ployees, and corporate successors or \nassigns, and any persons acting in co ncert with them, from: a) Advertising, \n \n \noffering, and/or entering into contracts to offer, fund, service, and/or collect on \nconsumer loans made to North Caro lina borrowers; b) Soliciting and/or \naccepting deposits or payments from North Carolina consumers for any loan \nproduct or service; c) Collecting upon any further payment, directly or \nindirectly, from North Carolina consum ers related to any loan product or \nservice; d) Selling or transferring any  loans with North Carolina consumers \ncurrently held by any Defendant to a third party; e) Destroying, transferring, \nconcealing, altering, or removing from their possession or control any financial \nrecords, consumer contracts, emails, correspondence, business records, and/or \nother documents of Defendants relating  to loans made to North Carolina \nconsumers; and/or f) Transferring, withdrawing, concealing, or encumbering \nany assets outside of the normal course of business of Defendants pending \nfurther order of the Court;”\n35 \nb. An order requiring Defendants to pr oduce to the Court and Plaintiff \ncertain written financial information within ten days of the Court’s order; and \nc. An order requiring Defendants to  establish an escrow account “to \nprovide full restitution to all affected consumers,” in which Defendants would \nbe “required to maintain a balance in that account equal to the amount of funds \ncollected to date which exceed payment of the principal plus 16% of the interest \nfor the loans issued to North Caroli na consumers by Defendants within the \npast six (6) years.” \n61. G.S. § 75-14 provides that “the Attorney  General may prosecute civil actions \nin the name of the State . . . to obtain a mandatory order, including (but not limited to) \n                                                 \n35 Mot. Prelim. Inj. 3-4. \n \n \npermanent or temporary injunctions . . . , to ca rry out the provisions of this Chapter.”  The \nAttorney General may enforce North Caroli na’s usury statute and Consumer Finance Act \nthrough an order obtained under G.S. 75-14.  See NCCS Loans, Inc. , 174 N.C. App. at 640-\n42. \n62. A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary measure that “will not be lightly \ngranted.” Travenol Labs., Inc. v. Turner, 30 N.C. App. 686, 692 (1976) (citation omitted).  To \nobtain such relief, a plaintiff must generally show “a likelihood of success on the merits of his \ncase and . . . [that] plaintiff is likely to sustain irreparable loss unless the injunction is issued, \nor if, in the opinion of the Court, issuance is necessary for the protection of his rights during \nthe course of litigation.”  Analog Devices, Inc. v. Michalski , 157 N.C. App. 462, 466 (2003) \n(citations omitted).  When the Attorney Gene ral brings an enforcement action “to vindicate \npublic interest rather than to redress indivi dual grievances,” however, a more lenient \nstandard may apply to the requirement of irrepa rable loss or harm, and the State need not \nshow “actual injury” to obtain an injunction; rather, the State-movant must show that the \n“act or practice complained of adversely affects the public interest.” State ex rel. Edmisten v. \nChallenge, Inc., 54 N.C. App. 513, 521-22 (1981). In Challenge, Inc., the court explicitly took \nnote of the fact that G.S. § 75-14 provides the Attorney General with the authority to obtain \nmandatory orders to enforce the North Caroli na Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act. \nId.; see also State ex rel. Ross v. Overcash , 2008 N.C. App. LEXIS 1669 (Sept. 16, 2008) \n(affirming an injunction issued in an enforcement action that required the defendant to close \na mining operation pending compliance with statut ory law, even in the absence of actual or \napparent injury). \n63. The movant bears the burden of establishing the right to a preliminary \ninjunction.  Pruitt v. Williams, 288 N.C. 368, 372 (1975). The issuance of an injunction is “a \n \n \nmatter of discretion to be exercised by the hearing judge after a careful balancing of the \nequities.” State ex rel. Edmisten v. Fayetteville St. Christian Sch., 299 N.C. 351, 357 (1980). \n64. The relief sought by Plaintiff is in the nature of both a prohibitory injunction \n(enjoining certain activities by Defendants in  North Carolina) and a mandatory injunction \n(requiring the production of financial records and the creation of an escrow account.) While \nmandatory injunctions generally are disfavored, under proper circumstances such relief may \nbe necessary and appropriate.  \nSee Roberts v. Madison Cnty. Realtors Ass’n., 344 N.C. 394, \n400 (1996).  An injunction that is mandator y in nature, rather than prohibitory, “will \nordinarily be granted only where the injury is immediate, pressing, irreparable, and clearly \nestablished.” Auto. Dealer Res., Inc. v. Occidental Life Ins. Co., 15 N.C. App. 634, 639 (1972).   \n65. Having already disposed of Defendant s’ arguments regarding Rule 12(b)(6) \nand the applicability of North Carolina law to the claims at bar, the overwhelming evidence \nbefore the Court indicates that consumers signed loans initiated and serviced by Defendants \nthat charge interest rates far above those permitted under North Carolina law. The State \nhas further produced evidence that Defend ants’ loans create significant, unsustainable \nfinancial burdens for vulnerable North Carolina consumers. See Overcash, 2008 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 1669 at *11 (holding that “findings as  to the ongoing and continuous statutory \nviolations . . . support the conclusion that [the defendant’s] mining operation without a permit \nwas injurious to the public interest”). \n66. The allegations and evidence before the Court at this stage of the case support \nthe conclusion that Plaintiff has established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims \nagainst Defendants.  In particular, there is no dispute that Defend ants are charging North \nCarolina consumers interest rates in excess of the rate permitted by North Carolina’s usury \nstatute, and that these activities provide a basi s to conclude that Plaintiff is also likely to \nsucceed on its claims under the North Carolina Consumer Finance Act and the North \n \n \nCarolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices A ct.  Accordingly, the Court must consider \nwhether Plaintiff has shown that the “act or pr actice complained of adversely affects the \npublic interest,” under the standard articulated in  Challenge, Inc. , or whether the State is \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm if Defendant s are not enjoined, under the more common \nstandard for obtaining injunctive relief. \n67. Again, it is undisputed that North Carolina consumers have been paying \ninterest on loans in an excessive rate, and mu st continue to do so unless Defendants are \nenjoined from making or collecting on those loans. As discussed supra, the North Carolina \nusury statute states that it is in the public  interest “to protect North Carolina resident \nborrowers through the application of North Caro lina interest laws.” G.S. § 24-2.1(g).  It \nfollows that violation of North Carolina’s interest laws “adversely affects the public interest,” \nand that Plaintiff has demonstrated a right to injunctive relief under Challenge, Inc.  \n68. In State ex rel. Morgan v. Dare to Be Great, Inc., 15 N.C. App. 275 (1972), the \nNorth Carolina Court of Appeals upheld an injunction granted against a company operating \nan illegal pyramid scheme on the basis that the State “through economic loss to its individual \ncitizens and residents [] may suffer immediate and irreparable injury unless the defendants \nare enjoined during the pendency of this action.” Id. at 276. The court noted that such an \ninjunction was appropriate under the Attorney General’s Chapter 75 enforcement authority, \neven though individual consumers could also be entitled to their own remedies. Accordingly, \nthe Court finds that Plaintiff has also esta blished a risk of irreparable harm typically \nrequired for obtaining injunctive relief. \n69. The Court therefore proceeds to analyze the relief sought by the Plaintiff.  \n70. Plaintiff’s requests for an order requi ring Defendants to create an escrow \naccount and to produce certain financial records are arguably intertwined. In its Reply Brief, \nPlaintiff states that the financial records that it  seeks would be “for the benefit of the Court \n \n \nin making the determination of the appropriate amount to place in an escrow fund.” 36 The \nCourt will therefore address these requests for relief together.  \n71. Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s request for the establishment of an escrow \naccount amounts to a request for payment before judgment. See Grupo Mexicano de \nDesarrollo v. Alliance Bond Fund, 527 U.S. 308, 329 (1999) (“[F]ederal courts in this country \nhave traditionally applied the principle that cou rts of equity will not, as a general matter, \ninterfere with the debtor’s disposition of hi s property at the instance of a nonjudgment \ncreditor.”). Defendants further note that th e escrow account would be implemented to \nfacilitate payment of monetary damages, which are as a matter of law not irreparable. \nPlaintiff contends that an escrow account is necessary “[t]o ensure adequate funds are \navailable for restitution to North Carolina consumers,” 37 identifying as cause for concern \nmoneys paid or that may potentially be pa id by Defendants pursuant to pending actions \nagainst Defendants in other jurisdictions.   \n72. The Court finds instructive several opin ions issued by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States regarding injunctive relief in the context of a debtor-creditor relationship, \nwhere the relief sought is frequently monetary. In Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp. , \n311 U.S. 282 (1940), the petitioners sued a company that had sold them stock certificates, \ncontending that the transaction was fraudulent, and alleging that the company was insolvent \nand was likely to make preferential payments  to other creditors. The Supreme Court found \nthat an injunction restraining the company from transferring or disposing of any assets was \nappropriate in light of the equitable nature of the claim for restitution asserted by the \npetitioners. Similarly, in United States v. First National City Bank, 379 U.S. 378 (1965), the \nCourt upheld an injunction enjoining the respondent from transferring any property or rights \n                                                 \n36 Reply Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 8. \n37 Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 26. \n \n \nto property, when the injunction was issued ba sed on a tax lien and a statute giving courts \nthe authority to issue injunctions to uphold internal revenue laws. The Court took specific \nnote of the “public interest involved,” noting that courts “may, and frequently do, go much \nfarther both to give and withhold relief in fu rtherance of the public interest than they are \naccustomed to go when only private interests are involved.” \nId. at 383 (quoting Virginian R. \nCo. v. Federation, 300 U.S. 515, 522 (1937)).  \n73. Conversely, in De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. v. United States , 325 U.S. \n212 (1945), the United States sought to enjoin  several corporations from removing their \nassets from the country pending resolution of antitrust claims. In support of the injunction, \nthe government argued that the corporations co uld “quickly withdraw their assets from the \nUnited States and so prevent enforcement of  any order or decree which this Court may \nrender.” Id. at 215. The Court found that the relief sought was inappropriate, because the \ninjunction would restrain “a matter lying wholly outside the issues in the suit.” Id. at 220.  \n74. Finally, Defendants analogize the case at bar to Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, \n527 U.S. 308, in which the Supreme Court of the United States reviewed the propriety of an \ninjunctive order precluding the petitioner, a Mexican holding company, from transferring its \nright to receive certain notes from the Mexi can government. The respondents, investment \nfunds who had purchased loan notes guaranteed by the petitioner’s subsidiaries, brought suit \nalleging breach of contract for the petitioner’s failure to make payments on the loan notes. \nThe respondents had obtained injunctive relief by alleging that the petitioner was or was \nabout to be insolvent, which would “frustra te any judgment” that the respondents might \nobtain. Id. at 312. \n75. The Supreme Court looked to precedent from courts of equity, and found that \ncreditors would traditionally only have a right to restrain a debtor’s property after obtaining \na judgment, thereby obtaining a “cognizable interest” in the property of the debtor. Id. at 319-\n \n \n20. The Court distinguished the facts of Grupo Mexicano from previous Supreme Court cases \nallowing injunctive relief over a party’s assets, noting that a judgment is typically required \nto establish a right to control a debtor’s prop erty, and ultimately concluded that it had “no \nauthority to craft a ‘nuclear weapon’ of the law like the one advocated here.” Id. at 332.  \n76. A review of this precedent indicates that a court may well have the authority \nto issue the type of mandatory injunctive relief Plaintiff seeks where the relief sought is based \nin equity and the petitioner has alleged a “cognizable interest” in the particular property or \nassets that would be affected by the injunction. See, e.g., United States v. Oncology Assocs., \n198 F.3d 489, 496 (4th Cir.1999) (“[W]hen the plaintiff creditor asserts a cognizable claim to \nspecific assets of the defendant or seeks a re medy involving those assets, a court may in the \ninterim invoke equity to preserve the status quo pending judgment where the legal remedy \nmight prove inadequate and the preliminary re lief furthers the court’s ability to grant the \nfinal relief requested.”). \n77. Applying this analysis to the facts before the Court, it is true that at least some \nportion of the relief that Plaintiff seeks in its Complaint is equitable in nature. 38  \nNevertheless, the Court is skeptical that th e State may assert an equitable interest in \nDefendants’ assets prior to the entry of judgment, where it is seeking monetary remedies on \nbehalf of private citizens. Unlike First National City Bank, 379 U.S. 378, the “public interest” \ninvolved here is not tax money owed  to the government. Similarly, in Oncology Associates., \n198 F.3d 489, the federal government soug ht reimbursement and other remedies for \npayments fraudulently obtained by the defendants from Medicare and other federal \nprograms. 198 F.3d at 492.  The Court is not convinced that in this action the State may \n                                                 \n38 Compl. ¶¶ 58, 64. \n \n \nstand in the position of “creditor” for purpos es of asserting an equitable interest in \nDefendants’ property and assets.  \n78. The Court need not decide this question, however, as it does not believe that \nPlaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to justify the imposition of this mandatory \ninjunctive relief on Defendants. Plaintiff has not alleged, much less produced any evidence, \nthat Defendants are seeking to reallocate assets  to shield those assets in the event of a \njudgment, that Defendants’ assets are diminish ing, or that Defendant s’ liabilities exceed \ntheir assets. Instead, Plaintiff urges the Co urt to conclude that an escrow account is \nappropriate equitable relief based upon solely upon the potential financial impact of other \npending actions and settlements involving Wes tern Sky in other jurisdictions. Rather, \nPlaintiff has conceded that, roughly a year and a half after this case was filed and four months \nafter entry of the Case Management Order, it had not served any written discovery requests \nto Defendants that would permit it to determine the need for such a drastic remedy. Plaintiff \nhas not provided the Court with any basis to conclude that the escrow account, which would \nimpose a significant restraint on Defendants’ assets, is necessary or appropriate. See Roberts, \n344 N.C. at 401 (“A court of equity traditionally has discretion to shape the relief in accord \nwith its view of the equities or hardships of the case.”). \n79. Ultimately, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that it is entitled to the mandatory \nrelief sought, even with the more generous standard established in Challenge, Inc. The Court \nconcludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that Plaintiff’s request for an injunction mandating \nthe establishment of an escrow account and requiring Defendants to produce certain financial \ninformation should be DENIED. \n80. The Court now moves to the remaining injunctive relief sought. Generally, \nPlaintiff seeks an order prohibiting Defendants fr om advertising, soliciting for and entering \ninto any new loan agreements in North Carolina; destroying, concealing or altering financial \n \n \nrecords and other documents relevant to the claims in this lawsuit; selling or transferring to \nany third party existing loans it has with  North Carolina consumers; and “transferring, \nwithdrawing, concealing, or encumbering any assets outside of the normal course of \nbusiness.”  Plaintiff also seeks to prohibit Defe ndants from continuing to collect on existing \nloans to North Carolina consumers. \n81. The Court concludes that Plaintiff’s request that Defendants be enjoined from \n“transferring, withdrawing, concealing, or encu mbering any assets outside of the normal \ncourse of business” is akin to the request for mandatory relief upon which the Court has \nalready ruled. Accordingly, the Court concludes that this portion of the Motion should also \nbe DENIED.  \n82. The Court, however, reaches a different  result with regard to Plaintiff’s \nrequests for other prohibitory injunctive relief.  As discussed above, the Court is persuaded \nthat Plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its Claims, the threat \nof irreparable injury if Defendants are not enjoined from continuing to make loans, and that \ncontinued loan activity in North Carolina wo uld be adverse to the public interest. \nFurthermore, Defendants themselves have stated that Western Sky ceased making loans in \nNorth Carolina “months before the Complaint was filed,” 39 indicating that a restriction on \nDefendants’ ability to initiate new loans would not be a significant hardship.  \n83. In light of the foregoing, the Court conc ludes that it is appropriate to enjoin \nDefendants from engaging in activity that woul d result in the creation of new loans or the \ncollection of payments on those that already ex ist, in addition to restraining Defendants’ \nability to destroy evidence that may be relevant to Plaintiff’s claims.  \n                                                 \n39 Defs.’ Opp. Mot.
