Barrow, Jr., Esq. for Plaintiff.  \n \nPatterson Dilthey, LLP by Ronald C. Dilthey, Esq. for Defendants.   \n \nJolly, Judge.  \n \n \n \n \n \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY  \n[1] On January 19, 2006, Plaintiff filed his Compla int in Wake County.  In the \nComplaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes of action (\"Claim(s)\"): (a) First Claim – \nBreach of Contract; (b) Second Claim – Declaratory Judgment; (c) Third Claim – \nViolation of Chapter 57C of the North Carolina General Statutes; (d) Fourth Claim – \nBreach of Fiduciary; (e) Fifth Claim –  Constructiv e Fraud; (f) Sixth Claim – Fraud; (g) \nSeventh Claim – Conversion; (h) Eighth Claim – Deri vative Action – Lewis Financial \nManagement, LLC; (i) Ninth Claim – Derivative Actio n – LFM Operating Company, LLC; \n(j) Tenth Claim – Injunctive Relief; (k) Eleventh C laim – Negligence; (l) Twelfth Claim – \nDissolution and Sale of Enterprise; (m) Thirteenth Claim – Meiselman Claim; (n)  \nFourteenth Claim – Removal of Manager; (o) Fifteent h Claim – Accounting and (p) \nSixteenth Claim – Constructive Trust. \n[2] On April 4, 2008, Defendants filed their Motion  to Dismiss, Answer and \nCounterclaim.  On April 10, 2008, Defendants filed their First Amended Motion to \nDismiss, Answer and Counterclaim (\"Answer\").1  In their Answer, Defendants allege the \nfollowing counterclaim causes of action (\"Counterclaim(s)\"): (a) First Counterclaim – \nNegligence; (b) Second Counterclaim – Breach of Con tract; (c) Third Counterclaim – \nBreach of Implied Contract; (d) Fourth Counterclaim – Violation of Trade Secrets \nProtection Act; (e) Fifth Counterclaim – Declarator y Judgment; (f) Sixth Counterclaim – \nViolation of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C; (g) Seventh Counterclaim – Constructive Fraud; (h) \nEighth Counterclaim – Fraud and (i) Ninth Countercl aim – Conversion. \n                                                 \n1 Because Defendants did not brief their Motion to Dismiss as required by Rule 15.2 of the General Rules \nof Practice and Procedure for the North Carolina Business Court (\"BCR\"), the court deems this motion to \nbe abandoned and does not consider it herein.   \n[3] On May 6, 2009, Plaintiff filed his Reply to Counterclaim, in which he \nmoved to dismiss Defendants' Counterclaims pursuant to Rule 12(b) and responded to \nthe substantive allegations of the Counterclaims. 2 \n[4] On June 11, 2009, Defendants filed their Motion  for Summary Judgment \n(\"Defendants' Motion\"). 3 \n[5] On June 15, 2009, Plaintiff filed his Motion fo r Summary Judgment \n(\"Plaintiff's Motion\"). 4  \n[6] On October 19, 2009, Plaintiff filed a motion t o strike affidavits of \nDefendant Douglas J. Lewis and Kenneth Martin, both filed on October 9, 2009.  The \ncourt denied this motion at a hearing on January 6, 2010.     \n[7] The Motions have been briefed, argued and are r ipe for adjudication. 5  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n[8] Unless otherwise indicated herein, the material  facts reflected in \nparagraphs 9 through 47 of this Opinion and Order exist, are undisputed 6 and are \npertinent to the issues raised by the Motions. \n                                                \n \n2 Because Plaintiff did not brief his Motion to Dism iss as required by BCR 15.2, the court deems such \nMotion to Dismiss to have been abandoned and does n ot consider it herein.  \n3 Defendants move for summary judgment dismissal of each of Plaintiff's Claims.  They do not seek \nsummary judgment in their favor as to any of their Counterclaims. \n4 Plaintiff moves for summary judgment dismissal of each of Defendants' Counterclaims.  Plaintiff also \nmoves for summary judgment in his favor with regard  to one or more of his Claims, but it is unclear from \nPlaintiff's briefs whether he intends his Motion to seek judgment in his favor as to all or only some of his \nClaims.  For purposes of this Opinion and Order, the court will deem Plaintiff's Motion to seek such relief \nas to all of Plaintiff's Claims.   \n5 The court recognizes that certain of Plaintiff's C lams and Defendants' Counterclaims are derivative in \nnature.  However, except with regard to Plaintiff's  Eight and Ninth Claims, neither party has raised an \nissue regarding standing of the Plaintiff or Defendants to allege a derivative Claim or Counterclaim.  The \ncourt does not undertake an analysis of standing or derivative issues in this Opinion and Order, but w ill \nconsider them if raised at trial. \n6 It is not proper for a trial court to make findings of fact in determining a motion for summary judgm ent \nunder Rule 56.  However, it is appropriate for a Rule 56 order to reflect material facts that the court \nconcludes exist and are not disputed, and which sup port the legal conclusions with regard to summary \njudgment.

Lewis (\"Douglas Lewis\") is a citize n and resident of Wake \nCounty, North Carolina.  \n[11] Linda P. Lewis (\"Linda Lewis\") is a citizen an d resident of Wake County, \nNorth Carolina.    \n[12] LFM Operating Company, LLC (the \"Operating Com pany\") was a North \nCarolina limited liability company, which was dissolved on January 1, 2005.   \n[13] Lewis Financial Management, LLC (the \"Financia l Company\") is a North \nCarolina limited liability company (collectively, the Operating Company and the \nFinancial Company are referred to as the \"Defendant Companies\"). \n[14] For many years prior to 1999, Douglas Lewis di d business as Lewis \nFinancial Management (\"Lewis Financial Management\").7  Douglas and Linda Lewis \nproduced a radio program on WPTF called \"Money Matters with Doug and Linda,\" \nwhich they used for advertising and marketing.  Douglas Lewis also was engaged in the \nfinancial services industry including, but not limited to, providing investment advice as a \nRegistered Investment Advisor and selling securities and insurance.  Linda Lewis \nworked with Douglas Lewis in the business and was an active part of the business.   \n[15] Smith was employed in the securities industry when he first met Douglas \nLewis, who was also in the securities business.  Smith's business was primarily located \nin Moore County, North Carolina, and was known as Tax Deferred Retirement Planners, \nInc. (\"TDRP\"), a North Carolina corporation.  \n                                                \n \n7 At various times, the parties loosely refer to the Defendant Companies as Lewis Financial Management.  \n[16] In October 1998, Douglas Lewis sought to emplo y and affiliate Smith with \nLewis Financial Management.  Douglas Lewis promised Smith income in excess of \n$200,000 per year. 8  He also promised and fulfilled his promise to train and mentor \nSmith. \n[17] Subsequently, Smith voluntarily agreed to relo cate his family from Moore \nCounty to Raleigh, North Carolina. \n[18] On January 30, 1999, Douglas Lewis and Smith e ntered into a \n\"MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT\" (the \"Agreement\").9  The unsigned Agreement \nstates, \"[t]he period of this agreement will be for one year, to be reviewed at the end \nthereof to see if it has proven successful and can be formatted into a permanent, long-\nterm arrangement.\"  The Agreement also discusses the treatment of clients should \"the \narrangement between Troy and LFM . . . not continue in the future.\" \n[19] Sometime after Smith began working for Lewis F inancial Management, he \nasked his brother, Brady Smith, to sell financial products for TDRP and to assist him in \nupdating the computer systems at Lewis Financial Management. 10  \n[20] On February 5, 2001, the Defendant Companies w ere formed.  The law \nfirm of Wyrick, Robbins, Yates & Ponton, LLP (\"Wyrick Robbins\") prepared numerous \ndocuments relating to the Defendant Companies and revised such documents many \ntimes.  The parties at various times signed signature pages for operating agreements \nand other documents.  These documents continue to be held in escrow by Wyrick \nRobbins. \n                                                \n \n8 Answer 26, ¶¶ 6, 7; Reply Countercl. ¶ 7.  \n9 See  Defs. Mem. Supp. Mot.

Lewis, Troy M. Smith, and Linda P. Lewis).\"12   The letter informed clients \nthat their \"present advisory contracts with Lewis Financial Management will be assigned \nover to [the Financial Company].\"13  \n[22] All revenue from the Financial Company, Dougla s and Linda Lewis and \nSmith was paid into the Operating Company pursuant to agreement among the \nparties. 14  \n[23] Douglas and Linda Lewis had no entitlement to any portion of the \nrevenues or profits of TDRP. 15   It is undisputed that neither Douglas nor Linda Lewis \nwere to have any equity interest in TDRP.16   However, Smith testified that TDRP has \ncontributed capital to and became owner of a class of shares of the Operating \nCompany.17   \n[24] At times material, the Operating Company \"paid  salaries, and provided \nother benefits typically provided by employers, to employees providing services to [the \nFinancial Company] and TDRP.\"18    \n[25] During Smith's association with the Defendant Companies, Douglas and \nLinda Lewis traveled frequently to Israel and resided there for extended periods of \n                                                 \n11  T.

Following their return, they increased their involvement in the daily \noperations of the Defendant Companies. \n[31] Subsequently, also in early 2003, the parties had discussions concerning \nthe sale of the Defendant Companies to Smith.32   About this time, Douglas Lewis \nadvised Smith that he no longer desired TDRP to be associated in any way with Lewis \nFinancial Management. 33   \n[32] Later in 2003, Smith and Douglas and Linda Lew is received from Wyrick \nRobbins copies of all documents, including signature pages, for which fees had been \n                                                 \n27  Id.  \n28  Pl.

One or more of the documents were dated October \n5, 2001.  \n[33] On August 21, 2003, Douglas and Linda Lewis pr ovided a letter to Smith \nin which the couple stated, \"we do not have peace at the present time to sell equity in \nthe business\" and \"we feel the need to terminate our arrangement.\" 35   In the letter, they \nsuggested that \"[s]ince [they and Smith] spent much time in discussions with Wyrick \nRobbins considering what we would do if we ever reached this point, it is probably wise \nif we follow the procedures in the documents they produced for us.\"  Douglas and Linda \nLewis then pointed to the Operating Company's documents, contending that such \ndocuments: \n[S]peak to the removal of a manager \"with cause\": c ause \nbeing a \"material breach . . . which has the effect  of harming \nthe revenues of the business . . . [and] the other members.\"  \nHowever, they also speak to a resignation of a mana ger \n(para #3.4), and to the removal of a manager \"witho ut \ncause.\"  Further in the documents there are paragra phs that \ndeal with redemption and valuation of units . . . .   According \nto the pertinent paragraphs, once you are no longer  the \nmanager, you then offer the remaining members, the \nopportunity to exercise their purchase options.  Un der these \noptions they (we) buy out your interests in both of the LLCs.  \n \nThe price of the units of each LLC is the higher of  your \ncapital account or $100.

Smith had no active involvement in the Defendant Companies on or after \nSeptember 30, 2003. 37   Since that day, Smith received no profits or distributions from \nthe activities of the Defendant Companies.

App. 729, 733 \n(1998).   \nTHE PARTIES' CONTENTIONS  \n[46] Plaintiff contends, among other things, that ( a) Douglas and Linda Lewis \nconverted Plaintiff's membership interest in the Defendant Companies; (b) Douglas and \nLinda Lewis wrongfully repudiated an implied contract between the parties to share \nprofits one-third (1/3) each; (c) Douglas and Linda Lewis are liable for breach of \nfiduciary duty; (d) Plaintiff is entitled to the enforcement of his rights under G.S. 57C; (e) \nDouglas and Linda Lewis should be ordered to render a full accounting for all activities \n                                                 \n54  Hurvitz Dep. 3:22-23; 4:9-10; 7:24-8:1.

Id.  13:25-\n14:3.  \nof the Defendant Companies after September 30, 2003 and (f) Douglas and Linda Lewis \nare liable for unfair and deceptive trade practices under Chapter 75. 55   \n[47] Defendants contend, among other things, that ( a) many of Plaintiff's claims \nare based on the false assumption that he is the owner of and had an interest in the \nDefendant Companies;56  (b) the parties' business arrangement was terminated on \nAugust 21, 2003; (c) Plaintiff has failed to produce sufficient evidence as to any \nmisrepresentations made by Defendants that were reasonably calculated to deceive \nand made with an intent to deceive; (d) Plaintiff did not have any rights or ownership in \nthe distributions from the Defendant Companies; (e) declaratory judgment relief is \ninappropriate; (f) Plaintiff does not have standing to bring a derivative action against \nDouglas and Linda Lewis; (g) there was no fiduciary relationship between Plaintiff and \nDouglas and Linda Lewis; (h) Plaintiff has no claim for relief under the doctrine of \nconstructive fraud; (i) Plaintiff has failed to allege and offer any evidence that Douglas \nand Linda Lewis breached a legally recognized duty to Plaintiff; (j) there is no separate \nclaim for relief under Meiselman  and (k) all claims for relief against the Defendant \nCompanies should be dismissed because Plaintiff's attacks are directed solely at the \nconduct of Douglas Lewis.    \n                                                \n \n55  The court does not consider a Chapter 75 claim herein because Plaintiff did not allege such a claim in \nhis Complaint.   \n56  Def. Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 5 (referring to Plaintiff's Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nEleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Sixteenth Claims).  \nDISCUSSION  \nPlaintiff's Claims  \nPlaintiff's Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Eleventh,  \nTwelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Sixteenth Claims  \n \n[48] Each of these Claims by Plaintiff fundamentall y rests upon Plaintiff's \ncontention that he was a member with an ownership interest in the Defendant \nCompanies by virtue of his capital contributions, and that his ownership interest \ncontinued after September 30, 2003.  Accordingly, the court elects to group them for \npurposes of this Opinion and Order.  Plaintiff's First, Second, Sixth and Tenth Causes of \nAction will be dealt with individually. \n[49] Based upon the forecast of evidence before it,  the court CONCLUDES \nthat as to each such Claim, there exist one or more genuine issues of material fact with \nregard to this threshold contention.  Neither Plaintiff nor Defendants are entitled to \nsummary judgment as to said Claims, and as to each of them the respective Motions \nshould be DENIED.57  \nPlaintiff's First Claim –  Breach of Contract  \n[50] In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that (a) t he parties established a contract \nby course of dealing, whereby the net profits of the Defendant Companies would be \ndivided equally among Smith and Douglas and Linda Lewis; (b) by their dominion and \ncontrol over the Defendant Companies, Douglas and Linda Lewis caused these \ncompanies to breach their contract for division of the profits and (c) Douglas and Linda \nLewis themselves breached their agreement with Smith by failing to distribute to him \n                                                 \n57  Further analysis as to these Claims is not necessary for the purposes of this Opinion and Order.   \none-third (1/3) of the operating profits from the Defendant Companies and by failing to \ndistribute any profits to him from activities arising on or after September 30, 2003. \n[51] In his Motion, Plaintiff argues that the follo wing facts are not disputed: (a) \nthe three (3) members divided profits equally in 2001, 2002 and 2003 (through \nSeptember 30, 2003); (b) after the takeover by Douglas Lewis, Smith received nothing \nand (c) there is no evidence that Smith ever agreed to surrender his interest for nothing.   \n[52] The Defendants respond that Plaintiff is estop ped from claiming to be a \nmember of the Defendant Companies 58  and assert that the Agreement was a \"variable \nincome sharing arrangement.\"59  \n[53] Plaintiff replies that he is not estopped from  claiming membership. 60  \n[54] In their Motion, Defendants argue Plaintiff ha s failed to forecast sufficient \nevidence that an established and enforceable contract existed between Plaintiff and \nDefendants at any time after September 30, 2003. \n[55] Defendants contend that under the Agreement, t he parties agreed that \ntheir relationship would be one of revenue sharing.61   The Agreement stated that \"the \nperiod of the Agreement would be for one year, to be reviewed at the end thereof to see \nif it has proven successful and can be formatted into a permanent, long-term \narrangement.\"62   Defendants say that the Agreement continued in 2000, 63  and that \nwhen the Defendant Companies were formed in early 2001, the parties verbally agreed \nthat Douglas Lewis would receive 50% of the Defendant Companies' gross receipts and \n                                                 \n58  Defs.

Neither Plaintiff nor Defendants are entitled to summary judgment as \nto said Claim, and as to it the Motions should be DENIED. 69  \n                                                 \n64  Id. 3.  \n65  Id.    \n66  Id.  Att. 8.   \n67  Id.  Att. 9.  \n68  Id. Att. 5. \n69  Further analysis as to this Claim is not necessary for the purposes of this Opinion and Order.   \n \nPlaintiff's Second Claim – Declaratory Judgment  \n[59] Plaintiff's Second Claim seeks a declaratory j udgment regarding whether \nthe draft operating agreements of the Defendant Companies are controlling. \n[60] With regard to his Second Claim, Plaintiff arg ues that Defendants are \nestopped from denying that the draft operating agreements were not mutually assented \nto and are not controlling, and that he therefore is entitled to summary judgment on his \nClaim for declaratory judgment.  In response, Defendants argue that declaratory \njudgment relief for Plaintiff, pursuant to G.S. 1-253 et seq ., is inappropriate because \nPlaintiff is asking the court to construe an operating agreement(s) that never existed. 70   \nAs such, Defendants contend there is no document subject to declaratory relief for the \ncourt to review and interpret.  \n[61] Plaintiff also seeks summary judgment in his f avor on Defendants' Fifth \nCounterclaim, which seeks declaratory relief in favor of Defendants.  In this regard, \nDefendants offer the affidavit of Martin, who concludes that if the parties were bound by \nthe Operating Company's draft operating agreement, then Plaintiff is indebted to \nDouglas and Linda Lewis in an amount more than $200,000, which Plaintiff allegedly \npaid himself from the Operating Company during the time that Douglas Lewis was in \nIsrael and Plaintiff was managing the business. 71   In his Affidavit, Martin states that at \nno time was Stancil and Company, \"given any understanding that there were in place \nsigned operating agreements regarding [the Defendant Companies].  It has been our \nunderstanding that although operating agreements were in the draft states, the parties \n                                                 \n70  Defs. Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 13-14.   \n71  Resp. Mem. Defs. 2; see also  Martin Aff. ¶ 9.  \nnever signed and executed the operating agreements.\"72   Plaintiff argues that \nDefendants cannot rely on the draft operating agreements to recover because they \npreviously alleged that such documents were not completed and are not controlling. 73   \n[62] With regard to this Second Claim by Plaintiff,  the court CONCLUDES that \nthere exist genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the operating agreements \nof the Defendant Companies were completed by the parties and are controlling.   \n[63] Accordingly, neither Plaintiff nor Defendants are entitled to summary \njudgment as to said Claim, and as to it the Motions should be DENIED. 74  \nPlaintiff's Sixth Claim – Fraud  \n[64] It is well settled in North Carolina that to s upport a claim for fraud, a \nplaintiff must prove that there existed (a) false representation or concealment of a \nmaterial fact; (b) that was reasonably calculated to deceive; (c) that was made with an \nintent to deceive; (d) did in fact deceive, i.e., was relied upon and (e) resulted in \ndamage to the injured party.  State Props., LLC v. Ray , 155 N.C. App. 65 (2002); Helms \nv. Holland , 124 N.C. App. 629, 634 (1996).  Further, if there was in fact reliance upon \nthe representation or concealment, an actionable claim for fraud requires the reliance to \nhave been reasonable.  Johnson v. Owens , 263 N.C. 754 (1965). \n[65] In his fraud Claim, Plaintiff alleges that Dou glas and Linda Lewis \nrepresented to him that he would be associated with the Defendant Companies on a \npermanent basis and that he \"would remain in the enterprise and continue to receive \nincome therefrom.\"75   ln response, Douglas and Linda Lewis contend that they did not \n                                                 \n72  Martin Aff. ¶ 4. \n73  Pl.

On October 19, \n2000, Douglas Lewis allegedly sent Smith an e-mail entitled \"Broad Concepts of \nStructure.\"78   In that e-mail, Douglas Lewis discussed strategies by which Smith could \nacquire the Financial Company,79  stating, \"[w]e need to figure out what you have to use \nto purchase the stock and use that figure, so you don't alter your lifestyle.\"80   In \nreference to one of the strategies, Douglas Lewis stated, \"[y]ou and I could both be RIA \nreps of this corporate RIA, so that when I retire permanently and it is all yours, the \nexisting RIA would simply continue.\"81   The e-mail later provided, \"in concept it would \nset up a structure that would allow you to be purchasing LFM on a pay-as-you-go basis \nwith the least tax hit to you . . . .  In addition, it would allow you to be an immediate \nowner of the combined entity.\"82  \n[68] In his deposition, Douglas Lewis testified tha t the purchase price he gave \nto Smith was not reasonable and was one he knew Smith could not afford. 83   Douglas \n                                                 \n76  Def.

In fact, Douglas Lewis \nintended to \"watch [Smith] test and prove himself over ten years,\" then \"watch to see \nwhat would happen.\"  Douglas Lewis admitted that he knew Smith \"could never get 10 \nmillion – he'd never get $6 million.  [Douglas Lewi s] knew it wasn't worth anywhere near \n$6 million.\"84   Douglas Lewis contends that such representations regarding Smith's \npotential purchase or ownership of the Defendant Companies were not made with \nfraudulent intent or with the intent to induce reliance.  \n[69] Douglas and Linda Lewis point out that in the January 3, 2003 Letter, \nSmith wrote: \nWhen you both left two years ago, you said my perfo rmance \nwhile you were gone was a test to see if I could ma nage the \nbusiness and close new planning clients . . . .  In many ways, \nthe \"testing\" ground could not have been more inhos pitable . \n. . .  As far as I'm concerned the test is now over  and the \nresults are that I have taken the risk out of you s elling your \nbusiness to me . . . . Please let me know where we are \nheaded soon.\"85   \n \n[70] During their working relationship, Smith and D ouglas and Linda Lewis \nformed the Defendant Companies.  The Defendant Companies retained Wyrick Robbins \nto prepare organizing documentation, including operating agreements.  Smith argues \nthat because the Defendant Companies have a perpetual existence and, as such, can \nonly be dissolved by agreement or by court order, there was a representation as to a \npermanent relationship that would leave the Defendant Companies in his ownership. 86  \n                                                 \n84  Id.  122: 13-21. \n85  Defs.

Additionally, there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether \nDouglas Lewis made representations regarding Smith's potential purchase or ownership \nof the Defendant Companies with fraudulent intent. \n[72] With regard to this Sixth Claim by Plaintiff, the court CONCLUDES that \nthere exist genuine issues of material fact and that neither Plaintiff nor Defendants are \nentitled to summary judgment as to said Claim, and as to it the Motions should be \nDENIED. 87  \nPlaintiff's Tenth Claim – Injunctive Relief  \n[73] Plaintiff argues he is entitled to a prelimina ry injunction (a) requiring \nDouglas and Linda Lewis and the Financial Company to promptly provide information \nrequired by G.S. 57C and (b) prohibiting Douglas and Linda Lewis from paying \nthemselves any distributions or disposing of any assets of the Financial Company in any \ntransaction other than an arms length transaction at fair market value.  \n[74] A preliminary injunction is \"an extraordinary remedy and will not be lightly \ngranted.\"  Travenol Labs., Inc. v. Turner , 30 N.C. App. 686, 692 (1976).  To establish a \nright to a preliminary injunction a party must show (a) the likelihood of success on the \nmerits and (b) that the moving party is likely to sustain irreparable harm unless the \ninjunction is issued or that an injunction is necessary to protect [one's] rights during the \ncourse of the litigation.

Such \ncontended breaches are similar to those alleged in Defendants' Second Counterclaim,98  \nin addition to an allegation that Plaintiff failed to \"return overpayments to him, including \nthose resulting from the changed income sharing arrangements which he knew or \nshould have known he owed at a later date[.]\"99  \n[86] Plaintiff argues that he \"consistently perform ed his duties from February 5, \n2001 until August 21, 2003, when Douglas and Linda Lewis demanded that he stop.\"100   \nPlaintiff also argues that (a) the Defendant Companies' articles of organization release \n                                                 \n96  Further analysis as to this Claim is not necessary for the purposes of this Opinion and Order. \n97  Answer 36, ¶ 48.

Plaintiff's Motion with respect to \nDefendants' Fourth Counterclaim of Violation of Trade Secrets Protection Act should be \nGRANTED and the Fourth Counterclaim should be DISMISSED.  \nDefendants' Fifth Counterclaim – Declaratory Judgme nt  \n[94] The discussion above with regard to Plaintiff' s Second Claim, in which \nPlaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment in his favor, applies equally to Defendants' Fifth \n                                                 \n102  Answer 33, ¶ 39(h). \n103  D. Lewis Aff. ¶ 14.  \nCounterclaim.  Accordingly, with regard this Fifth Counterclaim, the court CONCLUDES \nthat there exist genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the operating \nagreements of the Defendant Companies were completed by the parties and are \ncontrolling.  Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment in his favor as to said \nCounterclaim, and as to it Plaintiff's Motion should be DENIED. 104  \nDefendants' Sixth Counterclaim – Violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C  \n[95] In their Sixth Counterclaim, Defendants allege  that if Plaintiff was a \nmanager of one or more of the Defendant Companies by virtue of a written and/or oral \noperating agreement, then under G.S. 57C, he was required to discharge his \nmanagerial duties in good faith with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like \nposition would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner the manager \nreasonably believes to be in the best interest of the Defendant Companies. 105  \n[96] Defendants specifically allege that Plaintiff (a) took revenues and other \nbenefits that belonged to Defendants without obtaining the informed consent of the \nmembers of the Defendant Companies and (b) used property of the Defendant \nCompanies for his own personal use, without the informed consent of the members. 106  \n[97] G.S. 57C-3-22(e) provides:  \nExcept as otherwise provided in the articles of org anization \nor a written operating agreement, every manager mus t \naccount to the limited liability company and hold a s trustee \nfor it any profit or benefit derived without the in formed \nconsent of the members by the manager from any \ntransaction connected with the formation, conduct, or \nliquidation of the limited liability company or fro m any \npersonal use by the manager of its property.   \n \n                                                \n \n104  Further analysis as to this Claim is not necessary for the purposes of this Opinion and Order. \n105  Answer 40, ¶ 66.   \n106  Id.  ¶ 67. \n[98] Plaintiff argues that Defendants have failed t o allege what revenues and \nother benefits he took,107  and there has been no forecast of admissible evidence \nidentifying any improper distribution or benefit. 108  \n[99] Plaintiff also argues that (a) Douglas Lewis t ook over all of the bank \naccounts upon Douglas Lewis' return to the United States in early 2003 109  and \"had \nample opportunity to determine any such amounts that were retained and to adjust such \namounts in distributions paid to Smith between April and September 2003;\"110  (b) a \nDecember 31, 2003 financial statement demonstrates that charges pertaining to \nPlaintiff's laptop were charged consistently to Plaintiff's account, and \"the payout of the \nlease was likewise charged to [Plaintiff's] account which was a reduction to his capital \naccount\"111 and (c) all banking and bill paying was handled by an employee, except for \nthe period when that employee was banned from the office by the SEC, 112  with whom \nDouglas Lewis was in contact every day and from whom he received an update \n\"whenever new business was done.\"113    \n[100] In response, Defendants argue that if the par ties were bound by the draft \noperating agreement for Operating Company, then Plaintiff is indebted to Douglas and \nLinda Lewis in an amount more than $200,000, which Plaintiff paid himself from the \nOperating Company \"during the time that Doug Lewis was in Israel and Troy Smith was \nmanaging the business.\"114    \n                                                 \n107  Pl. Mem. Supp. Pl. Mot. Summ. J. Defs. Countercl. 3.  \n108  Id.  4.  In her affidavit, Prince refers to \"automatic recurring payments\" made by Lewis but, to the court's \nknowledge, she does not identify such payments as a misappropriation of funds.  Prince Dep. 62:5-7. \n109  Id.  3 (citing D. Lewis Dep. 94-98). \n110  Id.  \n111  Id.  \n112  Id.  4 (citing D. Lewis Dep. Ex. 23 and Prince Dep. 8-1 2). \n113  Id.  (citing Prince Dep. 48-49).  \n114  See , e.g ., Def. Resp. Mem. 2 (discussing Martin's conclusion). \n[101] The court CONCLUDES that there exist genuine issues of material fact \nregarding whether Plaintiff, as manager of either or both of the Defendant Companies, \nderived any profit from either without the consent of the members connected with the \nformation, conduct or liquidation of the Defendant Companies or from any personal use \nby Plaintiff of the Defendant Companies' property.   \n[102] Accordingly, Plaintiff is not entitled to sum mary judgment as to \nDefendants' Fifth Counterclaim, and as to it Plaintiff's Motion should be DENIED. 115  \nDefendants' Seventh Counterclaim – Constructive Fra ud  \n[103] In their Seventh Counterclaim, Defendants all ege that Plaintiff, by virtue of \nhis position with the Defendant Companies and his business relationship with Douglas \nand Linda Lewis, was in a confidential or fiduciary relationship with Defendants.116   \nDefendants further allege that Plaintiff sought to benefit himself to their detriment in a \nvariety of ways, in spite of the relationship of trust and confidence they had developed \nwith Plaintiff. 117   The Plaintiff denies any such wrongful conduct. 118   \n[104] In his Motion, Plaintiff argues that he does not owe a fiduciary duty to \nDouglas and Linda Lewis arising from his status as minority member and manager. 119   \nSee , e.g. , Kaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 473-74 (2009). \n[105] Plaintiff also contests Defendants' allegatio n that he breached a fiduciary \nduty to them by unauthorized use of Douglas Lewis' signature stamp, suggesting that \nanother employee \"cleared [a] fax 120  with Douglas Lewis before  she submitted it.\"121   \n                                                 \n115  Further analysis as to this Claim is not necessary for the purposes of this Opinion and Order. \n116  Answer 41, ¶ 70. \n117  Id . ¶¶ 71-72. \n118  Reply Countercl. ¶¶ 71-72.  \n119  Pl. Mem. Supp. Pl. Mot. Summ. J. Defs. Countercl. 4.  \n120  Id.  \n121  Id . (citing Prince Dep. 38) (emphasis in original).  \n[106] The court CONCLUDES that there exist genuine issues of material fact \nregarding whether Plaintiff owed Defendants any fiduciary duty or breached any such \nduty by his conduct. \n[107] Accordingly, Plaintiff is not entitled to sum mary judgment as to \nDefendants' Seventh Counterclaim, and as to it the Plaintiff's Motion should be \nDENIED. 122  \nDefendant's Eighth Counterclaim – Fraud  \n[108] In their Eighth Counterclaim, Defendants alle ge that Smith entered into the \none-year unsigned Agreement, although he \"knew at the time he agreed to such terms \nthat he would not fulfill those terms\"123  and that Smith falsely represented that he would \nnot use Douglas Lewis' signature stamp \"for anything other than what Douglas Lewis \nhad indicated.\"124     \n[109] In Williams v. Williams , the North Carolina Supreme Court explained:  \nIt is generally held, and is the law in this State,  that mere \nunfulfilled promises cannot be made the basis for a n action \nof fraud (citations omitted).  If, however, a promi se is made \nfraudulently – that is, with no intention to carry it out, thus \nbeing a misrepresentation of a material fact, the s tate of the \npromisor's mind, and with intention that it shall b e acted \nupon, and it is acted upon to the promisee's injury —then, it \nwill sustain an action based on fraud and misrepres entation \n(citations omitted) and the plaintiff will be entit led to legal or \nequitable relief (citations omitted) . . . . Mere p roof of \nnonperformance is not sufficient to establish the n ecessary \nfraudulent  intent. \n \n220 N.C. 806, 810-11 (1942) (citations omitted).   \n \n                                                \n \n122  Further analysis as to this Claim is not necessary for the purposes of this Opinion and Order. \n123  Answer 43, ¶¶ 77, 79-80. \n124  Id.  44, ¶¶ 83-84.   \n[110] Here, Defendants' allegations relate to futur e actions.  In addition to the \nnumerous allegations of Smith's nonperformance, Defendants allege that Smith knew \nthey \"would be traveling for extended periods of time, and thus knew that their ability to \nsign documents and to monitor [his] attendance and [his] work would be limited.\"125   As \nsuch, Defendants contend they have forecast evidence that \"indicate[s] or warrant[s] the \ninference that [Smith] did not intend, at the time [he] made [the promises] to perform \n[the promises] when time for performance arrived.\"  Id.  at 811. \n[111] Although it is a close question with regard t o this Eighth Counterclaim, the \ncourt CONCLUDES that there exist genuine issues of material fact as to whether \nPlaintiff intended to defraud Defendants.   \n[112] Accordingly, Plaintiff is not entitled to sum mary judgment as to \nDefendants' Eighth Counterclaim, and as to it Plaintiff's Motion should be DENIED. 126  \nDefendants' Ninth Counterclaim – Conversion      \n[113] Defendants' Ninth Counterclaim is premised up on their allegations that \nPlaintiff converted monies from the accounts of the Defendant Companies and \nproprietary information, including customer lists, work product and trade secrets. 127  \n[114] Though Plaintiff's Motion purports to seek su mmary judgment as to all of \nDefendants' Counterclaims, he does not specifically address the Ninth Counterclaim in \nhis brief.  In the subsequent briefings, the parties do not discuss the Ninth Counterclaim.  \n[115] Based on the foregoing, the court CONCLUDES t hat Plaintiff has \nabandoned his Motion with respect to the Ninth Counterclaim.  Accordingly, with regard \nto the Ninth Counterclaim, Plaintiff's Motion should be DENIED.  \n                                                 \n125  Id.  ¶ 81. \n126  Further analysis as to this Claim is not necessary for the purposes of this Opinion and Order. \n127  Id.  ¶ 94. \nNOW THEREFORE, based on the foregoing, it hereby is ORDERED that:  \n[116] Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment as to  Defendants' Fourth \nCounterclaim is GRANTED, and said Fourth Counterclaim is DISMISSED. \n[117] The parties' respective Motions for Summary J udgment as to the \nremaining Claims and Counterclaims are DENIED. \n[118] On Wednesday, February 15, 2012, at 11:00 a.m ., at the North Carolina \nBusiness Court, 225 Hillsborough Street, Suite 303, Raleigh, North Carolina, the court \nwill conduct a hearing and status conference with all parties to this action for the \npurpose of setting this matter for trial and determining any remaining pre-trial issues. \nThis the 27th day of January, 2012. \n "
