Roin, for Defendants Corteva, Inc. and \nDuPont de Nemours, Inc. \n \n \nPlaintiff’s Complaint for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief can be Granted.  (ECF \nNo. 78.) \n \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n4. This action arises out of the alleged contamination of North Carolina’s air, \nland, and water through certain Defendants operations at a chemical manufacturing \nfacility known as Fayetteville Works located in Bladen and Cumberland Counties in \nNorth Carolina.  (Original Compl. ¶¶ 1, 77, ECF No. 2 [“Compl.”].)  Plaintiff the State \nof North Carolina (“Plaintiff”) alleges that some  Defendants have caused this \ncontamination through the use of per - and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), \nwhich “resist biodegradation, persist in the environment, and accumulate in p eople \nand other living organisms.”  (Compl. ¶ 1.)   Plaintiff alleges that “vast quantities of \nPFAS” have been discharged by Defendants through their operation of Fayetteville \nWorks into the air, water, sediments , and soils of North Carolina and PFAS “have \nhad and continue to have profoundly negative impacts on the State.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 1,  \n3–4.)   \n5. Plaintiff brings this suit in its parens patriae capacity to protect the health, \nsafety, security, and wellbeing of its residents and its natural resources.  (Compl. ¶ \n15.)  Plaintiff also brings this suit in its capacity as an owner of real property.  (Compl. \n¶ 15.)  Finally, Plaintiff brings fraudulent transfer claims in its capacity as a creditor.  \n(Compl. ¶ 15.) \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n6. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history  of \nthis litigation relevant to its determination of the Motion. \n \n \n7. Plaintiff initiated this action o n 13 October 2020 with the filing of its \nOriginal Complaint.   \n8. On 29 January 2021, Corteva and New DuPont filed the Motion and Brief \nin Support of Consolidated Motion to Dismiss by Defendants Corteva, Inc. and \nDuPont de Nemours, Inc.  ( Br. Supp. Consolidated Mot. Dismiss Defs. Corteva, Inc. \n& DuPont de Nemours, Inc., ECF No. 77 [“Br. Supp.”].)   \n9. Plaintiff filed its Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants \nCorteva, Inc.’s and DuPont de Nemours, Inc.’s Motion to Dismiss  (the “Response \nBrief”) on 18 Febru ary 2021.  ( Mem. Law Opp. Defs. Corteva, Inc.’s & DuPont de \nNemours, Inc.’s Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 89 [“Resp. Br.”].) \n10. Corteva and New DuPont filed the Reply in Support of Consolidated Motion \nto Dismiss by Defendants Corteva, Inc. and DuPont de Nemours, Inc. on 1 March \n2021.  (ECF No. 96.) \n11. After conferring with counsel, o n 23 March 2021, the Court entered the \nOrder Regarding Discovery on Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2)  \npermitting the parties to conduct limited jurisdictional discovery  and submit \nsupplemental briefing on the Motion.3  (ECF No. 109.) \n \n3 In the Response Brief, Plaintiff requested “limited jurisdictional discovery” “to the extent \nthe Court is inclined to grant the Motion [.]”  (Resp. Br. 21.)  While the Court permitted \njurisdictional discovery, the Court made no determination regarding the propriety of the \nMotion and in no way provided either Plaintiff or Defendants with guidance on how the Court \nintended to rule on the Motion before permitting jurisdictional discovery. \n \n \n12. On 21 May 2021, Plaintiff filed its Supplemental Brief in Opposition to \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss  (“Plaintiff’s Supplemental Brief”) .  ( Suppl. Br. Opp. \nDefs.’ Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 136 [“Pl.’s Suppl. Br.”].)4 \n13. On 4 June 2021, Corteva and New DuPont filed the Supplemental Brief in \nSupport of Consolidated Motion to Dismiss by Defendants Corteva, Inc. and DuPont \nde Nemours, Inc. (“Defendants’ Supplemental Brief”).  (Suppl. Br. Supp. Consolidated \nMot. Dismiss Defs. Corteva, Inc. & DuPont de Nemours, Inc., ECF No. 145 [“Defs.’ \nSuppl. Br.”].)5 \n14. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on 29 June 2021. 6  (See ECF No. \n135.) \n15. The Motion is ripe for resolution. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \n16. When a defendant moves to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(2) for \nlack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff carries the burden of establishing that the \n \n4 The Court cites to Plaintiff’s Supplemental Brief as it is filed provisionally under seal in its \nunredacted form.  A partially redacted, public version of Plaintiff’s Supplemental Brief can \nbe found filed at ECF No. 138. \n5 The Court cites to Defendants’ Supplemental Brief as it is filed provisionally under seal in \nits unredacted form.  A partially redacted, public version of Defendants’ Supplemental Brief \ncan be found filed at ECF No. 144. \n6 After the hearing on the Motion, Plaintiff filed a Suggestion of Subsequently Decided \nAuthority Under Business Court Rule 7.9 (the “Suggestion of Authority”).  (ECF No. 146.)  \nAttached to the Suggestion of Authority is a decision in a related action rendered by the New \nHampshire Superior Court that concluded it could properly exercise personal jurisdiction \nover Corteva and New DuPont  pursuant to New Hampshire law .  On 10 August 2021, \nPlaintiff again filed a Suggestion of Subsequently Decided Authority Under Business Court \nRule 7.9, attaching a decision in a seemingly related action in Ohio denying Corteva and New \nDuPont’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  (ECF No. 152.)     \n \n \ntrial court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant .  Bauer v. Douglas Aquatics, \nInc., 207 N.C. App. 65, 68 (2010). \n17. “The standard of review to be applied by a tria l court in deciding a motion \nunder Rule 12(b)(2) depends upon the procedural context confronting the court.”  \nBanc of Am. Sec. LLC v. Evergreen Int’l Aviation, Inc., 169 N.C. App. 690, 693 (2005).  \nIf the trial court considers affidavits and other documentary evidence submitted by \nthe parties in support of and in opposition to a Rule 12(b)(2) motion, the court should \nact as a fact -finder and determine whether the plaintiff has establishe d personal \njurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.  See Deer Cor p. v. Carter, 177 N.C. \nApp. 314, 322 (2006); Soma Tech., Inc. v. Dalamagas, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 26, at *8–9 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 24, 2017) (acting as a fact-finder and deciding whether grounds \nfor personal jurisdiction existed by a preponderance of the evidence where the court \nconsidered the evidence submitted by each party and held a non-evidentiary hearing \non the Rule 12(b)(2) motion).  \n18. “Once a defendant submits an affidavit or evidence  challenging personal \njurisdiction, unverified allegations in a complaint conflicting with that evidence may \nno longer be taken as true[ ,]” though “allegations in [the] complaint uncontroverted \nby [the evidence] are still taken as true.”  Weisman v. Blue Mt. Organics Distrib., \nLLC, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 41, at *2 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 5, 2014) (citing Evergreen \nInt’l Aviation, 169 N.C. App. at 693–94). \n19. Having considered all relevant matters, the Court finds the following facts \nby a preponderance of the evidence and makes the following conclusions of law.  \n \n \nIV. FINDINGS OF FACT7 \n20. The Court makes the following  findings of fact solely  for the purpose of \nruling on the Motion to the extent it is b rought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) without \nprejudice to the Co urt making contrary findings of fact  at a later stage of the \nproceeding on a more fully developed record.   \n21. Defendant E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (“Old DuPont”) is a \nDelaware corporation with its principal place of business in Delaware, conducting \nbusiness throughout the United States, including North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶ 16.) \n22. Defendant The Chemours Company (“Chemours”) is a Delaware \ncorporation with its principal place of business in Delaware.  (Compl. ¶ 17.)  \nDefendant Chemours FC, LLC (“Chemours FC ” and with Chemours referred to \ncollectively as the “Chemours Defendants”) is a Delaware limited liability company \nwith its principal place of business in Delaware.  (Compl. ¶ 19.)   Chemours FC is a \nsubsidiary of Chemours.  (Compl. ¶ 19.) \n23. Corteva and New DuPont are Delaware corporations.  (Compl. ¶¶ 20–21.) \n24. In 1969, Old DuPont purchased property near Fayetteville, North Carolina \nand began a manufacturing process at Fayetteville Works, a chemical manufacturing \nfacility, discharging PFAS.  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 77–79.)  PFAS are chemicals that pose \nsignificant risks to human health and the environment as they resist biodegradation, \n \n7 Any determination later stated as a conclusion of law that should have been stated as a \nfinding of fact is incorporated in these  findings of fact.  See Rutherford Elec. Mbrshp. Corp. \nv. Time Warner Entm’t-Advance/Newhouse P’ship, 240 N.C. App. 199, 215 (2015) (“Further, \nconclusions of law which are mischaracterized as findings of fact will be treated on review as \nconclusions of law.”).    \n \n \npersist in the environment, and accumulate in people and other living organisms.  \n(Compl. ¶ 1.)  Old DuPont manufactur ed PFAS at Fayetteville Works  beginning in \n1980.  (Compl. ¶ 82.)  Old DuPont knew about the dangers posed by  PFAS no later \nthan 1984.  (Compl. ¶¶ 61–72.)  Notwithstanding its knowledge of the dangers posed, \nOld DuPont continued to manufacture PFAS at Fayetteville Works.  (Compl. ¶¶ 61–\n72, 82.) \n25. Old DuPont has engaged in a multi-step process to restructure its business \nthat could place Old DuPont in a position where it is unable to pay billions of dollars \nof liabilities related to PFAS contamination, including liabilities arising out of the \noperation of Fayetteville Works.  (Compl. ¶¶ 130, 139–43, 150–52.)   \n26. On 26 June 2015, Old DuPont and Chemours entered into a separation \nagreement (the “Chemours Separation Agreement”).  (Compl. ¶ 156.)  Pursuant to the \nterms of the Chemours Separation Agreement, Old DuPont transferred the \nPerformance Chemicals Business, which included the use of PFAS, and active \nchemical plants, including Fayetteville Works, to Chemours.  (Compl. ¶ 157.)  On 1 \nJuly 2015, Old DuPont completed the spinoff of the Performance Chemicals Business \nto Chemours.  (Compl. ¶ 154.)   \n27. Prior to 1 July 2015, Old DuPont owned Chemours as a wholly owned \nsubsidiary.  (Compl. ¶ 154.)  On 1 July 2015, Chemours became a separate, publicly \ntraded entity.  (Compl. ¶ 154.)   Chemours Defendants now own and operate \nFayetteville Works.  (Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19, 81.)  Chemours generates up to hundreds of \nPFAS at Fayetteville Works.  (Compl. ¶ 83.)  \n \n \n28. At the time of the spinoff, Chemours assumed direct liability for Old \nDuPont’s PFAS contamination.  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 18, 159 .)  However, Chemours w as \nundercapitalized and could not satisfy all of Old DuPont’s liabilities; therefore, Old \nDuPont still faced liability for PFAS contamination.  (Compl. ¶ 145.)  \n29. In December 2015, Old DuPont and non- party Old Dow entered into an \nAgreement and Plan of Merger and pursuant to its terms, Old DuPont and Old Dow \nbecame subsidiaries of DowDuPont, Inc. (“DowDuPont”) .  (Compl. ¶ 147.)  After its \nformation, DowDuPont engaged in numerous business segment and product line \nrealignments and divestitures.  (Compl. ¶ 148.)  DowDuPont combined the assets of \nOld DuPont and Old Dow and created three distinct divisions: ( 1) the Agriculture \nBusiness, (2 ) the Specialty Products Business, and ( 3) the Materials Science \nBusiness.  (Compl. ¶ 174.) \n30. After creating the three business div isions, DowDuPont incorporated \nCorteva and non- party New Dow  to hold two of DowDuPont’s business divisions .  \n(Compl. ¶ 176.)  On 1 April 2019, Corteva, New Dow, and DowDuPont entered into \nthe Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “DowDuPont Separation \nAgreement”).  (Compl. ¶ 177 ; see also Resp. Br. Ex. A , ECF No. 89.1 [“DowDuPont \nSeparation Agreement”].)   \n31. On 2 May 2019, DowDuPont consolidated the Agriculture Business into Old \nDuPont.  (Compl. ¶ 179.)  On 31 May 2019, DowDuPont contributed its ownership of \nOld DuPont to Corteva.  (Compl. ¶ 179.)   Effectively, pursuant to the terms of the \nDowDuPont Separation Agreement, the Agriculture Business was allocated to \n \n \nCorteva.  (Compl. ¶ 177.)  On 1 June 2019, Corteva became an independent, public \ncompany.  (Compl. ¶ 179.)   \n32. DowDuPont retained the Specialty Products Business.  (Compl. ¶¶ 177–79.)  \nOn 1 June 2019, DowDuPont changed its name to Du Pont de Nemours, Inc. (referred \nto herein as New DuPont).  (Compl. ¶ 179.) \n33. Pursuant to the terms of the DowD uPont Separation Agreement, Corteva \nand New DuPont assumed certain direct financial liability of Old DuPont.  (Compl. ¶ \n180.)  When dividing DowDuPont’s three business divisions, Old DuPont transferred \nvaluable assets and business lines to New DuPont and Corteva  for less than the \nassets’ value .  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 182, 253.)  T he value of Old DuPont has continued to \ndecrease and at one point, declined to a net worth of negative $1.125 billion.  (Compl. \n¶¶ 182, 184, 186.) \nV. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW8 \n34. “Determining whether personal jurisdiction exists is usually a ‘two -step \nanalysis’: jurisdiction must be authorized by the State’s long -arm statute and \nconsistent with the federal Due Process Clause.”  Banc of Am. Merch. Servs., LLC v. \nArby’s Rest. Grp., Inc., 2021 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 30, 2021) \n(citing Beem USA LLLP v. Grax Consulting , LLC, 373 N.C. 297, 302 (2020)).   North \nCarolina’s long -arm statute is “intended to make available to the North Carolina \n \n8 Any findings of fact that are more appropriately deemed conclusions of law are incorporated \nby reference into the Court’s analysis and conclusions of law.  See Sheffer v. Rardin, 208 N.C. \nApp. 620, 624 (2010) (providing that the  appellate court will treat findings of fact that are \n“more properly designated” as conclusions of law as conclusions of law for the purposes of an \nappeal).   \n \n \ncourts the full jurisdictional powers permissible under federal due process.”  Dillon \nv. Numismatic Funding Corp., 291 N.C. 674, 676 (1977).   Accordingly, the “two-step \nanalysis” often “collapses into one” inquiry: whether the exercise of personal \njurisdiction is allowed under the due process clause.  Quidore v. Alliance Plastics, \nLLC, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 63, at *8– 9 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 19, 2020) (citing Filmar \nRacing, Inc. v. Stewart, 141 N.C. App. 668, 671 (2001); Worley v. Moore, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 15, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 28, 2017)). \n35. Corteva and New DuPont contend in their briefing on the Motion that “the \nonly question the Court needs to address is whether the exerci se of personal \njurisdiction would violate due process.”  (Br. Supp. 5 fn. 2.)   Therefore, the Court \nlimit’s its analysis to this question.  See, e.g., Arby’s Rest. Grp., 2021 NCBC LEXIS \n60, at *12. \n36. The Due Process Clause requires that a defendant “have certain minimum \ncontacts” with the State so that the exercise of jurisdiction “does not offend traditional \nnotions of fair play and substantial justice.”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. \n310, 31 6 (1945) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “The primary \nconcern of the Due Process Clause as it relates to a court’s jurisdiction over a \nnonresident defendant is the protection of an individual’s liberty interest in not being \nsubject to the  binding judgments of a forum with which he has established no \nmeaningful contacts, ties, or relations.”  Beem, 373 N.C. at 302 (quoting Burger King \nCorp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 471–72 (1985)).   \n \n \n37. “There are two types of personal jurisdiction: specific jurisdiction and \ngeneral jurisdiction.”  Worley , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 15, at *21.  Plaintiff does not \ncontend that this Court may exercise general jurisdiction over Corteva and New \nDuPont.  (Resp. Br. 12.)  Therefore, the Court limits its discussion herein to specific \njurisdiction. \n38. Specific jurisdiction, or “case-linked” jurisdiction, “exists when the cause of \naction arises from or is related to defendant’s contacts with the forum.”  Skinner v. \nPreferred Credit, 361 N.C. 114, 122 (2006).  “Specific jurisdiction is, at its core, focused \non the ‘relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.’ ”  Beem, 373 \nN.C. at 303 (quoting Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 133 (2014)). \n39.   Plaintiff contends that “there are two independent bases to exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over [Corteva and New DuPont]: (i) Old DuPont’s jurisdictional \ncontacts are imputed to them because they assumed Old DuPont’s PFAS liabilities \npursuant to the DowDuPont Separation Agreement. . . ; and (ii) they participated in \nfraudulent transfers purposefully directed at North Carolina.”  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. 1.)  In \nother words, Plaintiff in part contends the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction \nover Corteva and New DuPont not based on their contacts with the State but based \non Old DuPont’s contacts with the State.9 \n \n9 Plaintiff also argues, seemingly separate and distinct from its arguments related to \nsuccessor liability and imputation of  Old DuPont’s contacts, that Corteva and New DuPont \n“purposefully directed their fraudulent transfer at North Carolina” and requests that the \nCourt exercise personal jurisdiction over them  by applying Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783 \n(1984) and its progeny.  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. 8 –11.)  However, the Court need not address this \nargument due to its conclusion that the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Corteva \nand New DuPont on other grounds.  \n \n \n40. The appellate courts of North Carolina have not spoken directly to the issue \nraised here: whether a predecessor corporation’s contacts with the forum t hat \nestablish personal jurisdiction over it may be imputed to a successor corporation for \nthe purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction over the successor corporation .  \nBecause of the paucity of direct North Carolina authority on the subject, this Cou rt \nlooks elsewhere for persuasive guidance.   \n41. “The great weight of persuasive authority permits imputation of a \npredecessor’s actions upon its successor whenever forum law would hold the successor \nliable for its predecessor’s actions.”  Synergy Ins. Co. v. Unique Personnel Consultants, \nInc., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187970, at *2 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 14, 2017) (emphasis \nomitted) (quoting City of Richmond v. Madison Mgmt. Grp., Inc. , 918 F.2d 438, 454 \n(4th Cir. 1990)); see also Leonard v. Bed, Bath & Beyond, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n2237, at *8 ( E.D.N.C. Jan. 18, 2016) (“Nonetheless, the court notes that it may \nexercise personal jurisdiction over a successor corporation to the extent that such \njurisdiction exists over its predecessor corporation.”); Ostrem v. Prideco Secure Loan \nFund, LP, 841 N.W.2d 882, 897 fn. 3 (Iowa 2014) (collecting cases). \n42. “[F]ederal courts have consistently acknowledged that it is compatible with \ndue process for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over an individual or a \ncorporation that would not ordinarily be subject to personal jurisdiction in that court \nwhen the individual or corporation is an alter ego or successor of a corporation that \nwould be subject to personal jurisdiction in that court.”  Patin v. Thoroughbred Power \nBoats, 2 94 F.3d 640, 653 (2002); see also  Purdue Research Found. v . Sanofi -\n \n \nSynthelabo, S.A., 338 F.3d 773, 778 (7th Cir. 2003) (“[S]everal courts have recognized \nthat the jurisdictional contacts of a predecessor corporation may be imputed to it s \nsuccessor corporation without offending due process.”).  “The theory underlying these \ncases is that, because the two corporations are the same entity, the jurisdictional \ncontacts of one are the jurisdictional contacts of the other for the purposes of the \nInternational Shoe due process analysis.”  Patin, 294 F.3d at 653 (cleaned up).   \n43. While North Carolina courts have not  directly addressed the issue of \nimputing a predecessor’s contacts to the successor for the purposes of personal \njurisdiction, to hold otherwise would allow a corporation to “avoid all consequences . \n. . by just reforming in some other jurisdiction and avoiding any  accountability[.]”  \nMadison Mgmt. Grp. , 918 F.2d at 455 (citation omitted).   Accordingly, the Court \nfollows the federal courts and concludes that personal jurisdiction over a defendant \nbased on a theory of successor liability comports with due process.         \n44. Pursuant to North Carolina law, “ [a] corporation which purchases all, or \nsubstantially all, of the assets of another corporation is generall y not liable for the \nold corporation’s debts or liabilities.”  Budd Tire Corp. v. Pierce Tire Co., 90 N.C. App. \n684, 687 (1988).  However, there are four “well-settled exceptions to this general rule \nagainst successor liability.”  Becker v. Graber Builders, Inc. , 149 N.C. App. 787, 791 \n(2002).  A successor corporation , or a purchasing corporation,  may be subject to \nliability for the debts of its predecessor, or a selling corporation, where:  \n(1) there is an express or implied agreement by the purchasing \ncorporation to assume the debt or liability; (2) the transfer amounts to a \nde facto merger of the two corporations; (3) the transfer of assets was \ndone for the purpose of defrauding the corporation’s creditors; or (4) the \n \n \npurchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the selling corporation \nin that the purchasing corporation has some of the same shareholders, \ndirectors, and officers.  \n \nBudd Tire, 90 N.C. App. at 687 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n45. North Carolina law “has treated the question of a successor corporation’s \nliability for the debts or liabilities of its predecessor as a matter of equity, endeavoring \nto protect the predecessor’s creditors while respecting the separateness of the \ncorporate entities.”  Id.  at 689.  The Court concludes both the first and third Budd \nTire exceptions are applicable here.  \n46. As to the first exception, Corteva and New DuPont expressly agreed to \nassume Old DuPont’s PFAS liabilities.  Pursuant to the DowDuPont Separat ion \nAgreement, Corteva assumed  all of the Agriculture Liabilities  and New DuPont \nassumed all of the Specialty Products Liabilities .  (DowDuPont Separation \nAgreement § 2.2(c).)  The term Agriculture Liabilities is defined to include “any of the \nLiabilities set forth on Schedule 1.1(38)(vii).”  (DowDuPont Separation Agreement § \n1.1(38)(vii).)  The term Specialty Products Liabilities is defined to include “any of the \nLiabilities set forth on Schedule 1.1(309)(vi).”  (DowDuPont Separation Agreement § \n1.1(309)(vi).)   \n47. On 1 June 2019, DowDuPont, now New DuPont, and Corteva entered into \na Letter Agreement.  (Letter Agreement, ECF No. 136.2 [“Letter Agreement”].)  The \nLetter Agreement expressly amended Schedule 1.1(38)(vii) and Schedule 1.1(309)(vi) \nto the DowDuPont Separation Agreement.  (Letter Agreement NCAG-CTVA-001373–\n001375.) \n \n \n48. Under the “Certain Liabilities” header in the Letter Agreement , Schedule \n1.1(38)(vii) of the DowDuPont Separation Agreement is amended to add the following \nitems:  \n3. (x) Fifty percent (50%) of the following Liabilities, up to an aggregate \namount of $300,000,000 (e.g., 50% being up to $150,000,000) and (y) the \nAgriculture Shared Historical DuPont Percentage for any amounts of \nthe following Liabilities in excess of the $300,000,000 aggregate amount \nspecified in clause (x): \n \n(a) any and all Indemnifiable Losses to the extent related to , \narising out of or resulting from any and all DuPont Discontinued \nand/or Divested Operations and Business Liabilities to the extent \nrelated to, arising out of or resulting from Actions to the extent \nrelated to, arising out of or Resulting from the development, \ntesting, manufacture or sale of per - or polyfluoroalkyl \nsubstances[.]  \n \n(Letter Agreement NCAG-CTVA-001373–001374.) \n      \n49. Schedule 1.1(309)(vi) of the DowDuPont Separation Agreement is similarly \namended by the Letter Agreement to add the following items:  \n2. (x) Fifty percent (50%) of the following Liabilities, up to an aggregate \namount of $300,000,000 (e.g., 50% being up to $150,000,000) and (y) the \nAgriculture Shared Historical DuPont Percentage for any amounts of \nthe following Liabilities in excess of the $300,000,000 aggregate amount \nspecified in clause (x): \n \n(a) any and all Indemnifiable  Losses to the extent related to, \narising out of or resulting from any and all DuPont Discontinued \nand/or Divested Operations and Business Liabilities to the extent \nrelated to, arising out of or resulting from Actions to the extent \nrelated to, arising out of or Resulting from the development, \ntesting, manufacture or sale of per - or polyfluoroalkyl \nsubstances[.]  \n \n(Letter Agreement NCAG-CTVA-001374–001375.) \n \n \n \n50. The DowDuPont Separation Agreement defines  the term  “DuPont \nDiscontinued and/or Divested Operations and Business Liabilities” to include “any \nand all Liabilities to the extent arising out of or related to any Discontinued and/or \nDivested Operations and Businesses of any member (at any point in time) of [Old]  \nDuPont (or any of their respective predecessors), including those set forth in \nSchedules 1.1(15) . . . and 1.1(291)[.]”  (DowDuPont Separation Agreement § 1.1(102).)   \n51. Schedule 1.1(15) to the DowDuPont Separation Agreement incaludes “any \nand all Liabilities to the extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from”: \n[Old] DuPont’s Performance Chemicals segment to the extent spun -off \nin 2015 as The Chemours Company . . . and also including;  \n \na. the spin-off thereof; [and] \n \nb. any and all Liabilities of [O ld] DuPont to the extent resulting \nfrom, arising out of or related to [Old]  DuPont’s development, \ntesting, manufacture or sale of [PFOA.]  \n \n(ECF No. 136.4.)10  Schedule 1.1(291) incorporates these same liabilities by reference.  \n(Letter Agreement NCAG -CTVA-001406.)  It is clear that by  execution of the \nDowDuPont Separation Agreement and the Letter Agreement, Corteva and New \nDuPont assumed certain liabilities related to Old DuPont’s manufacturing of PFAS.   \n52. Notwithstanding this e xpress assumption of liabilities, Corteva and New \nDuPont contend they did not assume Old DuPont’s PFAS liabilities because (1) \nChemours assumed all of the PFAS liabilities that were capable of being assumed; \nand (2) Corteva and New DuPont agreed to indemni fy each other for PFAS- related \n \n10 The broader definition of PFAS includes PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid).  (Compl. ¶ 4.)  \n \n \nlosses but did not assume PFAS liabilities.  (See generally  Defs.’ Suppl. Br. 3 –12.)  \nThe Court finds Defendants’ arguments unpersuasive for two reasons. \n53. First, Chemours’ assumption of PFAS liabilities as a legal matter does not \npreclude Corteva and New DuPont from assuming those same PFAS liabilities  and \nCorteva and New DuPont do not cite any authority supporting t his position.  ( See \nDefs.’ Suppl. Br. 3–5.)  Second, the DowDuPont Separation Agreement’s definition of \nIndemnifiable Loss or Losses is broad. “Indemnifiable Loss” and “Indemnifiable \nLosses” are jointly defined by the DowDuPont Separation Agreement as:  \nany and all Damages, losses, deficiencies, Liabilities, ob ligations, \npenalties, judgments, settlements, claims, payments, fines, interest, \ncosts and expenses (including the costs and expense s of any and all \nActions and demands, assessments, judgments, settlements, and \ncompromises relating thereto and the reasonab le costs and expenses of \nattorneys’, accountants’, consultants’ and other professionals’ fees and \nexpenses incurred in the investigation or defense thereof or the \nenforcement of rights hereunder).   \n \n(DowDuPont Separation Agreement § 1.1(144).)  The definition of Indemnifiable Loss \nand Indemnifiable Losses allows for the interpretation that Corteva and New DuPont \nnot only agreed to indemnif y against certain liabilities but additionally assume the \nsame liabilities.  See,  e.g., Town of Lexington v. Pharmacia Corp. , 2015 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 36815, at *10–11 (D. Mass. Mar. 24, 2015) (“A plain reading of the Distribution \nAgreement indicates that [the defendant] both assumed liability and indemnified [the \nco-defendant] against liability.”) \n54. Corteva and New DuPont largely rely on the Letter Agreement ’s language \nthat the parties “wish to enter into certain additional agreements in a manner \neffective as between the Letter Parties [Corteva and New DuPont] . . . but not . . . \n \n \nThird-Party Beneficiaries.”  (Defs. ’ Suppl. Br. 7 (emphasis  and modifications  in \noriginal).)  However, as stated in Town of Lexington, a successor corporation “may not \nshield itself from liability it expressly assumed by virtue of a clause ne gating third-\nparty beneficiary rights.”  Id. at *14 (citing Safety -Kleen Corp. v. Arkema, Inc. , 380 \nB.R. 716, 740 (Del. Bankr. 2008)) ; see also Caldwell Trucking PRP v. Rexon Tech. \nCorp., 421 F.3d 234, 245 (3d Cir. 2005) (providing that “general, boilerplate language” \nexcluding third-party beneficiary recovery without specific reference to a contractual \nprovision is insufficient to preclude third -party actions where there is an express \nassumption of liabilities).   \n55. In reading  the DowDuPont Separation Agreement and its subsequent \namendment by way of the Letter Agreement, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has \nestablished by the preponderance of the evidence that Corteva and New DuPont \nagreed to assume Old DuPont’s PFAS- related liabilities.   Therefore, based on the \nexceptions to successor liability, imputing Old DuPont’s contacts to Corteva and New \nDuPont is appropriate.  \n56. Even if the Court made a contrary conclusion regarding the interpretation \nof the DowDuPont Separation Agreement as amended an d Corteva’s and New \nDuPont’s assumption of PFAS liabilities, t he Court further concludes that the third \nexception in Budd Tire  applies to this case.   Plaintiff argues that Corteva and New \nDuPont’s “participation in the fraudulent transfer of Old DuPont’s assets was \ndirected at the State and designed to frustrate its ability to collect on any judgment \nrelated to Old DuPont’s contamination of North Carolina’s natural resources.”  (Pl. ’s \n \n \nSuppl. Br. 8–9.)  It is Plaintiff’s position that New DuPont and Corteva “targeted their \nfraudulent transfer at the State, frustrating its ability . . . to reach Old DuPont’s \nassets.”  (Pl.’s Suppl. Br. 9.) \n57.  Plaintiff, in its capacity as a creditor,  asserts two claims for relief against \nCorteva and New DuPont  for fraudulent transfers  of Old DuPont’s assets and \nbusiness lines to Corteva and New DuPont.  (Compl. ¶¶ 15, 231–39, 251–60.)  Plaintiff \nalleges that Old DuPont undertook a series of transactions to shield itself fr om \nbillions of dollars in liabilities related to its discharge of PFAS at its manufacturing \nfacilities, including Fayetteville Works.  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 13, 142–43, 145, 182.)  Plaintiff \nfurther alleges that  these transactions have resulted in (1) Old DuPont havi ng a \nnegative net worth; (2) Chemours being undercapitalized and unable to satisfy Old \nDuPont’s PFAS liabilities; and (3) the transfer of valuable assets from Old DuPont to \nCorteva and New DuPont  for far less consideration than those assets were worth.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 145, 182, 186.)  Lastly, Plaintiff alleges that Corteva and New DuPon t \n“acted with the actual intent to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors or future \ncreditors.”  (Compl. ¶ 256.)  A t this stage of the proceeding, a ll of these allegation s \nare sufficient to show that Old DuPont transferred assets to Corteva and New DuPont \nfor the purpose of defrauding its potential creditors.  See Synergy Ins., 2017 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 187970, at *4– 5 (considerin g the successor’s payment of inadequate \nconsideration for the predecessor’s assets in determining that the third Budd Tire  \nexception applied);  Budd Tire , 90 N.C. App. at 689 (considering that (1) the \npredecessor’s assets were sold for insufficient consideration; (2) the predecessor was \n \n \nnot left with sufficient assets to pay existing credit ors; and (3) the successor \ncorporation knew that the consideration paid would be inadequate to satisfy the \npredecessor’s debts , in affirming the trial court’s conclusion that there was a \nfraudulent transfer for the purpose of successor liability).  \n58. It is clear  and uncontested  that Old DuPont has sufficient minimum \ncontacts with the State through its operation of Fayetteville Works.  The Court \nconcludes that, at this stage of the proceeding, Plaintiff has established successor \nliability by the preponderance of the evidence as to Corteva and New DuPont under \nthe first and third Budd Tire  exceptions.  Therefore, the Court may impute Old \nDuPont’s contacts with the State to Corteva and New DuPont  to establish personal \njurisdiction over them.   \n59. In sum, the Court concludes that Old DuPont’s contacts can be imputed to \nCorteva and New DuPont , consistent with due process,  to establish personal \njurisdiction over Corteva and New DuPont ; therefore, the Motion, to the extent it is \nbrought pursuant to Rule (12)(b)(2), should be DENIED.   \nVI.      CONCLUSION \n60. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby  DENIES the Motion to the \nextent it is brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2).  The Court DEFERS ruling in part on \nthe Motion to the extent it is brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) and  will issue a \nseparate order and opinion determining that portion of the Motion.  \n \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 9th day of September, 2021. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L.
