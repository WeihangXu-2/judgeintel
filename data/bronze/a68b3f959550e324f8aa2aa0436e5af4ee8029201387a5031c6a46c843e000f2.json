Farms, LLC (“Rocking B. Farms”),\nand Earth Products Company, LLC (“Earth Products”) are limited liability companies organized under the\nlaws of the State of North Carolina with their principal places of business in Mecklenburg County, North\nCarolina.\n  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 2-3.)\n{8}\n      \nDefendant Basic Electric Company, Inc. (“Basic Electric”) is a North Carolina corporation with its\nprincipal place of business in Union County, North Carolina.\n  \n(Compl. ¶ 4.)\n{9}\n      \nAspen is an investment holding company formed for the purpose of managing real estate\ninvestments.\n  \n(Steve Clardy Aff. ¶ 2.)\n{10}\n    \nBasic Electric is an electrical contractor.\n  \n(Steve Clardy Aff. ¶ 2.)\n{11}\n    \nRocking B. Farms is a cattle and timber farm.\n  \n(Steve Clardy Aff. ¶ 2.)\n{12}\n    \nEarth Products is in the business of dirt recycling.\n  \n(Steve Clardy Aff. ¶ 2.)\n{13}\n    \nAt all relevant times, Defendant Steve Clardy served as Aspen’s Chief Executive Officer.\n \n(Wilkinson Dep. 25:1-9.)\n{14}\n    \nAt all relevant times, Defendants Michael Clardy and Chip Clardy held ownership interests in or\nactively managed one or more of the Clardy Entities.\n  \n(Answer ¶¶ 6-8; Wilkinson Dep. 88:4-90:17.)\nB.\nSUMMARY OF THE FACTS\n{15}\n    \nIn addressing the competing motions for summary judgment, the Court has accepted the non-\nmoving parties’ version of the facts, where supported in the record.\n \n{16}\n    \nKornegay was hired to work for Aspen on or about 1 October 1996.\n  \n(Kornegay Aff. ¶ 4.)\n{17}\n    \nKornegay accepted employment with Aspen based on Defendant Steve Clardy’s promise that he\nwould be paid $72,000 per year\n[3]\n plus: (1) an annual bonus in the amount of 20% of net profits on real\nestate investments that he originated and implemented; and (2) “fair compensation” for any real estate\ninvestments that he implemented, but did not originate.\n  \n(Kornegay Aff. ¶ 5; Kornegay Dep. 21:8-28:16,\n101.)\n[4]\n{18}\n    \nDefendant Steve Clardy told Kornegay that he was being hired to (in part) “initiate” or “find”\ninvestments, but neither he nor Kornegay discussed specifically how the proposed bonus program would\noperate or how Kornegay’s bonus would be calculated.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 20:1-22:5, 57:4-58:3; Steve\nClardy Aff. ¶ 4-5.)\n{19}\n    \nTo qualify as the “originator” or “initiator” of a real estate investment for purposes of earning a\nbonus, Kornegay understood that he was required to engage in “a combination of finding [the property],\ndoing due diligence, preparing for closing, answering questions, [and] doing a financial analysis.”\n \n(Kornegay Dep. 60:12-15.)\n{20}\n    \nAlthough Kornegay was vague and inconsistent on the point in his deposition testimony, it appears\nthat he understood “implementation” of a real estate investment to mean the management and oversight of\nthe property post-closing.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 65:14-25, 66:17-19, 67:10-13.)\n  \nWith respect to his right to\nreceive “fair” bonus compensation for implementing an investment that he did not originate, Kornegay\nconceded that the specifics for determining such compensation were left open for future negotiations.\n \n(Kornegay Dep. 101:12-20.)\n[5]\n \n{21}\n    \nKornegay and Steve Clardy also agreed that the term “net profits,” for purposes of the 20% bonus\ncalculation, meant revenues minus costs, but they did not discuss or otherwise identify the precise costs to\nbe allocated against gross revenues.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 57:20-58:3.)\n  \nAs for the revenue side of the\nequation, Kornegay and Clardy “never talked about 20 percent of the purchase prices [of the properties].\n \nWe talked about 20 percent of profits.\n  \nProfits would be sales – sales price of the resale minus the original\nprice minus the cost.”\n  \n(Kornegay Dep.\n  \n210:11-14.)\n[6]\n \n{22}\n    \nFollowing his termination, Kornegay affirmed his understanding of this measure of net profits\nwhen he wrote the individual Defendants seeking payment of his outstanding bonuses and emphasizing\nthat “[o]ur profit sharing was to be calculated on gross sales, minus job expenses.”\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. Ex.\n12.)\n{23}\n    \nAlthough Kornegay now believes he is entitled to a 20% net profit bonus on properties he\noriginated, even if they were not sold during his employment, he admits that the Defendants never made\nany such promise.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 82:4-20.) \n  \n{24}\n    \nKornegay also believed that he could earn a 20% bonus for originating a particular real estate\ninvestment property, even if he did not find the property, provided that he completed a substantial portion\nof the work leading to its acquisition.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 60:21-63:12.) \n  \n \n{25}\n    \nBefore Kornegay began his employment, Steve Clardy directed him to work with Evelyn\nWilkinson, Aspen’s Chief Operating Officer, to memorialize his employment terms in writing.\n  \n(Kornegay\nDep. 34:22-35:17, 108:19-110:8.)\n   \n{26}\n    \nSometime between October and November 1996, Kornegay received a draft of the proposed terms\nfrom Ms. Wilkinson, which he deemed unsatisfactory.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. Ex. 1; Kornegay Dep. 137:12,\n139:18.)\n  \nThis draft (which Kornegay quotes almost verbatim in his Memorandum in Opposition to the\nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment) provides, \ninter alia,\n that the Defendants will contribute 20%\nof net profits on real estate and other investments originated and implemented by Kornegay and that\n“special arrangements” will be made with regard to his work on other projects.\n[7]\n{27}\n    \nOver the next six years, Kornegay and his employer exchanged numerous drafts of the proposed\nemployment agreement, but none was ever signed.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 154:10, 166:16-22; Kornegay Dep.\nExs. 1-12.)\n \n{28}\n    \nKornegay performed services for each of the various Clardy Entities.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 110:12-20;\nKornegay Aff. ¶¶ 4, 14.)\n{29}\n    \nEach of the Individual Defendants exercised some measure of control over the terms and\nconditions of Kornegay’s employment.\n  \n(Answer ¶ 23.)\n{30}\n    \nFor example, Defendant Michael Clardy supervised Kornegay’s daily work activities.\n  \n(Kornegay\nAff. ¶ 14.)\n  \nMichael Clardy also told Kornegay in June 2002 that he would not be receiving bonus\ncompensation, (Wilkinson Dep. 164:9-165:21), and he fired Kornegay.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 280:12-18.)\n{31}\n    \nDefendant Chip Clardy assigned tasks to Kornegay on a regular basis.\n  \n(Kornegay Aff. ¶\n14.)\n  \nAt a post-termination meeting with the Individual Defendants where Kornegay demanded his\nbonus payments, Chip Clardy (who apparently is an attorney) told Kornegay that his alleged\nemployment agreement was not binding.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 281:6-282:4.)\n \n{32}\n    \nFrom 1996 through his termination on 16 July 2004, Kornegay was paid $72,000 annually.\n \nHe received no additional compensation.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 33:11-15, 120:7-9.)\n{33}\n    \nKornegay alleges that his efforts in originating and implementing a number of properties generated\napproximately $9.375 million in realized and unrealized profits for the Defendants.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep.\n288:14-289:3.)\n{34}\n    \nKornegay seeks 20% of the net profits for at least three properties that he claims to have originated\nand implemented, and that were sold during his term of employment.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 101:21-102:4,\n288:14-289:3; Michael Clardy Aff. ¶ 8.)\n{35}\n    \nKornegay also seeks 20% of the net profits on nine other properties that he claims to have\noriginated and implemented, but which were not sold during his tenure.\n[8]\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 101:21-\n103:11.)\n \n{36}\n    \nFinally, Kornegay seeks “fair compensation” (over and above his $72,000 annual salary) for his\nalleged efforts implementing or managing 10 other properties during his employment.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep.\n102:13-106:22.)\n  \n  \n \nIII.\nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW\nA.\nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n{37}\n    \nSummary judgment should be granted if “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories,\nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c)\n(2006).\n  \nThe moving party bears the burden of showing a lack of triable issues of fact. \n \nPembee Mfg. Corp.\nv. Cape Fear Constr. Co.\n, 313 N.C. 488, 491, 329 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1985). \n \nOnce the moving party meets\nthis burden, the nonmoving party must “produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that the [nonmoving\nparty] will be able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.”\n  \nCollingwood v. Gen. Elec. Real Estate\nEquities, Inc.\n, 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989).\n{38}\n    \nSummary judgment, however, is a drastic remedy that should be granted cautiously.\n  \nWhere the\nslightest doubt exists as to the merits of the motion, it should be denied.\n  \nFirst Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v.\nBranch Banking & Trust Co., \n282 N.C. 44, 50, 191 S.E.2d 683, 688 (1972); \nVolkman v. DP Assocs., \n48\nN.C. App. 155, 157, 268 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1980).\n{39}\n    \nWith this legal standard in mind, the Court proceeds to analyze the individual claims.\nB.\nBREACH OF CONTRACT\n1.\nLEGAL PRINCIPLES\n{40}\n    \nA \n“contract is an agreement, upon sufficient consideration, to do or not to do a particular thing.”\n \nOverall Co. v. Holmes\n, 186 N.C. 428, 431, 119 S.E. 817, 818 (1923). \n \nAn essential element to every\ncontract is mutuality of agreement.\n  \nD.M. Wright Builders, Inc. v. Bridgers\n, 2 N.C. App. 662, 667, 163\nS.E.2d 642, 645 (1968).\n  \nMutuality of agreement means that a contract’s “legal consequences are not\ndependent upon the impressions or understandings of one alone of the parties to it. \n \nIt is not what either\nthinks, but what both agree.”\n  \nOverall\n, 186 N.C. at 431-32, 119 S.E. at 818-19 (quoting \nPrince v. McRae\n,\n84 N.C. 674 (1881)).\n \n{41}\n    \nAn agreement to make a contract, or as the cases sometimes phrase it, “an agreement to agree,”\ndoes not constitute a binding obligation. \n \nGregory v. Perdue, Inc.\n, 47 N.C. App. 655, 657, 267 S.E.2d 584,\n586 (1980).\n  \n \n \nFor a contract to bind two parties, they must assent to the same thing in the same sense, and\ntheir minds must meet at least with respect to \nall\n material terms.\n  \nThus, a contract which leaves material\nterms open for future negotiations is invalid.\n  \nId.; Boyce v. McMahan\n, 285 N.C. 730, 734, 208 S.E.2d 692,\n695 (1974).\n  \nPut another way, “[i]f any portion of the proposed terms is not settled, there is no\nagreement.”\n  \nGoeckel v. Stokely\n, 236 N.C. 604, 607, 73 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1952).\n{42}\n    \nOn the other hand, “the law . . . does not favor the destruction of contracts on account of\nuncertainty, and ‘the courts will, if possible, so construe the contract as to carry into effect the reasonable\nintent of the parties, if it can be ascertained.’”\n  \nWelsh v. Northern Telecom\n, 85 N.C. App. 281, 290, 354\nS.E.2d 746, 751 (1987) (quoting \nFisher v. John L. Roper Lumber Co.\n, 183 N.C. 486, 490, 111 S.E. 857,\n860 (1922)).\n  \nWherever possible, “courts should attempt to determine the intent of the parties from the\nlanguage used, construed with reference to the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract.”\n  \nId.\n(citing \nChew v. Leonard\n, 228 N.C. 181, 44 S.E.2d 869 (1947)).\n{43}\n    \nFinally, even if a particular promise in an agreement is unenforceable because there was no\nmeeting of the minds between the parties, the court must still determine whether it may sever the invalid\nprovision and enforce the remainder.\n  \nIn that regard:\nA contract is entire, and not severable, when by its terms, nature and purpose it\ncontemplates and intends that each and all of its parts, material provisions, and the\nconsideration, are common each to the other and interdependent. \n \nSuch a contract\npossesses essential oneness in all material respects. . . . \n \nOn the other hand, a severable\ncontract is one in its nature and purpose susceptible of division and apportionment,\nhaving two or more parts, in respect to matters and things contemplated and embraced\nby it, not necessarily dependent upon each other, nor is it intended by the parties that\nthey shall be. . . .\n  \nIf it appear that the purpose was to take the whole or none, then the\ncontract would be entire; otherwise, it would be severable.\n \nWooten v. Walters, \n110 N.C. 251, 254-56, 14 S.E. 734, 735-36 (1892).\n \n2.\nANALYSIS\n{44}\n    \nApplying these legal principles here, neither side is entitled to summary judgment on Kornegay’s\nclaim for a bonus of 20% of net profits on investments that he originated and implemented.\n  \nDefendants\nare entitled, however, to partial summary judgment as to their purported promise to pay Kornegay\nadditional “fair compensation” for his work in implementing investment projects that he did not\noriginate.\n   \n{45}\n    \nWith respect to the disputed claim of a 20% “net profits” bonus, Defendants insist that such a\npromise is unenforceable as a matter of law where, as here, the parties fail to agree on the activities that\nwould qualify for a bonus or on a formula for calculating the same.\n  \n(Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for\nSumm. J. (“Defs’ Mem.”) 17-19.)\n  \nKornegay responds that courts routinely allow such cases to go to a\njury, even in the absence of a precise formula for calculating the amount of the bonus.\n  \n(Pl.’s Mem. 6-10.)\n{46}\n    \nIn fact, North Carolina courts have found such a promise sufficient to overcome a motion for\ndirected verdict where the parties, “\nby both their words and actions\n,” conveyed that they had reached a\n“meeting of the minds” with respect to the additional compensation.\n  \nArndt v. First Union Nat’l Bank\n, 170\nN.C. App. 518, 523, 613 S.E.2d 274, 278 (2005) (emphasis added) (holding that a directed verdict was\nproperly denied as to the existence of a contract based on an employer’s promise to pay a bonus of 20% of\nall net income that the employee earned for the employer where the employee offered evidence that the\nemployer paid the bonus in previous years); \nsee also Fulk v. Piedmont Music Ctr., \n138 N.C. App. 425,\n430, 531 S.E.2d 476, 480 (2000).\n  \nIn this case, however, Defendants never paid Kornegay a bonus, so\nArndt \nand \nFulk \ndo not foreclose summary judgment.\n{47}\n    \nBy the same token, however, the \nArndt \nand \nFulk \nholdings do not go as far as the Defendants urge.\n \nMerely because the Court of Appeals determined in those cases that the words and actions of the\npromisors were sufficient to raise issues of fact does not mean that such evidence is essential to send the\ncase to the jury.\n  \nI have not found (and the Defendants have not cited) any North Carolina authority\naffirming summary judgment for an employer on facts analogous to those before me, but Kornegay has\ncited persuasive authorities suggesting that summary judgment is not appropriate on these facts.\n  \nSee Wood\nv. James B. Nutter & Co., \n416 S.W.2d 635 (Mo. 1967) (reversing summary judgment in favor of an\nemployer based on an alleged oral agreement to pay the employee a salary plus one-third of the net profit\nderived from the employer’s servicing operation where there was no evidence of prior bonus payments by\nthe employer); \nsee also Pratt v. Seventy-One Hawthorne Place Assocs., \n106 S.W.3d 608 (Mo. Ct. App.\n2003).\n{48}\n    \nIn sum, while the Defendants’ arguments have some logical appeal (particularly in light of\nKornegay’s remarkable inability to fix on a consistent and stationary definition of the contours of the\nalleged 20% net profits bonus plan in his deposition testimony), Kornegay has shown that there remain\ngenuine issues for trial as to whether the parties reached “a meeting of the minds” and, if so, the precise\nterms of their contract.\n  \nSee Northington v. Michelotti, \n121 N.C. App. 180, 184, 464 S.E.2d 711, 714\n(1995) (stating that whether mutual assent has been established and whether a contract was intended\nbetween the parties are questions for the trier of fact).\n{49}\n    \nKornegay also alleges that the employment agreement required Defendants to provide additional\nbonus compensation for his work implementing real estate investments that he did not originate.\n  \nAs to this\npurported term, however, the parties did not specify with \nany\n degree of reasonable certainty how such\ncompensation would be calculated.\n \n{50}\n    \nKornegay asserts that his agreement with the Defendants as to investments implemented, but not\noriginated, by him was that he would receive “fair compensation.” (Kornegay Aff. ¶ 5.)\n  \n  \nThe various\ndraft employment agreements described this promise as a commitment to make “special arrangements” for\nadditional compensation.\n  \nFor purposes of this summary judgment motion, there is no material difference\nbetween these terms.\n{51}\n    \nThe bottom line is that the parties never agreed during their initial negotiations on how they would\ndetermine this additional compensation, opting instead to defer that issue for another day.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep.\n101:12-20.)\n  \nFor six years thereafter, the parties traded various draft agreements in an unsuccessful\nattempt to memorialize their entire oral bargain.\n  \nWhen Kornegay was terminated on 16 July 2004, he\ndeparted without being paid any bonus.\n \n{52}\n    \nOn these facts, Kornegay may not proceed with this portion of his claim for breach of contract:\nGenerally, a contract, or offer to contract, which leaves material portions open for future\nagreement is nugatory and void for indefiniteness. \n \nThe reason is that if a preliminary\ncontract fails to specify all of its material and essential terms so that some are left open\nfor future negotiations, then there is no way by which a court can determine the\nresulting terms of such future negotiations. \n \nHence, there is no basis upon which to\nascertain what damages, if any, might follow from a refusal to enter into such future\nagreement.\n \nNorth Carolina Nat’l Bank v. Wallens, \n26 N.C. App. 580, 583, 217 S.E.2d 12, 15 (1975).\n \n{53}\n    \nThe parties in this case left open for future negotiations the question of “fair compensation” for\nKornegay’s work not otherwise covered by the 20% net profits bonus.\n  \nSimply put, there was no meeting\nof the minds between these parties as to this essential term of the employment agreement.\n  \nSee, e.g.,\nVarney v. Ditmars,\n111 N.E. 822 (N.Y. 1916) (holding that a contract calling for an employee to receive “a\nfair share of the profits” is too vague, indefinite, and uncertain to be enforced); \nEdwards v. Central\nGeorgia HHS, Inc., \n253 Ga. App. 304, 558 S.E.2d 815 (2002) (declining to enforce a contract for a\npurported bonus payment because it was not for an exact amount or based upon a formula or method for\ndetermining the exact amount of the bonus); \nT’ai Corp. v. Kalso Systemet, Inc. \n568 F.2d 145, 147 (10th\nCir. 1977) (holding that an attempt to fix a quantity in a sales contract by such terms as “fair share” is too\nindefinite).\n  \nAs a result, the purported agreement is unenforceable.\n  \nSee Gray v. Hager\n, 69 N.C. App. 331,\n335, 317 S.E.2d 59, 62 (1984) (stating that a contract is unenforceable if its material terms are\nindefinite). \n \n{54}\n    \nFinally, applying the principles with respect to divisibility of contracts set forth in \nWooten\n, there\nalso exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the parties intended the two alleged promises\nregarding bonus payments to be part of a single indivisible contract (in which case the whole contract\nstands or falls together) or severable.\n  \nSee generally McLawhon v. Briley\n, 234 N.C. 394, 396, 67 S.E.2d\n285, 287 (1951); \nsee also Mioni v. Hewes, \n763 P.2d 414, 416 (Or. Ct. App. 1988) (stating that whether\npromises are severable from each other, “thereby making the contract divisible, depends on the intentions\nof the parties as reflected in the words that they used”).\n  \n \n{55}\n    \nAccordingly, the Court will \nDENY\n Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to that portion\nof the breach of contract claim arising from the alleged promise of a 20% net profits bonus but will\nGRANT\n Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to that portion of the breach of contract claim\narising from the alleged promise of additional “fair compensation.” \n  \nThe Court also \nDENIES\n Plaintiff’s\nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment as to the breach of contract claim.\nC.\nNORTH CAROLINA WAGE & HOUR ACT VIOLATIONS\n \n1.\nLEGAL PRINCIPLES\n{56}\n    \n“The Wage and Hour Act was enacted to safeguard the hours worked by and the wages paid to ‘the\npeople of the State without jeopardizing the competitive position of North Carolina business and\nindustry.’”\n  \nHorack v. S. Real Estate Co. of Charlotte, \n150 N.C. App. 305, 309, 563 S.E.2d 47, 521 (2002)\n(citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 95-25.1(b) (2001)). \n \nAn employee may sue under the Act to recover wages due\nand owing pursuant to the terms of the employment.\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 95-25.6.\n{57}\n    \nA “‘wage’ paid to an employee means compensation for labor or services rendered by an employee\nwhether determined on a time, task, piece, job, day, commission, or other basis of calculation . . . and . . .\nincludes [among other things] bonuses, when the employer has a policy or a practice of making such\npayments.”\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 95-25.2(16).\n{58}\n    \nThe Act defines an employer as “any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an\nemployer in relation to an employee.”\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 95-25.2(4).\n  \nBecause this is the same definition of\n“employer” as that found in the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C.S § 203(d) (2006), the\nNorth Carolina Department of Labor “looks to the judicial and administrative interpretation and rulings\nestablished under federal law as a guide for interpreting the North Carolina law.”\n  \nIn re Halperin, \n87 B.R.\n399, 400 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1987).\n  \nThis Court will do the same.\n{59}\n    \nThe federal cases interpreting the FLSA hold individuals jointly and severally liable with a\ncorporate employer for unpaid wages where they serve as part owners, officers, or directors of the\ncorporation, or where they are involved in the management of the corporation. \n \nId.\n (citing\n Donovan v.\nAgnew,\n 712 F.2d 1509 (1st Cir. 1983)); \nWirtz v. Soft Drinks of Shreveport, Inc.\n, 336 F. Supp. 950 (W.D.\nLa. 1971); \nDonovan v. Grim Hotel\n, 747 F.2d 966 (5th Cir. 1984).\n  \nHalperin \nteaches that the question of\nliability boils down to whether “the individual asserted sufficient ‘control’ to justify liability for wages.”\n \n87 B.R. at 400; s\nee also Horack, \n150 N.C. App. at 309, 563 S.E.2d at 51 (stating that a relevant factor is\n“the degree of control the alleged employer exerted over the person”).\n \n{60}\n    \nAn employer who violates the Wage and Hour Act is liable for the unpaid wages with interest\nfrom the date each amount first comes due.\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 95-25.22(a).\n  \nIn addition, the trial court must\ndouble any such judgment as a form of liquidated damages unless the employer proves that it acted in\ngood faith and that it had reasonable grounds for withholding payment, in which case, the Court may\ndecline to award liquidated damages or award a lesser sum.\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 95-25.22(a1).\n  \nThe Court may also\norder the employer to pay costs and a reasonable attorneys’ fee.\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 95-25.22(d).\n2.\nANALYSIS\n{61}\n    \nBecause there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to a portion of Kornegay’s claim for bonus\ncompensation and there is no dispute that Defendants have not paid Kornegay the full amount of the bonus\nclaimed in this action, the Court will \nDENY\n Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Kornegay’s\nclaim alleging a violation of the Wage & Hour Act.\n \n{62}\n    \nDefendants also argue that any alleged employment agreement was negotiated by Steve Clardy\nacting solely on behalf of Aspen.\n  \nAs a result, the remaining Defendants insist that they were not\nKornegay’s employer and, therefore, are not liable to him for any Wage and Hour Act violation.\n  \nBecause,\nhowever, there is evidence tending to show that: (a) Kornegay provided services to all of the Clardy\nEntities; (b) the Individual Defendants were all involved (at least to some degree) in the management of\none or more of the Clardy Entities; and (c) the Individual Defendants all exercised some measure of\ncontrol over Kornegay’s work activities and the decision to deny Kornegay his alleged bonus, the Court\nwill \nDENY\n the Motion of Defendants Chip Clardy, Mike Clardy, Basic Electric, Rocking B. Farms, and\nEarth Products for Summary Judgment as to the North Carolina Wage & Hour Act claim.\n[9]\n \nD.\nQUANTUM MERUIT\n1.\nLEGAL PRINCIPLES\n{63}\n    \n“\nQuantum meruit\n is an equitable principle that allows recovery for services based upon an implied\ncontract. \n \nThe law implies a promise to pay for services . . . where the recipient knowingly and voluntarily\naccepts the services and there is no showing that the services were gratuitously given.”\n  \nHarrell v.

App. 304, 307, 330 S.E.2d 627, 629 (1985).\n{65}\n    \nQuantum meruit\n is a measure of recovery for the reasonable value of services rendered in order to\nprevent \nunjust\n enrichment. \n \nPotter v. Homestead Preservation Ass'n\n, 330 N.C. 569, 578, 412 S.E.2d 1, 7\n(1992).\n  \nThe cases describe “unjust enrichment” as “the result or effect of a failure to make restitution of,\nor for, property or benefits received under such circumstances as to give rise to a legal or equitable\nobligation to account therefor.” \n \nIvey v. Williams\n, 74 N.C. App. 532, 534, 328 S.E.2d 837, 839 (1985).\n{66}\n    \nFurthermore, “the mere fact that one party was enriched, even at the expense of the other, does not\nbring the doctrine of unjust enrichment into play.\n  \nThere must be some added ingredients to invoke the\nunjust enrichment doctrine.”\n  \nWatson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, \n160 N.C. App. 647, 652, 587\nS.E.2d 87, 92 (2003) (quoting \nPeace River Elec. Coop., Inc. v.

Ex. 12.)\n{68}\n    \nThese disputed facts create a triable issue as to whether the Defendants were unjustly enriched by\nKornegay’s services.\n  \nAccordingly, the Court will \nDENY\n the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\nas to Kornegay’s Third Claim For Relief in \nQuantum Meruit.\n  \nHowever, in the absence of any claim that\nthe Clardy Entities are sham companies such that the Individual Defendants should bear personal liability\nfor Kornegay’s equitable claim,\n[10]\n the Court \nGRANTS\n summary judgment in favor of the Individual\nDefendants as to this claim.\nE.\nFRAUD\n1.\nLEGAL PRINCIPLES\n{69}\n    \n“The essential elements of fraud are: ‘(1) False representation or concealment of a material fact, (2)\nreasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5)\nresulting in damage to the injured party.’”\n  \nRowan County Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co.\n, 332 N.C. 1,\n17, 418 S.E.2d 648, 658 (1992) (quoting \nTerry v. Terry\n, 302 N.C. 77, 83, 273 S.E.2d 674, 677 (1981)).\n{70}\n    \n“As a general rule, a mere promissory misrepresentation will not support an action for fraud.”\n \nBraun v. Glade Valley Sch., Inc.\n, 77 N.C. App. 83, 87, 334 S.E.2d 404, 407 (1985). \n \nPut another way,\n“fraud cannot [ordinarily] be based on an allegation of a promise of future intent.”\n  \nId.\n  \nNevertheless, a\nplaintiff may recover for fraud where a promise of future intent is made with a present intention not to\nperform.\n  \nSee Cofield v. Griffin\n, 238 N.C. 377, 381, 78 S.E.2d 131, 134 (1953).\n2.\nANALYSIS\n{71}\n    \nIn this case, Kornegay alleges that the Defendants defrauded him when they promised him bonus\ncompensation because they never intended to keep that promise.\n  \nTo support his claim of fraud, Kornegay\npoints to (a) his performance in reliance on the promise; (b) the Defendants’ failure to establish specific\nbonus criteria over the course of his employment; (c) the Defendants’ failure to pay him a bonus; and (d)\nhis subsequent discharge.\n  \n(Pl.’s Mem. 16-17.)\n{72}\n    \nDefendants deny the allegations and point to evidence tending to show the absence of any\nfraudulent intent.\n  \nIn particular, the Defendants point to the extended negotiations by both sides to reach\nagreement on the specifics of a bonus compensation plan and Kornegay’s failure to demonstrate reliance\n“in light of his willingness to continue working for eight years without a written bonus plan.”\n  \n(Defs.’\nMem. 27.)\n  \n{73}\n    \nOur Supreme Court has emphasized that “[a]llegations of fraud do not readily lend themselves to\nresolution by way of summary judgment because a cause of action based on fraud usually requires the\ndetermination of a litigant's state of mind.”\n  \nJohnson v.

Farms,\nBasic Electric, and Earth Products.\n  \nCONCLUSION\n{76}\n    \nBased upon the foregoing, the Court will:\n(1)\n        \nDENY \nthe Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to Kornegay’s First Claim for\nRelief alleging violations of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act;\n(2)\n        \nDENY \nthe Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to that portion of Kornegay’s\nSecond Claim for Relief alleging a breach of contract for unpaid bonuses of 20% of net profits on\ninvestments that Kornegay originated and implemented;\n(3)\n        \nGRANT\n the Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to that portion of Kornegay’s\nSecond Claim for Relief alleging a breach of contract for additional “fair compensation” for\nKornegay’s work in implementing investments;\n(4)\n        \nDENY\n Kornegay’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to the Second Claim for\nRelief alleging breach of contract;\n(5)\n        \nGRANT \nthe Individual Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to Kornegay’s\nThird Claim for Relief alleging recovery in \nquantum meruit\n;\n(6)\n        \nDENY\n the Clardy Entities’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to Kornegay’s Third Claim\nfor Relief alleging recovery in \nquantum meruit\n;\n(7)\n        \nDENY\n the Motion for Summary Judgment of Defendants C. Steve Clardy and Aspen as to\nKornegay’s Fourth Claim for Relief alleging fraud; and,\n(8)\n        \nGRANT\n the remaining Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to the claim for\nfraud.\n           \nThis the ____ day of September, 2006.\n \n                                                           \n[1]\n The Court’s Order will sometimes refer to Defendants C. Steve Clardy, Michael Clardy, and Chip Clardy, collectively as the\n“Individual Defendants.”\n  \nThe Court’s Order will also refer to Defendants Aspen Asset Group, LLC, Rocking B. Farms, LLC,\nBasic Electric Company, Inc., and Earth Products Company, LLC collectively as the “Clardy Entities.”\n[2]\n This claim is incorrectly denominated in the Plaintiff’s Verified Complaint as the “Third” Claim for Relief.\n[3]\n According to Kornegay, the $72,000 sum consisted of a $50,000 base salary, with the balance being a draw against his expected\nbonus.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 22:23-27:6.)\n  \nKornegay further alleged that he would not forfeit the $22,000 draw, regardless of whether\nhe earned a bonus in any particular year.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 22:23-27:6.)\n[4]\n Although not in dispute here, Kornegay was also promised the opportunity to participate as an equity partner in any real estate\ninvestments.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 28:10-16, 159:16-24.)\n[5]\n Kornegay also testified that “fair compensation” could be calculated using either an hourly rate or by reference to a percentage\nof the profits, depending on the work that he performed.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 230:19-231:2, 244:21-245:2, 246:8-23.)\n[6]\n In his deposition testimony, however, Kornegay insisted that his net profits bonus should also include a 20% cut of any annual\nprofits generated by rents or other income producing activities.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. 265:17-266:6.)\n[7]\n Kornegay asserts that this was not the first draft of the agreement exchanged by the parties.\n  \n(\nSee \nPl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to Defs.’\nMot. for Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) 3 n.2.)\n  \nI find that any factual dispute as to the precise sequence of the various draft agreements\ncontained in this record is not material to the issues before me.\n[8]\n As to this element of his damages, Kornegay alleges that he should recover 20% of the appraised value of the unsold property at\nthe time of his termination, less some unspecified cost estimate.\n  \n(Kornegay Dep. Ex. 12.)\n[9]\n The cases relied on by the Defendants in support of a more restrictive definition of the term “employer” are not dispositive,\neither because they do not involve claims under the North Carolina Wage & Hour Act, \nsee, e.g., Houpe v. City of Statesville\n, 128\nN.C. App. 334, 344-45, 497 S.E.2d 82, 89 (1998), or because the employee failed to allege that the individual defendants were\nemployers.\n  \nSee, e.g., Sides v. Duke Univ.\n, 74 N.C. App. 331, 344-345, 328 S.E.2d 818, 828 (1985), \nabrogated on other grounds by\nKurtzman v.
