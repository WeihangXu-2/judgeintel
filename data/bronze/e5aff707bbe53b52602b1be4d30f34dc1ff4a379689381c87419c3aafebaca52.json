The Court determines the matter without further oral argument pursuant \nto Rule 15.4 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Business Court.  \nAfter considering the matters of record, briefs of counsel, and authorities cited, the \nCourt determines that attorneys’ fees in the total amount of $14,680.70 and costs of \n$5,182.83 should be taxed solely against Plaintiff Southeast Air Charter, Inc. \n(“SEAC”). \nYarborough, Winters & Neville, P.A. by J. Thomas Neville for Plaintiff. \nVan Camp, Meacham & Newman, PLLC by Thomas M. Van Camp and \nRichard Lee Yelverton, III for Defendants Russell Viall, Kathleen Steiner-\nCrowley, and Karen Lee Robinson. \nGale, Chief Judge. \nI. BACKGROUND \n{2} This Court issued its initial J une 30, 2015 Order (“Initial Order”), \ndetermining that sanctions were appropriate in regard to some but not all of \n \n \nPlaintiff’s claims, leaving open the amount of attorneys’ fees to be awarded and \nagainst whom they should be taxed, pending receipt of supporting documentation.  \nThe Court now enters its Final Order, incorporating findings and conclusions from \nthe Initial Order, and repeating only those findings necessary to provide context for \nthis Final Order.   \n{3} Plaintiff initiated this action on September 22, 2011, and filed an \nAmended Complaint on January 30, 2012.  Relevant to this Order, the Complaint \nand Amended Complaint alleged the following claims against Defendants Kathleen \nSteiner-Crowley (“Steiner-Crowley”), Karen Robinson (“Robinson”), and Russell \nViall (“Viall”) (collectively, “the Moving Defendants”): (1) breach of fiduciary duty; \n(2) constructive fraud; (3) conversion; (4) trespass to personalty; (5) unjust \nenrichment; (6) unfair and deceptive trade practices (“UDTP”); (7) fraud; (8) tortious \ninterference with contract; (9) tortious interference with prospective contract; (10) \nconspiracy; (11) unauthorized appropriation for invasion of privacy; (12) piercing the \ncorporate veil; (13) reverse piercing the corporate veil; and (14) punitive damages.   \n{4} The Moving Defendants have been represented by Van Camp, \nMeacham & Newman, PLLC (“the Firm”).  Service of a summons on Robinson was \ndelayed for several months, during which period the Firm represented Steiner-\nCrowley and Viall, who each agreed to pay one-half of the Firm’s charges.  After \nservice upon Robinson, the three Moving Defendants agreed to share fees on an \nequal, one-third basis.  After claims against Steiner-Crowley were dismissed on \nSeptember 10, 2013, Robinson and Viall assumed responsibility for equal shares of \nthe Firm’s charges. \n{5} All claims against the Moving De fendants were dismissed before the \nCourt was required to consider them upon motion.  None of the Moving Defendants \nfiled a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil \nProcedure (“Rule(s)”).  After the litigation had been pending for several months, \nPlaintiff dismissed claims against Steiner-Crowley before she had filed any \ndispositive motion.  Robinson and Viall filed a motion for summary judgment on \nNovember 26, 2013.  Prior to oral argument, Plaintiff dismissed the breach of \n \n \nfiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims against Robinson and Viall on January \n27, 2014, but did not dismiss the conspiracy claim.  Robinson and Viall filed a \nsecond motion for summary judgment on April 1, 2014, seeking to dismiss the \nconspiracy claims.  Plaintiff did not file an opposition but voluntarily dismissed all \nremaining claims against Robinson and Viall on April 24, 2015. \n{6} On August 28, 2014, the Moving Defendants filed their Motion for \nAttorneys’ Fees and Costs.  In its Initial Order, the Court determined that Rule 11 \nsanctions were appropriate as to only some claims, including all claims against \nSteiner-Crowley and breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims against \nRobinson and Viall.  Se. Air Charter, Inc. v. Stroud, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 68, *21–22 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. June 30, 2015).  The Court deferred determination of the amount of \nsanctions pending further documentation of attorneys’ fees incurred.  Id. at *27. \n{7} On July 18, 2015, the Moving Defendants submitted the Affidavit of \nThomas M. Van Camp (“Van Camp”), requesting a total of $35,887.01 in attorneys’ \nfees, reflecting $19,322.00 of fees charged to Steiner-Crowley, $7,578.12 of fees \ncharged to Robinson, and $8,986.89 of fees charged to Viall.  Van Camp indicates \nthat the requested sums for Robinson and Viall represent one-third of the total fees \nthey incurred while the fiduciary duty claims were pending against them, less any \ncharges that pertained solely to other claims.  (Van Camp Aff. ¶ 10, July 8, 2015.) \n {8} Plaintiff’s counsel, J. Thomas Ne ville (“Neville”), submitted affidavits \nto support his argument that no sanctions should be imposed against him or his \nfirm because he conducted a reasonable and adequate investigation to warrant his \nbelief that there was a valid factual basis for each claim at the time it was filed.  In \nparticular, Neville asserts that he reasonably relied on assurances from his client \nthat Steiner-Crowley, Robinson, and Viall were each active participants in the \nwrongs committed against Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff had vested each with \nsufficient trust and confidence to subject them to a proper claim of breach of \nfiduciary duty, even though they were employees and not officers or directors.  \nMoving Defendants contend that sanctions should be jointly imposed on Plaintiff \nand Neville. \n \n \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n{9} If a trial court concludes that a Rule 11 violation has occurred, it \nfashions an appropriate sanction and determines upon whom to impose such \nsanction.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 11(a).  The decision is to be made upon the trial court’s \nexercise of sound discretion, which should not be based upon “irrelevant or improper \nmatters.”  \nHill v. Hill, 173 N.C. App. 309, 315, 622 S.E.2d 503, 508 (2005) (quoting \nCent. Carolina Nissan, Inc. v. Sturgis, 98 N.C. App. 253, 264, 390 S.E.2d 730, 737 \n(1990)).  The imposition of actual sanctions must not be “manifestly unsupported by \nreason or . . . so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned \ndecision.”  Couch v. Private Diagnostic Clinic, 146 N.C. App. 658, 667, 554 S.E.2d \n356, 363 (2001) (quoting State v. Fowler, 353 N.C. 599, 620, 548 S.E.2d 684, 699 \n(2001)).  When awarding attorneys’ fees, the trial court makes “findings regarding \nthe time and labor expended, the skill required to perform the services rendered, \nthe customary fee for like work, and the experience and ability of the attorney.”  \nMcKinnon v. CV Indus., 745 S.E.2d 343, 351 (N.C. Ct. App. 2013) (quoting Shepard \nv. Bonita Vista Props., L.P., 191 N.C. App. 614, 626, 664 S.E.2d 388, 396 (2008), \naff’d per curiam, 363 N.C. 252, 675 S.E.2d 332 (2009)); see also Polygenex Int’l, Inc. \nv. Polyzen, Inc., 133 N.C. App. 245, 253, 515 S.E.2d 457, 463 (1999).  When doing so, \nit considers the degree of complexity of the specific case.  VSD Commc’ns, Inc. v. \nLone Wolf Publ’g Grp., Inc., 124 N.C. App. 642, 646, 478 S.E.2d 214, 217 (1996). \nIII. ANALYSIS \n{10} To determine whether the claimed fees are reasonable, the Court \nconsiders both the rate at which fees were charged and the total amount of time \nexpended in representation.   \n{11} The Firm’s charges were for efforts by three attorneys and one \nparalegal.  Van Camp, a partner at the Firm who has practiced law in North \nCarolina for twenty-five years, was primarily responsible for the defense.  From \n2011 to 2013, Van Camp billed at the rate of $300 per hour.  He increased his billing \nrate in 2013 to $325 per hour and in 2014 to $350 per hour.  Richard Yelverton, III \n \n \nand Evelyn Savage were associates with eight years’ experience when they began to \nwork on the matter.  Yelverton worked on the matter from 2011 to 2012 with an \ninitial billing rate of $230 per hour, which was increased to $250 per hour in 2012.  \nSavage worked on the matter from 2013 to 2014, with an initial billing rate of $225 \nper hour, which was increased to $240 per hour in 2014.  Lorie Morse, a paralegal \nwith approximately twenty-five years of legal experience, had an initial billing rate \nof $100 per hour, which was increased to $125 per hour in 2013. \n{12} The Court is aware of rates charge d for similar matters in the Superior \nCourt, including matters designated to this Court from Moore County and similar \nlocations.  The Court finds that the hourly rates charged were appropriate and \nreasonable for this case and other cases of similar complexity.  Accordingly, the \nhourly rates charged were appropriate and reasonable. \n{13} The Court then considers whether the overall amount of time charged \non the matter was also reasonable.  “The most useful starting point for determining \nthe amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the \nlitigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.”  \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. \n424, 433 (1983), quoted in Out of the Box Devs., LLC v. Doan Law, LLP, 2014 \nNCBC LEXIS 39, *23–24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 29, 2014).  “[H]ours that are \nexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary” are not reasonable and should not \nbe included in the trial court’s assessment of attorneys’ fees. \nHensley, 461 U.S. at \n434.  That determination is neither easy nor straightforward under the particular \ncircumstances of this case. \n{14} The Court has reviewed the Firm’s invoices and finds that, overall, \nresponsibility was fairly allocated without unnecessary duplication of effort or other \navoidable inefficiency.   \n{15} In its Initial Order, the Court co ncluded that all of the claims made \nagainst Steiner-Crowley are subject to sanctions because there was not a sufficient \nfactual basis to present them.  By her motion, Steiner-Crowley contends that this \nwas apparent at the time the Complaint was first filed.  It follows that it was \napparent to her counsel as well as Plaintiff or its counsel.  Yet Steiner-Crowley was \n \n \ncharged an equal share of fees and never moved to dismiss the Complaint or the \nAmended Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).  While she remained a defendant, Steiner-\nCrowley was charged a proportionate share of the Firm’s fees in discovery, motion \npractice, and general defense efforts.      \n{16} As all claims against her are subj ect to sanctions, allocation of fees \nbetween various claims against Steiner-Crowley is not required.  However,  it does \nnot necessarily follow that she is entitled to recover all attorneys’ fees charged to \nher.  Her motion asserts there were never any grounds for the claims SEAC alleged \nagainst her.  (Defs.’ Mot. Clarification Req. Oral Arg. ¶¶ 14–16.)  Steiner-Crowley \nshould bear some responsibility for not attacking those claims on the pleadings \nbefore incurring significant other expense.   \n{17} Taking all factors into consider ation, the Court, in its discretion, \nconcludes that Steiner-Crowley’s attorneys’ fees should be discounted by fifty \npercent.  Plaintiff is then taxed for her attorneys’ fees in the total amount of \n$9,661.00. \n{18} The Court must determine how to allocate attorneys’ fees for claims \nagainst Robinson and Viall between those claims that are subject to sanctions and \nthose that are not.  The sanctions arise from the Court’s conclusion that there was \nnot an adequate factual basis to assert a colorable claim that Robinson and Viall, as \nemployees who were not also officers and directors, owed fiduciary duties to \nPlaintiff.  The Court determined that other claims, while perhaps not ultimately \nmeritorious, had a sufficient factual basis so that sanctions are not appropriate for \nthose claims. \n{19} The Court does not accept Van Camp’s suggestion that one-third of \nattorneys’ fees charged to Robinson and Viall should be allocated to the breach of \nfiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims.  In his second affidavit, Van Camp \ncontends this one-third allocation supports a combined award to Robinson and Viall \ntotaling $16,656.01.  (See Van Camp Aff., July 8, 2015.) \n{20} As an initial matter, the Court co ncludes that the total attorneys’ fees \ncharged to Robinson and Viall for the defense of all claims were reasonable as to \n \n \nrate, total number of hours charged, and division of efforts among the Firm’s \nlawyers and support staff in light of the claims presented.  As to whether claims \nagainst Robinson and Viall should have also been attacked by an early motion on \nthe pleadings, defense counsel faced different strategic considerations.  Even if \ncounsel believed the motion was strong regarding the claims now subject to \nsanctions, the strong possibility that other claims would have survived an early \ndispositive motion justified allowing even the weak claims to survive.  There is an \nobvious factual overlap among the various claims.  That same factual overlap \nrequires that the Court give due regard to the principle that Rule 11 only permits \nsanctions in “the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of \nthe pleading.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 11 (emphasis added).  \n{21} Even if the Amended Complaint had not included the breach of \nfiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims, Robinson and Viall would have \nincurred attorneys’ fees in connection with the other claims, including those \nresulting from preparing responsive pleadings, attending court proceedings and \ndepositions, addressing issues with service and default, and other necessary efforts \nreflected in the Firm’s invoices during the course of the defense.   \n{22} Van Camp acknowledges that the attorneys’ fees documented in his \naffidavit “reflect work done on all of the claims[,] not just the claims for Breach of \nFiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud.”  (Van Camp. Aff. ¶ 10, July 8, 2015.)  The \nCourt has reviewed the invoices in detail.  Having done so, it concludes that \nawarding one-third of those total fees would be excessive, as it cannot determine \nthat this amount was incurred solely because the Complaint and Amended \nComplaint included the breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims.   \nThere is, however, no precise way to determine the appropriate amount to award \nfrom the combined effort.  The Court, therefore, concludes that it is appropriate to \nallocate the total fees on a percentage basis to take into account an award \n \n \nconsistent with Rule 11.1  See Am. Agri-Brokers v. Phykitt, No. 1:88-cv-00657 \n(E.D.N.C. Oct 3, 1991), cited with approval in Out of the Box Devs., 2014 NCBC \nLEXIS 39, at *26–28, and Noel Allen, North Carolina Business Practice § 11.05, at \n11-17 (3d ed. 2014).2 \n{23} Considering all factors, the Court, in its discretion, determines that an \nappropriate sanction is ten percent of the total attorneys’ fees charged to Robinson \nand Viall, fairly reflecting the time reasonably expended because factually \ninsufficient claims were included in the Complaint and Amended Complaint.  Those \namounts are $2,296.40 and $2,723.30 respectively, for Robinson and Viall, for a \ntotal of $5,01970.  This amount should be taxed against Plaintiff.  Combined with \nthose fees awarded to Steiner-Crowley, the Court imposes a total sanction of \n$14,680.70 in attorneys’ fees.  The Court also incorporates, from its Initial Order, its \nfinding of costs other than attorneys’ fees that should be taxed against Plaintiff.    \n{24} The Court now turns to the ques tion of whether these sanctions and \ncosts should be taxed jointly against Plaintiff and its counsel.  In considering \nwhether to sanction counsel, the controlling question is whether counsel “acted with \nobjective reasonableness under the circumstances when [he] signed the pleading in \n                                                 \n1 It is significant that Rule 11’s purpose is to sanction an inappropriate pleading.  The policy \nunderlying the imposition of sanctions is easily distinguished from the policy underlying the statute  \nthat allows for the recovery of attorneys’ fees upon the successful pursuit of a claim for which there is \na statutory basis for recovering attorneys’ fees.  In the latter case, deducting a percentage of \nattorneys’ fees would potentially defeat a plaintiff’s ability to receive a full recovery.  Even though \nthere may have been a factual nexus among claims on which plaintiff succeeded and those on which \nshe did not, it might be unfair to deduct attorneys’ fees where the plaintiff was required to develop a \ncommon factual record in order to recover on any claim.  See Okwara v. Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc., \n136 N.C. App. 587, 596, 525 S.E.2d 481, 487 (2000) (assessing fees under an award statute and \nnoting that “plaintiff’s claims arose from a common nucleus of operative facts” and that \napportionment of fees relating to unsuccessful claims was not necessary).  But, the purpose of \nimposing Rule 11 sanctions is not to assure a full recovery on claims arising from a common factual \nnucleus.  Rather, the purpose is to sanction conduct and the statutory direction is to sanction only \nthat portion of efforts that would not have been required but for the improper claims.  When it \nenacted Rule 11, the legislature “never intend[ed] to constrain or discourage counsel from the \nappropriate, well-reasoned pursuit of a just result for their client.”  \nGrover v. Norris, 137 N.C. App. \n487, 495, 529 S.E.2d 231, 235 (2000). \n2 These sources addressed the award of fees to a successful plaintiff bringing an action under a \nstatute allowing for the recovery of fees, such as section 75-16.1.  The Court has noted that this type \nof award presents different policy considerations when determining whether to allocate fees.  The \nsources are useful and instructive, however, in considering possible allocation methods. \n \n \nquestion.”  Lincoln v. Bueche, 166 N.C. App. 150, 156, 601 S.E.2d 237, 243 (2004) \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Turner v. Duke Univ., 325 N.C. 152, \n164, 381 S.E.2d 706, 713 (1989)).   The Complaint was filed in close proximity to the \nexpiration of the statute of limitations for many of the asserted claims.  Time \npressures alone do not excuse a reasonable inquiry before filing claims, but those \ntime pressures may limit the ability to subject client statements to searching \nindependent scrutiny.  Here, Neville testified that he relied on express statements \nfrom his clients that Plaintiff’s owners had reposed trust and confidence in Steiner-\nCrowley, Robinson, and Viall of a degree sufficient for the law to impose upon them \nspecial fiduciary duties commensurate with that trust.  \n{25}  The Court determined that these client representations were without \nan adequate factual basis.  That finding does not necessarily equate to a conclusion \nthat it was unreasonable for Neville to accept and rely on his client’s assertions and \nproceed to file claims based on them.  Clearly, even accepting those client \nrepresentations as true, the assertion of a fiduciary duty against the Moving \nDefendants was, at best, at the edge of case law that might arguably support a \nfiduciary duty arising from the employment responsibilities of an employee who was \nnot also an officer or director.  That was particularly so with regard to Steiner-\nCrowley, and the Court has struggled most with whether Neville had a sufficiently \nreasoned basis to assert a breach of fiduciary duty claim against her.  The \nComplaint and Amended Complaint allege that Steiner-Crowley served as SEAC’s \nAssistant Charter Sales Manager from November 1, 2005, to February 8, 2008, and \nin that position was responsible for assisting Robinson with all day-to-day activities \nof the sales team, assisting Robinson with the maintenance and control of the entry \nof client contact information into a data system, providing daily support to sales \nstaff in response to client inquiries, assisting with the generation of new business \nthrough telemarketing, and assisting to ensure follow-up on lead sales to staff.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 20, 43–44; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20, 45–46.)  At least during discovery, it \nbecame clear that she was subordinate to Defendant Barry Stroud (“Stroud”), \nSEAC’s president.  Additionally, Steiner-Crowley ceased working at SEAC before \n \n \nthe occurrence of most of the alleged acts giving rise to claims for conversion, \ntrespass, unjust enrichment, UDTP, fraud, tortious interference, and unauthorized \nappropriation. \n{26} Where an employee is neither an officer nor a director, extraordinary \ncircumstances are necessary to impose a fiduciary duty arising out of the \nemployment relationship.  See Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 652, 548 S.E.2d 704, \n708 (2001) (“Under the general rule, the relation of employer and employee is not \none of those regarded as confidential.” (internal quotations and citations omitted)); \nSunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head & Engquist Equip., LLC, 2002 NCBC LEXIS 2, *15 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. July 10, 2002) (noting that management over an entity’s day-to-day \noperation does not, itself, give rise to a fiduciary duty claim).  Absent extraordinary \ncircumstances of special relationships of trust and confidence leading to dominion \nand control, employees who are not also officers and directors should not be put to \nthe burden of defending fiduciary duty claims. Here, it is a close question whether \nPlaintiff’s representations to Neville regarding the nature and character of Steiner-\nCrowley’s position were adequate to form a sufficient factual basis for asserting a \nfiduciary duty. \n{27} The factual allegations concerning  Robinson’s and Viall’s respective \nduties come closer to describing a position akin to that of a \nde facto officer.  Where \nan employee exercises sufficient discretionary authority and dominion over her \nemployer, such that the employer becomes “subjugated” to that employee, it is \npossible that a fiduciary relationship lies.  Tai Sports, Inc. v. Hall, 2012 NCBC \nLEXIS 64, *48–49 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 28, 2012). \n {28} Based on his client’s assertions, Neville filed a Complaint and \nAmended Complaint asserting that Viall was Plaintiff’s Director of Operations and \nwas responsible for developing policies concerning flight operations; complying with \nall laws, rules, and regulations governing flight; overseeing and implementing \ntraining required by the Federal Aviation Regulations; safely operating all aircraft \nowned or managed by Plaintiff; ensuring that all aircraft were in compliance with \nFederal Aviation Administration and company regulations; and ensuring that each \n \n \nsatellite base had a qualified Chief Pilot.  (Compl. ¶ 39; Am. Compl. ¶ 41.)  Plaintiff \npled that Robinson served as Charter Sales Manager and Bookkeeper, responsible \nfor managing “all day to day [sic] activities,” maintaining and controlling client \ncontact information, providing daily support to sales staff, generating new business, \nand ensuring follow-up on leads to sales staff.  (Compl. ¶¶ 40–41; Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n42–43.)  Pursuant to her employment responsibilities, Robinson was privy to \nconfidential client information.  (Compl. ¶ 42; Am. Compl. ¶ 44.)  These duties and \nresponsibilities provided Neville a stronger basis from which to conclude that \nRobinson’s and Viall’s duties were sufficiently expansive to allow a fiduciary duty \nclaim to survive early dismissal.  See Sunbelt Rentals, 2002 NCBC LEXIS 2, at \n*17–20.    \n {29}  As noted in its Initial Order, later deposition testimony from \nPlaintiff’s deposition designee to the effect that Robinson and Viall were “run of the \nmill” employees who took direction from Stroud (Southeast Air Charter, Inc. \n30(b)(6) Dep. Vol. I 226:5–:7) weakened the factual premise on which claims had \nbeen asserted.  But, for purposes of considering sanctions against counsel, the \ninquiry concerns Neville’s reasonable and good-faith belief at the time the claims \nwere filed based on adequate investigation that facts supporting the claims existed.    \n {30} Earlier in the litigation, as part of case management, the Court \nexpressed its concern about the reach of the claims in the Complaint and Amended \nComplaint, in particular that the claims extended beyond those centrally involved \nin the underlying alleged factual events.  The Court cautioned against proceeding \nwith such claims without an adequate factual basis.  Plaintiff proceeded, cognizant \nof the risk that an award of attorneys’ fees may follow.  Although the Court does not \ntake imposing sanctions lightly, after a considered and comprehensive review, the \nCourt concludes that limited sanctions are appropriate.  However, in its discretion, \nafter considering the entire record, briefs, arguments of counsel, and the policies \nunderlying Rule 11, the Court concludes that these sanctions should be taxed solely \nagainst Plaintiff and not against its counsel. \n \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \n{31} For the foregoing reasons, as it s Final Order, the Court orders that \nPlaintiff Southeast Air Charter, Inc. shall pay: \n1. Defendant Kathleen Steiner-Crowley attorneys’ fees in the amount of \n$9,661.00; \n2. Defendant Karen Lee Robinson attorneys’ fees in the amount of \n$2,296.40; \n3. Defendant Russell Viall attorneys’ fees in the amount of $2,723.30; \n4.
