Dismiss Sec. Am. Compl., ECF No. 288.)  The Motion to Dismiss Second \nAmended Complaint seeks dismissal of Defendants on two distinct grounds: (1) under \nNorth Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(2) \n(hereinafter, the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure will be referred to as \n“Rule(s)”), based on lack of personal jurisdiction over GFY Industries Limited  \n(“GFY”), GFY, Limitada de Capital Variable  (“GFY LCV”), GFY Cooperative, U.A.  \n(“GFY Coop”) , and GFY S H (collectively, “GFY Defendants”);  and (2) under Rule \n12(b)(6) for  failure to state claims as to all Defendants.  Defendants sought, and the \nCourt granted, leave for the GFY Defendants to separately file a brief in support of \ntheir 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction  (“GFY Defendants’ \nMotion”), and for all Defendants to file a single, consolidated brief in support of their \n12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. \nOn November 14, 2018, the Court issued its order and opinion on the GFY \nDefendants’ Motion and granted that  Motion with respect to GFY, GFY LCV, and \nGFY SH , dismissing those parties from the case.   Global Textile All., Inc. v. TDI \nWorldwide, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 117 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 14, 2018).  The Court \ndid not dismiss the claims against GFY Coop.  \nThe Court now addresses the Rule 12(b)(6) Motion of Defendants Ryan Graven \n(“Ryan”), Dolven Enterprises, Inc.  (“Dolven”), and GFY Coop. (collectively Ryan, \nDolven, and GFY Coop are “Dolven Defendants,” and the motion for determination is \nreferred to as “Dolven Defendants’ Motion”). \nTHE COURT, having considered the Dolven Defendants’ Motion , the briefs \nfiled in support of and in opposition to the Dolven Defendants’ Motion, the arguments \nof counsel at the hearing, and other appropriate matters of record, concludes that the \nDolven Defendants’ Motion should be GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part, in \nthe manner and for the reasons set forth below. \nHagan Barrett & Langley PLLC, by J.

The facts relevant to d etermination of the Dolven Defendants’ Motion  \nare drawn from the Second Amended Complaint.  (“SAC”, ECF No. 261.) \nA. Parties Relevant to the Motion \n2. Plaintiff Global Textile Alliance, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) is a North Carolina \ncorporation with its principal place of business in Rockingham County, North \nCarolina.  Plaintiff is in the business of providing fabrics, mattress ticking, covers, \nand other textiles to the bedding, upholstery, and home furnishings industries. (ECF \nNo. 261, at ¶ 1.)  \n3. Plaintiff was founded in 2001 by Luc Tack (“Tack”), a Belgian \nEntrepreneur, and Defendants Timothy Dolan (“Timothy”) and Steven Graven \n(“Steven”), “for the purpose of providing fabric sourcing alternatives to furniture and \nbedding manufacturers in the United States.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 20–21.)  Tack provided the \nfunding to start Plaintiff, and Timothy incorporated Plaintiff and transferred all of \nits shares to Tack in the fall of 2001.  ( Id. at ¶ 21.)  Since that time, Tack has been \nthe sole shareholder of Plaintiff.  (Id.)  Until April 2016, Timothy served as Plaintiff’s \nCEO and as a director, and Steven served as Plaintiff’s Executive Vice President and \nas a director.  ( Id. at ¶¶  4, 6.)  Timothy, Steven, and Tack made up the Plaintiff’s \nthree person Board of Directors.  (Id. at ¶ 23.) \n4. Defendant Ryan is the son of Steven and a former employee of Plaintiff.  \n(Id. at ¶ 7.)  Ryan served as the legal representative and head operating manager of \nPlaintiff’s operations in China.  (Id. at ¶ 7.) \n5. Defendant Dolven  is a North Carolina corporation with its principal \nplace of business in North Carolina.  ( Id. at ¶ 3.)  Dolven is owned in equal twenty -\nfive percent shares  by Timothy , Steven, Ryan, and James Dolan (“James ”).  ( Id.)  \nDolven is engaged in the business of sourcing fabrics, cutting and sewing fabrics, and \nproviding other services in the bedding and fabric industries  in direct competition \nwith Plaintiff.  (Id.) \n6. Defendant GFY Coop was formed in the Netherlands.  (Id. at ¶ 11.)  GFY \nCoop is managed and controlled by Dolven.  (Id.)  \nB. Plaintiff’s Business and Ryan’s Role with Plaintiff’s Asia Operations \n7. Plaintiff uses third -party vendors to provide certain products an d \nservices integral to its manufacturing of its products.  Plaintiff contracts with third -\nparty fabric mills to manufacture some of its fabrics.  Plaintiff also contracts with \n“cut-and-sew” operations to further process the fabric that Plaintiff manufactur es \ninto final products for its customers.  The third-party fabric mills and cut -and-sew \noperations are located primarily in China.   Plaintiff uses an “extremely selective” \nprocess to identify qualified third parties, a process that requires significant amounts \nof time and money.  (Id. at ¶ 29.) \n8. In or around 2005, Plaintiff hired Ryan to set up an office in China and \nto oversee all of Plaintiff’s business within Asia.  (Id. at ¶¶ 34–35.)  Plaintiff initially \ndid its sourcing in China through a Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise (“WOFE”) \nnamed Paradise, which is owned by Tack.  ( Id. at ¶ 36.)  In 2010, Plaintiff created \nGuanteng (“GTA Asia”), a nother WOFE, to conduct business on its behalf in Asia.  \n(Id. at ¶  36.)  Ryan was named Director of GTA A sia and served as the legal \nrepresentative of GTA Asia.  (Id.)  Through GTA Asia, Plaintiff invested “significant \namounts of time and money” to identify, select, and develop relationships with \nChinese vendors capable of providing high-quality, reliable products and services for \nPlaintiff.  (Id. at ¶¶ 40–41.)  \n9. During his time in China, Ryan’s responsibilities included identifying \nqualified and reliable Chinese fabric mills and cut-and-sew vendors for Plaintiff and \noverseeing the vendors’ work for Plaintiff.  (Id. at ¶ 35.)  In his role as Director of GTA \nAsia, Ryan was entrusted to represent the legal interests of GTA Asia, had the power \nto enter binding contracts on behalf of GTA Asia,  had control over GTA Asia’s cash \nand capital, and had the power to set  pricing and payment terms for goods sold and \npurchased by Plaintiff and GTA Asia.  ( Id. at ¶ 37.)  The only supervisor Ryan \nreported to in carrying out his duties was Timothy.  (Id.)  Plaintiff alleges “[t]he effect \nof setting up GTA Asia, with [ ] Ryan [ ] in charge and reporting only to Timothy [ ], \nwas to remove the trading activities done for GTA from Paradise and place them \nunder the direct management and control of [ ]Ryan Graven and Timothy [ ].”  (Id.) \n10. Ryan worked on Plaintiff’s behalf in Asia  until 2012 , when Ryan’s \nbrother, Garrett Graven (“Garrett”), replaced Ryan as Director of GTA Asia.  ( Id. at \n¶ 38.)  Ryan, however,  maintained employment with Plaintiff and continued \noverseeing various individuals who filled the role of legal representative and Director \nof GTA Asia.  (Id.)   \nC. GFY, Dolven, GFY LCV, GFY Coop, and GFY Shanghai Created to Divert \nCorporate Opportunities from Plaintiff to Defendants \n \n11. Through his position with Plaintiff, Ryan gained extensive and detailed \nknowledge about all aspects of Plaintiff’s Asia operations and about the capabilities \nof Plaintiff’s vendors.  (Id. at ¶ 44.)  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants leveraged this \nknowledge to form GFY Defendants to compete with and usurp business \nopportunities from Plaintiff.  (Id. at ¶¶ 125–132.) \n12. On or about May 4, 2009, Timothy, Steven, Ryan, and James founded \nGFY, a Chinese company, using Plaintiff’s offices, employees, capital, and other \nassets.  (Id. at ¶ 48.)  Ryan stated that GFY was founded to “manage the sourcing, \nquality and servicing of [cut-and-sew] products.”  (Id. at ¶ 50.)  Steven stated that the \ncreation of GFY was facilitated by “experiences [Ryan] gained in China” and that \nGFY was created for the purpose of having one company “manage cut -and sew \nfacilities, operations, logistics, quality control, and product in -flow and out [-]flow.”  \n(Id.)    \n13. GFY “went into direct competition” with Plaintiff.  ( Id. at ¶ 51.)  GFY \npurchased fabric from Plaintiff, which GFY would then send to third -party cut-and-\nsew vendors in China to make products for Plaintiff’s customers.  ( Id. at ¶ 65.)  \nPlaintiff alleges that “[t]here was no reason that [Plaintiff] could not have directly \nsourced its fabrics to the third-party cut and sew operators, as it had done for many \nyears.”  ( Id.)  Timothy, Steven, Ryan  and James did not di sclose the creation of, or \ntheir ownership interests in, GFY to Tack.  (Id. at ¶ 68.)  \n14. In August of 2013, Timothy, Steven, Ryan, and James created Dolven.  \n(Id. at ¶ 77.)  Dolven “is engaged in sourcing fabrics, cutting and sewing of fabrics, \nand providing other services in the bedding and fabric indust ries.”  ( Id. at ¶ 3.)  \nDolven owns, manages, and controls GFY.  (Id. at ¶ 9.)  Plaintiff alleges that Dolven \nwas created using Plaintiff’s resources to divert business from Plaintiff to Dolven.  \n(Id. at ¶ 77.)   \n15. Plaintiff further alleges that Timothy, Steven, Ryan, and James created \nGFY LCV, GFY SH , and GFY Coop in early 2014 to facilitate the diversion of \ncorporate opportunities by Dolven away from GTA.  (Id. at ¶ 82.) \n16. Plaintiff alleges that “[a] ll of the busines s conducted by Dolven and \n[GFY Defendants] was business which [Plaintiff] was able, willing and qualified to \nconduct and would have conducted had Defendants not diverted the opportunities to \ndo so to themselves.”  (Id.) \n17. Plaintiff alleges  Timothy, Steven, Ryan, and Garrett used their \nemployment with Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s resources to benefit the business interests \nof Dolven and the GFY Defendants without disclosing to Plaintiff their ownership \ninterests in Dolven or the GFY Defendants.  (Id. at ¶¶ 84–92.)  For instance, Plaintiff \nalleges that Timothy, Steven, Ryan, and Garett gave preferential  pricing and  \ntreatment to Dolven and the GFY Defendants in transactions with Plaintiff , and \nusurped opportunities belonging to Plaintiff and gave them to Dolven and the GFY \nDefendants.  (Id. at ¶¶ 85–99.)  As a result of this alleged misconduct, Plaintiff claims \nit has suffered damage to its relationships with its customers and suppliers and has \nlost business opportunities, which rightfully belonged to it.  (Id. at ¶¶ 98, 103.)  \nD. Relevant Procedural History \n18. On April 11, 2018, Plaintiff filed the SAC.  In the SAC, Plaintiff makes \nthe following claims against Dolven Defendants: actual and constructive fraud (Third \nClaim for Relief); common law unfair competition/business conversion  (Sixth Claim \nfor Relief); unfair or  deceptive trade practices in violation of the North Carolina \nUnfair Trade Practice s Act, N. C. Gen. Stat.  § 75-1.1 (“UDTPA”) (hereinafter, the \nNorth Carolina General Stat utes will be referred to as “G.S.”) (Seventh Claim for \nRelief); constructive trust (Tenth Claim for Relief);  fraudulent transfer under G.S. \n§ 39-23.1, et seq.  (Eleventh Claim for Relief);  and a motion for preliminary and \npermanent injunction (Twelfth Claim  for Relief).  Plaintiff also brings the following \nclaims against Ryan, only: conspiracy (Fourth Claim for Relief); breach of fiduciary \nand other duties (Eighth Claim for Relief); and disgorgement of compensation during \nperiods of faithlessness (Ninth Claim for Relief). \n19. On May 14, 2018, the Dolven Defendants filed the Dolven Defendants’ \nMotion and a brief in support of the Motion . (Br. Supp. Dolven Defs. Mot, ECF No. \n290.)  Plaintiff filed its brief in opposition to the Dolven Defendants’ Motion on June \n5, 2018.  (ECF No. 315.)  The Dolven Defendants filed their rep ly brief on June 18, \n2018.  (ECF No. 325.)  The Court held a hearing on the Dolven Defendants’ Motion, \nand it is now ripe for resolution.   \nII. ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review \n20. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the [C]omplaint, treated as \ntrue, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some \nlegal theory, whether properly labeled or not.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 85 N.C. \nApp. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987).  North Carolina is a notice pleading state.  \nSee, e.g., Feltman v. City of Wilson, 238 N.C. App. 246, 252, 767 S.E.2d 615, 620 (2014) \n(quoting Wake Cty. v. Hotels.com, L.P. , 235 N.C. App. 633, 646, 762 S.E.2d 477, 486 \n(2014)).  “Under notice pleading, a statement of claim is adequate if it gives sufficient \nnotice of the claim asserted to enable the adverse party to answer and prepare for \ntrial, to allow for the application of the doctrine of res judicata, and to show the type \nof case brought.”  Id. \n21. Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when t he \ncomplaint reveals on its face the absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; [or] \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985).  In deciding \na motion to dismiss, the Court must construe the Complaint liberally and accept all \nwell-pleaded allegations as true.  Laster v. Francis , 199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 \nS.E.2d 858, 862 (2009).  The Court, however, is not required “to accept as tru e \nallegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 2 74, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005) (citations and quotations \nomitted). \nB. The SAC Alleges Facts Sufficient to G ive Rise to an Agency R elationship \nbetween Ryan and Dolven and Ryan and GFY Coop \n \n22. Although the parties have not argued the issue, the Court believes it is \nnecessary at the outset of its analysis to discuss the potential ba sis for liability with \nrespect to Plaintiff’s claims against Dolven and GFY Coop.  While Plaintiff does not \nexpressly allege in the SAC that Ryan or the other individual Defendants were acting \nas “agents” of Dolven or GFY Coop, Plaintiff appears to contend that Dolven and GFY \nCoop are vicariously liable for actions of Ryan, and other individual Defendants, \nbecause they were acting as agents for Dolven or the GFY Defendants.  For example, \nPlaintiff argues that “[a]ll of Ryan’s fraudulent conduct was for and on behalf of \n[Dolven and GFY Coop], and renders [them] liable for the fraud,” and cites case law \ninvolving agency law in support. (ECF No. 315, at p. 220 n. 7.)   \n23. On the other hand, Plaintiff does not allege or argue that Dolven or GFY \nCoop participated in alleged fraudulent conduct by acting through their boards of \ndirectors, or otherwise engaging in corporate acts, or that they had corporate policies \nthat caused or contributed to the wrongful conduct.  See, e.g., Everhart v. O’Charley’s, \nInc., 200 N.C. App. 142, 153, 683 S.E.2d 728, 737 (2009) (stating that the direct \nliability of a corporation may be based on “the corp oration’s acts or policies ”); \nDraughon v. Harnett County Bd. of Educ., 166 N.C. App. 464, 468–70, 602 S.E.2d 721, \n725–26 (2004) (finding that the plaintiff’s complaint failed to allege a basis for direct \nliability against defendant Harnett County Board of Education where the complaint \ndid not allege any specific wrongful conduct of the Board, and only alleged wrongful \nconduct by individual board members); Patel v. Sunvest Realty Corp. , 2018 Del. \nSuper. LEXIS 441, *20-21 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 15, 2018) (holding that while plaintiff \nalleged a basis for vicarious liability of the corporate defendants, he failed to state a \ndirect claim for fraud against corporate defendants where the plaintiff did not allege \nthe corporate defendants “committed fraud through any conduct” other than through \ntheir agents’ conduct).     \n24. Nevertheless, in the corporate context, directors, officers, and employees \nwho transact business on behalf of the corporate principal are considered agents of \nthe corporation.  See Tillery Envtl. LLC v. A&D Holdings, Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS \n13, at *42–43 (N.C. Super Ct. Feb. 9, 2018) (“It is . . . axiomatic that a corporation, \nhaving no body, voice, or other means of interacting with the corporeal world, must \nrely on agents . . . to transact its business –typically directors, officers, and \nemployees.” (citing Braswell v. United States , 487 U.S. 99, 110 (1988))).  Critically, \ncorporate defendants can be held vicariously liable “for the torts of [their] agent which \nare committed within the scope of the agent’s [actual or apparent] authority[.]”  \nPhillips v. Rest. Mgmt. of Carolina, L.P., 146 N.C. App. 203, 216, 552 S.E.2d 686, 695 \n(2001); Norburn v. Mackie , 262 N.C. 16, 23, 136 S.E.2d 279, 284 –85 (1964) (“[A] \nprincipal is responsible to third parties for injuries resulting from the fraud of his \nagent committed during the existence of the agency and within the scope of the \nagent’s actual or apparent authority from the principal . . . .”). \n25. Here, based on the allegations in the SAC,  the Court concludes that \nPlaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Ryan  was an agent of Dolven and GFY Coop .  \nThe SAC alleges that Ryan is the President and CEO  of Dolven.  (ECF No. 261, at \n¶ 7.)  The SAC also alleges GFY Coop is owned 99% by Dolven, controlled and \nmanaged by Dolven, that Ryan was a founder of GFY Coop, and that Ryan conducted \nbusiness on behalf of Dolven and GFY Coop.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 82, 84, 95.)  With respect to \nthe business Ryan conducted for Dolven and GFY Coop , the SAC states that Ryan , \n“while employed by [Plaintiff] as the head manager of Plaintiff’s China o perations, \nwas contemporaneously working on and for his own interests and the interests of \n[Dolven and GFY Coop] in arranging for and conducting business for and through \n[Dolven and GFY Coop].”  ( Id. at ¶ 95.)  The SAC also indicates that Ryan used his \nposition with Plaintiff “to cultivate relationships with customers, vendors, and \nsuppliers . . . for Dolven [and GFY Coop].”  (Id. at ¶ 84.) \n26. Based on the above , there can be no question that Ryan, as President \nand CEO, is an agent of Dolven.  See Zimmerman v. Hogg & Allen, Prof’l Assoc., 286 \nN.C. at 32, 209 S.E.2d at 800 (1974).  Further, the Court finds the SAC’s allegations—\nthat GFY Coop is managed and controlled by Dolven and that Ryan engaged in \ncorporate transactions on GFY Coop’s behalf —sufficient to state an agency \nrelationship between Ryan and GFY Coop.  The Court need not, and does not, address \nat this time whether Ryan or any other individual Defendants’ actions would give rise \nto “direct” liability by Dolven or GFY Coop. \n27. Therefore, for purposes of  this Motion, the Court will treat Ryan as an \nagent of Dolven and GFY Coop.   And, because Plaintiff relies on vicarious liability , \nthe Court will focus its analysis primarily on  Plaintiff’s claims against Ryan.  If \nPlaintiff’s claims against Ryan survive dismissal and the SAC supports a finding that \nRyan was acting as an agent of Dolven and GFY Coop  when he committed the \nunderlying acts, than Plaintiff’s claims against GFY Coop and Dolven also survive.  \nC.  Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud \n28. Plaintiff brings a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Ryan, (ECF \nNo. 261, at ¶¶ 156–60), and claims for constructive fraud against Ryan, Dolven and \nGFY Coop.  (Id. at ¶¶ 125–32.)  The Dolven Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s claims \nfor breach of fiduciary duty  and constructive fraud must fail  because Ryan’s \nemployment with Plaintiff did not give rise to a fiduciary relationship and because  \nhis employment was with GTA Asia, a separate legal entity from Plaintiff, and cannot \nform the basis of a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff.  (ECF No. 290, at pp. 11–13.)  \nThe Dolven Defendants also argue that the constructive fraud claims against Dolven \nand GFY Coop fail because Plaintiff has not alleged facts supporting the existence of \na fiduciary relationship between itself and Dolven or GFY Coop.  (Id. at pp. 17–19.) \n29. Preliminarily, the Court is unpersuaded by the Dolven Defendants’ \nargument that Ryan was employed by GTA Asia and therefore couldn’t owe a \nfiduciary duty to Plaintiff.  The Dolven Defendants contend only that there are \nseveral allegations in the SAC that suggest Ryan was employed by GTA Asia.  (Id. at \np. 12.)  However, the SAC also alleges that Ryan was “e mployed by [Plaintiff] as the \nlegal representative and head operating manager of [Plaintiff]’s operations in China.”  \n(ECF No. 261, at ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff alleges that Ryan has admitted in a sworn affidavit \nthat his job was ‘‘ was also to ‘ [o]versee all aspects of [Plaintiff’s] business with [sic] \nthe Asia corridor.’”  (Id. at ¶ 35.)  The Court concludes that the allegations in the SAC \ndo not conclusively establish that Ryan was employed solely by GTA Asia and that \nhe could not owe a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff. \n30.  To establish a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must show: \n“(1) the existence of a fiduciary relationship; (2) a breach of that duty; and (3) the \nbreach proximately caused plaintiff’s injury.”  BDM Invs. v. Lenhil, Inc., 2014 NCBC \nLEXIS 6, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 20, 2014).  In contrast, t o plead a claim for \nconstructive fraud, a plaintiff must allege a breach of a fiduciary duty and allege that \nthe defendant benefited himself as a result of the breach.  White v. Consol. Planning, \nInc., 166 N.C. App. 283, 294, 603 S.E.2d  147, 156 (2004) (“The primary difference  \nbetween pleading a claim for constructive fraud and one for breach of fiduciary duty \nis the constructive fraud requirement that the defendant benefit himself.”); Crumley \n& Assocs., P.C. v. Charles Peed & Assocs., P.A. , 219 N.C. App. 615, 620 , 730 S.E.2d \n763, 767  (2012) (“To establish constructive fraud, a plaintiff must show that \ndefendant (1) owes plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) breached this fiduciary duty; and (3) \nsought to benefit himself in the transaction.” ).  Additionally, a claim of constructive \nfraud must be pled with particularity.  Terry v. Terry , 302 N.C. 77, 85, 273 S.E.2d \n674, 679 (1981) .  The particularity requirement  is satisfied by “alleging facts and \ncircumstances (1) which created the relation of trust and confidence, and (2) [which] \nled up to and surrounded the consummation of the transaction in which defendant is \nalleged to have taken advantage of his position of trust to the hurt of plaintiff.”  Id. \n(citation and quotation marks omitted).  \n31. Because both claims require the existence of a fiduciary relationship, the \nCourt begins its analysis there.  A fiduciary relationship arises when “there has been \na special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act \nin good faith and with due regard to the interests of t he one reposing confidence[.]”  \nDalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651–52, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001) (quoting Abbitt v. \nGregory, 201 N.C. 577, 598, 160 S.E. 896, 906 (1931)) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Such a relationship “extends to any possible case in which a fiduciary \nrelationship exists in fact, and in which there is confidence reposed in one side, and \nresulting domination and influence on the other .”  Id. at 652, 548 S.E. 2d at 707–08 \n(quoting Abbitt, 201 N.C. at 598, 160 S.E. at 906).   \n32. In the employment context, the mere existence of an employer-employee \nrelationship is insufficient to give rise to a fiduciary duty.  See Id. at 652, 548 S.E.2d \nat 708 (quoting King v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., 157 N.C. 44, 62–63, 72 S.E. 801, 808 \n(1911)) (“Under the general rule, ‘the relation of employer and employee is not one of \nthose regarded as confidential.’”) .  In fact, “where an employee is neither an officer \nnor a director, extraordinary circumstances are necessary to impose a fiduciary duty \narising out of the employment relationship.”  Southeast Air Charter, Inc. v. Stroud , \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 82, at *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 17, 2015) (citing Dalton, 353 N.C. \nat 652, 548 S.E.2d at 708 ).  These “extraordinary circumstances” occur when an \nemployer is “subjugated to the improper influences or domination of his employee.”  \nDalton, 353 N.C. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at 708; see also DSM Dyneema, LLC v. Thagard, \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 50, at *21 –22 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 12, 2015) (holding that the \nplaintiff failed to allege “the extraordinary or special type of employer -employee \nrelationship that gives rise to a fiduciary  duty” because the facts pleaded did not \n“allege that Thagard enjoyed the sort of domin ation or influence over DSM that our \ncourts have found necessary to create a fiduciary duty”).   For example, the special \ncircumstance of a fiduciary relationship can arise “‘when [the employee] figuratively \nholds all the cards —all the  financial power or te chnical information .’” Crumley & \nAssocs., P.C. v. Charles Peed & Assocs., P.A., 219 N.C. App. 615, 621, 730 S.E.2d 763, \n767 (2012) (quoting Broussard v. Meineke Disc. Muffler Shops, 155 F.3d 331, 348 (4th \nCir. 1998)).  \n33. The Court first concludes that Plaintiff pleads facts that support the \nallegation that Ryan had  a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff.  North Carolina \nrecognizes that a fiduciary duty can arise via an agency relationship where an \nemployee is “appointed by his [employer] primarily to bring about business relations \nbetween the [employer] and third persons.”  Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter, 129 N.C. App. \n464, 470, 500 S.E.2d 732, 736 (1998) (citation and quotations omitted) , rev’d in part \non other grounds , 351 N.C. 27, 519 S.E.2d 308 (1999).   Where such a relationship \nexists, “the agent or employee is bound to the exercise of utmost good faith, loyalty, \nand honesty toward his principal or employer.”  Id.  If the agent acts unfaithfully by, \nfor example, engaging in undisclosed self -dealing with his employer, a breach of \nfiduciary duty can result.  Id. at 470–71, 500 S.E.2d 736–37; see also Estate of Graham \nv. Morrison, 168 N.C. App. 63, 68–69, 607 S.E.2d 395, 299–300 (2005) (discussing the \nduties an agent owes to its principal and noting that the agent is prohibited from \nengaging in self -dealing).  Plaintiff alleges that it sent Ryan to China to find and \nnurture relationships with third-parties to supply Plaintiff with fabric and cut -and-\nsew services.  Plaintiff further alleges that Ryan then used the knowledge he gained \nthrough establishing these relationships to create competing companies and usurp \nand divert Plaintiff’s opportunities to himself. \n34. In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Ryan oversaw all of Plaintiff’s business \nwithin the A sia market and had vast control over Plaintiff’s Asia operation.   (ECF \nNo. 261 at ¶¶ 34 –35.)  Ryan was entrusted by Plaintiff to carry out its so urcing in \nChina through GTA Asia.  Ryan identified appropriate Chinese vendors with which \nto do business , managed the quality of fabric sourced to Plaintiff, and managed \nlogistics and customer service for Plaintiff.  ( Id. at ¶ 34.)  Through his work for \nPlaintiff, Ryan acquired detailed information about “the particular [Chinese] mills \nand cut and sew operations which had certain capabilities to do particular things \ncorrectly, reliably and consistently.”  (Id. at ¶ 44.)  Ryan also controlled GTA Asia’s \n“cash and capital”, entered binding contracts on behalf of GTA Asia, set the pricing \nand payment terms for goods purchased and to and from Plaintiff and GTA Asia, and \nrepresented the legal interests of GTA Asia.  ( Id. at ¶¶ 35–37.)  Ryan reported only \nto Timothy in carrying out these duties.  Even after leaving his role as director of \nGTA Asia, Ryan continued to provide oversight to GTA Asia’s operati ons.  ( Id. at \n¶ 38.)  The allegations support a claim that Plaintiff vested Ryan with significant \nauthority and that Ryan gained unique knowledge of, and had control over, technical \nand financial information on which Plaintiff became depe ndent.  See Lazenby v. \nGodwin, 40 N.C. App. 487, 494–95, 253 S.E.2d 489, 493 (1979) (concluding that the \nplaintiffs, who were co-directors of a corporation with defendant, presented sufficient \nevidence of a fiduciary relationship because defendant was the primary manager of \nthe corporation and the plaintiffs placed their trust in defendant’s business skill and \njudgment);  Austin v. Regal Inv. Advisors, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 3, at * 20–21 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Jan. 8, 2018)  (concluding that the plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claim \nsurvived a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss where the plaintiffs alleged that they gr anted \nthe defendants significant discretion to manage their investments and relied on \nthe  financial expertise of defendants). These allegations can be read to support the \ntheory that Ryan’s control over Plaintiff’s Asia operations might have given rise to an \nexceptional circumstance where Plaintiff was “subjugated to the improper influences \nor domination of [Ryan].”  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at 708.1 \n35. Plaintiff also sufficiently alleges the remaining elements of a claim for \nbreach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud.  Plaintiff alleges the facts and \ncircumstances that created the relationship of trust and confidence between Plaintiff \nand Ryan and which led up to and surrounded Ryan t aking advantage of Plaintiff.  \nTerry, 302 N.C. at 85, 273 S.E.2d at 679.  For example, Plaintiff alleges that Plaintiff \ntrusted Ryan to manage Plaintiff’s Asia operations and that, while employed by \nPlaintiff, Ryan created entities that compete with Plaintiff.  (Id. at ¶¶ 7, 34–38, 47–\n62, 77–84.)  Plaintiff alleges Ryan abused his fiduciary duty by usurping corporate \nopportunities from Plaintiff and taking them for the benef it of himself, Dolven, and \nthe GFY Defendants.  (Id. at ¶ 95–99.)  Plaintiff further alleges that Ryan failed to \ndisclose his interests in Dolven and the GFY Defendants and gave special deals to \nDolven and the GFY Defendants in transactions with Plaintiff,  to the detriment of \nPlaintiff.  (Id. at ¶ 85–99.)  Based on these allegations, Plaintiff’s SAC states a cause \nof action for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud against Ryan.   \n                                                 \n1 In Global Textile Alliance, Inc. v. TDI Worldwide, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 104 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Oct. 9, 2018), the Court found that Garrett, who succeeded Ryan as Director of GTA Asia, \ndid not have a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff.  Id. at *15–16. The Court finds that the \nallegations in the SAC regarding Ryan’s knowledge of GTA Asia’s operations, and his \nauthority and independence, establish that Ryan had a much broader role and more authority \nover Plaintiff’s Asia operation than his successor Garrett.  \n36. Therefore, Dolven Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’ s claims for \nbreach of fiduciary  duty and constructive fraud  against Ryan should be DENIED.  \nAdditionally, because Ryan’s alleged fraudulent conduct was taken to further the \nbusiness of Dolven and GFY Coop, and benefitted them, the Court concludes Plaintiff \nhas sufficiently alleged that Ryan’s alleged fraud was made within the scope o f his \nagency relationship with Dolven and GFY Coop .  Thus, the Dolven Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the constructive fraud claims against Dolven and GFY Coop should \nbe DENIED to the extent Plaintiff’s seek to hold them vicariously liable. \nD. Actual Fraud \n37. Plaintiff alleges claims of actual fraud against Ryan, Dolven, and GFY \nCoop.  (Id. at ¶¶ 125–132.)  The Dolven Defendants argue that Plaintiff failed to plead \nits fraud claim with the requisite particularity  because Plaintiff did not allege the \n“time, place, or s ubstance of any purported misrepresentation or concealment by \nDefendants, or make any specific allegation as to what Defendants gained.”   (ECF \nNo. 290, at pp. 17 –18.)  Plaintiff argues that its pleadings satisfy the particularity \nrequirements and are sufficient to survive dismissal.   \n38. To state a claim for actual fraud a plaintiff must plead the following \nelements: “(1) [f]alse representation or concealment of a material fact, (2) reasonably \ncalculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, \n(5) resulting in damage to the injured party. ”  Terry, 302 N.C. at 83, 273 S.E.2d at \n677 (citations and quotations omitted).  If a claim of fraud is based on concealment of \na material fact, the plaintiff must also allege that the party committing the fraud had \na duty to speak.  Griffin v. Wheeler-Leonard & Co., 290 N.C. 185, 198, 225 S.E.2d 557, \n565 (1976); Lawrence v. UMLIC-Five Corp., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *8 (N.C. Super. \nCt. June 18, 2007).  A duty to speak and disclose a material fact arises where  \n(1) a fiduciary relationship exists between the parties to \nthe transaction; (2) there is no fiduciary duty and one party \nhas taken affirmative steps t o conceal material facts from \nthe other; and (3) there is no fiduciary relationship and one \nparty has knowledge of a latent defect in the subject matter \nof the negotiations about which the other party is both \nignorant and unable to discover through reasona ble \ndiligence. \n \nHardin v. KCS Int’l, Inc., 199 N.C. App. 687, 696, 682 S.E.2d 726, 733 (2009) (internal \ncitations and quotations omitted). \n39. Additionally, claims for fraud must be pled with particularity.  Terry, \n302 N.C. at 84, 273 S.E.2d  at 678.  In the case of claims based on fraudulent \nconcealment, the particularity requirement is satisfied if a plaintiff alleges  \n(1) the relationship [between plaintiff and defendant] \ngiving rise to the duty to speak; (2) the event or \nevents  triggering the duty to speak and/or the general \ntime period over which the relationship arose and the \nfraudulent conduct occurred; (3) the general content of the \ninformation that was withheld and the reason for its \nmateriality; (4) the identity of those under a duty who \nfailed to make such disclosures; (5) what [the defendant] \ngained by withholding information; (6) why plaintiff's \nreliance on the omission was both reasonable and \ndetrimental; and (7) the damages proximately flowing from \nsuch reliance. \n \nMcKee v. James, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 33, at * 22 –23 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 24, 2013)  \n(quoting Lawrence v. UMLIC-Five Corp., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *9 (N.C. Super. \nCt. June 18, 2007).    \n40.   The Court concludes that Plaintiff’s allegations meet the particularity \nrequirements for f raudulent concealment and sufficiently allege a claim of  actual \nfraud against Ryan.  The Court has concluded that Plaintiff has alleged a fiduciary \nrelationship between Ryan and Plaintiff, which Plaintiff conte nds placed on Ryan a \nduty to speak.  Plaintiff alleges that the fraudulent concealment of these facts by \nRyan allowed Ryan and other employees of Plaintiff to give preferential treatment to \nentities they owned or operated in transactions with Plaintiff, and that Ryan, Dolven, \nand GFY Coop gained “tens of millions of dollars of revenues” from conflict of interest \ntransactions, which revenues should have inured to the benefit of  Plaintiff.  (Id. at \n¶¶ 63–71, 85–99, 132.)  Plaintiff also has alleged “the general period over which the \nrelationship arose and the fraudulent conduct occurred.”  McKee, 2013 NCBC LEXIS \n33 at *22–23.  These allegations meet the particularity requirements of McKee and \nare sufficient to state a claim for actual fraud against Ryan.  See Id. \n41.   Therefore, the Dolven Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim \nfor actual fraud should be DENIED.  Additionally, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that \nRyan’s fraudulent conduct  was in furtherance of  the business of Dolven and GFY \nCoop and as their agent.  Therefore, the Dolven Defendan ts’ motion to dismiss \nPlaintiff’s claim for actual fraud should also be DENIED.   \nE. Civil Conspiracy \n42.  Plaintiff brings a claim of civil conspiracy against Ryan and alleges that \nRyan committed civil conspiracy by “agree[ing] to cooperate and act” with the other \nindividual Defendants “to carry out the sc heme to divert business from [Plaintiff] .”  \n(ECF No. 261, at ¶ 134.)  Ryan argues that Plaintiff’s allegation of conspiracy fails to \nstate a claim because Plaintiff’s conclusory allegations do not allege when, where, or \nhow Ryan conspired against Plaintiff.  (ECF No. 290, at pp. 20–21.) \n43. In North Carolina, civil conspiracy is not an independent cause of action.  \nRather, liability for civil conspiracy must be alleged in conjunction with an underlying \nclaim for unlawful conduct.  Toomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. App. 462, 483, 574 S.E.2d \n76, 92 (2002).  To state a claim for civil conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege: “(1) an \nagreement between two or more individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful \nact in an unlawful way; (3) resulting in injury to plaintiff inflicted by one or more of \nthe conspirators; and (4) pursuant to a common scheme.”  Piraino Bros., LLC v. \nAtlantic Fin. Grp., Inc., 211 N.C. App. 343, 350, 712 S.E.2d 328, 333 (2011) (citations \nand quotations omitted).   \n44. Plaintiff has pleaded sufficient facts to support a claim that Ryan and \nthe other individual Defendants agreed to create Dolven and the GFY Defendants for \nthe unlawful purpose of diverting business and corporate opportunities from Plaintiff \nto themselves.  The allegation places the Dolven Defendants on notice as to who was \ninvolved in the conspiracy, when the conspiracy occurred, and the purpose of the \nconspiracy.  Furthermore, the Court already has decided that Plaintiff’s tort claims \nfor actual and constructive fraud survive dismissal. See Am. Air Filter Co. v. Price , \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 55, at *32 (N.C. Super. Ct.  June 26, 2017) (concluding that \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss a conspiracy claim should be denied where plaintiff’s \ntort claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair trade practices survived \ndismissal and plaintiff sufficiently alleged the existence of a conspiracy).  Therefore , \nthe Dolven Defenda nts’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s conspiracy claim should be \nDENIED.   \nF. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices  \n45. Plaintiff claims that all Defendants committed unfair or deceptive trade \npractices in violation of the UDTPA.  (ECF No. 261, at ¶¶ 150–55.)  Plaintiff does not \nspecifically state what actions by Defendants constitute unfair or deceptive trade \npractices, but pleads that “Defendants’ acts and omissions as alleged [in the SAC] \nconstitute unfair [or] deceptive trade acts or practices. ”  (Id. at ¶ 152.)  The Dolven \nDefendants argue  that Plaintiff fails to state a claim for v iolation of the UDTPA \nbecause the allegations are conclusory in nature and fail  to allege the Dolven \nDefendants’ actions were in or affecting commerce in North Carolina.  (ECF No. 290, \nat p. 9.) \n46. To allege a violation of the UDTPA, a plaintiff must allege that “(1) \ndefendant committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) the action in question \nwas in or affecting commerce, and (3) the act proximately caused injury to the \nplaintiff.”  Dalton, 353 N.C. at 656, 548 S.E.2d at 711.  An act or practice is considered \nunfair when it is offensive to public policy or when it is “immoral, unethical, \noppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers.”  Walker v. \nFleetwood Homes of N.C., Inc., 362 N.C. 63, 72, 653 S.E.2d 393, 399 (2007) (citations \nand quotations omitted).  An act or practice is considered deceptive if it has the \ncapacity or tendency to deceive.  Id.  Additionally, where a defendant engages in self-\ndealing with his North Carolina employer and companies owned by defendant, those \ntransactions are in or affecting commerce.  Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter, 351 N.C. 27, 32–\n33, 519 S.E.2d 308, 311–12 (1999). \n47. As discussed herein, the SAC contains extensive allegations detailing \nRyan’s unfair and deceptive conduct towards Plaintiff, including breaches of fiduciary \nduties and fraud arising from withholding material information from Plaintiff \nregarding Dolven and the GFY Defendants.  Plaintiffs also allege that Ryan took \nactions from and in North Carolina, as the agent for and on behalf of Dolven and GFY \nCoop, which were in commerce , and injured Plaintiff.  Therefore, the Dolven \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices \nshould be DENIED. \nG. Common Law Unfair Competition/Business Conversion \n48. Plaintiff also claims that the Dolven Defendants engaged in common law \nunfair competition and business conversion.  (ECF No. 261, at ¶¶ 144 –49.)  Plaintiff \nalleges that the Dolven Defendants engaged in unfair and  unethical conduct  \n“designed to handicap [Plaintiff]” and “ to misappropriate [Plaintiff] ’s commercial \ncompetitive advantage obtained through years of time, money and labor. ”  ( Id. at \n¶ 145.)  Plaintiff  further claims the Dolven Defendants “converted [Plaintiff]’s \nbusiness and Trade Secrets.”  (Id. at ¶ 144.)  Ryan argues that Plaintiff has failed to \nstate a claim because  (1) claims for business conversion and conversion of trade \nsecrets do not apply to intangible interests such as business opportuniti es and \nexpectancy interests ; and (2) Plaintiff fails to support its allegation that Ryan \ncompeted with Plaintiff.  (ECF No. 290, at pp. 6–7.)  \n49. A claim for unfair competition seeks to protect “a business from \nmisappropriation of its commercial advantage earned through organization, skill, \nlabor, and money.”  Henderson v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 346 N.C. 741, 749, 488 S.E.2d \n234, 240 (1997).  Conver sion is the “ unauthorized assumption and exercise of the \nright of ownership over  the goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the \nalteration of their condition or the exclusion of an owner’s rights.”  White, 166 N.C. \nApp. at 309, 603 S.E.2d at 1 65 (citations and quotations omitted).  With respect to \nintangible property, such as electronic information, a claim of conversion requires \nthat the plaintiff be deprived of the information on which it bases its claim.   See \nRoundPoint Mortg. Co. v. Florez, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *55 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. \n18, 2016) (dismissing plaintiff’s conversion claim where plaintiff failed to show that \nit“ ha[d] been deprived of possession or use of the information on which it base[d] its \nconversion claim”)   \n50.  Plaintiff’s claims for common law unfair competition and business \nconversion are each based on allegations that the D efendants diverted Plaintiff’s \nbusiness to, and used Plaintiff’s trade secrets for the benefit of, Dolven and the GFY \nDefendants.  Accordingly, the Court construes Plaintiff’s claims for common law \nunfair competition and business conversion as a single claim.  See Superior \nPerformers, Inc. v. Meaike , No. 1:13CV1149, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158862, at *26 \n(M.D.N.C. Nov. 10, 2014) (“The allegations of wro ngdoing, however, as to both \nPlaintiff’s claim for unfair competition and business conversion are the same.  \nTherefore, the court will address the torts for unfair competition and business \nconversion together.”). \n51. Courts recognize that a claim for common la w unfair competition is \nanalyzed the same way as a claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices under G.S. \n§ 75-1.1.  See BellSouth Corp. v. White Directory Publishers, Inc., 42 F. Supp. 2d 598, \n615 (M.D.N.C. 1999) (“The standard which a plaintiff must me et to recover on an \nunfair competition claim under the common law is not appreciably different [from a \nclaim for unfair or deceptive trade practices].”); Blue Rhino Global Sourcing, Inc. v. \nWell Traveled Imports, Inc. , 888 F. Supp. 2d 718, 721 n.1 (M.D.N.C. 2012); Global \nTextile All., Inc., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 57, at *20–21. \n52. The Court has determined that the claim for unfair or deceptive trade \npractices against the Dolven Defendants survives dismissal to the extent it  is based \non Ryan’s alleged fraud, and concluded that the alleged fraud was in furtherance of \nthe diversion of business and opportunities from Plaintiff to Dolven and GFY  Coop.  \nTherefore, to the extent Plaintiff’s claim for unfair competition is based on Ryan’s \nalleged fraudulent conduct, the allegations support the claim for unfair competition \nand business conversion and the claim is not subject to dismissal by the Dolven \nDefendants at this stage.   \n53. To the extent Plaintiff claims that the Dolven Defendants converted \nPlaintiff’s trade secrets, however, Plaintiff has failed to allege a claim for conversion.  \nPlaintiff based its trade secret conversion claim on intangible information, but fails \nto allege that it has been deprived of the use or access of its trade secret information.  \nSee RoundPoint Mortg. Co., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *55.   \n54. In conclusion, t o the extent the Dolven Defendants seek  dismissal of \nPlaintiff’s claims for common law unfair competition and busi ness conversion based \non the Dolven Defenda nts’ alleged diversion of Plaintiff’s business , it should be \nDENIED.  But, to the extent the Motion seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims for \ncommon law unfair competition and busi ness conversion based on the Dolven \nDefendants’ alleged conversion of Plaintiff’s trade secrets, it should be GRANTED. \nH. Fraudulent Transfer \n55.  Plaintiff also brings a claim of fraudulent transfer under  the Uniform \nVoidable Transactions Act (“UVTA”),  G.S. § 39 -23.1, et seq. , against the Dolven \nDefendants.  Plaintiff alleges that it is a creditor of Ryan, Dolven, and GFY Coop \nbecause it has claims against them in this lawsuit.  (ECF No. 261, at ¶ 168.)  \nAccording to Plaintiff, “in an attempt to defraud, hinder, and delay Plaintiff . . . from \nhaving a full an d lawful recovery” from Defendants,  Timothy, Steven , and James \nagreed upon terms for the sale of their shares in Dolven to Ryan.  (ECF No. 261, at \n¶¶ 168–69.)  Plaintiff admits that Defendants have yet to complete the transaction, \nbut argues that the oblig ation to complete the transaction has been incurred  and is \neffective.  (Id. at ¶ 168.)  The Dolven Defendants argue the fraudulent transfer claim \nshould be dismissed because Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate  either that: (1) a \ntransfer has occurred; (2) the transfer would be by Defendants; (3) Defendants failed \nto obtain reasonable value; or (4) that Plaintiff is a creditor under the UVTA.  (ECF \nNo. 290, at p. 15.)   \n56. Under § 39 -23.4(a)(1) of the  UVTA, “ [a] transfer made or obligation \nincurred by a debtor is voidable as to a creditor . . . if the debtor made the transfer or \nincurred the obligation : (1)[w]ith intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of \nthe debtor[.]”  Among the factors courts may consider in determining intent under \n§ 39-23.4(a)(1), are whether: the obligation incurred was to an insider; the obligation \nwas disclosed or concealed; or before the obligation was incurred, the debtor had been \nsued or threatened with suit.  G.S. § 39-23.4(b).   \n57. The UVTA defines a creditor as “[a] person that has a claim[;]” a debtor \nas “[a] person that is liable on a claim[;]” and a claim as “a right to payment, whether \nor not the right is reduced to judgment, . . . contingent,  disputed, [or] legal.”  G.S. \n§ 39-23.1(3)–(4), (6).  Furthermore, the official comment to G.S. § 39-23.1 states that \n“the holder of an unliquidated tort claim or a contingent claim may be a creditor \nprotected by this act.”  G.S. § 39-23.1, cmt. 4 (2014). \n58.  Here, Plaintiff has stated that it is a creditor of Ryan , because it has \ncontingent claims against Ryan in this lawsuit;  that Ryan incurred an obligation to \npurchase Timothy’s, Steven ’s, and James’ shares in Dolven  after this suit was \ninitiated; and that such obligation was incurred to hinder  and delay Plaintiff from \nreceiving a full recovery in this lawsuit.  (ECF No. 261, at ¶¶ 168 –70.)  These \nallegations are sufficient to state a claim for fraudulent transfer against Ryan.  (ECF \nNo. 261, at ¶¶ 168 –70.)  The allegations, however, are insufficie nt with respect to \nDolven and GFY Coop , who were not parties to the alleged transfer/obligation and \nagainst whom Plaintiff has no remedy under the UVTA.  See G.S. § 39-23.7.2   \n59. First, Plaintiff is a creditor of Ryan by virtue of the claims it has brought \nagainst him in this action.  See G.S. § 39-23.1, cmt. 4 (2014).  Next, to the extent § 39-\n23.4(a)(1) requires a “transfer ,” the Court determined in an earlier motion in this \nmatter that an allegation that Defendants incurred an obligation  to transfer  is \nsufficient to ple ad that a “transfer” occurred.  Global Textile All., Inc. v. TDI \nWorldwide, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 57, at *28–29 (N.C. Super. Ct. June  5, 2018).  \nAdditionally, § 39-23.4(a)(1) does not require the plaintiff to prove that the defendant \nfailed to obtain reasonable value.  Whether or not the debtor received reasonable \nvalue for the obligation incurred is only a factor in determining whether the \nobligation was incurred with intent to hinder, delay, o r defraud the creditor.  G.S. \n§ 39-23.4(b).  Lastly, the allegations  clearly allege that the obligation to purchase \nshares of Dolven was incurred by Ryan. \n60.  Therefore, the Dolven Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s \nfraudulent transfer claims against Dolven and GFY Coop should be GRANTED, but \nthe Dolven Defendants’  motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s fraudulent transfer claim  \nagainst Ryan should be DENIED.   \n                                                 \n2 As the name suggests, relief under the Uniform Void able Transfer Act is available only \nwhen a debtor engages in a transaction or incurs an obligation that the Act recognizes as \nvoidable.  Neither Dolven nor GFY Coop were parties to the transaction/obligation as alleged \nby Plaintiff and relief against them is unavailable.  \nI. Constructive Trust \n61. Plaintiff alleges that it is entitled to the equitable remedy of a \nconstructive trust “with respect to all money and other pr operty received by” Ryan, \nDolven, GFY Coop and the other Defendants as a result of their “unlawful conduct.”  \n(ECF No. 261, at ¶  165.)  The Dolven Defendants argue  that Plaintiff’s claim for \nconstructive trust should be denied because (1) the underlying claims fail as a matter \nof law and (2) Plaintiff has failed to show that Dolven or GFY Coop owed a duty or \nhad a confidential relationship with Plaintiff. \n62. A “claim” for a constructive trust is an equitable remedy used to prevent \nunjust enrichment acquired th rough “fraud, breach of duty or some other \ncircumstance making it inequitable for [defendant] to retain [the property].”  Wilson \nv. Crab Orchard Dev. Co. , 276 N.C. 198, 21 1, 171 S.E.2d 873, 882 (1970).  A \nconstructive trust typically arises “out of the existence of fraud, actual or presumptive \n– usually involving the violation of a confidential or fiduciary relation – in view of \nwhich equity transfers the beneficial title to some person other than the holder of the \nlegal title.”  Leatherman v. Leatherman, 297 N.C. 618, 621–22, 256 S.E.2d 793, 795–\n96 (1979) (quoting Bowen v. Darden, 241 N.C. 11, 13–14, 84 S.E.2d 289, 292 (1954)).  \nA fiduciary relationship is not required, however, as a claim of constructive trust can \nbe based on other circumstances which make a defendant’s retention of the property \nat issue inequitable.  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs., LLC, \n365 N.C. 520, 530–31, 723 S.E.2d 744, 752 (2012).   \n63. The SAC sufficiently alleges the existence of a fiduciary relationship \nbetween Ryan and Plaintiff.  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that Ryan is a shareholder \nand has an ownership interest in Dolven and GFY Coop. (ECF No. 261, at ¶¶ 77, 82, \n168.)  Plaintiff also alleges that Ryan fraudulently concealed his interest in these \ncompanies and diverted business or corporate opportunities from Plaintiff to Dolven  \nand GFY Coop,  (Id. at ¶¶ 77–99), and that Ryan, Dolven, and GFY Coop benefitted \nas a result.  (Id. at ¶ 127.)  Based on these allegations, Plaintiff has alleged that Ryan, \nDolven, and GFY Coop  wrongfully obtained title to property belo nging to Plaintiff.  \nTherefore, Plaintiff has alleged a basis for imposing a constructive trust over Ryan, \nDolven, and GFY Coop , and Defendants’  motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for a \nconstructive trust against Ryan, Dolven, and GFY Coop should be DENIED. \nJ. Disgorgement of compensation \n64. Plaintiff asserts a claim titled “Disgorgement of Compensation During \nPeriods of Faithlessness” against Ryan.  (ECF No. 261, at ¶¶  161–63.)  Plaintiff \nalleges that Ryan was paid a “substantial salary and compensation” while he was \n“diverting business from [Plaintiff]  . . . and engaging in conflicts of interest \ntransactions.”  (Id. at ¶ 162.)  Plaintiff claims that, “[i]n equity and good conscience,” \nRyan should be compelled to disgorge the compensation and benefits he received \nduring the period in which he allegedly violated his duties owed to Plaintiff.  (Id. at \n¶ 163.) \n65. As with a constructive trust, a request for “disgorgement of \ncompensation” would be considered a remedy and not a cause of action.  See Sara Lee \nCorp. v. Carter , 129 N.C. App. 464, 472, 500 S.E.2d 732, 737 (1998)  (allowing an \nemployer to recover as damages compensation and benefits paid to an employee while \nthe employee was breaching his fiduciary duty).  The remedy is based on the principle \nthat an agent is not entitled to compensation when he breaches his fiduciary duty \nand is disloyal to his principal.  Id. \n66. The Court has already determined that Plaintiff suffici ently alleged a \nclaim of breach of fiduciary duty against Ryan, and that Ryan diverted business from \nPlaintiff and engaged in conflict of interest transactions with Plaintiff.  These \nallegations also support Plaintiff’s request for the remedy of disgorgement of \ncompensation.  Therefore, the Dolven Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim \nfor disgorgement of compensation should be DENIED. \nK. Motion for Permanent Injunction \n67. Plaintiff’s Twelfth Claim for Relief is styled as a “Motion for Preliminary \nand Permanent Injunction.”  (ECF No. 261, at ¶¶  172–73.)  The Court previously \ndenied Plaintiff’s motion for prelim inary injunction as to all D efendants.  Global \nTextile All., Inc. v. TDI Worldwide, LLC , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 108 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nNov. 21, 2017) .  The Dolven Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s claim for permanent \ninjunction should fail because the underlying claims fail and because equitable relief \nis inappropriate.  (ECF No. 290, at pp. 21–22.) \n68.   Since certain of Plaintiff’s claims against the Dolven Defendants  \nsurvive dismissal and  might provide a basis for  a permanent injunction , the Court \nwill not at this time dismiss the claim for a permanent injunction against them.  The \nDolven Defendants’  motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for permanent injunction  \nshould be DENIED. \nTherefore, it is ORDERED that: \n1. The Dolven Defendants’ motions to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against Ryan \nfor breach of fiduciary duty, actual fraud , constructive fraud, unfair or  \ndeceptive trade practices, civil conspiracy, fraudulent transfer, constructive \ntrust, disgorgement of compensation , and permanent injunction  are \nDENIED. \n2. The Dolven Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim against Ryan for \nunfair competition/business conversion is DENIED to the extent the motion \nseeks dismissal based on Ryan’s alleged f raudulent conduct, and \nGRANTED to the extent it seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s claim for common \nlaw unfair competition/business conversion based on Ryan’s alleged \nconversion of Plaintiff’s trade secrets. \n3. The Dolven Defendants’ motions to dismiss  Plaintiff’s claims against \nDolven and GFY Coop  for actual fraud, constructive fraud, unfair or \ndeceptive trade practices, constructive trust, and permanent injunction are \nDENIED. \n4. The Dolven Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim against Dolven \nand GFY Coop for unfair competition/business conversion is DENIED to the \nextent the motion seeks dismissal based on Ryan’s alleged fraudulent \nconduct, and GRANTED to the extent it seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s claim \nfor common law unfair competition/busines s conversion based on Ryan’s \nalleged conversion of Plaintiff’s trade secrets. \n5. The Dolven Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against Dolven \nand GFY Coop for fraudulent transfer is GRANTED.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 29th day of November, 2018. \n \n_/s/ Gregory P.
