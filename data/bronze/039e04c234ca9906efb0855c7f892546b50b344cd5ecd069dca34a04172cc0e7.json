Leiber, who \ngoes by “Dr. Hilmar Leiber,” is a practicing attorney.  Since passing the German bar \nexam in 1969, Leiber has provided investment and tax advice to his clients.  As a \nresult of his formal education and his professional experience, Leiber is a seasoned \ninvestor. \n{24}  In the late 1980s or the early 1990s, Leiber was introduced by a friend, \nDr. Kunstmann, to Wolfram Count von Spreti (“Spreti”).  Dr. Kunstmann informed \nLeiber that Spreti had successfully invested money in the United States.  Without \n  \nany research or due diligence into Spreti or Spreti’s investments, Leiber \nrecommended that one of his clients, Caroline Becher, invest with Spreti.  After Ms. \nBecher invested with Spreti, Spreti personally invited Leiber to invest with him in \nthe United States.  \n{25} Spreti invested in the AAC Defendants, a collection of entities that were \nfounded in Charlotte, North Carolina, beginning in the late 1980s.  The AAC \nDefendants primarily develop commercial real estate. \n{26} Riprand Count Arco (“Count Arco”) and Maria Beatrice Countess Arco \n(“Countess Arco”), both of whom are German, run the AAC Defendants.  Spreti was \na social contact of Count and Countess Arco, and they invited him to invest with \nthem in the United States.  At no point prior to meeting Spreti did Leiber have any \ncontact with any of the AAC Defendants. \n2. \nLEIBER’S INVESTMENT \n{27} Shortly after Spreti’s invitation to invest in the United States, Leiber wire-\ntransferred $210,000 from a Swiss bank account to be invested directly in \nSouthlake, an AAC Defendant.  The parties dispute whether Leiber was Spreti’s \n“client” or whether Spreti “invested” Leiber’s money.   Leiber contends that Spreti \nwas merely a “mediator” between Leiber and the AAC Defendants and that the \n$210,000 was wired directly to a bank account controlled by the AAC Defendants, \nnot by Spreti.  Conversely, the AAC Defendants contend that Leiber was Spreti’s \n“client” and that Spreti “invested” Leiber’s money in Southlake.  On the facts of this \ncase, the Court finds this distinction to be of little consequence.  Whether Leiber \nwas Spreti’s client or whether Spreti invested the funds is a matter of semantics.  It \nis undisputed that $210,000 was transferred from Leiber’s Swiss bank account \nbased upon Spreti’s advice.   \n{28} Significantly, there is no evidence that Leiber did any due diligence with \nrespect to his investments in the AAC Defendants.  Certainly, he obtained no \ninformation directly from the AAC Defendants.  Nor is there any evidence he \n  \nobtained information from the Arcos.  The only source of information upon whom he \ncould have relied was Spreti. \n{29} Leiber also invested in Arbor and Gastonia, both AAC Defendants.  Arbor \nand Gastonia were both partnerships that held limited partnership interests in \nother AAC entities.  Spreti was the general partner of both Arbor and Gastonia.  In \ntotal, Leiber invested $445,000 in the AAC Defendants. (Leiber Dep. 112:4−8, Oct. \n26, 2006.) \n3. \nLEIBER’S INVESTMENT DOCUMENTS \n{30} Leiber executed a number of documents for his investments in Southlake, \nArbor, and Gastonia.  For Southlake, Leiber signed three (3) attachments to the \nSouthlake Limited Partnership Agreement, including a Subscription Agreement, a \nSignature Page, and a Power of Attorney.  Leiber also signed a partnership \nagreement for both Arbor and Gastonia.  The parties have, however, failed to \nproduce an executed copy of the Gastonia agreement.   \n{31} All of the documents Leiber signed were in English.  The parties dispute \nwhether Leiber, who does not speak or read English, signed the documents “on the \nadvice of Spreti.”  (AAC Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 5; Pl.’s Resp. Mot. Summ. J. \n5.)   The dispute over semantics notwithstanding, it is undisputed that: (1) Leiber \ntestified his only contact was with Spreti; (2) he knows of nowhere else from which \nthe documents could have come; (3) he did not read the documents or have them \ntranslated before signing; (4) he signed at least one document when Spreti came to \nvisit him; and (5) he signed at least one document because he “trusted”\n2 Spreti. \n{32} The Signature Page of the Southlake Limited Partnership Agreement \ncontained an “Address of Notices” field.  On the Signature Page executed by Leiber, \nthe “Address of Notices” field contained the following hand-printed words: “Att. Mr. \nPeter Emgler, Wirtschafts & Privat Bank, Stauffacher Str. 45, 8026 Zurich, \n                                                 \n2 Leiber explained he signed the documents presented to him by Spreti without reading them or \nhaving them translated, “[b]ecause I had trust—I trusted I could make an investment via Graf \nSpreti in America.”  (Leiber Dep. 70:17−18.) \n  \nSwitzerland.”  Shortly thereafter, however, Spreti instructed the AAC Defendants \nto send all information concerning Leiber’s investments directly to Spreti in \nGermany.  The AAC Defendants complied with Spreti’s request despite the hand-\nprinted address on the Southlake Signature Page.  From then forward, the AAC \nDefendants sent everything related to Leiber’s investments, including payments, to \nSpreti.   \n{33} Plaintiff’s counsel has suggested that Leiber intended payments be sent to \nMr. Emgler at Wirtschafts & Privat Bank.  Leiber’s deposition testimony makes \nclear, however, that Leiber never intended payments be directed to Mr. Emgler.3   \nIn fact, Leiber testified that he did not write the Swiss bank’s address on the \nSignature Page or know who did.\n4  The evidence before the Court indicates that \nLeiber had no agreement with either the AAC entities or Spreti about how he would \nreceive communications or disbursements related to his investments in the United \nStates.5 \n{34} Consistent with Spreti’s instructions, the AAC entities sent all \ndistributions and documentation related to Lieber’s investments to Spreti.  The \n                                                 \n3 Q:  Did you ask [Spreti] to send anything to your bank accounts in Switzerland?   \n  A:  Originally I had intended to have the management of the investment done by a Swiss instance, \nbut then I decided against it. \n  Q:  Why? \n  A:  Because the supervision of the investment or the control of the investment by—in Switzerland \nwas not orderly enough for my taste.   \n \n(Leiber Dep. 76:24−77:10.) \n \n4 Q:  On the [Signature Page], which is marked page 1, Bates-stamped LBR 01527, is anything on \nhere in your handwriting? \n  A:  No. \n  Q:  Do you know whose handwriting that is? \n  A:  No.  It’s in printed letters that are almost impossible to identify. \n  Q:  But you know it’s not yours? \n  A:  Yes.   \n \n(Leiber Dep. 71:21−72:4.) \n \n5 Q:  Did you expect the checks to be delivered to Count Spreti? \n  A:  There was no agreement in that respect.   \n \n(Leiber Dep. 76:15−18.)  \n \n  \nrecord indicates distributions intended for Leiber totaling approximately $315,000 \nfrom 1990 to 2003.  Many of the distributions were by way of check made payable to \n“Wolfram Spreti In Favor of Dr. Hilmar Leiber.”  (Briody Dep. 189:8−190:6, June \n30, 2006.)  Moreover, the AAC entities also completed United States and North \nCarolina tax returns for Leiber’s investments.  From 1990 to 2003, the tax returns \nclaimed refunds totaling approximately $78,000.  The AAC entities claim to have \nsent the tax refund checks for Leiber’s investments to Spreti.   \n{35} The record also indicates that, during the period from 1990 to 2003, Leiber \nreceived only approximately $75,000 from Spreti, leaving roughly $320,000 \nunaccounted for.  Leiber testified that he received his first disbursement from \nSpreti eighteen months after his initial investment.6  Over the fifteen years at issue, \nLeiber claims that he received approximately twenty total payments from Spreti.7   \nLeiber knew the checks made out to him from the AAC Defendants were being sent \nto Spreti, but he never objected to anyone, including Spreti or the AAC Defendants, \nabout this practice.8  In fact, Leiber didn’t contact any of the AAC Defendants \nconcerning his investments until 2005, even though he had their contact \ninformation in 2000.  On each and every occasion, Leiber failed to object to Spreti \nreceiving the payments on his behalf.   \n                                                 \n6 Q:  When did you begin receiving disbursements of income from your investments with Count  \nSpreti? \n  A:  I received the first disbursements approximately 18 months after signing.   \n(Leiber Dep. 74:19−22.) \n7 Q:  To the best of your recollection, how many disbursement checks did you receive personally from \nyour investment in America? \n  A:  Within 15 years, it’s kind of difficult to say, but I’d say plus, minus, within—that there were \nprobably 20 transfers within that period of time.   \n(Leiber Dep. 122:10−15.) \n8 Q:  You never objected to the checks being delivered to Count Spreti, though? \n  A:  No.  \n \n(Leiber Dep. 76:15−20.) \n \n  \n{36}  The record indicates that Leiber did a poor job of managing his \ninvestments in the AAC Defendants.  Only rarely did Leiber and Spreti discuss \nLeiber’s investments.  On one occasion in 2000, Spreti sent Leiber a letter stating \nthat he was enclosing a disbursement check from the AAC Defendants.  The letter, \nhowever, did not contain the disbursement check.  In light of the missing check, \nLeiber’s wife sent Spreti a letter requesting that Spreti call her about the missing \ncheck and send a new one.  Nevertheless, Leiber never received the missing check \nor followed up with Spreti regarding the missing check. \n4. \nREDEMPTION OF THE SOUTHLAKE INTEREST \n{37} In July 2000, the AAC entities created the AAC Retail Fund.  It was \ncreated to consolidate the AAC entities’ interests in several commercial properties \ninto one entity to facilitate an increased borrowing limit.     \n{38} Southlake was contributed to the AAC Retail Fund in 2002.  Investors in \nSouthlake were given the opportunity to roll their Southlake investment into the \nAAC Retail Fund or sell their Southlake investment to the AAC Retail Fund.  In \naccordance with Spreti’s earlier instructions, the AAC entities mailed Leiber’s \nelection form to Spreti.  Spreti completed the election form, thereby notifying the \nAAC entities that Leiber wished to sell his interest in Southlake to the AAC Retail \nFund.  Accordingly, the AAC entities sent a Transfer and Sale of Limited \nPartnership Interest in Southlake Limited Partnership (“Southlake Redemption \nAgreement”) to Spreti.   \n{39} Subsequently, the AAC entities received the Southlake Redemption \nAgreement from Spreti with what was purported to be Leiber’s signature.  As a \nresult of the signed Southlake Redemption Agreement, the AAC Retail Fund issued \na Wachovia Bank check (the “Wachovia Check”) payable to Leiber in the amount of \n$151,274.  The Wachovia Check represented the purchase price of Leiber’s interest \nin Southlake less amounts withheld for United States taxes. \n{40} Leiber alleges that Spreti forged Leiber’s indorsement on the Wachovia \nCheck, cashed it and retained the proceeds.  (First Am. Compl. ¶ 41.)  Spreti   \n  \ncashed the Wachovia Check at Dresdner Bank, AG (“Dresdner”), a German bank.  \nDresdner then transferred the Wachovia Check to American Express Bank \n(“AMEX”) for collection.  Subsequently, AMEX presented the Wachovia Check to \nWachovia for payment, and Wachovia paid in full. \n5. \nREDEMPTION OF THE ARBOR AND GASTONIA INTERESTS \n{41} A similar scenario resulted from Leiber’s interests in Arbor and Gastonia.  \nArbor and Gastonia were both contributed to the AAC Retail Fund in January 2001.  \nIn 2003, the AAC entities again sent investors documents permitting their interests \nin Arbor and Gastonia to be rolled into the AAC Retail Fund or sold to the AAC \nRetail Fund.  Specifically, the AAC entities sent Spreti a Membership Interest \nRedemption Agreement Between Arbor Limited Partnership and Hilmar Leiber \n(“Arbor Redemption Agreement”) and a Member Interest Redemption Agreement \nBetween Gastonia Limited Partnership and Hilmar Leiber (“Gastonia Redemption \nAgreement”).  Here again, the AAC entities received the Arbor Redemption \nAgreement and the Gastonia Redemption Agreement with what was purported to \nbe Leiber’s signature.  As a result of the signed agreements, the AAC Retail Fund \nissued a Bank of America check (the “B of A Check”) payable to Leiber in the \namount of $254,858.  The B of A Check represented the purchase price of Leiber’s \ninterest in both Arbor and Gastonia less amounts withheld for United States taxes.   \n{42} Leiber again alleges that Spreti forged Leiber’s indorsement on the B of A \nCheck, cashed it and retained the proceeds.  (First Am. Comp. ¶ 44.)  Spreti \nnegotiated the B of A Check at Oberbank, AG (“Oberbank”).  Oberbank transferred \nthe B of A Check to Wachovia for collection.  Thereafter, Wachovia presented the \ncheck to B of A for payment, and B of A paid in full. \n{43} The Wachovia Check and the B of A Check will be collectively referred to \nas “the Checks” or the “Redemption Checks.”   \n \n \n \n  \n6. \nSPRETI COMMITS SUICIDE \n{44} In November 2004, Leiber scheduled a meeting with Spreti to discuss his \ninvestments in the United States.  The day before the scheduled meeting, Spreti \ncommitted suicide.  It was not until after Spreti’s death that Lieber claims to have \nlearned about the Wachovia and B of A Checks that were purportedly payment for \nhis interests in Southlake, Arbor, and Gastonia. \n{45} In May 2005, Leiber demanded payment from the AAC Defendants for the \namounts Spreti allegedly misappropriated.  To date, Leiber has not taken any legal \naction against Spreti’s estate or contacted German officials about Spreti’s alleged \nmisconduct.  Furthermore, Leiber has not taken any legal action against the \nEuropean banks at which the Wachovia Check and B of A Check were negotiated. \n7. \nALTERNATIVE CLAIMS \n{46} Leiber filed this instant litigation on October 19, 2005.  Plaintiff asserts \nalternative claims against the AAC Defendants and the Bank Defendants.  The \nalternative liability turns on the issue of agency. \n{47} On one hand, Paragraph 47 of the First Amended Complaint asserts: \nSpreti was not authorized to act as agent for Leiber or, upon \ninformation and belief, other limited partners of Arbor or Gastonia in \nexecuting or carrying out the Ar bor, Gastonia, [or Southlake] \nRedemption Agreements or receiving payments issued in the limited \npartners’ names.  The payments delivered into Spreti’s possession were \nnot delivered to Leiber and such other limited partners. \n \n(First Am. Compl. ¶ 47 (emphasis added).)  Additionally, the First Amended \nComplaint avers that Spreti “was not authorized upon information and belief to \nreceive” the Redemption Checks from the AAC Defendants.  (First Am. Compl.  \n¶¶ 59, 61 (emphasis added).) \n{48} On the other hand, Paragraph 83 of the First Amended Complaint states \nthat “Spreti acted as [Leiber’s] duly or apparently authorized agent in the receipt of \nthe B of A Check or that Leiber constructively received the B of A Check.”  (First \n  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 83.)  Along those same lines, Paragraph 87 of the Amended \nComplaint asserts that “Spreti acted as [Leiber’s] duly or apparently authorized \nagent in the receipt of the Wachovia Check or that Leiber constructively received \nthe Wachovia Check.”  (First Am. Comp. ¶ 87.)  Ultimately, the disposition of this \ncase will turn on the issue of agency.  If there is sufficient evidence to establish that \nSpreti was Leiber’s agent with respect to Leiber’s investment in the United States, \nthe AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment and the Bank Defendants \nare not entitled to summary judgment.9 \n8. \nREQUESTS FOR ADMISSION AND INTERROGATORIES \n{49} Wachovia has served several sets of requests for admission and \ninterrogatories in this case.  The Second Set of Requests for Admission and the \nSecond Set of Interrogatories were served after fact discovery was completed.  The \ndiscovery sought to resolve Plaintiff’s conflicting positions that (1) Spreti was \nLeiber’s agent for purposes of receipt of the Wachovia and B of A Checks and that \n(2) Spreti was not Leiber’s agent for purposes of receipt of the Wachovia and B of A  \nChecks. \n{50} Plaintiff objected to the discovery requests by asserting, among other \nthings, that “[w]hether Spreti was Leiber’s agent is a bona fide controversy.” (Pl.’s \nResp. Wachovia Bank’s First Set Req. Admis. 2.)  Plaintiff did, however, give a \nlimited substantive response by admitting that he did not communicate \nexpress \nauthority for Spreti to receive the Wachovia Check or the B of A Check.  (Pl.’s Resp. \nWachovia Bank’s First Set Req. Admis. 2.)   \n{51} Wachovia subsequently advised Plaintiff that the responses to the \ndiscovery did not comply with Rule 36 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  On March 16, 2007, Wachovia filed its Motion to Determine Sufficiency \nof Plaintiff’s Response to Requests for Admission and to Compel Plaintiff to \nRespond to Interrogatories (the “Motion to Compel”).  In an Order dated April 18, \n                                                 \n9  Leiber has straddled the fence on the question of Spreti’s agency.  Accordingly, he could not and did not move for \nsummary judgment with respect to his claims against the Banks.  Those claims remain for trial. \n  \n2007, the Court granted Wachovia’s Motion to Compel.  The Court stated, “[f]act \ndiscovery is closed.  Leiber either authorized Spreti to receive the checks or he did \nnot.  He will have to answer that fact question at trial.  He should do so now.” \n(Order Mot. Compel 2.) \n{52} In response to the Court’s April 18th Order, Plaintiff filed supplemental \nresponses to the Requests for Admission.  Leiber’s supplemental responses to \nRequests for Admission numbers 1 and 2 are as follows: \n \n1.  Wolfram Count von Spreti was not authorized to receive the \nWachovia Check, as that term is used in the Complaint, on Leiber’s \nbehalf from the AAC Retail Fund or any person or entity. \n \nRESPONSE: \nLeiber admits that he did not communicate to any person or \nentity express authority for Spreti to receive the Wachovia Check, \neither specifically or by a more general communication of authority.  \nExcept as expressly admitted, denied. \n \n2.  Plaintiff Hilmar Leiber did not receive delivery of the \nWachovia Check, as that term is used  in the Complaint, either directly \nor through delivery to an agent or co-payee, prior to the date upon \nwhich Wolfram Count von Spreti allegedly deposited the Wachovia \nCheck. \n \nRESPONSE: \nLeiber admits that he did not receive direct delivery of the \nWachovia Check and that there was no co-payee on the check.  Except \nas expressly admitted, denied. \n \n(Pl.’s Supp. Resp. Wachovia Bank’s First & Second Set Req. Admis. 1−2.)  Leiber \ngave virtually identical supplement responses to Requests for Admission numbers 3 \nand 4 regarding the B of A Check.  (See Pl.’s Supp. Resp. Wachovia Bank’s First & \nSecond Set Req. Admis. 2.)   \n{53} Plaintiff also supplemented his responses to Requests for Admission \nnumbers 9 and 10 as follows: \n \n  \n9.  Wolfram Count von Spreti was not authorized to sign \nPlaintiff Hilmar Leiber’s name to the [Southlake Redemption \nAgreement, Arbor Redemption Agreement, or Gastonia Redemption \nAgreement]. \n \n \nRESPONSE: \nLeiber admits he did not communicate to any person or entity \nexpress authority for Spreti to sign Leiber’s name to the [Southlake \nRedemption Agreement, Arbor Redemption Agreement, or Gastonia \nRedemption Agreement], either specifically or by a more general \ncommunication of authority.  Except as expressly admitted, denied. \n \n10.  No person or entity ot her than Hilmar Leiber was \nauthorized to sign Leiber’s name to the [Southlake Redemption \nAgreement, Arbor Redemption Agreement, or Gastonia Redemption \nAgreement]. \n \nRESPONSE: \nLeiber admits that he did not communicate to any person or \nentity express authority for any person or entity other than Leiber to \nsign Leiber’s name to the [Southlake Redemption Agreement, Arbor \nRedemption Agreement, or Gastonia Redemption Agreement], either \nspecifically or by a more general communication of authority.  Except \nas expressly admitted, denied \n \n(Pl.’s Supp. Resp. Wachovia Bank’s First & Second Set Req. Admis. 4.) \n{54} As further required by the Court’s Ap ril 18th Order, Leiber also provided \nsupplemental responses to certain interrogatories.  Leiber answered interrogatory \nnumber 10 as follows: \n \n10.  State whether you still contend “that Spreti acted as [Your] \nduly or apparently authorized agen t in the receipt of the Wachovia \nCheck or that Leiber constructively  received the Wachovia Check,” as \nalleged in paragraph 87 of your Complaint.  If so, describe in detail the \nbasis for this allegation, identifying all documents supporting the \nallegation and identifying all persons who have knowledge of any \ninformation supporting this allegation. \n \nRESPONSE:  Yes.  The evidentiary basis  for the allegation is that \nSpreti served as intermediary in brokering Leiber’s investments in \nAAC Defendants’ projects and Leiber received the payments referenced \n  \nin the immediately preceding response, a couple of reports and other \ncorrespondence from AAC, all of whic h has been previously produced, \nfrom Spreti, to the best of his knowledge, and did not communicate to \nthe AAC Defendants to cease transmitting such items through Spreti. \n . . . \n  \n(Leiber also continues to contend, in the alternative, that Spreti \nwas not his agent or that Spreti was the agent of the AAC Defendants.) \n \n(Pl.’s Supp. Resp. Wachovia Bank’s First & Second Set Interrogs. 2.)  Leiber gave a \nvirtually identical supplemental response to interrogatory number 11 regarding the \nB of A Check.  (See Pl.’s Supp. Resp. Wachovia Bank’s First & Second Set Interrogs. \n2−3.)   \n{55} As a result of the supplemental responses, the AAC Defendants contend \nthat it is undisputed that Spreti was in fact Leiber’s agent, and they are entitled to \nsummary judgment.  Conversely, Leiber asserts that he complied with the Court’s \nApril 18th Order by admitting that he did not give express authority for Spreti to \nreceive payment from the AAC Defendants on his behalf, but that there is still a \ngenuine issue of material fact about whether the circumstances surrounding Leiber \nand Spreti’s relationship give rise to a principal/agent relationship. \n \nIII. \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nA. \nTHE PARTIES’ MOTIONS \n{56} All Defendants have filed motions for summary judgment pursuant to Rule \n56 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. \n{57} Leiber is suing the AAC Defendants for unjust enrichment, breach of \ncontract, reinstatement, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and unfair \ntrade practices, claiming that Spreti was not authorized to sign the redemption \nagreements or receive the Checks on Leiber’s behalf.  (First Am. Comp. ¶¶ 47−82, \n91−104.)   \n  \n{58} Alternatively, Leiber is suing Wachovia and B of A for conversion of the \nWachovia Check and B of A Check under North Carolina General Statute section \n25-3-420(a) on a theory that Spreti was authorized to sign the redemption \nagreements and receive the Checks on Leiber’s behalf.  (First Am. Compl.  \n¶¶ 83−90.) \n{59} The AAC Defendants have moved for summary judgment against Plaintiff \non a theory that as a matter of law Spreti was Leiber’s agent, and he had the \nauthority to sign the redemption agreements in question and to receive the Checks \non Leiber’s behalf.   \n{60} Conversely, Wachovia contends, among other things, that as a matter of \nlaw, Spreti was not Leiber’s agent, and therefore, Wachovia cannot be held liable for \nstatutory conversion of the Checks because Leiber never received “delivery” of the \nChecks as required to make a statutory conversion claim. \n{61} In the same vein, B of A has moved for summary judgment against \nPlaintiff on a theory that, as a matter of law, Spreti was not Leiber’s agent, and \ntherefore, B of A cannot be held liable for statutory conversion of the B of A Check \nbecause Leiber never received “delivery” of the B of A Check as required to make a \nstatutory conversion claim.   \n{62} B of A has also filed a Cross-claim against Wachovia, alleging that if \nLeiber can maintain an action against B of A for conversion of the B of A Check, \nthen B of A is entitled to summary judgment against Wachovia because Wachovia \nbreached the presentment warranties upon presentment of the B of A Check with a \nforged payee indorsement. \n{63} Wachovia has moved for summary judgment on B of A’s Cross-claim on a \ntheory that: (1) B of A is not liable to Leiber for conversion of the B of A Check; and, \nalternatively, (2) Wachovia did not breach the presentment warranties to B of A. \nB. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{64} Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \n  \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  “An issue is ‘genuine’ if it \ncan be proven by substantial evidence, and a fact is ‘material’ if it would constitute \nor irrevocably establish any material element of a claim or defense.”  Lowe v. \nBradford, 30 N.C. 366, 369, 289 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1982).  “It is not the purpose of the \nrule to resolve disputed material issues of fact but rather to determine if such issues \nexist.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56 cmt.  The burden of showing a lack of triable issues of fact \nfalls upon the moving party.  See, e.g., Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co., \n313 N.C. 488, 491, 329 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1985).  Once this burden has been met, the \nnonmoving party must “produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that [it] will \nbe able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.”  Collingwood v. Gen. Elec. \nReal Estate Equities, Inc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989).  The Court \nmust exercise caution in granting a motion for summary judgment.  N.C. Nat’l Bank \nv. Gillespie, 291 N.C. 303, 310, 230 S.E.2d 375, 379 (1976).      \n \nIV. \nPRINCIPLES OF LAW \nA. \nAGENCY \n{65} The first question for the Court on the present motions is whether the \nevidence gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Spreti was \nLeiber’s agent with authority to receive the Redemption Checks.  Ultimately, the \nalternative liability of the AAC Defendants or the Banks turns on whether Spreti \nwas or was not Leiber’s agent.  Based on the record in this case, the Court finds as a \nmatter of law that Spreti was Leiber’s agent for purposes of receipt of the \nRedemption Checks. \n{66} The North Carolina Supreme Court has stated, “an agent is one who acts \nfor or in the place of another by authority from the other.”  Am. Tours, Inc. v. \nLiberty Mutual Ins. Co., 315 N.C. 341, 349, 338 S.E.2d 92, 97 (1986).  An agency \nrelationship arises “when parties manifest consent that one shall act on behalf of \n  \nthe other and subject to his control.”  Miller v. Piedmont Steam Co., 137 N.C. App. \n520, 524, 528 S.E.2d 923, 926 (2000) (citing Hayman v. Ramada Inn, Inc., 86 N.C. \nApp. 274, 277, 357 S.E.2d 394, 397 (1987)).  Typically, the issue of agency is a \nquestion of fact for the jury.  Vares v. Vares, 154 N.C. App. 83, 87, 517 S.E.2d 612, \n615 (2002).  However, “if only one inference can be drawn from the facts then it is a \nquestion of law for the trial court.”  Id. (citing Hylton v. Koontz, 138 N.C. App. 629, \n635, 532 S.E.2d 252, 257 (2000)).  Thus, the Court must examine the evidence to \ndetermine whether genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Spreti was \nLeiber’s agent.  While Leiber’s ambiguous answers create some problems at the \nsummary judgment stage, the Court believes that the evidence overwhelmingly \nestablishes agency under either of four agency theories.   \nB. \nACTUAL AGENCY \n{67} “[I]n establishing the existence of an actual agency relationship, the \nevidence must show that a principal actually consents to an agent acting on its \nbehalf.”  Phillips v. Rest. Mgmt. of Carolina, L.P., 146 N.C. App. 203, 217, 552 \nS.E.2d 686, 695 (2001).  In an actual agency relationship the agent can have (1) \nactual authority or (2) apparent authority.  12 Richard A. Lord, Williston on \nContracts § 35.10 (4th ed. Westlaw) (2007).  \n{68} Actual authority can be either express or implied.  Id.  “Express authority \nexists if the principal has delegated authority to the agent by words which expressly \nauthorize the agent to do a delegable act.”  Id. (internal quotations omitted).   \n{69} On the other hand, “[i]mplied authority depends on circumstantial proof of \nactual authority, and exists where appearances justify a finding that the agent was \nauthorized to perform certain acts.”  Id.  Implied authority “includes not only the \nauthority to accomplish the precise act which the principal expressly authorized the \nagent to do, but the power to perform whatever acts are reasonably necessary to \nachieve that purpose.” Id.   \n{70} An actual agency relationship can also be based on the doctrine of \n“apparent authority.”  See Ward v. Durham Life Ins. Co., 325 N.C. 202, 212, 381 \n  \nS.E.2d 698, 703 (1989).  Apparent authority allows an agent to affect the rights and \nliabilities of his principal outside the scope of his actual authority.  See Zimmerman \nv. Hogg & Allen, P.A., 286 N.C. 24, 30, 209 S.E.2d 795, 798−99 (1974).  In \nZimmerman, the doctrine of apparent authority was summarized as follows: \nThe rights and liabilities which exist between a principal and a third \nparty dealing with that principal’s agent may be governed by the \napparent scope of the agent’s authority, which is that authority which \nthe principal has held the agent out as possessing or which he has \npermitted the agent to represent that he possesses; however, the \ndetermination of a principal’s liability in any particular case must be \ndetermined by what authority the third person in the exercise of \nreasonable care was justified in believing that the principal had, under \nthe circumstances, conferred upon his agent. \n \nId. at 30−31, 209 S.E.2d at 799.  Importantly, whether the agent was acting within \nthe apparent scope of his authority is governed by the principal’s conduct, not by \nany manifestations of the agent.  Id.  Put another way, “[t]he scope of the agent’s \napparent authority is determined not by the agent’s own representations but by the \nmanifestations of authority which the principal accords to the [agent].”  \nRestatement (Second) of Agency § 27 (1958).  Apparent authority may not, however, \n“be relied upon to assert that a principal authorized a certain transaction between \nits purported agent and a third party unless the third party actually relied upon the \nassertions of the principal regarding the purported agent’s power at the time of the \ntransaction.”  Knight Publ’g Co. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 125 N.C. App. 1, \n15, 479 S.E.2d 478, 487 (1997) (emphasis in original). \nC. \nAPPARENT AGENCY/AGENCY BY ESTOPPEL \n{71} In the absence of actual agency, an agency relationship may be deemed to \nexist under the theory of “apparent agency” or “agency by estoppel.”  Hayman, 86 \nN.C. App. at 278, 357 S.E.2d at 397.  The Court will hereinafter refer to both \ntheories as “apparent agency.”  The theory of apparent agency has been stated as \nfollows: \n  \nWhere a person by words or conduct represents or permits it to be \nrepresented that another person is his agent, he will be estopped to \ndeny the agency as against third pe rsons who have dealt, on the faith \nof such representation, with the person  so held out as agent, even if no \nagency existed in fact.   \n \nId.  (quoting Fike v. Bd. of Trustees, 53 N.C. App. 78, 80, 279 S.E. 2d 910, 912 \n(1981)). \n{72} Apparent agency is governed by the principles and policies governing \nequitable estoppel.  Deal v. N.C. State. Univ., 114 N.C. App. 643, 645, 442 S.E.2d \n360, 362 (1994).  “Equitable estoppel arises when one party, by his act, \nrepresentations, or silence when he should speak, intentionally, or through culpable \nnegligence, induces a person to believe that certain facts exist, and that person \nreasonably relies on and acts on those beliefs to his detriment.”  Id. (emphasis \nadded).  Equitable estoppel is a doctrine that aids a court “in the administration of \njustice when without its aid injustice would result.”  Id. \nD. \nAPPARENT AGENCY V. APPARENT AUTHORITY \n{73} The doctrines of apparent agency and apparent authority are often used \ninterchangeably.  They are, however, different.  Apparent agency allows a non-\nagent to bind his putative principal.  See Hayman, 86 N.C. App. at 278, 357 S.E.2d \nat 397.  Conversely, apparent authority allows an agent to bind his principal to \nmatters outside the scope of his actual authority.  See Zimmerman, 286 N.C. at \n30−31, 209 S.E.2d at 799.  In sum, apparent authority only applies to an actual \nagent, whereas apparent agency applies to a non-agent.  While there is a difference, \nthese doctrines operate under very similar circumstances and rely on the same \nprinciples of equity.   \nE. \nRATIFICATION \n{74} Additionally, a principal can be held liable for an agent’s unauthorized act \nwhen the principal subsequently ratifies the unauthorized act.  See, e.g., Inv. Prop. \nof Asheville, Inc. v. Allen, 283 N.C. 277, 285−86, 196 S.E.2d 262, 267 (1973) (“A \n  \nprincipal is liable upon a contract duly made by his agent with a third person . . . \nwhen the contract, although unauthorized, has been ratified . . . .”).  “Ratification is \ndefined as ‘the affirmance by a person of a prior act which did not bind him but \nwhich was done or professedly done on his account, whereby the act, as to some or \nall persons, is given effect as if originally authorized by him.’”  Am. Travel Corp. v. \nCent. Carolina Bank & Trust Co., 57 N.C. App. 437, 442, 291 S.E.2d 892, 895 (1982) \n(citing Restatement (Second) of Agency § 82 (1958)).  A principal must have intent \nto ratify plus full knowledge of all material facts.  Bell Atl.Tricon Leasing, Corp. v. \nDRR, Inc., 114 N.C. App. 771, 776, 443 S.E.2d 374, 377 (1994).  “Ratification may be \nexpress or implied, and intent may be inferred from failure to repudiate an \nunauthorized act . . . or from conduct on the part of the principal which is \ninconsistent with any other position than intent to adopt the act.”  Id. at 776−77, \n443 S.E.2d at 377 (internal quotations omitted).   \nF. \nPARTNERSHIP \n{75} Under North Carolina law, it is fundamental that partners are agents for \neach other for certain purposes.  See Barnes v. Campbell Chain Co., 47 N.C. App. \n488, 490, 267 S.E.2d 388, 390−91 (1980).  Specifically, section 59-39(a) of the North \nCarolina General Statutes states that “[e]very partner is an agent of the \npartnership for the purpose of its business.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 59-39(a) (2007).  \nFurthermore, “[e]xcept as provided in [the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership \nAct] or in the partnership agreement, a general partner of a limited partnership has \nthe rights and powers . . . of a partner in a partnership without limited partners.”  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 59-403(a) (2007).   \n{76} While in certain situations a person dealing with an agent must know the \nextent of the agent’s authority, this is not the case when dealing with one who is a \ngeneral agent, such as a general partner.  Investors Title Ins. Co. v. Herzig, 320 \nN.C. 770, 774, 360 S.E.2d 786, 788 (1987).  In the case of a general partner, “the \nburden is on the principal to show that the other party had notice of a restriction \nupon the power of the general agent.”  Id.  \n  \nV. \nANALYSIS \nA. \nEXPRESS ACTUAL AUTHORITY \n{77} The principles of agency law discussed above must be applied to the facts \nof this case.  First, the record is clear that Leiber did not communicate express \nauthority to Spreti or anyone else regarding his investments in the United States.  \nLeiber admitted that “he did not communicate to any person express authority for \nSpreti to receive the Wachovia Check, either specifically or by a more general \ncommunication of authority.”  (Pl.’s Supp. Resp. Wachovia’s First & Second Reqs. \nAdmis. ¶ 1.)  Similarly, Leiber admitted that “he did not communicate to any person \nexpress authority for Spreti to receive the Bank of America Check, either \nspecifically or by a more general communication of authority.”  (Pl.’s Supp. Resp. \nWachovia’s First & Second Reqs. Admis. ¶ 3.)  There is no evidence contradicting \nthese admissions. \nB. \nIMPLIED ACTUAL AUTHORITY \n{78} Next, the Court turns to the issue of implied actual authority.  As a matter \nof law, the Court finds that Spreti had implied actual authority to act on Leiber’s \nbehalf.  There is circumstantial proof of Spreti’s actual authority, and “appearances \njustify a finding that [Spreti] was authorized to perform certain acts.” 12 Richard A. \nLord, supra, at § 35.10.  As a result, an actual agency relationship existed between \nLeiber and Spreti, and Spreti was authorized to receive the Redemption Checks and \nthe documents from the AAC Defendants.      \n{79} Leiber did no due diligence with respect to his investments in the United \nStates.  Leiber invested $445,000 in the AAC Defendants based solely upon Spreti’s \nadvice.  In making this substantial investment, Leiber never contacted any of the \nAAC Defendants directly.  At all relevant times, Leiber managed his investment in \nthe AAC Defendants through Spreti.  For over fifteen years Spreti was the AAC \nDefendants’ only contact regarding Leiber’s investments.  This undisputed evidence \n  \njustifies a finding that Spreti was authorized to perform certain acts on Leiber’s \nbehalf. \n{80} Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the execution of the investment \ndocuments are evidence of Spreti’s implied actual authority.  It is undisputed that \nthat: (1) Leiber testified his only contact was with Spreti; (2) he knows of nowhere \nelse from which the investment documents could have come; (3) he did not read the \ninvestment documents or have them translated before signing; (4) he signed at least \none document when Spreti came to visit him at his home; and (5) he signed at least \none document because he “trusted” Spreti.  Taken together, these undisputed facts \nare circumstantial proof of Spreti’s implied actual authority.   \n{81} The Address of Notices field on the Southlake investment documents \ncontained the name and address of an employee at a Swiss bank.  Leiber has \nsuggested that this is some evidence that Leiber wanted someone other than Spreti \nhandling his investments in the United States.  On its face, this argument seems \nreasonable.  After a review of the entire record, however, this argument is not \npersuasive.  Leiber testified at his deposition that he did not write anything in the \nAddress of Notices field or have any idea who did.  Leiber went so far as to \naffirmatively testify that he did \nnot want the Swiss bank to manage his \ninvestments.  Leiber further testified that he had reached no agreement with \nanyone regarding disbursements or notices concerning his investments in the AAC \nDefendants.   \n{82} Leiber’s conduct with respect to the disbursement checks also justifies a \nfinding that Spreti was authorized to do certain acts on Leiber’s behalf.  Within \neighteen months of his initial investment Leiber received his first disbursement \ncheck from Spreti.  Upon receipt of this check, Leiber did not contact the AAC \nDefendants to object to Spreti receiving checks on his behalf.  Instead, for the better \npart of fifteen years, without objection, Leiber received approximately twenty \nchecks relating to his investments in the United States from Spreti.  \n{83} Finally, Leiber invested in Southlake, Arbor, and Gastonia, all of which \nare limited partnerships.  In the case of Arbor and Gastonia, Spreti was the general \n  \npartner.  Given that all partners are agents for each other, Leiber’s investment in \nArbor and Gastonia indicates an agency relationship between Leiber and Spreti.  \nBarnes, 47 N.C. App. at 490, 267 S.E.2d at 390. \n{84} From the perspective of the AAC Defendants, they knew that Leiber had to \nbe relying upon Spreti for investment advice because he had no other source of \ninformation.  Their only contact with Leiber was through Spreti.  They never had \nany direct contact, were never asked for information, and were never questioned \nabout any transactions related to Leiber and handled by Spreti.  They knew Leiber \nhad invested in Arbor and Gastonia, in which Spreti was the general partner.  The \nAAC Defendants had multiple indications that Spreti was authorized to act on \nbehalf of Leiber and no indications that he was not authorized.  In the exercise of \nreasonable care, the AAC entities were justified in believing that Leiber had \nconferred upon Spreti authority to handle his investments in the United States.  \nThe Court, therefore, finds as a matter of law that Spreti had implied actual \nauthority to act on Leiber’s behalf.   \nC. \nAPPARENT AUTHORITY \n{85} Next, the Court turns to the issue of apparent authority.  As a matter of \nlaw, the Court finds that Spreti had apparent authority to act on Leiber’s behalf.  \nThere is undisputed evidence that Leiber held out Spreti as his agent.  See \nZimmerman, 286 N.C. at 30−31, 209 S.E.2d at 799.  Additionally, Leiber permitted \nSpreti to represent to the AAC Defendants that he had authority to act on Leiber’s \nbehalf.  \nSee id.  Based on Leiber’s actions, the AAC Defendants were justified in \nbelieving that Leiber conferred upon Spreti the ability to act on his behalf.  Under \nthese facts, an actual agency relationship existed between Leiber and Spreti on the \nbasis of apparent authority. \n{86} Many of the same undisputed facts that support a finding of implied actual \nauthority also support a finding of apparent authority.  Specifically, Leiber invested \nin the AAC Defendants based solely on Spreti’s advice.  Leiber signed the \ninvestment documents without having them translated or read to him because he \n  \n“trusted” Spreti.  Ultimately, Leiber invested nearly a half a million dollars without \never directly contacting any of the AAC Defendants or doing any due diligence.  At \nall relevant times, Leiber managed his investment in the AAC Defendants through \nSpreti.  By exclusively using Spreti to manage his investments for roughly fifteen \nyears, Leiber held out Spreti to the AAC Defendants as having authority to act on \nhis behalf.  The AAC Defendants never dealt with anyone but Spreti.  Based on this \ncourse of conduct, the AAC Defendants were justified in believing that Spreti had \nauthority to act on Leiber’s behalf.   \n{87} The circumstances surrounding the numerous disbursement checks also \nnecessitate a finding of apparent authority.  Within eighteen months of his initial \ninvestment Leiber received his first disbursement check from Spreti.  From that \npoint forward, Leiber knew that the checks were coming from Spreti, not directly \nfrom the AAC Defendants.  Leiber failed to object to this practice upon receipt of the \nfirst check and any of the subsequent nineteen checks.  Leiber’s numerous failures \nto object gave Spreti apparent authority to receive checks for Leiber.  No other \nconclusion can be drawn from these facts. \n{88} Finally, Leiber invested significant funds in Arbor and Gastonia, both \nlimited partnerships in which Spreti was the general partner.  North Carolina law \nis clear that all partners are agents for each other concerning partnership business.  \nBarnes, 47 N.C. App. at 490, 267 S.E.2d at 390.  Receiving disbursement checks \nfrom partnership investments is partnership business.  As such, the partnership is \nan indicator that an agency relationship existed between Leiber and Spreti.  In \neffect, the partnership is a holding out by Leiber of an agency relationship with \nSpreti.   \n{89} Based on the foregoing, there is undisputed evidence that Leiber held out \nSpreti as his agent and that Leiber permitted Spreti to represent that he was \nLeiber’s agent.  Accordingly, the Court finds as a matter of law that Spreti had \napparent authority to act on Leiber’s behalf. \n \n \n  \nD. \nAPPARENT AGENCY \n{90} Next, the Court turns to the issue of apparent agency.  The Court finds as \na matter of law that an apparent agency relationship existed between Leiber and \nSpreti.  There is undisputed evidence that Leiber, by his conduct, represented that \nSpreti was his agent.  Based on a course of conduct that existed for fifteen years, \nLeiber is now estopped to deny the agency relationship, even if no agency actually \nexisted in fact. Hayman, 86 N.C. App. at 278, 357 S.E.2d at 397.  Accordingly, an \napparent agency existed between Leiber and Spreti. \n{91} The undisputed facts that sustain a finding of implied authority and \napparent authority also sustain a finding of apparent agency.  Leiber’s investment \nin the AAC Defendants was at Spreti’s direction.  Leiber testified that he trusted \nSpreti to make investments for him in the United States.  At no point prior to \nSpreti’s suicide did Leiber have any direct contact with the AAC Defendants, \ndespite the fact they had $445,000 of his money.  By exclusively using Spreti to \nmanage his $445,000 investment for fifteen years, Leiber held out Spreti as having \nauthority to act on his behalf.  With respect to Leiber’s investment, the AAC \nDefendants knew of no one else with whom to communicate.  Given Leiber’s conduct \nfor over fifteen years, the AAC Defendants were justified in believing the Spreti had \nauthority to act on Leiber’s behalf. \n{92} Additionally, the circumstances surrounding approximately twenty \ndisbursement checks dictate a finding of apparent agency.  Leiber received his first \ndisbursement check within eighteen months of his initial investment.  Upon receipt \nof the first check, Leiber failed to question why the AAC Defendants were sending \nthe disbursement checks to Spreti, as opposed to him directly.  Over the subsequent \nyears, Spreti sent Leiber another nineteen disbursement checks.  At all relevant \ntimes, Leiber failed to object to Spreti receiving checks on his behalf or notify the \nAAC Defendants about an alternative arrangement.  Apparent agency is a legal \nprinciple based on equity, and Leiber’s silence concerning the disbursement checks \ninduced the AAC Defendants to believe an agency relationship existed between \n  \nLeiber and Spreti.  See Deal, 114 N.C. App. at 645, 442 S.E.2d at 362.  The AAC \nDefendants reasonably relied on Leiber’s action to their detriment.  For that reason, \nthe Court finds that an apparent agency existed between Leiber and Spreti, even if \nthere was no actual agency relationship. \n{93} Finally, Leiber’s investment in Arbor and Gastonia, limited partnerships \nin which Spreti was the general partner, is further evidence that an agency \nrelationship existed between the two.  As the general partner, Spreti was an agent \nfor all the limited partners with respect to partnership business.  Receiving \ndisbursement checks on behalf of the limited partners is partnership business.  The \npartnership, and Leiber’s general hands-off approach, was a holding out of Spreti’s \nauthority to act on Leiber’s behalf.  As a result, the Court finds as a matter of law \nthat an apparent agency existed and that Spreti was authorized to receive the \nRedemption Checks. \nE. \nRATIFICATION \n{94} Last, the Court examines the issue of ratification.  Assuming, arguendo, \nthat Spreti was not authorized to receive the disbursement checks, Leiber’s silence \nfor fifteen years and after roughly twenty disbursement checks is a ratification of \nSpreti’s unauthorized acts.  Ratification requires an intent to ratify and knowledge \nof all material facts.  \nBell Atlantic Tricon Leasing, Corp., 114 N.C. App. at 776, 443 \nS.E.2d at 337.  Leiber was aware of all material facts because he received numerous \ndisbursement checks from Spreti over the course of fifteen years.  Leiber failed to \nobject to Spreti receiving the disbursement checks on each and every occasion.  By \nfailing to object, Leiber ratified Spreti’s continued receipt of the disbursement \nchecks.  Leiber’s intent to ratify is inferred from his failure to repudiate Spreti’s \nunauthorized acts.   \n \n \n \n \n  \nVI. \nCONCLUSIONS \n{95} Based on the foregoing, the undisputed evidence establishes an agency \nrelationship between Leiber and Spreti, both directly and through principles of \nratification and equity.  Accordingly, the AAC Defendants are entitled to summary \njudgment on each of Leiber’s claims. \n{96} The AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s \nunjust enrichment claim.  As a result of the agency relationship that existed \nbetween Leiber and Spreti, payment to Spreti was payment to Leiber.  The AAC \nDefendants, therefore, were not unjustly enriched because they issued the \nRedemption Checks to Spreti as payment for the interests they purchased from \nLeiber.  Leiber’s First Claim for Relief for unjust enrichment is DISMISSED. \n{97} The AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s \nbreach of contract claim.  Leiber has failed to identify any specific provision in the \nSouthlake, Arbor, or Gastonia partnership agreements that has been breached.  \nWithout such a showing, the cause of action cannot survive summary judgment.  \nMoreover, Leiber has produced no evidence to show that a payment to which he was \nentitled did not reach Spreti, his duly authorized agent.  Accordingly, Leiber’s \nSecond Claim for Relief for breach of contract is DISMISSED. \n{98} The AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s \nclaim for reinstatement/winding up partnerships.  The undisputed evidence shows \nthat Leiber’s interests in the AAC Defendants were redeemed by his duly \nauthorized agent, Spreti.  The AAC Defendants compensated Leiber for his \ninterests by issuing the Redemption Checks to Spreti.  Having sold his interests, \nLeiber is no longer a limited partner with standing to force a reinstatement and \nsubsequent winding up of the partnerships.  Additionally, Leiber has failed to join \nthe other limited partners whose interests would be affected by a reinstatement and \nsubsequent winding up of the partnerships.  As a result of his redemption and his \nfailure to join necessary parties, Leiber’s Third Claim for Relief for reinstatement/ \nwinding up is DISMISSED.         \n  \n{99} The AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Leiber’s breach \nof fiduciary duty claim.  Leiber asserts that the AAC Defendants breached their \nfiduciary duties based on the handling of the various disbursements, the \nredemption agreements, and the winding up of the partnerships.  Again, however, \nLeiber’s agency relationship with Spreti defeats this claim.  Leiber received the \ndisbursements and properly redeemed his interests in the AAC Defendants through \nhis duly authorized agent, Spreti.  Further, the winding up of the partnerships was \nnot a breach of a fiduciary duty because Leiber had already sold his interest in the \npartnerships to the AAC Defendants.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s Fourth Claim for Relief \nfor breach of fiduciary duty is DISMISSED. \n{100} The AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Leiber’s \nnegligence claim.  Leiber asserts that the AAC Defendants breached their duty of \nreasonable care as a result of the way they handled the various disbursements, the \nredemption agreements, and the winding up of the partnerships.  Leiber’s agency \nrelationship with Spreti, however, defeats this claim.  Leiber received the \ndisbursements and properly redeemed his interests in the AAC Defendants through \nhis duly authorized agent, Spreti.  In making payment to Leiber’s duly authorized \nagent, the AAC Defendants did not breach their duty of reasonable care.  Moreover, \nLeiber, having sold his interest in the partnerships to the AAC Defendants, was not \nowed a duty of reasonable care upon the winding up of the partnerships.  Plaintiff’s \nFifth Claim for Relief for negligence is, therefore, DISMISSED.     \n{101} The AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff’s \nconversion claim.  Plaintiff seeks to hold the AAC Defendants vicariously liable for \nconversion based on a theory that Spreti was the AAC Defendants’ agent and he \nconverted the checks intended for Leiber.  However, the undisputed evidence shows \nthat Spreti was Leiber’s agent, not the AAC Defendants’ agent.  Payments to Spreti \nwere payments to Leiber.  As such, the payments to Spreti could not have been \nconverted by the AAC Defendants.  Accordingly, Leiber’s Eighth Claim for Relief for \nconversion is DISMISSED. \n  \n{102} The AAC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Leiber’s claim \nfor unfair and deceptive trade practices.  The undisputed evidence shows that \nSpreti was Leiber’s agent, not the AAC Defendants’ agent.  Payments to Spreti were \npayments to Leiber.  As such, the payments to Spreti cannot serve as the basis of an \nunfair and deceptive trade practices claim.  Consequently, Leiber’s Ninth Claim for \nRelief for unfair and deceptive trade practices is DISMISSED. \n{103} In conjunction with his first five Claims for Relief, Leiber is seeking \ndamages, both individually as well as derivatively, on behalf of Arbor and Gastonia.  \nIn North Carolina, a limited partner who is suing for damages individually cannot \nalso pursue damages derivatively on behalf of the partnership, except in \ncircumstances not relevant here.  See Energy Investors Fund, L.P. v. Metric \nConstructors, Inc., 133 N.C. App. 522, 526−27, 516 S.E.2d 399, 402 (1999);  \nBrowning v. Maurice B. Levien & Co., P.C., 44 N.C. App. 701, 704, 262 S.E.2d 355, \n357 (1980).  This rule is intended to prevent a double recovery.  Energy Investors, \n133 N.C. App. at 527, 516 S.E.2d at 402.  Moreover, assuming, arguendo, that \nLeiber could maintain derivative claims on behalf of Arbor and Gastonia, it is \nundisputed that Spreti was the general partner of both Arbor and Gastonia.  As the \ngeneral partner, Spreti was authorized to receive payment on behalf of both Arbor \nand Gastonia.  Leiber has produced no evidence showing that a payment intended \nfor Arbor or Gastonia was not delivered to Spreti, the general partner.  As such, \nLeiber’s derivative claims are DISMISSED. \n{104} Based on the foregoing, the AAC Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment is GRANTED.   \n \nVII. \nTHE BANKS’ MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \n{105} Plaintiff has alleged that the Banks converted the Redemption Checks. \n(First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 83−90.)  Both Wachovia and B of A have moved for summary \njudgment against Plaintiff on the conversion claims.  After reviewing the record and \nsubmissions of counsel, the Court finds that there are genuine issues of material \n  \nfact surrounding the conversion claims.  Accordingly, the Court hereby DENIES \nWachovia’s and B of A’s motions for summary judgment against Plaintiff. \n \nVIII. \nB OF A’S CROSS-CLAIM AGAINST WACHOVIA  \n{106} Finally, the Court turns to B of A’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the \nCross-claim.  The Cross-claim alleges that if Leiber can maintain an action against \nB of A for conversion of the B of A Check, then B of A is entitled to summary \njudgment against Wachovia because Wachovia breached the presentment \nwarranties upon presentment of the B of A Check with a forged payee indorsement.  \nThis issue is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (“U.C.C.”), which is codified \nin our statutes as N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 25-4-101 through 25-9-710.    \n{107} Under sections 25-3-417(a) and 25-4-207.1(a) of the North Carolina \nGeneral Statutes, a party presenting a check to a drawee bank warrants  \n(1) [t]he warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred \nthe draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain \npayment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to \nenforce the draft; (2) [t]he draft ha s not been altered; and (3) [t]he \nwarrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer of the \ndraft is unauthorized.  \n \n N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-3-417(a); see also § 25-4-207.1(a).  The Official Comments to \nSection 25-3-417 state that “[s]ubsection (a)(1) in effect is a warranty that there are \nno unauthorized or missing indorsements.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-3-417(a), Official \nComment 2.  The presentment warranties are breached if the check contains a \nforged indorsement.  United Carolina Bank v. First Union Nat’l Bank, 109 N.C. \nApp. 201, 205, 426 S.E.2d 462, 466 (1993).   \n{108} Upon breach of a presentment warranty, “[a] drawee making payment may \nrecover from any warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to the amount \npaid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive \nfrom the drawer because of the payment.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-3-417(b). \n  \n{109} In Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Fed. Reserve Bank of Richmond, the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals noted, “[t]hrough presentment warranties, the general \nscheme of the U.C.C. shifts losses up the collection stream to presenting and \ndepository banks.”  338 F.3d 318, 321−322 (4th Cir. 2003) (citing 2 White & \nSummers, Uniform Commercial Code § 18-7 (4th ed. 1995)) (emphasis added).  The \nU.C.C.’s loss-shifting mechanism was further explained by N.C. Nat’l. Bank v. \nHammond: \n[I]f a payor/drawee bank suffers a loss by paying a check over a proven \nforged indorsement, it may sue the collecting bank which presented the \ncheck to it on a theory of breach of warranty of good title. That \ncollecting bank in turn may sue the next collecting bank and so on \ndown the collection chain. Final liability for the check with a forged \nindorsement under the Uniform Commercial Code rests ultimately on \nthe initial depository bank which presumably could have guarded \nagainst the loss by inspecting the indorsement more closely. \n \n298 N.C. 703, 708, 260 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1979).  This scheme places the liability for a \nforged indorsement “on the party most able to guard against it, the party taking the \ninstrument from the forger himself.”  Id. at 709, 260 S.E.2d at 622.  In this case, the \nliable parties would be the German banks—Dresdner and Oberbank.       \n{110} It is undisputed that Wachovia made the warranties enumerated in \nsections 25-3-417 and 25-4-207.1 of the North Carolina General Statutes.  Wachovia \nexpressly admitted to making such warranties in response to B of A’s First Set of \nInterrogatories.  (Wachovia Bank’s Resp. Bank of Am. First Set Interrogs. 8.)  There \nis no evidence in the record to suggest that the B of A Check was altered or that \nWachovia had knowledge that Leiber’s alleged signature was unauthorized.  \nAccordingly, the only issue is whether Wachovia was entitled to enforce the draft.  \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 25-3-417(a)(1), 25-4-207.1(a)(1). \n{111} Wachovia warranted that the B of A Check did not contain a forged \nindorsement.  It is undisputed, however, that Leiber’s signature on the B of A check \nwas a forgery.  “Any adjudicated or noncontested forgery triggers this warranty.”  \nHammond, 298 N.C. at 708, 260 S.E.2d at 621.  Spreti negotiated the B of A Check \nat Oberbank.  Oberbank transferred the B of A Check to Wachovia for collection.  \n  \nThereafter, Wachovia presented the check to B of A for payment, and B of A made \npayment in full.  Because the B of A Check contained a forged indorsement, \nWachovia breached the presentment warranties made to B of A.  As a result, \nsummary judgment on B of A’s Cross-claim is proper if the Banks’ defenses to the \nconversion claims fail.  Wherefore, B of A’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the \nCross-claim is hereby GRANTED. \n{112} Wachovia is free, however, to go “down the collection chain” because final \nliability under the U.C.C. “rests ultimately on the initial depository bank which \npresumably could have guarded against the loss by inspecting the indorsement \nmore closely.”  \nHammond, 298 N.C. at 708, 260 S.E.2d at 621.  In this case, that \nliability rests on the German banks.  \n \nIX. \nCONCLUSION \n{113} Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED: \n1.  That the AAC Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED;  \n2.  That Wachovia’s Motion for Summary Judgment against Plaintiff is \nDENIED; \n3.  That B of A’s Motion for Summary Judgment against Plaintiff is DENIED; \nand \n4.  That B of A’s Motion for Summary Judgment on the Cross-claim is \nGRANTED. \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED, this the 8th day of July, 2009. \n \n \n  "
