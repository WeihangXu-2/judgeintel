Dart (“Dart”) \nand Robert E. Zaytoun (“Zaytoun”) were three members of a seven member \nPlaintiffs’ Management Committee (“PMC”) appointed by the court in a federal \nclass action lawsuit, Beaulieu v. E.Q. Indus. Servs., Inc., No. 5:06-CV-400 BR, \nEastern District of North Carolina, Western Division (“Beaulieu”) arising out of an \nOctober 5, 2006 explosion at the EQ Industrial Services (“EQ”) plant in Apex, North \nCarolina.  The present dispute involves how the parties are to share in attorneys’ \nfees awarded to the PMC totaling $2,983,000 as a part of the class action \nsettlement.   The PMC Fee Subcommittee recommended an allocation among the \nseven members.  The individual members opposed that allocation and filed a motion \nto compel arbitration in the Eastern District class action which was assigned to \nUnited States Magistrate Judge James E. Gates.  By a December 23, 2009 order, \nMagistrate Judge Gates approved the PMC Fee Subcommittee recommendation \nupon the PMC’s representation that all disputes underlying the motion to compel \nhad been resolved by agreement.  That allocation provided for payments to Dart of \n$995,000, Zaytoun of $670,000 and Dunn of $75,000, totaling $1,740,000.   Dunn \nclaims he is entitled to a greater share through his prior separate agreement with \nDart and Zaytoun, and that such agreement remains enforceable after Judge Gates’ \norder.  Dart and Zaytoun deny that any such agreement existed in the first \ninstance, that any such agreement would be unenforceable if reached as it was \nnever approved by clients, and that Magistrate Judge Gates’ was a final \nadjudication barring the present Complaint. \n{3} The Court concludes that while fee-splitting percentages on which an \nagreement would be negotiated were apparently agreed to, no final agreement was \nreached, and that any such agreement solely among counsel was unenforceable \nuntil client approval.  The Court further concludes that it is unnecessary separately \nto reach the issues raised by Defendants’ equitable and claim preclusion defenses.  \nAccordingly, the Court GRANTS Summary Judgment for Defendants. \n \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n  \n {4} Dunn filed his Complaint in this ac tion in Craven County Superior Court \non December 23, 2009.  Dart and Zaytoun removed the case to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina on December 31, 2009.  \nThe Honorable Louise W. Flanagan, Chief United States District Court Judge, \nentered an order remanding the case to state court for lack of federal subject matter \njurisdiction on April 20, 2010.  The case was then designated as a complex business \ncase on May 21, 2010 and assigned to this court.  On January 13, 2011, following \nthe completion of discovery, Dart and Zaytoun filed Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment and Defendant Dart’s Alternative Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  The various grounds for the joint motion include their contention that: \n1) there is insufficient evidence to prove that any enforceable fee-sharing agreement \nwas ever entered; 2) if any such agreement was reached, it was not approved by the \nclients as required by North Carolina Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5;  3) a \nnovation occurred when any initial agreement was substituted by the subsequent \nagreements on which the allocation approved by Magistrate Judge Gates was based; \nand 4) Dunn’s present action is inconsistent with and barred by Magistrate Judge \nGates’ order to which Dunn consented.  Dart’s individual motion is based on the \nproposition that Dunn’s claim would entitle him to a greater award than he received \nunder the allocation Magistrate Judge Gates approved. \n \nIII. STATEMENT OF FACTS \n \n{5} The material facts necessary to resolve the pending motion are \nundisputed.  The dispute is rather the legal import of those facts.1  \n{6} Dart is a Louisiana attorney with substantial class action experience.  \nPrior to the October 5, 2006 explosion at the EQ facility in Apex, North Carolina on \nwhich the class action underlying this dispute had occurred, Dunn and Dart had \nworked together on a class action representing residents of Kinston, North Carolina \nwho were adversely affected by the 2003 explosion at the West Pharmaceutical \nplant.   They did so pursuant to a fee-sharing agreement by which Dart advanced \nall costs and they divided the fees two-thirds to Dart and one-third to Dunn.   \n{7} Very shortly after the EQ explosion, Dunn and Dart discussed potentially \nfiling a class action with claims similar to those in the Kinston class action and \npursuant to the same fee-sharing agreement. At this time, however, neither Dart \nnor Dunn had clients affected by the EQ explosion who could serve as class \n                                                 \n1  The Court does not adjudicate facts in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, and typically an \norder ruling on such a motion does not include a detailed recitation of facts.  However, such a \nrecitation is appropriate to elucidate the basis for the Court’s ruling.  See Capps v. City of Raleigh, \n35 N.C. App. 290, 292, 241 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1978). \nrepresentatives.  Dunn contacted Zaytoun to explore Zaytoun’s interest in \nassociating with Dart and Dunn on the basis that Dart would advance all costs and \nwould receive two-thirds of any fee, with Dunn and Zaytoun sharing equally in the \nremaining one-third fee.  Zaytoun represented two families who had claims arising \nfrom the EQ explosion – the Carleys and the Wilders. \n{8} Dart, Zaytoun, and Dunn filed a class action in the Eastern District of \nNorth Carolina on October 10, 2006 naming the Carleys and the Wilders as class \nrepresentatives. (“Carley” or the “Carley Action”).  A fourth attorney Allen Usry also \nappeared as counsel of record.2  Dunn contends that he, Dart, and Zaytoun had \norally agreed to the above fee-sharing arrangement prior to the filing of the action \nbut had not yet reduced the agreement to writing.  Dart and Zaytoun acknowledge \npreliminary negotiations but contend that no final agreement was ever \nconsummated.   Both parties rely on two e-mails to support their position. \n{9} Dunn contends that these two e-mails are a written confirmation of the \noral agreement the three had reached.3  On October 22, 2006, Zaytoun sent an e-\nmail to Dart, copied to Dunn, stating: \nIn view of the arrangement we have contemplated on fee \nsplit and cost-bearing as forecast by Donnie to me early \nlast week, Stacy and I would like to be sure that we are \nmoving forward on the basis that costs will be borne by \nHank’s firm (to what extent?, what expenses?); and the \nfee split will be 66 2/3 to Hank and we will split with \nDonnie 50-50 the remaining one-third. Is this correct? If \nso, I suggest that we put this in the form of a letter \nmemorandum of understanding. We also need to get fee \nagreements signed with our current clients this week.\n4  \n \nOn October 23, 2066, Dart sent the following response, copied to Dunn: \nI agree with your understanding of the fee split and cost \nresponsibility. I will be happy to memorialize that in a \nletter agreement and circulate it among us tomorrow.5  \n                                                 \n2 Defs.’ Ex. 1.  Plaintiff and Defendant each filed a substantial appendix in support of their \nmemoranda on the motion.   The Court will cite to those as “Pl.’s Ex. [ __ ]” and “Defs.’ Ex. [ __ ].” \n3 Defs.’ Ex. 22 at 18-19. \n4 Pl.’s Ex. 1. \n5 Pl.’s Ex. 2. \n \nThe parties never executed any other writing reflecting agreement to this fee \nproposal. There is no evidence that these e-mails were shared with the Carleys or \nthe Wilders.  \n {10} As of October 31, 2006, there was also apparently no final understanding \nof all attorneys that might share in fees, and specifically whether Allen Usry, who \nhad appeared on the Carley complaint, would be a party to the fee-sharing \nagreement.  Dunn wrote Dart and Zaytoun that day, advising that: “according to \nour ethical requirements, we need to know if Allen is going to participate.  Our \nethical rules require that the attorney fee contract identify all lawyers and their \npercentage of fee in a fee sharing arrangement.” 6  Dunn indicated in that e-mail \nthat he had drafted a fee agreement reflecting only Dart, Zaytoun and Dunn as \nparticipating counsel.7\n{11} Three class actions in addition to Carley were also filed in or removed to \nthe Eastern District.  On June 20, 2007, the Eastern District court issued a Case \nManagement Order consolidating all actions into the Beaulieu action, appointing \nthe PMC, and appointing Zaytoun as Liaison Counsel.  \n{12} All class representatives, including the Carleys and the Wilders, \nexecuted Supplemental Retainer Agreements with the PMC in November 2007.8  \nThese acknowledge that the class representatives are being represented by “one or \nmore of the above-mentioned attorneys . . . pursuant to a written attorney \nemployment contract,” and that the Supplemental Retainer Agreement does not \nalter or amend the contract except as set forth in paragraph 3, which states: \nI hereby retain the above-mentioned PMC and associated \nattorneys to represent me in all matters pertaining to \nclass certification and all common class issues after \ncertification . . . understand and agree that if a class-wide \nsettlement or judgment is obtained for a certified class in \n                                                 \n6 Defs.’ Ex. 33. \n7 Id. At oral argument, the parties indicated that this draft was not produced during discovery.  \nDunn indicated that he drafted the agreement, which appears to be disputed.  However, all agree \nthat such agreement, if drafted, was not signed. \n8 Defs.’ Ex. 4. \nwhich I am a member, the Court may establish and \nallocate a reasonable attorneys’ fee among my individual \nattorney, the PMC and associated attorneys, which may \nalter the contingent fee set forth in my current attorney’s \nemployment contract.9  \n \nThese Supplemental Retainer Agreements are the only fee agreements ever signed \nby the Carleys or the Wilders.     \n{13} Settlement discussions were underway in the class action in early 2008.  \nAt the time, the PMC members had not yet executed a PMC agreement, although \nDart and Zaytoun advocated such a written agreement.10   As negotiations between \nPMC members continued, Dart sent Dunn an e-mail on Sunday March 9, 2008 \nconcerning a separate agreement between the three, stating: \nDonny, Robert is getting nervous about not having an \nagreement among the 3 of us in writing, given that he’s \nspent about $40k on the case so far. Would you be able to \ncome up to Raleigh Tuesday before the mediation so the 3 \nof us can meet after the Deshong deposition and hammer \nout an agreement among the 3 of us?\n11\n \nDunn testified that he responded affirmatively to this e-mail, but the \nproposed meeting never took place.12  \n{14} Each PMC member executed a written agreement on May 30, 2008 \n(“PMC Agreement”).13  The PMC Agreement has multiple provisions which provide \nfor, inter alia, equalizing cost responsibility among PMC members,14 allocating \n                                                 \n9 Id. \n10 Defs.’ Ex. 34; Defs.’ Ex. 36. \n11 Defs.’ Ex. 31.  \n12 Defs.’ Ex. 22 at 40. \n13 Defs.’ Ex. 5. \n14 Defs.’ Ex. 5 ¶¶ 3-10.

Earl Britt approved a class \nsettlement for $7,850,000 in July 2009.  On October 9, 2009, Judge Britt approved \nattorney fees in the amount of $2,983,000.00, payable to class counsel, and \nreimbursement for costs in the amount of $322,241.50, retaining jurisdiction to \nresolve any payment dispute.17   \n{16} The PMC Fee Subcommittee undertook its effort to recommend the \nallocation of the court’s fee award.   Dunn requested that the Subcommittee allocate \nhim $350,000.00.18  The Fee Subcommittee submitted a narrative report containing \nthe following fee recommendation on November 10, 2009:19  \n \n {17} The PMC Agreement provided that the Fee Subcommittee \nrecommendation was binding only upon unanimous consent of all PMC members \nand provided that any PMC member agreed to submit an allocation dispute to \nbinding arbitration.20  On November 20, 2009, each of the PMC members demanded \n                                                 \n15Defs.’ Ex. 5.

Dart requested an allocation of $1,675,000, and \nZaytoun requested an allocation of $1,350,000.21 The PMC members filed a Motion \nto Compel Arbitration in the Eastern District on November 30, 2009.22  On \nDecember 2, 2009, Magistrate Judge Gates held a telephone conference with PMC \nmembers,23 followed by his December 4, 2009 order24 asking for briefing by \nDecember 18, 2009 on whether the court had authority to order arbitration and \nwhether, in lieu of arbitration, the dispute should be referred to a special master.  \nMagistrate Judge Gates also encouraged the parties to continue efforts to resolve \ntheir disputes. \n  {18} The PMC Members then undertook  further negotiations.  On December \n14, 2009, the PMC advised Magistrate Judge Gates that the parties had agreed to \nhave a special master appointed rather than proceeding with arbitration.  They did \nso by filing a stipulation which provided for a special master proceeding “exclusive \nof contract claims among fewer than all members of the PMC and arising \nindependent of the PMC Agreement.”25     Dunn sent an e-mail on December 15, \n2009 to Dart and Zaytoun asserting his position that he was entitled to enforce the \ninitial agreement he contends provides for a split of two-thirds of the fee to Dart, \n                                                 \n21 Defs.’ Ex. 21; Defs.’ Ex. 37.  \n22 Defs.’ Ex. 14. \n23 Defs.’ Ex. 15.   Prior to the December 2 hearing, Mike Malone, on behalf of the PMC, had \nrequested that the undersigned, who was then in private practice, serve as an arbitrator if there \nwere no conflict of interest.  He provided the names of the PMC members but no further information \nabout the details of any dispute and did not provide details regarding the allocation that was before \nJudge Gates.  Later, the undersigned was  advised that the matter would be subject to a special \nmaster proceeding rather than arbitration and that the undersigned would be appointed by \nMagistrate Judge Gates as a special master.   The undersigned was provided no further background \ninformation and undertook no substantive efforts before being advised that his services would not be \nneeded.   The undersigned never submitted any statement for services or expenses.  The undersigned \nwas later appointed as a judge to serve on the Business Court and the case was assigned to the \nundersigned. The parties were advised of this background and these circumstances and given an \nopportunity to have the case reassigned to another Business Court judge with the need for any \nfurther motion or grounds stated.  Each of the parties advised the court in writing and on the record \nat the hearing on the motion for summary judgment that they wished the undersigned to continue as \nthe judge assigned to the case.\n \n24 Defs.’ Ex. 16. \n25 Pl.’s Ex. 3. \nwith Zaytoun and Dunn sharing the remaining one-third.26  Dunn stated his \nexpectation of a $350,000.00 fee, and that he “did not care from whom it comes.”27   \n{19} PMC Members exchanged a series of e-mails on December 17 and 18, \n2009 in an effort to resolve disputes before the December 18, 2009 briefing deadline \nset by Magistrate Judge Gates.  These e-mails, in part, speak to whether individual \nfee contract disputes had been withdrawn from the proceeding before Magistrate \nJudge Gates, such that the matter before Magistrate Judge Gates was limited to \nwhether to approve the PMC Fee Subcommittee recommendation.   At 5:26 p.m. on \nDecember 17, 2009, Dart indicated that he would dismiss his claim if other PMC \nmembers did likewise.\n28   Dunn replied at 5:47 p.m., saying that he, too, would \nwithdraw his objection if all other PMC members did. 29 Zaytoun replied at 6:05 \np.m., indicating that he would not withdraw his objection “until I receive email \nconfirmation from Donnie Dunn that he has unconditionally withdrawn his \nobjection.”\n30  Dart sent an e-mail at 11:21 p.m. with a proposed consent motion and \norder, and stating Dart’s belief that individual rights to bring a separate lawsuit \nover alleged contractual agreements among PMC members were preserved.31  On \nthe morning of December 18, 2009, Dart wrote Roger Orlando, another PMC \nmember, indicating that, “[w]e specifically excluded side deals and private contract \nclaims from this process.”32  Orlando and some other PMC members had a side \nagreement which they resolved by an agreement that would provide that they \nreceive fees which collectively totaled the amount awarded to them in the PMC Fee \nSubcommittee allocation but which would be paid in individual amounts which \nvaried from that allocation.33\n                                                 \n26 Defs.’ Ex. 43.  \n27 Id. \n28 Pl.’s Ex. 5. \n29 Id. \n30 Id.

Prepare for battle.”35 At 11:43 a.m., \nDunn replied indicating that he was “considering withdrawing my objection to \ndisbursing, however, I will not have an answer until 3:30 today.” 36 At 3:24 pm, \nDunn sent an e-mail stating, “I hereby withdraw my objection to disbursement of \nfunds by the Court [and the settlement administrator] . . . Also, my withdrawal of \nmy objection to disbursement is done based on my specific reservation of any and all \nclaims I may have against Hank and Robert based on contractual agreements.”37  \n{21} The PMC filed its Unopposed Motion to Dismiss the Motion to Compel \nArbitration, To Approve Attorney’s Fee Allocation and for Distribution of Attorney’s \nFees at 4:11 p.m. on December 18, 2009, which was signed by each PMC member. \n(“Unopposed Motion”)38  In its accompanying memorandum, the PMC stated that:  \n“On 18 December 2009, all members of the PMC agreed to dismiss all objections to \nthe allocation of attorneys fees, to accept the allocation of attorneys’ recommended \nby the PMC Fee Sub-Committee (Exhibit A), and to request the immediate payment \nof those fees by the Settlement Administrator.” 39  The motion did not mention any \nside agreements or any dispute about such agreements. \n{22} Magistrate Judge Gates granted the Unopposed Motion on December 23, \n2009, reciting that the “memorandum supporting the motion states that the Class \nCounsel attorneys have resolved the previous disagreement among them regarding \nallocation of the awarded fees, which had prompted the motion to compel \narbitration, and that all Class Counsel attorneys agree to the allocation set out in \nExhibit A . . . There is no opposition of record to the proposed allocation.”\n40 \n                                                 \n34 Defs.’ Ex. 39.  \n35 Defs.’ Ex. 40. \n36 Defs.’ Ex. 41. \n37 Pl.’s Ex. 6.  \n38 Defs.’ Ex. 17. \n39 Defs.’ Ex. 18. \n40 Defs.’ Ex. 19. \nMagistrate Judge Gates cited Turner v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., 472 F. Supp. 2d 830, \n869-70 (E.D. La. 2007) for the proposition that final apportionment of court awarded \nfees can be left to class counsel who are able to come to an agreement.41   \n {23} Dunn filed this action in stat e court a few hours after the entry of \nMagistrate Judge Gate’s Order.   Dunn maintains that he agreed to the allocation \nbecause of his concern that further court proceedings might result in a reduction in \nthe total amount awarded to Dart, Zaytoun, and Dunn collectively, and that he \nbelieved that he had reserved his right to bring suit to ask for a percentage of the \ncollective award because disputes over side agreements had been removed from the \nmatter before Magistrate Judge Gates.42\n {24} Dart and Zaytoun removed the matter to the Eastern District and sought \nto have it consolidated with Beaulieu.   Dunn moved to remand.   After briefing, \nChief United States District Judge Flanagan remanded the matter to state court.43  \nDart and Zaytoun advised Judge Flanagan of the side agreement which Dunn \nasserts in this action, and argued that the issue should be resolved by the federal \ncourt, and specifically the Beaulieu court , because the dispute directly related to \nthat court’s jurisdiction over the common fund created by the class action \nsettlement.  In rejecting federal court jurisdiction, Judge Flanagan found that \nDunn’s claim “does not challenge the federal district court’s division of any fee,” and \n“[t]he determination of whether a separate fee-sharing agreement exists does not \nraise any such substantial federal question.”\n44  \n \nIV. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n \n           {25} The purpose of summary judgment is to dispense with formal trials in \ncases where only legal issues remain “by permitting penetration of an unfounded \nclaim or defense in advance of trial and allowing summary disposition for either \nparty when a fatal weakness in the claim or defense is exposed.” Elliott v. Duke \n                                                 \n41 Id. \n42 Pl.’s Br. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. at 4. \n43 Pl.’s Ex. 7.   \n44 Id. at 3-4. \nUniversity, Inc., 66 N.C. App. 590, 592, 311 S.E.2d 632, 634 (1984).  This Court \nmust decide, on the basis of the pleadings, depositions, and other evidentiary \nmaterials presented, whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and \nwhether the claim in question may be resolved as a matter of law. Stephenson v. \nWarren, 136 N.C. App. 768, 770-71, 525 S.E.2d 809, 811 (2000). The burden is on \nthe moving party to show that no genuine issues of fact exist, and it may be met “by \nproving that an essential element of the opposing party’s claim is nonexistent, or by \nshowing through discovery that the opposing party cannot produce enough evidence \nto support an essential element of his claim.” Elliott, 66 N.C. App. at 592, 311 \nS.E.2d at 634. Once this burden has been satisfied, “the burden shifts to the non-\nmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as \nopposed to allegations, establishing at least a prima facie case at trial.” Stephenson, \n136 N.C. App. at 772, 525 S.E.2d at 812. If the non-moving party fails to meet its \nburden, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. \n \nV. ANALYSIS \n \nA.  The Existence of a Fee-Sharing Agreement in the First Instance \n{26} Dunn alleges that the parties reached agreement on the essential terms \nof a percentage division of fees and expenses, confirmed by written e-mails, and that \nany additional term may be implied by the obligations attendant to the attorney-\nclient relationship.  Dart and Zaytoun urge that there is no evidence that there was \nnever final agreement to material terms, and that undisputed evidence \ndemonstrates that the parties expected a writing before reaching final agreement. \n{27} To form a contract, there must be “an assent to the same thing in the \nsame sense and [the parties’] minds must meet as to all the terms.” Miller v. Rose, \n138 N.C. App. 582, 587-88, 532 S.E.2d 228, 232 (2000). Mutual assent is not \ndetermined by what the “the party intended… but,” rather “what a reasonable \nperson” in the like position of the parties would have interpreted the offer and \nacceptance to represent. Howell v. Smith, 258 N.C. 150, 153, 128 S.E.2d 144, 146 \n(1962). Therefore, when determining if mutual assent is present, the Court \nconsiders the “expressed intention of the parties,” or more specifically, “their words \nand acts.”  Id.  Where the “evidentiary forecast” offered by the plaintiff indicates \nthat the parties failed to meet minds as to the essential terms of the agreement, \nsummary judgment in favor of the defendants is proper.” Miller, 138 N.C. App. at \n588, 532 S.E.2d at 232. Moreover, “[t]he terms of a contract must be sufficiently \ndefinite and certain.”  Id. Thus, when a contract “‘leaves material portions open for \nfuture agreement,” it fails for “indefiniteness” as a matter of law. Id. (quoting MCB \nLimited v. McGowan, 86 N.C. App. 607, 609, 359 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1987)).  \n{28} The October 2006 e-mail exchanges, read objectively, reflect an initial \nunderstanding as to fee and cost sharing provisions upon which the contemplated \nagreement would be negotiated; however, they also indicate the expectation of \nfurther negotiation and approval of a written agreement.   Dunn’s October 31, 2006 \ne-mail reflects that there was yet no final agreement on which attorneys would \nparticipate in the fee-sharing.  The negotiations were for a single action in which \nthese attorneys would be sole counsel, in contrast to the consolidated class action to \nwhich Dunn seeks to apply the agreement.  Even the March 9, 2008 e-mail several \nmonths later reflects that there were still terms to be fleshed out and reduced to \nwriting.  The Court concludes that the evidence does not indicate an assent by the \nparties to necessary material terms, but rather a contemplation of a future final \nagreement which was never reached.45  \n{29} The Court further notes that subsequent conduct casts doubt on whether \nthe parties believed that they had the agreement Dunn asserts.  Clearly, Dart did \nnot advance all costs.  Dunn’s request to repurchase financing shares so that he \nmight participate in that portion of fees as provided by the PMC Agreement \nsuggests that he believed that the PMC Agreement would control all fees.   Dunn \nmade no effort to insist on a separate retainer agreement with the Carleys and the \nWilders at the time of the Supplemental Retainer Agreements.  The Court believes \n                                                 \n45   If there were final agreement between the attorneys on all essential terms, the question would \nremain whether the agreement would be enforceable until reduced to writing and agreed to by the \nclients themselves.   That issue is discussed below.   \nthis pattern of conduct amplifies the lack of mutual assent to the fee-sharing \nagreement Dunn promotes.   \n{30} In sum, Dunn has not forecast sufficient evidence of an agreement to \njustify trial. Summary judgment is, therefore, appropriate on the ground that no \nbinding agreement was ever reached. \n  \nB. Application of North Carolina Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5 \n{31} While summary judgment might rest alone on the basis that there was \nno agreement, the Court also concludes that any agreement that may have been \nreached is not enforceable pursuant to North Carolina Rule of Professional Conduct \n1.5.   That Rule provides that “a division of a fee between lawyers who are not in the \nsame firm may be made only if . . . the client agrees to the arrangement, including \nthe share each lawyer will receive, and the agreement is confirmed in writing.” Rule \n1.5(e)(2) N.C.R.P.C.  Rather than speaking solely to enforcement, the Rule provides \nthat no contract is “made” absent the client agreement.   While Dunn offers what he \ncontends is written confirmation of an agreement among the three attorneys, he has \noffered no evidence of the approval of that agreement by the clients. \n{32} Further, a separate provision of the Rule requires that “a contingent fee \nagreement shall be in a writing, signed by the client, and shall state the method by \nwhich the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that \nshall accrue.” Rule 1.5(c) N.C.R.P.C.   Dunn was well aware of these constraints as \nevidenced by his own e-mail.46 Yet, clearly, there is here no written agreement \nsigned by the Carleys and/or Wilders assenting to the fee sharing agreement Dunn \nnow asserts.  There is no such issue with the PMC Fee Subcommittee allocation \napproved by the Eastern District.  The Carleys and Wilders acknowledged and \nagreed to that potential fee process when signing the Supplemental Retainer \nAgreements. \n {33} Dunn raises the question that the agreement he asserts is invalidated by \nRule 1.5 because the North Carolina courts have held that a “breach of a provision \n                                                 \n46 Defs.’ Ex. 33. \nof the Code of Professional Responsibility is not in and of itself . . . a basis for \nliability.” Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 0.2[7]; Baars v. Campbell Univ., Inc., \n148 N.C. App. 408, 421, 558 S.E.2d 871, 879 (2002); Webster v. Powell, 98 N.C. App. \n432, 439, 391 S.E.2d 204, 208 (1990), aff'd, 328 N.C. 88, 399 S.E.2d 113 (1991) \n(quoting McGee v. Eubanks, 77 N.C. App. 369, 374, 335 S.E.2d 178, 181 (1985), disc. \nreview denied, 315 N.C. 589, 341 S.E.2d 27 (1986)).  As Judge Ervin of the North \nCarolina Appeals explained in his well-reasoned opinion, this limitation on use of \nthe Rules of Conduct does not mean, however, that they “have utterly no bearing on \nthe proper resolution of civil litigation.” Cunningham v. Selman, 689 S.E.2d 517, \n529, 2009 N.C. App. LEXIS 2253 at *35-36 (N.C. App. 2009).47\n {34} Like the North Carolina Rule, th e ethical rules in most jurisdictions \nrequire that a client “agree” or “consent” to any fee division arrangement between \nattorneys of different firms, including the share each lawyer will receive, and the \nagreement to be confirmed in writing. ABA Model R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(e).  Other \njurisdictions have held that a violation of the rule renders the agreement \nunenforceable as matter of public policy. \nSee In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., \n818 F.2d 216, 7 Fed. R. Serv. 3d 1063 (2d Cir. 1987); Marcus v. Garland, Samuel & \nLoeb, P.C., 441 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1230 (S.D. Fla. 2006); Chambers v. Kay, 29 Cal. \n4th 142, 148-49, 56 P.3d 645, 649-50 (2002); Robinson v. Thornton, 705 So. 2d 745, \n748 (La. App. 3d Cir. 1997), writ denied, 709 So. 2d 739 (La. 1998); Anderson v. \nAnchor Org. for Health Maint., 274 Ill. App 3d 1001, 1011, 654 N.E.2d 675, 684 \n(1995). \n {35} The Court concludes that any fee- sharing agreement that Dart, Zaytoun, \nand Dunn may have reached is not enforceable absent compliance with Rule 1.5(e), \nand that the failure to comply with that rule can be raised as a defense to an action \n                                                 \n47 In Cunningham, the defendant client raised Rule 1.5(f) as a jurisdictional challenge to the action \nin Superior Court because the plaintiff attorney had not exhausted the administrative fee grievance \nproceeding.  The Court of Appeals allowed the jurisdictional challenge, finding that to “allow the \nplaintiff to violate a valid state bar rule to his own advantage by permitting a lawsuit to proceed \ndespite noncompliance with those rules and regulations would completely undercut “the efficiency, \neffectiveness, and purpose” of the State Bar’s rules. 689 S.E.2d at 529, 2009 N.C. App. LEXIS at *35-\n36.\n \nto enforce fee-sharing pursuant to such an agreement.   This would serve as an \nindependent basis for summary judgment. \n \n C.  Other Asserted Grounds for the Joint Motion\n     {36} Having determined summary judgment on other grounds, the Court need \nnot make a final determination as to other defenses raised, including novation and \nthe various equitable and claim preclusion defenses.  As to novation, the Court has \ndetermined that the initial agreement was itself never reached, so no question of \nsubstitution by novation occurs.  However, had such an agreement been reached, \nthe Court notes that the subsequent Supplemental Retainer Agreement expressly \nratified existing individual contracts while allowing for their terms to be modified \nby subsequent court orders approving attorney fees.  \n {37} As the equitable and claim pr eclusion defenses, the argument is \nessentially that all fee disputes should have been presented to Magistrate Judge \nGates and that his order is then final as to all disputes, particularly where his order \nwas based on the representation that agreements among PMC members had been \nresolved.   While the Court does not undertake a full analysis of these defenses,  \nthere are hurdles that would have to be overcome before the defenses could be \nsustained.  First, the December 14, 2009 stipulation indicated that separate side \nagreements were removed from the special master proceeding which had been \nsubstituted for arbitration.  Second, Judge Flanagan rejected the assertion that \nDunn’s claim was integrally tied to the federal court’s fee determination.\n48  \nHowever, the Court need not wrestle further with these issues in light of its ruling \non other issues which allow for summary adjudication. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n48 The Court also need not deal in this case with the difficult question of what obligation, if \nany, rested on any PMC member to disclose any side agreement as a part of the fee award \nproceeding. \nD  Dart’s Alternative Individual Motion for Summary Judgment  \n {38} Dart argues alternatively that th e claim against him should be dismissed \neven if the joint motion for summary judgment is denied.  In sum, Dunn argues that \nhe would actually be entitled to more of an award than he has, in fact, received \nshould the Court have enforced the agreement as Dunn promotes.  More \nspecifically, he urges that interpretation would yield Dart two-thirds of the total fee \naward of $1,740,000, which equals approximately $1,160,000 which is in excess of \nthe $995,000 he actually received pursuant to the allocation Magistrate Judge \nGates approved.   While the individual motion is moot in light of the grant of the \njoint motion, the Court believes that Dart’s individual position would have been \nwell taken as a basis for the award of summary judgment in his favor.  \n \nVI. CONCLUSION \n \n {39} For the reasons stated, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment and \nDefendant Dart’s Alternative Motion for Summary Judgment filed January 13, \n2011 is GRANTED and Plaintiff’s complaint is DISMISSED. \n \n This the 14th day of July, 2011. \n "
