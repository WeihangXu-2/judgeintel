  "raw_text": "W&W Partners, Inc. v. Ferrell Land Co., LLC, 2019 NCBC 44. \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nWAKE COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17-CVS-9998 \n \nW&W PARTNERS, INC. and CHASE \nPROPERTIES, INC., \n \n                                       Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nFERRELL LAND COMPANY, LLC; \nFERRELL INVESTMENTS LIMITED \nPARTNERSHIP; DAVID S. FERRELL; \nand LUANNE FERRELL ADAMS, \n \n                                      Defendants. \nORDER AND OPINION ON CROSS-\nMOTIONS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT \n \nTHIS MATTER comes before the Court on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment (“Plaintiffs’ Motion”, ECF No. 88), and Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment as to Plaintiffs’ First, Fifth, and Seventh Claims and Ferrell Land \nCompany, LLC’s Counterclaims (“Defendants’ Motion”, ECF No. 86) (tog ether, the \n“Summary Judgment Motions”).   \nTHE COURT, having considered the Summary Judgment Motions,  the \nevidentiary materials1 and briefs filed in support of and in opposition to the Summary \n                                                \n1 The Court notes that Plaintiffs did not meet the letter or  spirit of Business Court Rule \n(“BCR”) 7.5 in filing their supporting materials.  BCR 7.5 provides that “Materials that have \nbeen filed previously need not be re -filed, but the filing party should use specific references \nto the docket location of the previously filed materials to aid the Court. In selecting materials \nto be filed, parties should attempt to limit the use of voluminous materials.” In support of \nPlaintiffs’ Motion, Plaintiff  filed a document entitled “Index and Notice of Designation of \nMaterials in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Public Filing”).  (ECF No. \n90.)  This document was a single .pdf that consisted of over 3 ,400 pages, contained 184 \nseparate exhibits, and included what appeared to be the entire deposition trans cripts for \nmany of the deposed witnesses  though only a limited number of pages of testimony were \nreferenced.  The exhibits were not separately filed as sub -documents to the index, meaning \nthe entire 3,400 pages had to download from the docket before single exhibits could be viewed.  \nIn addition, Plaintiffs did not cite to a majority of those 184 exhibits in their briefs and, \n \n \nJudgment Motions, the arguments of counsel at the hearing, and o ther appropriate \nmatters of record, CONCLUDES, that the Plaintiffs’ Motion should be DENIED, and \nthe Defendants’ Motion should be GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part,  in the \nmanner and for the reasons set forth below.  \nGeorge B. Currin for Plaintiffs W&W Partners, Inc. and Chase Properties, Inc. \n \nK&L Gates LLP, by A. Lee Hogewood III, Margaret R. Westbrook, and Matthew \nT. Houston, for Defendants Ferrell Land Company, LLC; Ferrell Investments \nLimited Partnership; David S. Ferrell; and Luanne Ferrell Adams.  \n \nMcGuire, Judge.  \n \nI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions for \nsummary judgment.  See In re Estate of Pope, 192 N.C. App. 321, 329, 666 S.E.2d 140, \n147 (2008) (citation omitted).  The factual background contained herein, taken from \nthe evidence submitted in support of and in opposition to the Mot ion, is intended \nsolely to provide context for the Court’s analysis and ruling. \n                                                \ninstead, often relied upon documents filed in connection with Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to \nAmend the Second Amended Complaint,  (ECF No. 91), further expanding the scope of the \nrecord.   \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs have included the Management Agreement in this electronic \nrecord a total of ten (10) times.  Plaintiffs’ single .pdf document contained six (6) separate \ncopies of the Management Agreement, (ECF No. 90 at Exs. D2, E1, F1, G1, I3, K5), when it \nhad already been included in this record as an attachment to the original complaint, (ECF \nNo. 3), the first amended complaint, (ECF No. 9), the second amended complaint, (ECF No. \n13), and the affidavit of B. Kyle Ward, (ECF No. 21). \nThe filing of exhibits in this fashion makes its extraordinarily difficult and time  \nconsuming for the Court to navigate the record.  The Court asks that counsel be cognizant of \ntheir role in creating a helpful and manageable record. \n \n \n2. Plaintiff W&W Partners, Inc. (“W&W”) is a real estate development \ncompany.  Plaintiff Chase Properties, Inc. (“Chase”) is a real estate broker or agent.  \nCollectively, W&W and Chase are referred to herein as “Plaintiffs.” \n3. Defendant Ferrell Land Company, LLC (“FLC”) is a limited liability \ncompany formed on December 14, 1995, and is in the business of land development.  \nFormer Defendants David S. Ferrell (“David”), Luanne Ferrell Adams (“Luanne”)2, \nand their now -deceased father, Omer Ferrell (“Omer”), were the original managing \nmembers of FLC.  David and Luanne are the current managing members of FLC.  \n4. On May 13, 1998 , David, Luanne, and other Ferrell family relatives \nformed Defendant Ferrell Investments Limited Partnership (“Ferrell Investments”), \na landholding and investment company.  (D . Ferrell Aff., ECF No. 87.2, at ¶ 11.) \nDavid and Luanne are general and limited partners of Ferrell Investments.  ( Id. at \n¶ 16.)  FLC and Ferrell  Investments are separate entities: neither has equity in or \nmanages the other company, and the two companies conduct separate businesses.  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 12–16.)   \n5. On January 1, 1996, Plaintiffs and FLC entered into a Management, \nDevelopment and Exclusive Agency Agreement.  (Verif. Second Am. Compl., ECF No. \n13 at Ex. A (hereinafter “the Management Agreement” or the “Agreement”).)  Ferrell \nInvestments was not a party to the Management Agreement.   The Management \nAgreement provides that FLC “intends to acquire, develop, and market the real \nproperty described in Exhibit A [to the Management Agreement] (‘Land’) as lots for \n                                                \n2 All claims alleged against David and Luanne were dismissed by Order.  (ECF No. 65.)  \n \n \nresidential, commercial, office and retail development.”  (Id. at p. 1.)  Exhibit A to the \nManagement Agreement is a map or plat showing the specific real property subject \nto the Agreement (hereinafter, the real property depicted in Exhibit A to the \nManagement Agreement will be referred to as the “Land”).   FLC is identified as the \n“Owner” in the Management Agreement, but when the parties executed the \nAgreement FLC did not actually own any of the Land.  (ECF No. 87.2, at ¶ 26.)  \nHowever, much of the property was owned by Omer, Omer’s estate, and third parties.  \n(Id.)  The developed Land was to be known as “the Carpenter Village Planned Unit \nDevelopment” (hereinafter the developed Land will be referred to as “the \nDevelopment”).  (ECF No. 13, at ¶ 9.) \n6. In the Management Agreement, W&W  agreed to develop the real \nproperty, including “obtaining entitlements, permitting, zoning, rezoning, site plan \napproval, and other customer development tasks [.]”  (Id. at ¶ 10.)  Chase agreed to \nmarket and sell the property.  ( Id.)  The Management Agreement pro vided that \nPlaintiffs would be compensated for their services as follows: \n(a) FLC agreed to pay W&W a “Construction Management Fee” on a monthly \nbasis equal to  5% of the “hard costs” of the improvement to the real \nproperty.  Hard costs are defined as  \nthe Foreman Cost and the costs of installation of all \nImprovements including, but not limited to, curbs, gutters, \nstreets, sidewalks, water, sanitary and storm sewers, \nentrances (including signs, landscaping and other \nbeautification), common area improvements and amenities \nincluding the Recreation Center.  Specifically included are \nthe following:  architectural, engineering and planning \n \n \ncosts, permits and licenses and application fees directly \nrelated to the Project.  \n(Id. at Ex. A, pp. 10–11);  \n(b) FLC agreed to compensate Chase by payment of a brokerage fee  of either \n5% of the “sales price of all Residential Land,” and a brokerage fee of 6% on \n“the sales price of all Commercial Property ,” “upon the sale and closing of  \nsuch property.” (Id. at p. 11); and \n(c) FLC agreed to pay W&W “[a]s compensation for [W&W]’s overall services \nto be provided hereunder, . . .  20% of the net profits of the Project.”  (Id. at \np. 11.) \n7. The property was to be developed parcel-by-parcel in 19 “Phases.”  (ECF \nNo. 13, at ¶ 11.)  The parties prepared and attached to the Management Agreement \npro forma “Project Expense” statements estimating the projected costs for \ndevelopment, marketing, and sale for each of the 19 Phases.  (Pro Forma Statements, \nECF No. 13, at Ex. C.) \n8. As part of the Management Agreement, W&W and its individual owners \nagreed to certain restrictions on their right to develop and manage property within \ntwo miles of the boundary line of the Land. Specifically, they agreed to refrain from \ndeveloping or managing “any real pro perty that is to be developed as a ‘Neo \ntraditional’ subdivision within the area located within a two (2) mile radius of the \nboundary lines of the Land without the prior written consent of Owner, which may \nbe granted or withheld at the sole discretion of Owner.”  (ECF No. 13 at Ex. A, p. 9.) \n \n \n9. Shortly after execution of the Management Agreement, FLC instructed \nW&W to commence the rezoning and development of the Land, and W&W did so.  (D. \nFerrell Depo., ECF No. 90 at Ex. G, pp. 23–25.)  FLC subsequently acquired, over a \nnumber of years, the parcels for Phases 1–17, and portions of Phases 18 and 19. (ECF \nNo.  13, at ¶ 12.)  Pursuant to  the Management Agreement, Plaintiffs developed, \nmarketed, and sold Phases 1–17, and the acquired portions of Phases 18 and 19.  FLC \ndid not acquire the remaining portions of Phases 18 and 19. ( Id. at ¶¶ 23 –24.)  \nHereinafter, the portions of Phases 18 and 19 that FLC did not acquire are referred \nto as “the Disputed Property.”  David lived on the Disputed Property at the time the \nManagement Agreement was executed.  (ECF No. 13, at ¶ 30.)   \n10. On or around July 2, 1998, Betty Lou Ferrell, wife to Omer and mother \nto David and Luanne,  transferred the Disputed Property to Ferrell Investments. \n(ECF No. 90 at Ex. G, pp. 252–55.)  It is unclear whether Ferrell Investments made \nany payment to Betty Lou Ferrell for the Disputed Property.  (Id.)  \n11. In March 2002, David asked Plaintiffs to enter into an amendment of \nthe Management Agreement to explicitly exclude the Disputed Property from the \nLand.  (ECF No. 13, at ¶ 31; ECF No. 13 at Ex. E (hereinafter the “Proposed \nAmendment”).)  The Proposed Amendm ent changed the definition of the “Land” in \nthe Management Agreement to state as follows: \n \n \nThe term Land shall not include any of the ‘Excluded Land’ \nidentified on Exhibit A or any other property not expressly \nlisted on Exhibit A. Any property not included herein \nwhich may in the future be identified, considered or \npurchased for incorporation into the Carpenter Village \nPUD shall not be subject to the terms of this Agreement \nunless expressly added to this Agreement by written \namendment executed by both parties. \n(ECF No. 13 at Ex. E, p. 2 (emphasis in original).)  The Proposed Amendment defined \n“Excluded Land” as “[a]ny property  now owned by [Ferrell Investments] on the north \nside of Morrisville -Carpenter Road . . . [and] certain property under contract with \nWake County School Board owned by [David] and [Luanne] and [ Ferrell \nInvestments][.]” ( Id. at p. 21.)  Plaintiffs refused to agree to the Proposed \nAmendment.  (ECF No. 13, at ¶ 31.) \n12. On July 3, 2003, the parties entered into an amendment to the \nManagement Agreement.  (ECF No. 13, at Ex. B (hereinafter, “the Amendment”).)  \nThe Amendment, which was purportedly to “clarify the terms of the [Management] \nAgreement,” provided that FLC “shall acquire” a discreet part of the Land described \nin the Management Agreement; set the acquisition cost for that part of the land for \npurposes of calculating W&W’s share of the net profits; and provided that “except as \nexpressly amended . . . the [Management] Agreement is hereby reaffirmed in all \nregards.”  (ECF No. 13, at Ex. B.)  The Amendment did not change the definition of \nthe Land. \n13. In December 2016, Plaintiffs learned that Ferrell Investment s had \nentered into a contract to sell the Disputed Property to a third -party.  (ECF No. 13, \nat ¶ 32.)  Plaintiffs demanded that FLC acquire the Disputed Property  from Ferrell \n \n \nInvestments, but to date FLC has refused.  ( Id. at ¶ 40.)  Plaintiffs allege that FLC \nbreached the Management Agreement by refusing to acquire the Disputed Property.  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 45 –46.)  Defendants also refused to permit Plaintiffs to participate in the \ndevelopment, marketing, or sale of the Disputed Property.  (Id. at ¶ 41.)   \n14. Plaintiffs allege that “David [ ] and Luanne [ ], as managers of [FLC] \nand partners of [ Ferrell Investment s] are refusing to perform [FLC]’s obligations \n[under the Management Agreement] in order to personally realize a higher profit \nfrom the sale of [the Disputed Property] and to deprive [W&W] and Chase of the \nbenefit of their bargain under the [Management Agreement].”  ( Id. at ¶  42.)  FLC \ncontends that the Management Agreement does not obligate FLC to acquire any of \nthe Land, including the Disputed Property, but o nly provides that if FLC acquires \nany or all of the Land, Plaintiffs shall have the right to develop, market, and sell such \nproperty.  (ECF No. 87, at p. 10.) \n15. On August 18, 2017, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint in this action.  (ECF \nNo. 3.)  Plaintiffs subsequently filed an Amended Complaint on September 29, 2017, \n(ECF No. 9), and a verified3 Second Amended Complaint on October 27, 2017.  (ECF \nNo. 13.)  The Second Amended Complaint alleges claims for: breach of contract \nagainst FLC for failure to acquire the Disputed Property (“First Cause of Action”) (Id. \nat ¶¶ 43–47); specific performance against all Defendants (“Second Cause of Action”) \n(Id. at ¶¶ 48–52); piercing the corporate veil against all Defendants (“Third Cause of \nAction”) (Id. at ¶¶ 53–61); unfair and deceptive trade practices against all Defendants \n                                                \n3 Plaintiffs filed verification of the SAC on February 12, 2018.  (ECF No. 48.) \n \n \n(“Fourth Cause of Action”)  (Id. at ¶¶ 62 –65); constructive trust against Ferrell \nInvestments (“Fifth Cause of Action”)  (Id. at ¶¶ 66–68); breach of listing agreement \ncontained in the Master Agreement against FLC and David (“Sixth Cause of Action”)  \n(Id. at ¶¶ 69–78); and breach of contract against FLC for failure to pay W&W the “net \nprofits” as calculated by the Management Agreement (“Seventh Cause of Action”) (Id. \nat ¶¶ 79–84). \n16.   On December 29, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction.  (ECF No. 20.)  On March 8, 2018 the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction.  (Order on Pls.’ Mot. for PI, ECF No. 61.) \n17. FLC brought counterclaims for breach of th e Management Agreement \nfor W&W’s failure to comply with essential terms; breach of the implied covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing; and for attorneys’ fees.  (Defs.’ Answ. and CC, ECF No. \n25.)  FLC subsequently voluntarily dismissed its claims for breach of the Agreement \nand breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  (ECF No. 120.)  \nFLC’s only remaining counterclaim is for attorneys’ fees. \n18. On December 29, 2017 , Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss C laims \nOne through Five and Seven of Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint  (“Motion to \nDismiss”).  (ECF No. 23.)  In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants sought, inter alia, \ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ claim that FLC breached the Management Agreement by \nfailing to acquire the Land (First Cause of Action).  (Id.)  On May 22, 2018 the Court \nentered an Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Second Amended \nComplaint (“SAC”).  (“Order on Motion to Dismiss”, ECF No. 65; W & W Partners, Inc. \n \n \nv. Ferrell Land Co., LLC , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 52  (N.C. Super. Ct. May 22, 2018) .)  \nRegarding Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action the Court concluded “ that the \nManagement Agreement does not unambiguously establish that FLC was not \nobligated to acquire the Land, including the Disputed Property, for development and \nsale by Plaintiffs” and denied Defendants’ motion to dismiss the First Cause of Action \nfor breach of contract . Id. at *20–21.  In the Order on Motion to Dismiss, the Court \ndismissed Plaintiffs’ claims for specific performance ( Second C ause of Action) , \npiercing the corporate veil  (Third Cause of Action) , and unfair and deceptive trade \npractices (Fourth Cause of Action). \n19. Plaintiffs subsequently voluntarily dismissed their claims for breach of \nthe listing agreement (Sixth Cause of Action) and breach of contract as it applied to \nunpaid portions of the net profits from the sale of Phases 1 through 1 7 and portions \nof Phases 18 and 19  (Seventh Cause of Action) . (ECF No. 119.)  Following the \ndismissals, Plaintiffs’ only claims remaining for disposition are the claims for breach \nof contract for failure to acquire the Disputed Property ( First Cause of Action ) and \nfor constructive trust (Fifth Cause of Action). \n20. On March 1, 2019, Plaintiffs filed a  Motion for Leave to Amend Second \nAmended Complai nt seeking to reallege their dismissed claims for piercing the \ncorporate veil and for unfair and deceptive trade practices.  (“Motion to Amend”, ECF \nNo. 91.)  On April 23, 2019, following briefing by the parties, the Court denied the \nMotion to Amend.  (ECF No. 108.) \n \n \n21. On March 1, 2019, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all of its \nremaining claims and on all of FLC’s counterclaims.  (Pls.’ Mot. for SJ, ECF No. 88.)  \nPlaintiffs’ Motion has been fully briefed.  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. for SJ, ECF No. 89; \nDefs.’ Br. Opp. Pls.’ Mot. for SJ, ECF No. 104; Pls.’ Reply Supp. Mot. for SJ, ECF No. \n105.)  However, FLC subsequently dismissed its counterclaims for breaches of the \nManagement Agreement. (ECF No. 120.)  Plaintiffs make no separate argument for \ndismissal of FLC’s remaining counterclaim for attorneys’ fees.  For that reason, \nPlaintiffs’ Motion on FLC’s counterclaims is DENIED as MOOT.   \n22. On March 1, 2019, Defendants filed Defendants’ Motion.  (Defs.’ Mot. for \nSJ, ECF No. 86.)  Defendants’ Motion is fully bri efed.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. for SJ, \nECF No. 87; Pls.’ Br. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. for S J, ECF No. 103;  Defs.’ Reply Supp. Mot. \nfor SJ, ECF No. 106.)   \n23. The Court held a hearing on the Motions on May 15, 2019.  Plaintiffs’ \nand Defendants’ Motions on Plaintiffs’ two remaining claims for breach of the \nAgreement (First Cause of Action) and constructive trust (Fifth Cause of Action), are \nripe for determination. \nII. ANALYSIS \n24. “Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and ad missions on file, together with affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that any party is entitled to \njudgment as matter of law.”  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic \nServs., LLC, 365 N.C. 520, 523, 723 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2012).  An issue is “material” if \n \n \n“resolution of the issue is so essential that the party against whom it is resolved may \nnot prevail.”  McNair v. Boyette, 282 N.C. 230, 235, 192 S.E.2d 457, 460 (1972).  The \nmoving party bears “the burden  of clearly establishing lack of a triable issue to the \ntrial court.”  N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sadler, 365 N.C. 178, 182, 711 S.E.2d \n114, 116 (2011) (quotation marks omitted).  The moving party may meet this burden \nby “proving an essential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot \nbe proven at trial, or would have been barred by an affirmative defense.”  Variety \nWholesalers, Inc., 365 N.C. at 523, 723 S.E.2d at 747. All evidence is viewed in the \nlight most favorable to the nonmo ving party with the benefit of all reasonable \ninferences.  Bruce-Terminix Co. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 130 N.C. App. 729, 733, 504 S.E.2d \n574, 577 (1998). \n25. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required \nshowing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving pa rty to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784−85, \n534 S.E.2d 660, 664 (2000).  As recently reit erated by the North Carolina Court of \nAppeals, the burden on the non-movant goes beyond merely producing some evidence \nor a scintilla of evidence in support of its claims. Rather,  \n \n \n[i]f the movant meets [its] burden, the nonmovant must \ntake affirmative steps to set forth specific facts showing the \nexistence of a genuine issue of material fact. An adverse \nparty may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of \nhis pleading. A genuine issue of material fact is one that \ncan be maintained by substantial evid ence. Substantial \nevidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion and \nmeans more than a scintilla or a permissible inference. \nKhashman v. Khashman, 2017 N.C. App. LEXIS 715, at *15 (Sept. 5, 2017) (citations \nand internal quotation marks and modifiers omitted). \n26. The Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83, 530 S.E.2d at 835.  However, the nonmovant \n“may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, \nby affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  If [the nonmovant] does not so \nrespond, summary judgment, if a ppropriate, shall be entered against [the \nnonmovant].”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(e). \n27. This case has been distilled, through motions practice and voluntary \ndismissals, to a dispute over Plaintiffs’ claim that FLC breached the Management \nAgreement by failing to acquire the Disputed Property.  Both parties seek summary \njudgment on Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of the Management Agreement.  Defendants \nfirst contend the claim for breach of the Management Agreement is barred by the \nstatute of limitations.  (ECF No. 87, at pp. 5–8.)  Plaintiffs argue that the First Cause \nof Action is timely under the ten-year limitations period applicable to the claim.  (ECF \nNo. 103, at pp. 2–9.) \n \n \n28. Alternatively, Defendants argue that the unambiguous terms of the \nAgreement establish that FLC was not obligated to acquire any of the Land, and that \nPlaintiffs’ obligations to develop, market, and sell property in the Development only \narose if FLC chose to acquire portions of the Land. (ECF No. 87, at pp. 10–18.) \n29. On the other hand, Plaintiffs argue that the Management Agreement, \ninterpreted as a whole, unambiguously created an implied obligation on FLC to \nacquire or “make reasonable efforts to acquire” all of the Land, including the Disputed \nProperty.  (ECF No. 89, at pp. 4 –11.)  Plaintiffs contend FLC’s failure to acquire or \nattempt to acquire the Disputed Property breached the Management Agreement. (Id.) \n30. Plaintiffs also argue that, if the Court concludes that the Management \nAgreement is ambiguous, the undisputed facts surrounding the negotiation and \nperformance of the Agreement establish as a matter of law that it was the intent of \nthe parties that FLC be required to acquire the Lan d or make good faith efforts to \nacquire the Land.  (ECF No. 89, at pp.  11–12.) \nA. Defendants’ Statute of Limitations Arguments \n31. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action for breach of the \nManagement Agreement is barred by the statute of limitations.  (ECF No. 87, at pp. \n5–8.)  It is undisputed that the agreement was signed under seal and, consequently, \nthe claim for breach of the Agreement is governed by the ten -year statute of \nlimitations set forth in N.C.G.S. § 1-47(2).  This lawsuit was filed on August 8, 2017.  \nAccordingly, to be time-barred, Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract would have to  \nhave accrued before August 8, 2007. \n \n \n32. Defendants argue that FLC put Plaintiffs on notice that Defendants did \nnot believe the Disputed Property was subject to the Agreement in 1997 and in 2002—\nmore than ten years before Plaintiffs filed this action.4  Defendants contend that these \nnotices were anticipatory repudiations, and consequently breaches, of the \nManagement Agreement. (ECF No. 87, at pp. 5 –8.)  A breach of contract “may . . . \noccur by repudiation.”  D.G. II, LLC v. Nix , 211 N.C. App. 332, 338, 712 S.E.2d 335, \n340 (2011) (quoting Profile Invs. No. 25, LLC v. Ammons East Corp., 207 N.C. App. \n232, 236, 700 S.E.2d 232, 235 (2010)).   “Repudiation is a positive statement by one \nparty to the other party indicating that [they] will no or cannot substantially perform \n[their] contractual duties.”  Id.  However, \n[f]or repudiation to result in a breach of contract, the \nrefusal to perform must be of the whole contract or of a \ncovenant going to the whole consideration, and must be \ndistinct, unequivocal, and absolute[.] Furthermore, even a \ndistinct, unequivocal, and absolute refusal to perform is not \na breach unless it is treated as such by the adverse party.   \nUpon repudiation, the non -repudiating party may at once \ntreat it as a breach of the  entire contract and bring his \naction accordingly.  Thus, breach by repudiation depends \nnot only upon the statements and actions of th e allegedly \nrepudiating party but also upon the response of the non -\nrepudiating party. \nD.G. II, LLC, 211 N.C. App. at 338–39, 712 S.E.2d 335, 340–41 (quoting Prolive Invs. \nNo. 25, LLC , 207 N.C. App. at 237, 700 S.E.2d at 235 –36) (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted). \n                                                \n4 Defendants also argue that statements made by Plaintiffs’ attorneys in correspondence with \nDefendants’ counsel in 2013 and 2014 were repudiations of the Agreement.  Since the Court \nhas determined that a ten-year limitations period applies to the claim , it need not address \nthe arguments regarding the 2013 and 2014 correspondence. \n \n \n33. Defendants claim that David informed Plaintiffs of FLC’s position that \nthe Disputed Property was not part of the Agreement and that FLC was not obligated \nto purchase the Disputed Property in a meeting held with Plaintiffs in 1997.  (Ferrell \nDepo., ECF No. 90 at Ex. G, pp. 223–25.)  In his deposition, David testified that “we \nmade [Plaintiffs] aware in the late fall  [of 1996] or early spring of 1997 that we did \nnot believe that the north side [Disputed Property] was a part of the \nagreement . . . [i]t was in a meeting.”  ( Id. at pp.  223, 224 –25.)  Plaintiffs deny that \nDavid Ferrell told them that FLC did not believe that the Disputed Property was part \nof the Agreement position in 1997.  (D. Ward Aff., ECF No. 103.1, at ¶ 6; M. Hunt er \nAff., ECF No. 103.2, at ¶ 10.)  To the contrary, Plaintiffs provided evidence  that \n“W&W performed development work within the Disputed Property after 1997 and \nwith the encouragement of FLC.   Plaintiffs would never have performed work \npertaining to the D isputed Property unless it was understood and agreed that the \nDisputed Property was part of and subject to the Agreement.”  (ECF No. 103.2, at \n¶ 10.)  Accordingly, the question of whether David notified Plaintiffs in 1997 that FLC \ndid not believe the Dispu ted Property was part of the Agreement , thereby \nanticipatorily repudiating the Management Agreement, is in dispute. \n34. Defendants also contend that they repudiated the Management \nAgreement in 2002. (ECF No. 87, at pp. 6 –7.)  It is undisputed that in March 200 2, \nFLC proposed that the parties enter into an amended agreement that expressly \nremoved the Disputed Property from the Land. (ECF No. 90, at Ex. M.) Plaintiffs \nadmit that in conjunction with presenting the proposed amended agreement, David \n \n \ntold Plaintiffs that FLC did not believe the Disputed Property was covered by the \nManagement Agreement.  (Michael Hunter Dep., ECF No. 87.5, at p. 56.)  However, \nPlaintiffs told David that they disagreed with FLC’s position.  (Id.)   \n35. The proposed amended agreement and David’s statement were not  a \nrepudiation of the Management Agreement.  First, FLC’s claim that the Disputed \nProperty was not covered by the Agreement was not a disavowal of the entire \nAgreement, but only the obligations regarding the Disputed Property.  Edwards v. \nProctor, 173 N.C. at 44, 91 S.E. at 585 (holding that, to be a repudiation, “the refusal \nto perform must be of the whole contract or of a covenant going to the whole \nconsideration”).  \n36. Second, “[i]n order to maintain a claim for antici patory breach, the \nwords or conduct evidencing the renunciation or breach must be a ‘positive, distinct, \nunequivocal, and absolute refusal to perform the contract’ when the time fixed for it \nin the contract arrives.”  Messer v. Laurel Hill Assoc. , 93 N.C. App. 439, 443, 378 \nS.E.2d 220, 223 (1989 ).  David’s notice to Plaintiffs that FLC did not consider the \nDisputed Property to be subject to the Agreement was not an unequivocal statement \nthat FLC would never acquire the Disputed Property, but merely an expre ssion of \nFLC’s position regarding its interpretation of one part of the Agreement. \n37. Finally, it is undisputed that Plaintiffs did not choose to treat the \nproposed amended agreement or David’s statements  as a repudiation  in 2002 .  A \nrepudiation is a breach of the contract only when the non-breaching party chooses to \ntreat it as a breach.  Gordon v. Howard, 94 N.C. App. 149, 153, 379 S.E.2d 674, 676 \n \n \n(1989) (“The renunciation [of the contract] itself does not ipso facto  constitute a \nbreach. It is not a breach of the contract unless it is treated as such by the adverse \nparty.”).  Instead, Plaintiffs continued to perform under the Management Agreement \nthrough 2017 or 2018. \n38. Therefore, Defendants have failed to present undisputed eviden ce that \nthey breached the Management Agreement prior to August 8, 2007, and they are not \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on their arguments that the statute of \nlimitations bars Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action for breach of the Agreement. \nB. First Cause of Action: Breach of Contract \n39.   Plaintiffs and Defendants all argue that the Management Agreement \nis unambiguous and each seek summary judgment in their favor on Plaintiffs’ First \nCause of Action  for breach of Management Agreement.  Defendants argue that the \nManagement Agreement states only that FLC “intends” to acquire the Land but does \nnot obligate FLC to acquire the Land.  Plaintiffs contend that the language and terms \nof the Agreement, considered as a whole, unambiguously create an obligation on FLC \nto acquire all of the Land, including the Disputed Property, or make their best efforts \nto acquire it. \n40. The Court previously concluded that the Management Agreement was \nambiguous regarding the question of whether FLC was required to acquire the Land \nin the Order on Motion to Dismiss. W & W Partners, Inc., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 52 , at \n*20–21.  “Whether or not the language of a contract is ambiguous [ ] is a question for \nthe court to determine.”  Lynn v. Lynn, 202 N.C. App. 423, 432, 689 S.E.2d 198, 205 \n \n \n(2010).  “It is the general law of contracts that the purport of a written instrument is \nto be gathered from its four corners, and the four corners are to be ascertained from \nthe language used in the instrument.”  Carolina Power & Light Co. v. Bo wman, 229 \nN.C. 682, 693–94, 51 S.E.2d 191, 199 (1949).  \n41. Neither Plaintiffs nor Defendants moved the Court to reconsider Order \non Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 54(b).  See N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 54(b) (stating \nthat interlocutory orders are “subject to revision at any time before the entry of \njudgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties”).  \nHowever, Plaintiffs and Defendants raised some arguments regarding the Summary \nJudgment Motions not raised at the motion to dismiss stage . “A motion for \nreconsideration is not a vehicle to identify facts or legal arguments that could have \nbeen, but were not, raised at the time the  [motion to dismiss] was pending .”  W4 \nFarms, Inc. v. Tyson Farms, Inc. , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 99, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. \n19, 2017) (quoting Julianello v. K-V Pharm. Co., 791 F.3d 915, 923 (8th Cir. 2015)) \n(quotation marks omitted).  E ven if the Court were inclined to reconsider its prior \nruling, it is unpersuaded by the new arguments and concludes that the reasoning \napplied in the Order of Motion to Dismiss remains  apposite, and finds it controlling \nas to the Motions for Summary Judgment.  2018 NCBC LEXIS 52, at *17–21. \n42. The Court now turns to the evidence of the parties’ intent.   Plaintiffs \ncontend that, “[s]hould the Court be unable to determine from the Agreement itself \nthat the parties intended to impose on FLC the obligation to acquire the Land, the \nforecast of undisputed evidence establishes such intention. ” (ECF No. 89, at pp. 11 –\n \n \n12.)  In contrast, Defendants claim, “if the Court resorts to extrinsic evidence, there \nare genuine issues of disputed fact ” regarding the parties’ intent.  (ECF No. 104, at \np. 18.) In this case, the facts about the parties’ intentions and understandings about \nwhether the Management Agreement obligated FLC to acquire the Land  are hotly \ndisputed.  \n43. Defendants presented evidence supporting its claim that the parties \nalways understood the words “intends to acquire” to mean that FLC had the \n“prerogative” to choose whether and whic h land to include in the Management \nAgreement, (L. Adams Depo., ECF No. 90  at Ex. A, p. 36); that the Ferrell family \n“never intended on selling” the Disputed Property, (ECF No. 90 at Ex. G, p. 222); and \nthat David communicated as much to Plaintiffs sometime in the Spring of 1997, (Id. \nat p. 223).  Defendants also elicited testimony from Michael Hunter, being deposed \nas the Rule 30(b)(6) representative for W&W Partners and Chase, that the word \n“intends” generally can mean the person intending to do something can change their \nmind later.  (M. Hunter Depo., ECF No. 87.5, at p. 50 (“Q: If you intend to do \nsomething, can you change your mind? . . . A: Sure. It doesn’t make it right.”).)  \nSeconds later in that same deposition, Michael Hunter testified that he believed that \nan intention was synonymous with a requirement.  (Id. (“Q: Does an intention mean \nyou have to do it?  A: Absolutely.”)) \n44. On the other hand, Plaintiffs presented evidence that the parties \nunderstood FLC was obligated to acquire the Land, and that this basic understanding \nunderlies the entirety of the Management Agreement.  (Ward Aff., ECF No. 103.2, at \n \n \n¶¶ 4, 11, 14; M. Hunter Depo., ECF No. 87.5, at pp. 60–61, 67.)  Plaintiffs also argue \nDavid Ferrell’s Notice to Proceed on March 28, 1996 instructing W&W to begin the \nrezoning and development of the Land before FLC had acquired the Land, supports \nits claim that David Ferrell understood that FLC was obligated under the Agreement \nto acquire that land.  (ECF No. 89, at p. 12  ( citing D. Ferrell Depo., ECF No. 90 at \nEx. G., pp. 21 –25).)  Plaintiffs also presented circumstantial evidence of the Ferrell \nfamily’s intent to obligate FLC to acquire all of the Land, such as: inclusion of the \ntotal 368.79 acres in Carpenter Village in the estimated project costs, which includes \nthe Disputed Property , and David Ferrell’s signature on a document representing \nthat FLC was the owner of approximately 400 acres of land in Wake County being \ndeveloped as Carpenter Village, (ECF No. 90 at Ex. G, pp. 43–44.)  \n45. “If an agreement is ambiguous, . . . , and the intention  of the parties is \nunclear, interpretation of the contract is for the jury.”  Cleland v. Children’s Home, \nInc., 64 N.C. App. 153, 156, 306 S.E.2d 587, 589 (1983) (citing Silver v. Board of \nTransportation, 47 N.C. App. 261, 270, 267 S.E.2d 49, 55 (1980)).  “[Where] a genuine \nissue of material fact exists in regard to the intention of the parties, summary \njudgment [is] not appropriate.”  Id. at 157, 306 S.E.2d at 590. \n46. In the face of conflicting evidence, the Court is unable to determine as a \nmatter of law the intent of the parties as to whether the Agreement obligated FLC to \nacquire any of the Land  as a matter of law .  Accordingly, the Motions for Summary \nJudgment on Plaintiffs’ first claim for breach of contract should be DENIED.  \n \n \nC. Fifth Cause of Action: Constructive Trust \n47. For a fifth cause of action, Plaintiffs seek a constructive trust over the \nproceeds of the sale of the Disputed Property that is in the hands of Ferrell \nInvestments.  (ECF No. 13, at ¶¶ 66 –68.)  “When a court impresses a  constructive \ntrust upon property for the benefit of a claimant, it exercises its equitable powers to \nfashion remedies.”  Weatherford v. Keenan, 128 N.C. App. 178, 179, 493 S.E.2d 812, \n813 (1997).  “[A] constructive trust is not a standalone claim for relief or cause of  \naction.”  LLG-NRMH, LLC v. Northern Riverfront Marina & Hotel, LLLP , 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 105, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, 2018) (citing Weatherford as quoted \nherein). \nA constructive trust is a duty, or relationship, imposed by \ncourts of equity to prevent the unjust enrichment of the \nholder of title to, or of an interest in, property which such \nholder acquired through fraud, breach of duty or some \nother circumstance making it inequitable for him to retain \nit against the claim of the beneficiary of the  constructive \ntrust. \nVariety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs., LLC , 365 N.C. 520, 530, \n723 S.E.2d 744, 751 (2012) (quoting Wilson v. Crab Orchard Dev. Co., 276 N.C. 198, \n211, 171 S.E.2d 873, 882 (1970).   “In the absence of [a fiduciary] relationship, [the \nplaintiff] face s the difficult task of proving some other circumstance making it \ninequitable for” for a defendant to possess the property at issue.  Id. at 520–31, 723 \nS.E.2d at 752 (quotation omitted). \n48. Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on their  \nrequest for a constructive trust because,  \n \n \n[s]hould the Court conclude that FLC breached the \nAgreement and its contractual duty of good faith owed to \nPlaintiffs, . . . it is indisputable that [Ferrell Investments], \nand David and Luanne, would be unjustly enriched if they \nare allowed to retain the proceeds (or exchanged property) \nthey received as a result of their breach of duty to \nPlaintiffs.   \n(ECF No. 89, at p. 23.)  The Court has concluded that Plaintiffs are not entitled to \nsummary judgment on their claim for breach of the Management Agreement.  \nAccordingly, to the extent it seeks judgment i n Plaintiffs’ favor on the request for a \nconstructive trust, Plaintiffs’ Motio n should be DENIED.  Azure Dolphin, LLC v. \nBarton, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 90, at *29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 2, 2017) (“Having \ndismissed all of Plaintiffs’ underlying causes of action, the Court also grants the \nmotion to dismiss the[ ] remedial claim[  of constructive trust].”). \n49. Defendants also seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ fifth cause of \naction.  In support of their position, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not \nproduced any evidence supporting a finding that a constructive trust should be placed \non the proceeds from the sale of the Disputed Property by Ferrell Investments.  (ECF \nNo. 87, at pp. 19–21.)  Defendants argue that there is no evidence Ferrell Investments \nhad a fiduciary relationship with or owed a duty to Plaintiffs.   (Id. at p. 21.)  \nDefendants also argue that Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law  of monetary \ndamages for their breach of contract claim and  should not be able to  invoke the \nequitable remedy of constructive trust.  ( Id. at p. 2 0 ( citing Morris v. Scenera \nResearch, LLC , 368 N.C. 857, 867, 788 S.E.2d 154, 161 (2016) ( holding money \ndamages usually sufficient to remedy a claim for breach of contract and equitable \n \n \nremedy of rescission available only “only when a material breach occurs and all legal \nremedies fall short of compensating the injured party for its loss”)).)   \n50. Plaintiffs do not contend, and have not presented evidence, that Ferrell \nInvestments had a fiduciary relationship to Plaintiffs.  Instead, they argue that they \nhave established other equitable grounds for imposition of a constructive trust over \nFerrell Investments .  Plaintiffs contend that David and Luanne, as controlling \nmembers of both FLC and Ferrell Investments, failed to transfer  the Disputed \nProperty from Ferrell Investments to FLC, caused Ferrell Inv estments to sell the \nDisputed Property to a third party, and have drained assets out of FLC “for purposes \nof preventing Plaintiffs from having a legal remedy for FLC’s intentional failure to \nacquire the Disputed Property. ”  (ECF No. 103, at pp. 20 –22.)  David and Luanne’s \nactions, Plaintiffs argue, warrant the Court imposing a constructive trust on Ferrell \nInvestments’ property for the benefit of Plaintiffs. \n51. Plaintiffs’ argument is based on their (now dismissed) assertion of the \nlegal theory of piercing the corporate veil of FLC and Ferrell Investments via David \nand Luanne.  W & W Partners, Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 52 , at *26 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nMay 22, 2019).  In fact, Plaintiffs cite repeatedly to the brief filed in support of their \nMotion to Amend the SAC  to reassert the veil -piercing claim and bring David and \nLuanne back into this case as Defendants.  (ECF No. 103, at p. 21 (“As described more \nfully in Plaintiffs’ Brief in Support of Motion to Amend Second Amended Complaint, \nDavid and Luanne are using [Ferrell Investments] purely for purposes of preventing \nPlaintiffs from having a legal remedy for FLC’s intentional failure to acquire the \n \n \nDisputed Property”); p.22 (“As described in Plaintiffs’ Brief in Support of Motion to \nAmend, there is no distinction between the Ferrell family and its various entities.”).)  \nThe Court denied the motion to amend , the veil -piercing claim was not reasserted, \nand David and Luanne are not currently Defendants.  (ECF No. 108.) \n52. Absent a veil -piercing theory by which FLC’s obligations c ould be \nimposed on Ferrell Investments, the Court must consider FLC and Ferrell \nInvestments as separate, distinct legal entities, and cannot impose the obligations or \nduties owed by FLC upon Ferrell Investments. As a result, the Court will not consider \nthe arguments or evidence presented by Plaintiffs relating to whether it is \nappropriate to pierce the corporate veils of FLC and Ferrell Investments.   \n53. Plaintiffs have made no other argument that Ferrell Investments owed \nany duty directly to Plaintiffs, committed some fraud on Plaintiffs, or that there are \nsome other circumstances making it inequitable for Ferrell Investments to retain the \nproceeds from the sale of the Disputed Property.  Therefore, to the extent the Motions \nseek summary judgment on the Fifth Cause of Action for constructive trust, Plaintiffs’ \nMotion should be DENIED, and Defendants’ Motion should be GRANTED.  \nIII. CONCLUSION \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the Summary Judgment Motions are decided \nof as follows:  \n1. To the extent that it seeks summary judgment on FLC’s \ncounterclaims, Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED as MOOT.  \n \n \n2. To the extent it seeks summary judgment on the First Cause of \nAction for breach of contract, Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED. \n3. To the extent it seeks summary judgment on the First Cause of \nAction for breach of contract, Defendants’ Motion is DENIED \n4. To the exte nt it seeks summary judgment on the Fifth Cause of \nAction for constructive trust, Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED.  \n5. To the extent it seeks summary judgment on the Fifth Cause of \nAction for constructive trust, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED. \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 25th day of July, 2019. \n \n \n  /s/ Gregory P.
