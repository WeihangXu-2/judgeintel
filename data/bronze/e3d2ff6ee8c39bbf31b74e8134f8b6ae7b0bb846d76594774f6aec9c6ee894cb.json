Since 2009, Plaintiff Jianxun “Bill” Gao (“Gao”) and Defendants Heckmann \nand Liu have been engaged in business together in manufacturing and selling \nchemicals to the oil and gas industry.  In order to conduct this business, Gao, \nHeckmann, and Liu formed companies in the United States, China, and Hong Kong.  \nThis lawsuit involves on ly the United States company, Sinova US, and Heckmann \nand Liu’s alleged violations of their fiduciary duties to Sinova US. \n4. Gao’s Amended Complaint seeks judicial dissolution of Sinova US pursuant \nto N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55 -14-30, and contains claims against H eckmann, Liu, New \nShore, and Calder  Overseas (“Calder”)  for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive \nfraud, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and breach of  contract.  The Rule 12(b)(6) \nMotions seek dismissal of all of Gao’s direct claims, which include Gao’s fourth, sixth, \neighth, and tenth causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, \ncorporate waste, and unjust enrichment, respectively , and Gao’s eleventh cause of \naction, a derivative claim for breach of contract.  The Motion to Dism iss Dissolution \nClaim seeks dismissal of Gao’s claim for judicial dissolution of Sinova US.   \n5. For the reasons explained below, the Court denies the Rule 12(b)(6) Motions \nin all respects except as to Gao’s direct claim for corporate waste, which the Court \ndismisses with prejudice.  The Court also denies the Motion to Dismiss Dissolution \nClaim.    \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n6. Gao first initiated this action on April 8, 2016 by filing a Verified Complaint \nin Mecklenburg County Superior Court.  The case was designate d as a mandatory \ncomplex business case by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina dated April 11, 2016.  The action was assigned to the undersigned by order \ndated April 14, 2016. \n7. Gao filed an Amended Complaint, with the Court’s permission, on July 8, \n2016.  The Rule 12(b)(6) Motions were filed on August 10, 2016, and the Motion to \nDismiss Dissolution Claim was filed on the same day. \n8. All briefing was completed on October 5, 2016.   The Court held a hearing \non these and other motions on November 8, 2016.  Both the Rule 12(b)(6) Motions and \nthe Motion to Dismiss Dissolution Claim are now ripe for resolution.   \nIII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n9. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(6), but only recites those facts included in the Amended Complaint that are \nrelevant to the Court’s determination of the Rule 12(b)(6) Motions and the Motion to \nDismiss Dissolution Claim.     \nA. The Parties  \n10. Gao is a chemical engineer and a Chinese citizen and resident.  (Am. Compl. \n¶ 8.)   \n11. Heckmann is a German citizen who resides in Matthews, North Carolina.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 10.)   \n12. Liu is a Chinese citizen and resident, but maintains a place of business in \nMatthews, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 11.)   \n13. Sinova US is a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in Matthews, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 9.)  Sinova US’s shareholders \nare Heckmann, Liu, and Gao.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 27.)   \n14. New Shore is a Nor th Carolina corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in Matthews, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12.)  Heckmann is the sole \nshareholder of New Shore.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 12.)   \n15. Calder is a British Virgin Islands company with its principal place of \nbusiness in Tortola, British Virgin Islands.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 13.)  Liu is the sole \nshareholder of Calder.   The Court has dismissed Calder as a party to this lawsuit \nbecause the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Calder.   \nB. Related Entities \n16. Heckmann, Liu, and Gao formed Sinova Chemicals Limited, formerly \nknown as Sinomax Solutions Co., Limited, (“Sinova HK”), a Hong Kong corporation, \non March 28, 2011.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 14.)   \n17. Heckmann, Liu, and Gao formed Sinomax Specialties Inc. (Beijing), also \nknown as Sinova (Beijing) Catalyst Technology Co., Ltd. , (“Sinova Beijing”  and, \ncollectively with Sinova US and Sinova HK, the “Sinova Companies” ), a Chinese \ncorporation, on July 10, 2012.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 15.)   \n18. Liu and her mother, Sujin Feng, formed Sino Chem Chemical Co., Limited, \nalso known as Xinnuokai (Beijing) Chemical Co., Ltd. , (“Sino Chem”), a Chinese \ncorporation, on July 5, 2007.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 17.)   \n19. Sino Chem controls a Chinese company called Sinova Specialties Ltd. \n(Beijing), also known as Sinova (Beijing) Chem ical Technology Co., Ltd., (“Chemical \nTechnology”), which was formed on November 11, 2013.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.)  Gao \nalleges that, although Chemical Technology uses the Sinova name, such use is \nwithout the Sinova Companies ’ authorization, and that Chemical Technology is not \naffiliated with the Sinova Companies.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.) \n20. Sino Chem also controls North America (Beijing) Invest Holding Limited, \nalso known as North America Sequoia (Beijing) Investment Group Co., Ltd., (“North \nAmerica Sequoia”), which was formed in 2014.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 19.)   \nC. Organization of the Sinova Companies \n21. Heckmann, Liu, and Gao formed Sinova US in 2009 for the purpose of \nmarketing, producing, and selling chemical compounds to the pharmaceutical, oil, \nand chemical industries.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 26.)  At the time of Sinova US’s formation, \nits stock ownership was as follows: Heckmann owned 45%, Liu owned 30%, and Gao \nowned 25%.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 27.)   \n22. In 2011, Heckmann, Liu, and Gao acquired all interest in Sinova HK and \ninitially maintained the same stock ownership allocation —45% for Heckmann, 30% \nfor Liu, and 25% for Gao.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 28.)  Shortly after the Sinova HK acquisition, \nhowever, Heckmann, Liu, and Gao agreed to adjust Gao’s ownership in the Sinova \nCompanies to 30%.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 29.)  To effectuate this adjustment, the \nshareholders agreed that Heckmann  would transfer 5% of his shares in Sinova HK \nto Gao.  After this transfer, Sinova HK’s ownership allocation was as follows: \nHeckmann owned 40%, and Liu and Gao both owned 30%.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 30.) \n23. To ensure that ownership across all of the Sinova Companies  was \nconsistent, Heckmann agreed to also transfer 5% of his interest in Sinova US and \nSinova Beijing to Gao.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 31.)  Gao alleges that Heckmann confirmed on \nnumerous occasions that the ownership of Sinova US had been adjusted to reflect \nGao’s 30% ownership interest.  (Am. Compl. ¶  32.)  For example, on April 16, 2014, \nGao wrote in a text message to Heckmann: “As [b]oth [Sinova Beijing] and [Sinova \nUS] are the same share ratio[, f]or [Liu] and me, pay from BJ as RMB.  For you, pay \nfrom US as USD.  Keep the ratio [a]s 3:3:4, then it will be fair.”  Heckmann responded: \n“Sounds good. Ok.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 32.)  Additionally, all distributions and votes after \n2011 have reflected and been consistent with Gao having a 30% ownership interest.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 33.)   \n24. In addition to being Sinova US’s only shareholders, Heckmann, Liu, and \nGao are also directors and officers.  Heckmann is the President, Gao is the Treasurer, \nand Liu is the Secretary.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 35.)  Each shareholder also holds the same \nofficer role and is a director in Sinova Beijing and Sinova HK.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.)  \nHeckmann has primarily been responsible for sales and marketing for the Sinova \nCompanies.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.)  Liu has primarily been responsible for management \nof the Sinova Companies’ operations.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.)  Gao has been responsible \nfor product development.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.)   \n25. Gao focused his efforts on research and development, and relied on \nHeckmann and Liu to sell the products and manage the Sinova Companies’ \noperations.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 38.)  Gao alleges that he trusted Heckmann and Liu and \nreasonably believed that their loyalty to the Sinova Companies was undivided.  \nAccordingly, Gao limited his involvement in the day -to-day operation and \nadministration of the Sinova Companies.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 38.)   \n26. The Sinova Companies, including Sinova US, eventually sold their \ncompounds and chemicals to major companies such as Shell Chemical, Bayer \nCorporation, Dow Agroscience, E.I. DuPont, and BASF.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 39.)  From \n2011 to mid -2015, in the United States alone, Sinova US generated more than \n$41,500,000 in revenues.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 40.)   \nD. Company Agreements \n27. On June 30, 2012, Heckmann, Liu, and Gao entered into a CDA and Non \nCompete Agreement (the “CDA” ).  (See Am. Compl. Ex. A.)  The CDA provides that \n“[t]he three persons in this agreement” are Heckmann, Liu, and Gao, and that “[t]he \ncompany in this agreement is Sinova Specialties Inc. (Beijing) and its related \ncompany in USA, HK and China.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. A 1.)  The CDA lists the share \nallocation between the shareholders as 40% for Heckmann, 30% for Liu, and 30% for \nGao.  The CDA also imposed an obligation upon each shareholder to “keep the secrecy \nof the company” and not to “leak the market, technology and operation secrecy to any \nthird party directly or indirectly at any time.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. A 2.)  Finally, the \nCDA provides that “[a]nyone who breaches [the CDA] shall pay RMB 5million to the \ncompany.  At the same time, he/she shall compensate all the lost that [sic] caused to \nthe company by his/her violating [the CDA].”  (Am. Compl. Ex. A 3–4.)   \n28. On September 16, 2012, Heckmann, Liu, and Gao entered into a board \nagreement (the “2012 Board Agreement”) that permitted each “to set up non-related \nother companies,” but barred each from doing “business [to] compete” with Sinova US \nand Sinova Beijing, providing or accepting any “product or service” of Sinova US or \nSinova Beijing, and “separat[ing] the existing business of [Sinova US or Sinova \nBeijing] in any method.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. B 1.)  The 2012 Board Agreement further \nstates that “[p]rofit shall be allocated according to percentage of the share.”  (Am. \nCompl. Ex. B 2.)   \n29. Beginning in 2013, Heckmann, Liu, and Gao discussed the separation of \ntheir future businesses and development activities.  Gao alleges that the concept was \nthat Sinova US would continue to operate, and that Heckmann, Liu, and Gao would \nremain officers, directors, and shareholders in the Sinova Companies to sell and \nmarket an agreed -upon set of p roducts.  Each shareholder would also, however, be \nfree to engage in non -competing businesses and develop non -competing products.  \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 50.)   \n30. On January 15, 201 4, Heckmann, Liu, and Gao entered into a board \nagreement (the “2014 Board Agreement”),  by which the existing business of the \nSinova Companies was to be maintained but not developed beyond seven products \nspecified in that agreement.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 54.)   \n31. The 2014 Board Agreement  contained several provisions that were to \ngovern the shareholders’ relationship going forward by: \n expressly reaffirming the shareholders’ prior confidentiality and non-compete \nobligations set forth in the CDA and the 2012 Board Agreement,  (Am. Compl. \nEx. C ¶ 2);  \n providing that “[e]ach board member will adhere to pro fessional rules of \nconduct toward each other and promises to promote the common projects to the \nbest of their abilities and not to cause adverse effects to another board member. \nShould such action occur damages may be sought, ” (Am. Compl. Ex. C ¶ 11);  \nand \n providing that “[a]ll expenditures for common projects shall be approved by 2 \nboard members prior to release of the funds,” (Am. Compl. Ex. C ¶ 18). \n32. The 2014 Board Agreement also states that “[a]ny amount above $3,500,000 \nis to be distributed at the end of the quarter in the ratio of 30/30/40 to [Gao, Liu, and \nHeckmann,] respectively.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. C ¶ 8.)  Although the 2014 Board \nAgreement states that Gao is a 25% shareholder of Sinova US, (Am. Compl. Ex. C. ¶ \n21), Gao alleges that this representation was mistaken, incorrect, contrary to prior \nand future corporate resolutions and practices, including all future distributions, and \ncontradictory to paragraph eight in the 2014 Board Agreement.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 59.)   \nE. Alleged Fraudulent and Insider Transactions \n33. Gao alleges that, throughout the time that Heckmann and Liu ran the day-\nto-day operations and administration of the Sinova Companies, and espe cially after \nentering into the 2014 Board Agreement, Heckmann and Liu engaged in numerous \nunapproved, fraudulent, and improper insider transactions and converted Sinova  \nUS’s confidential trade secret information and technology without Gao’s knowledge \nor consent.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 80, 83.)   \n34. For example, Heckmann and Liu allegedly caused the registration of three \npatents in China for chemical compounds owned by Sinova US —which Heckmann \nhad told Gao had no viable market—in the name of Chemical Technology, a company \nunder Liu’s control.  Heckmann and Liu also falsely listed Heckmann as an inventor \nof the intellectual property.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 84.)   \n35. In addition, Gao alleges that Heckmann, with Liu’s consent and assistance, \ncaused Sinova US to make improper payments to New Shore .  (Am. Compl. ¶ 86.)  \nThe Amended Complaint provides three examples of such alleged improper payments \nwhich were unapproved by Gao: (1) a $60,000 “marketing se rvice fee” to New Shore \non January 1, 2014; (2) a $1,285,866.30 transfer from Sinova US to New Shore at \nsome time prior to December 26, 2014, which was initially characterized as a loan, \nbut was later characterized as a fee; and (3) a $320,000 payment from  Sinova US to \nNew Shore on July 23, 2015, which was initially described as a “distribution,” and \nlater re-characterized as a “marketing service fee.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 87–100.)      \n36. Gao also alleges that Heckmann and/or Liu caused Sinova US to make \nimproper payments to Liu.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 101.)  The Amended Complaint contains \nseveral examples of such alleged improper payments, which were unapproved by Gao, \nincluding: (1) a $995,274.78 “loan” from Sinova US to Liu; (2) a $120,000 “production \nmanagement fee” to  Liu; (3) a $240,000 “loan” to Liu; and (4) three unapproved \npayments to Chemical Technology totaling $358,186.   (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 102–118.)   \n37.   Further, Gao alleges that, as part of their scheme to siphon funds out of \nSinova US for their own benefit and to the detriment of Sinova US and Gao, \nHeckmann and Liu engaged in various transactions that involved moving revenues \npaid to Sinova US from the United States to offshore accounts through intermediary \nentities such as Calder, and shipping Sinova US products m anufactured in China \nthrough “circuitous routes.”  Specifically, Gao alleges that , in 2012, Heckmann and \nLiu caused Sinova US revenues of at least $4,300,000 to be siphoned out of Sinova \nUS for the benefit of Liu and Calder.   \n38. Gao alleges that, beginning in 2015, Liu and Heckmann shipped Sinova US-\nowned chemicals and compounds through Liu’s and Heckmann’s own companies to \navoid sharing income in Sinova US.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 127–28.)   \n39. On May 15, 2015, Heckmann and Liu executed a “Sinova Specialties Inc. \nResolution of the Shareholders’ Meeting,” purporting to memorialize a shareholders’ \nmeeting that occurred on May 15, 2015.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 137 ; see Am. Compl. Ex. Q.)  \nDespite Gao’s absence from this meeting, the resolution states that all shareholders \nwere present for and participated in the shareholder meeting.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 137.)  \nThe resolution purports to approve: (1) a “supplier management service f ee” of RMB \n1.5 million to Chemical Technology; (2) a “project management consulting service fee” \nof RMB 1.75 million to a company owned by Liu called “Sequoia Technologies \nDevelopment Center”; (3) a “market consulting service fee” of $376,344 to New Shore; \nand (4) a “tech service fee” to a company owned by Gao called “PTG Advanced \nCatalyst Co., Limited” of RMB 1.75 million.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 138.)   \n40. Heckmann and Liu executed the resolution, and transmitted it to Gao for \nhis signature.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 140.)  Gao refused to approve and execute the \nresolution.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 144.)  Further, Gao did not receive the paymen t for the \n“tech service fee” described in the resolution.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 145.) \n \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n41. In ruling on the Rule 12(b)(6)  Motions and the Motion to Dismiss \nDissolution Claim, the Court construes the Amended Complaint liberally and reviews \nthe allegations of the Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Gao.  See \nLaster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009).   The Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \ntrue, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some \nlegal theory.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. 669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, \n840 (1987).   \n42. Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when the \ncomplaint reveals on its face the absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; [or] \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc. , 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985); see also \nJackson v. Bumgardner, 318 N.C. 172, 175, 347 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1986).  Otherwise, \n“a complaint should not be dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty \nthat plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in \nsupport of the claim.”  Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) \n(emphasis omitted).   \n43. The Court is not required “to accept as true allegations that are merely \nconclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  Good Hope \nHosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs. , 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 \nS.E.2d 873, 880 (2005).  The Court can also ignore a party’s legal conclusions set forth \nin its pleading.  McCrann v. Pinehurst, LLC, 225 N.C. App. 368, 377, 737 S.E.2d 771, \n777 (2013).     \nV. RULE 12(b)(6) MOTIONS \n44. The Rule 12(b)(6) Motions seek dismissal of all of Gao’s direct claims, which \ninclude Gao’s fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth causes of action for breach of fiduciary \nduty, constructive fraud, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment, respectively , and \nGao’s eleventh cause of action, a derivative claim for breach of contract.  The Rule \n12(b)(6) Motions also seek to dismiss Gao’s first cause of action for judicial dissolution, \nbut because those Motions rely on the arguments made by Sinova US in its Motion to \nDismiss Dissolution Claim, the Court will address that claim in its analysis of the \nMotion to Dismiss Dissolution Claim below. \nA. Gao’s Direct Claims \n45. In North Carolina, “[s]hareholders . . . of corporations generally may not \nbring individual actions to recover what they consider their share of the damages \nsuffered by the corporation.”  Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks , 346 N.C. 650, 6 60, \n488 S.E.2d 215, 220–21 (1997).  Despite this general rule, however,  \na “shareholder may maintain an individual action against a third party \nfor an injury that directly affects the shareholder, even if the corporation \nalso has a cause of action arising  from the same wrong,” under two \ncircumstances: (1) where “the wrongdoer owed [the shareholder] a \nspecial duty[,]” and (2) where the shareholder suffered a personal \ninjury—one that is “separate and distinct from the injury sustained by \nthe other shareholders or the corporation itself.”   \n \nRaymond James Capital Partners, L.P. v. Hayes, 789 S.E.2d 695, 700 (N.C. Ct. App. \n2016) (quoting Barger, 346 N.C. at 659, 488 S.E.2d at 219).   \n46. Thus, for Gao to maintain direct claims against Defendants, he must allege \neither (1) that Defendants owed Gao a special duty, or (2) that Gao suffered a personal \ninjury separate and distinct from the injury suffered by Sinova US.  Defendants \ncontend that Gao has not alleged either a special duty or a separate and distinct \ninjury.   \n47. As to the special duty exception, the special duty that is required for a \nplaintiff to maintain an individual action  \nmay arise from contract or otherwise.  To support the right to an \nindividual lawsuit, the duty must be one that the alleged wrongdoer \nowed directly to the shareholder as an individual.  The existence of a \nspecial duty thus would be established by facts showing that defendants \nowed a duty to plaintiffs that was personal to plaintiffs as shareholders \nand was separate and distinct from the duty owed the corporation.  A \nspecial duty therefore has been found when the wrongful actions of a \nparty induced an indivi dual to become a shareholder; when a party \nviolated its fiduciary duty to the shareholder; when the party performed \nindividualized services directly for the shareholder; and when a party \nundertook to advise shareholders independently of the corporation.   \n \nBarger, 346 N.C. at 654, 488 S.E.2d at 217 (internal citations omitted).  Although \nBarger did not purport to identify an exhaustive list, the Court of Appeals has \nconcluded that “the special duty exception clearly requires an articulation of some \nduty owed to a plaintiff that is distinct from the general fiduciary duties directors and \nofficers owe to the corporation.”  Hayes, 789 S.E.2d at 701.   \n48. Gao argues that Heckmann and Liu owes him a special duty because he is \na minority shareholder in Sinova US , and  Heckmann and Liu together form a \nmajority block of shareholders.  In Norman v. Nash Johnson & Sons’ Farms, Inc., 140 \nN.C. App. 390, 537 S.E.2d 248 (2000), the Court of Appeals stated its view that \n“minority shareholders in a closely held corporation who allege wrongful conduct and \ncorruption against the majority shareholders in the corporation may bring an \nindividual action against those shareholders, in addition to maintaining a derivative \naction on behalf of the corporation.”  Id. at 405, 537 S.E.2d at 259; see also Blythe v. \nBell, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *1 3–14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 8, 2013)  (“[I]n certain \ninstances, a group of owners of a closely -held corporation may be considered a \nmajority even though neither alone owned a majority.”).    \n49. This view does not, however, represent a determination by the Court of \nAppeals that “the general rule favoring derivative actions must be abandoned in all \ninstances so that a minority owner always has a right to proceed individually to assert \nbreach of fiduciary claims for injury to the corporation where the other owners take \naction as a majority which disagrees with the minority owner’s view as to what best \nserves the corporation’s interest.”  Blythe, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *14 .  Rather, \nNorman should be considered in light of its particular facts and the Court of Appeals’ \nrecognition that applying the general rule that a corporate shareholder may not bring \nan individual action to the facts in that case woul d actually have “disserve[d] the \ncorporation’s interest which the general rule seeks to protect.”  Id. at *15.   \n50. In Norman, plaintiffs alleged that defendants (1) were acting in concert, (2) \nowned a majority of the stock in the corporation, (3) were officers of the corporation, \nand (4) controlled the board of directors of the corporation.  The Court of Appeals held \nthat these allegations are sufficient to “give rise to a fiduciary relationship between \nplaintiffs and the defendants and establish that defendants owed plaintiffs a ‘special \nduty’ within the meaning of the Barger decision.”  Norman, 140 N.C. App. at 407, 537 \nS.E.2d at 260 .  Here, Gao alleges that Heckmann and Liu are the majority and \ncontrolling shareholders of Sinova US, (Am. Compl. ¶ 65),  that they were acting in \nconcert in furtherance of their alleged wrongful transactions and conduct, (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 75), that they were both officers of Sinova US, (Am. Compl. ¶ 35), and that \nthey have actual domination and control over the board of directo rs of Sinova US, \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 68).  \n51. Moreover, the factors that the Court of Appeals considered that weighed in \nfavor of allowing the individual shareholder plaintiffs to proceed in a direct action \nagainst the director defendants in Norman are also present here, at least as alleged \nin the Amended Complaint.  First, if Gao was not allowed to proceed in a direct action, \nany recovery he would receive in this action would go to Sinova US, and thus, under \nthese facts as alleged, be under the control of the alleged wrongdoers, Heckmann and \nLiu.  See Norman, 140 N.C. App. at 405, 537 S.E.2d at 259.  Additionally, there is no \nindication in the record that Sinova US is insolvent, or that the rights of Sinova US’s \ncreditors would otherwise be prejudiced by the possibility of an individual recovery.  \nSee id. at 406, 537 S.E.2d at 259.   There appears to be no danger of multiple lawsuits, \nsince all of Sinova US’s shareholders are parties to this litigation.  See id.   \n52. Therefore, the Court concludes that, under the f acts as alleged in the \nAmended Complaint, Gao may properly pursue his claims against Heckmann and Liu \nboth as direct and derivative claims.  Moreover, as taught by Norman, because Gao \nalleges that New Shore is “under the control of some or all of the [indi vidual] \ndefendants or [has] entered into a conspiracy with the individual defendants to \nsiphon off corporate assets from [Sinova US], to deprive [Sinova US] of corporate \nopportunities, and to redirect those assets and opportunities to the individual \ndefendants[,] . . . [New Shore is] inextricably wedded to the individual defendants.  \n[Gao] can, therefore, maintain a direct action against [New Shore] under the \ncircumstances alleged in the [Amended Complaint].”  Id.   \n53. Defendants argue that, as a result of  Gao’s voluntary limited involvement \nin the management and operation of Sinova US , Heckmann and Liu could not have \nowed a fiduciary duty to Gao.  This argument is without merit.  Gao alleges that, after \nthe 2014 Board Agreement, he limited his involvement in t he day-to-day operation \nand administration of the Sinova Companies, and that he placed his trust  in \nHeckmann and Liu, based on their affirmative representations that they would act \nin the best interests of Sinova US .  The Court believes these allegations actually \nweigh in favor of finding an individual fiduciary duty owed to Gao, in addition to the \nduties otherwise owed to Sinova US.  See Blythe v. Bell, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *34 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 4, 2013).   \n54. Because Gao alleges a special duty owed to him by Defendants, he should \nbe allowed to proceed on his individual claims to the same extent as his derivative \nclaims brought on behalf of Sinova US.   \n55. Defendants argue an additional and separate basis for dismissal of  Gao’s \ndirect claim for corporate waste.  Defendants point out that “North Carolina does not \nrecognize corporate waste as an independent cause of action,” because such a claim \nis subsumed within a breach of fiduciary duty claim.  Soft Line, S.p.A. v. Itali an \nHomes, LLC, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *15 –16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 16, 2015).  The \nCourt agrees that Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint improperly sets out Defendants’ \nalleged waste as a separate, albeit non -existent, cause of action. Accordingly, the \nCourt dismisses Gao’s direct claim for corporate waste.   \nB. Gao’s Derivative Claim for Breach of Contract \n56. Gao’s eleventh cause of action is a derivative claim brought on behalf of \nSinova US against Heckmann and Liu for their alleged breach of the CDA.  Gao \nalleges tha t Heckmann and Liu have violated the CDA by publicly disclosing \nconfidential and proprietary intellectual property in their registration of three \npatents for Sinova US-owned compounds in China.   \n57. Defendants seek dismissal of this claim on the basis that such a claim does \nnot belong to Sinova US.  Defendants argue that Gao failed to acknowledge that the \nconfidential and propriety information that was disclosed through registration of the \npatents belonged specifically to SNVUS.  However, Gao specifically alleges that the \nthree compounds for which the patents were registered were Sinova US -owned \ncompounds.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 84.)  Accordingly, the Court rejects this argument. \n58. Defendants also argue that the claim should be dismissed because the right \nto recover damages under the agreement belongs to Sinova Beijing, rather than \nSinova US.  Contrary to Defendants’ argument, h owever, the CDA provides that \n“[t]he company in this agreement is Sinova Specialties I nc. (Beijing) and its related \ncompany in USA, HK and China.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. A) (emphasis added).  The CDA \nis on Sinova US letterhead.  There is nothing in the CDA that clearly contradicts the \nallegation that Sinova US was a party to the CDA, and thus entitled to any damages \nfor its alleged breach.  Accordingly, the Court also rejects this argument. \n59. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) \nMotions should be denied to the extent they seek dismissal of Gao’s eleventh cause of \naction.   \n60. In sum, the Court denies the Rule 12(b)(6) Motions in all respects except as \nto Gao’s direct claim for corporate waste.  The Court concludes that Gao’s direct claim \nfor corporate waste should be dismissed with prejudice.   \nVI. MOTION TO DISMISS DISSOLUTION CLAIM \n61. Gao’s first cause of action seeks judicial dissolution of Sinova US pursuant \nto N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55 -14-30.  Gao contends that dissolution of Sinova US is \nappropriate on three separate grounds.  First, he contends that there is a deadlock  \namong the directors and shareholders that the shareholders are unable to break and, \nas a result, Sinova US's business cannot be conducted to the advantage of all \nshareholders.  See N.C. Gen. Stat.  § 55-14-30(2)(i).  Second, he contend s that \nliquidation is  reasonably necessary for the protection of Gao's rights or \ninterests.  See id. § 55-14-30(2)(ii).  Third, he contends that Sinova US's assets are \nbeing misapplied and wasted.  See id. § 55-14-30(2)(iv).  Even though Gao purports \nto bring derivative claims  on behalf of Sinova US, Sinova US , through its own \nseparately retained counsel, seeks dismissal of Gao’s claim in its entirety, asserting \nthat dissolution is not an appropriate remedy under the facts as alleged in the \nAmended Complaint. \nA. Section 55-14-30(2)(i) \n62.  Under section 55 -14-30(2)(i), in order to state a claim for judicial \ndissolution, a plaintiff must allege that  (1) “there is a deadlock among the directors \nin the management of the corporation”; (2) “the shareholders are unable to break the \ndeadlock”; and (3) “the corporation is suffering or in danger of suffering irreparable \ninjury, or is no longer able to conduct its business to the advantage of the \nshareholders generally.”  Foster v. Foster Farms, 112 N.C. App. 700, 706, 436 S.E.2d \n843, 847 (1993) (citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30(2)(i)).   \n63. As to the first condition, Gao alleges that there is a deadlock among the \ndirectors with respect to certain transactions —namely, insider, conflict of interest  \ntransactions—due to statutory veto rights afforded Gao.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55 -8-31 \nprovides that a “conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation \nin which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest.”  N.C. Gen . \nStat. § 55-8-31(a).  Such a transaction is voidable unless: (1) the material facts of the \ntransaction and the director’s interest were disclosed to disinterested directors, and \nthose directors approved the transaction; (2) the material facts of the transaction and \nthe director’s interest were disclosed to disinterested shareholders, and those \nshareholders approved the transaction; or (3) the transaction was fair to the \ncorporation.  Id.   \n64. Gao contends that Heckmann and Liu each have engaged in numerous \nconflict of interest transactions that must be approved by two non -interested \ndirectors or shareholders.  According to Gao, such transactions can never be \nauthorized by disinterested directors without Gao’s approval, because, on Sinova US’s \nthree-member board, there are only two disinterested directors.   \n65. The Amended Complaint admits, however, that as to conflict of interest \ntransactions engaged in by Liu, such transactions can be authorized by disinterested \nshareholders without Gao’s approval, because Heckma nn, a disinterested \nshareholder as to such transactions, is at least a 40% shareholder, whereas Gao is at \nmost a 30% shareholder.  Accordingly, it is only a narrow category of transactions \nthat the alleged deadlock among directors applies to—the alleged conflict of interest \ntransactions engaged in by Heckmann.   \n66. Gao identifies in his Amended Complaint three such transactions —a \n$60,000 “marketing service fee” paid by Sinova to New Shore, a $1,285,866.30 “loan” \nto New Shore, and a $320,000 payment to New Shor e that was originally \ncharacterized as a distribution, but later re-characterized as a “marketing fee.”  Gao \nalso alleges that these are merely examples, and that there were various other \nunapproved, fraudulent, and improper transactions.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 80, 86–100.)   \n67. Defendants initially argue that even these three transactions can be, and \nwere, approved by a majority of disinterested shareholders because Gao only owns \n25% of Sinova US’s shares, not 30% as Gao alleges.  Thus, Liu, who is a 30% \nshareholder, owns a majority of disinterested shares as to these transactions and \nvoted to approve the transactions.  Defendants point to the 2014 Board Agreement, \nwhich is attached to the Amended Complaint, and which identifies Gao as only a 25% \nshareholder of Sinova US.  (See Am. Compl. Ex. C 7.)  Although the Court may “reject \nallegations that are contradicted by the documents attached [to] . . . the complaint,” \nLaster, 199 N.C. App. at 577, 681 S.E.2d at 862, Gao alleges that the 2014 Board \nAgreement is incorrect in this regard.  Gao also attaches to the Amended Complaint \nseveral other documents that support Gao’s allegation of his 30% ownership.  ( See, \ne.g., Am. Compl. Ex. 2.)  The Court therefore, for the purposes of this Motion to \nDismiss Dissolution Claim, accepts Gao’s allegation of his 30% ownership in Sinova \nUS as true.    \n68. Nevertheless, that does not resolve the question of whether the inability for \ndisinterested shareholders to approve the above three transactions without Gao’s \napproval constitutes a deadlock in the management of the company.   \n69. In Foster, the Court of Appeals looked to whether the directors were \ndeadlocked as to a “major management decision.”  See Foster, 112 N.C. App. at 707, \n436 S.E.2d at 848.  In addition to the three transactions identified in the Amended \nComplaint that are potentially voidable under section 55-8-31, Gao also alleges that \nthere are other, yet -identified transactions in addition to these three.  If proven, \ndeadlock as to all such transactions, taken together,  could potentially constitute a \ndeadlock as to a major management decision.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that \nGao has properly alleged deadlock among the directors in the management of Sinova \nUS. \n70. As to the second condition, Gao alleges that the shareholders of Sinova US \nare unable to break the deadlock in management among the directors.  Defendants \nargue, however, that any deadlock at the director level is resolvable by the \nshareholders because, even if Gao is assumed to own 30%, Heckmann and Liu, who \ncombined own 70% of Sinova US’s shares, can vote Gao off the board of directors at \nany time.  Gao argues in response that Heckmann and Liu cannot vote Gao off the \nboard because they agreed, in the 2014 Board Agreement, that “[e]ach board member \nwill adhere to professional rules of conduct toward each other and . . . not to cause \nadverse effects to another board member.”  (Am. Compl. Ex. C.)  The Court concludes \nthat such an allegation is sufficient to s atisfy the second condition of dissolution \nunder section 55-14-30(2)(i). \n71. Finally, as to the third condition, Gao alleges that Sinova US is suffering \nirreparable injury, and is no longer able to conduct its business to the advantage of \nall of its shareholde rs.  Defendants contend that, because Sinova US is solvent and \nprofitable, it cannot be suffering irreparable injury or be unable to conduct business \nto the advantage of the shareholders.  However, in Foster, the Court of Appeals noted \nthat, while factors such as profitability  and ability to conduct everyday operations \nwithout incident are to be considered, there may be other factors that support a \nfinding that the corporation’s business could not be conducted to the advantage of the \nshareholders generally.  Foster, 112 N.C. App. at 708, 436 S.E.2d at 848–49.   \n72. Here, while the Amended Complaint admits that Sinova US is profitable, \nGao also alleges that, as a result of the alleged deadlock, Heckmann and Liu have \nreceived distributions when Gao has not, and th at Heckmann and Liu, either \npersonally or through their wholly -owned companies, have benefitted from \ntransactions involving Sinova -US assets and funds, when Gao has not.  The Court \nfinds these allegations sufficient to state a claim for entitlement to judicial dissolution \nunder section 55-14-30(2)(i). \nB. Section 55-14-30(2)(ii) \n73. Section 55-14-30(2)(ii) provides that the Court may dissolve a corporation \nif it is established that “liquidation is reasonably necessary for the protection of the \nrights or interests of the complaining shareholder.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30(2)(ii).  \nIn Meiselman v. Meiselman, 309 N.C. 279, 307 S.E.2d 551 (1983), the North Carolina \nSupreme Court set out the analysis a trial court should follow in determining whether \nto order dissolution under former N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55 -125(a)(4)—what is now N.C. \nGen. Stat. 55-14-30(2)(ii).   The trial court must (1) “define the ‘rights or interests’ the \ncomplaining shareholder has in the corporation ,” and (2) whether dissolution is \n“‘reasonably necessary’ for the protection of those ‘rights or interests.’”  Meiselman, \n309 N.C. at 301, 307 S.E.2d at 564.  To sufficiently state  a claim for entitlement to \ndissolution under this subsection sufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Gao \nmust allege that: “(1) he had one or more substantial reasonable expectations known \nor assumed by [Heckmann and Liu]; (2) the expectation has been frustrated; (3) the \nfrustration was without fault of [Gao] and was in large part beyond his control; and \n(4) under all of the circumstances of the case, [Gao] is entitled to some form of \nequitable relief.”  Id.     \n74. The “‘rights or interests’ must be defined with reference to the ‘rights or \ninterests’ the complaining shareholder has under the facts of the particular case —\nthe ‘reasonable expectations’ the participants’ relationship has generated.”  Id. at 303, \n307 S.E.2d at 565.  In a close corporation, these rights or interests may include secure \nemployment and meaningful participation in the management of the business.  Id. at \n302, 307 S.E.2d at 564–65.   \n75.  Gao alleges that his reasonable expectations , known by Heckmann and \nLiu, include: (1) that Heckmann and Liu would act only in the bester interests, and \nnot to the detriment, of Sinova US; (2) that all Sinova US property and assets would \nbe kept confidential and only would be used for the benefit of Sinova US; (3) that all \ndistributions to shareholders would be made contemporaneously and based upon each \nshareholder’s pro rata ownership interests; (4) that all insider transactions would be \nfully disclosed, fair, and subject to the vote of a majority of disinterested directors \nand/or shareholders; and (5) that Gao would have complete access to Sinova US’s \nbooks and records.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 177.)   \n76. Gao also alleges that these reasonable expectations have been frustrated by \nHeckmann and Liu : (1) converting Sinova US’s intellectual property for their own \nbenefit; (2) publicly disclosing and failing to maintain confidential intellectual \nproperty that Gao developed for the benefit of Sinova US; (3) engaging in improper \ninsider transactions without notice to or with the consent of Gao; (4) denying Gao full \naccess to, and examination of, Sinova US’s books and records; and (5) freezing Gao \nout of Sinova US’s business despite his substantial equi ty therein and his \ndevelopment of Sinova US’s successful products.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 178.)  Gao also \nalleges that the frustration of Gao’s expectations was completely outside Gao’s \ncontrol, as Heckmann and Liu engaged in their wrongful conduct without Gao’s \nknowledge or consent.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 179.) \n77. The Court concludes that the above allegations are sufficient to allege a \nclaim for dissolution under section 55-14-30(2)(ii).  If proven, Gao’s allegations of his \nreasonable expectations, and the frustration there of, with respect to Sinova US are \nof the type that may justify judicial dissolution under Meiselman. \nC. Section 55-14-30(2)(iv) \n78. Finally, section 55 -14-30(2)(iv) provides that the Court may dissolve a \ncorporation if it is established that “the corporate assets are being misapplied or \nwasted.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30(2)(iv).  Although there is little case law in North \nCarolina defining what constitutes “corporate waste,” in Delaware, “[t]he judicial \nstandard for determination of corporate waste is well developed.  Roughly, a waste \nentails an exchange of corporate assets for consideration so disproportionately small \nas to lie beyond the range at which any reasonable person might be willing to trade.”  \nKrieger v. Johnson, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *21 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2014); see \nalso First Union Corp. v. Suntrust Banks, Inc. , 2001 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *31 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Aug. 10, 2001) (“North Carolina courts have frequently looked to Delaware \nfor guidance [on matters of corporate law] because of the special expertise and body \nof case law developed in the Delaware Chancery Court and the Delaware Supreme \nCourt.”).   \n79. Gao alleges that Heckmann and Liu have misapplied or wasted corporate \nassets by (1) misappropriating Sinov a US’s intellectual property, and (2) causing \nSinova US to make payments to themselves for no consideration.  More specifically, \nthe Amended Complaint alleges that Heckmann and Liu caused the registration of \npatents in China for three compounds, which were owned by Sinova US but registered \nin the name of Chemical Technology.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 84 –85.)  Gao also alleges that \nthe alleged self -dealing, conflict of interest transactions that are described above \nconstitute corporate waste.  These transactions, as d escribed in the Amended \nComplaint, if they occurred, at the very least represent a misapplication of corporate \nassets.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that Gao has sufficiently alleged a claim for \njudicial dissolution under section 55-14-30(2)(iv).   \n80. In sum, the Court concludes that Gao has sufficiently stated a claim for \njudicial dissolution under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55 -14-30(2)(i), (ii), and (iv), and that the \nMotion to Dismiss Dissolution Claim should be denied in its entirety. \nVII. CONCLUSION \n81. For the fo regoing reasons, the Court hereby DENIES the Rule 12(b)(6) \nMotions, except as to Gao’s direct claim for corporate waste, which the Court hereby \nDISMISSES with prejudice.  The Court also hereby DENIES the Motion to Dismiss \nDissolution Claim.   \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 21st day of December, 2016. \n \n \n /s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L.
