Powell Bail Bonding, Inc., 2018 NCBC 74. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \nNEW HANOVER COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 4462 \nRAUL S. BREWSTER, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nPOWELL BAIL BONDING, INC.; \nLARRY JACK POWELL; JOHN E. \nLEONARD, JR.; and CYNTHIA LEE, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS  \n \n \n1. Plaintiff Raul S. Brewster  is a minority shareholder  of Defendant Powell \nBail Bonding, Inc. (“PBB”), where he worked for nearly 20 years before being fired in \n2015.  In this action, Brewster contends that some of PBB’s  other shareholders  \ncarried out a wrongful scheme to  push him out of PBB’s day-to-day business and \nencumber his rights as a shareholder.  Brewster asserts claims for breach of fiduciary \nduty, civil conspiracy, and unfair or deceptive trade practices .  He also request s \njudicial dissolution of PBB. \n2. Defendants have jointly moved to dismiss Brewster’s claim for judicial \ndissolution for failure to join necessary parties  under Rule 12(b )(7) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Pro cedure.  Defendants have also moved to dismiss the  \nremaining claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under \nRule 12(b)(6).  Having considered the parties ’ filings, the Court  GRANTS in part \nand DENIES in part the motion. \n \n \n \nKurt Thompson Law, by G. Kurt Thompson, Jr., and The Atlantic Coast \nLaw Firm, by Mark J. Ihnat, for Plaintiff.  \n \nShipman & Wright, L.L.P., by W. Cory Reiss, for Defendants.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact in deciding motions filed under  \nRules 12(b)(6) or 12(b)(7).  The following factual summary is drawn from relevant \nallegations in the pleadings and the attached exhibits. \n4. PBB is in the business of bail bonding.  (Compl. ¶¶  2, 18 , ECF No. 3.)  \nBrewster joined PBB in 1997 “as a recovery agent, finding and arresting defendants \nwho skipped bail.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 20, 28.)  He stayed in that role  until 2005, when an \ninternal dispute reshaped PBB’s  management and ownership  and resulted in  \nDefendant Larry Jack Powell taking charge of the company.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 22–23.)  \nAt that time, Powell offered Brewster an equity stake to keep him at PBB and to \nprevent him from defecting to a competing company .  ( Compl. ¶  32.)  Brewster \naccepted and became a director, a “2 nd Vice President,” and a 20% equity owner of \nPBB.  (Compl. ¶¶ 33, 35.) \n5. Around the same time , Powell brought aboard additional employees and \nshareholders.  (Compl. ¶¶ 36–37.)  Powell’s daughter, Defendant Cynthia Lee, joined \nPBB as an employee, Secretary, an d 10% shareholder.  (Compl. ¶¶  10–11, 36.)  \nDefendant John Leonard, Jr. joined PBB as an employee, Vice President, and 10% \nshareholder.  (Compl. ¶¶  15, 37.)  Lee’s husband and Leonard’s wife also received a \n10% share each in PBB, though neither became an employee.  (Compl. ¶¶ 12–13, 16–\n \n \n17.)  In addition to taking on the duties of President, Powell retained a 20% stake in \nPBB, and his wife held the remaining 20% until her death.  (Compl. ¶¶ 6–9.) \n6. Brewster alleges that, over the next decade, he took responsibility for all of \nPBB’s “revenue generating operations .”  (Compl. ¶  48.)  Among other things,  \nBrewster “supervise[d] the writing of bonds by all associate bondsmen”; developed all \nof PBB’s “training programs”; set up PBB’s new offices; and personal ly wrote and \nissued bonds.  (Compl. ¶¶ 44–45.)  Brewster also entered into an Agency Agreement \nwith Accredited Surety & Casualty Company, Inc. , which “imposed all liability for \nbonds written by Defendant PBB’s bondsman upon ” him and “provided for the \nassumption of liability for all bonds previously written by” Powell .  (Compl. ¶¶ 38–\n40, Ex. A.) \n7. At some point, Brewster’s work environment became “hostile.”  (Compl. \n¶ 61.)  Powell, Lee, and Leonard  “systematically excluded ” Brewster from PBB’s \nfinancial matters : Brewster “was the only owner of Defendant PBB who was not \nnamed on [its] bank accounts” ; he  was “never allowed to ap prove” financial \ntransactions; and he was denied access to accounting and banking records, excluded \nfrom management meetings, and barred from accessing PBB’s safe.  (Compl. ¶¶ 48–\n49, 56 .)  Brewster’s demands to be included in the se matters were ignored .  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 51, 54–55.)  \n8. Tensions rose in September 2015 .  Brewster demanded to see PBB’s By-\nLaws, but the Individual Defendants “intentionally withheld, modified, destroyed, or \notherwise hid” them.  (Compl. ¶¶ 58, 60.)  Frustrated, Brewster wrote a letter voicing \n \n \nhis concerns and announcing his intent to divest himself of his share s of PBB.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 63–64.)  Lee responded on behalf of the company, notifying Brewster that, \neffective immediately, he would be placed on paid leave.  (Compl. ¶ 66, Ex. C.)  Lee \nalso expressed a desire “to find a long-term agreement” regarding Brewster’s future \nemployment and minority interest in PBB.  (Compl. ¶ 66, Ex. C.)   \n9. Brewster alleges that, instead of negotiating an agreement, PBB fired him.  \n(See Compl. ¶¶ 70–71.)  PBB’s attorneys demanded that Brewster “stay off . . . PBB’s \npremises,” “relinquish his bond powers,” and “return all other property belonging to” \nPBB.  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 67–68.)  On September 25, 2015 , PBB’s attorneys e -mailed \nBrewster to inform him  that his employment benefits were terminated, effective \nimmediately.  (Compl. ¶ 71.)  Brewster alleges that he “never quit nor consented t o \nthe termination of his employment” or to any of the other measures taken by PBB.  \n(Compl. ¶ 70.) \n10. On October 7, 2015 , less than two weeks after Brewster was fired,  PBB \ncalled a special shareholders’ meeting.  (Compl. ¶ 72.)  Only Powell, Lee, and Leonard \nand their spouses were present.  (See Compl. Ex. D.)  Brewster, through proxy, issued \na written statement objecting to the meeting, asserting that he had not resigned, and \ndemanding that he immediately be provided with all the compensation and benefits \nhe was owed.   (Compl. ¶ 72.)  During the meeting, Powell, Lee, and Leonard  were \nelected as the sole directors of PBB.  (Compl. ¶ 73.)  They immediately adopted new \nBy-Laws and,  a month later , approved a new Minority Shareholder Buy -Sell \nAgreement (“Shareholder Agreement”), both of which Brewster alleges were designed \n \n \nto encumber his rights as a minority shareholder  and to frustrate his reasonable \nexpectations.  (Compl. ¶¶ 73–77.)  \n11. According to Brewster, he is now in a difficult position.  Though no longer \nworking for PBB, he is still personally liable for approximately $32 million in bonds \nwritten by agents of PBB after his termination.  (Compl. ¶ 85.)  Yet by virtue of his \nexclusion as an owner and manager , he is prohibited from taking any action to \nmitigate his personal liability.  (Compl. ¶¶ 93–95.) \n12. Brewster initially filed suit in  January 2016, asserting claims for judicial \ndissolution, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy, along with requests for \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief .  On December 6, 2016, Brewster \nvoluntarily dismissed all claims .  Brewster filed this action on December 5, 2017, \nrenewing each of the causes of action  he had raised in the first suit and adding a  \nclaim for unfair or deceptive trade practices.  \n13. Defendants moved to dismiss Brewster’s claim for judicial dissolution for \nfailure to join necessary parties and to dismiss all other causes of action for failure to \nstate a claim.  The motion has been fully briefed, and the Court elects to resolve the \nmotion without a hearing.  See BCR 7.4. \nII. \nTHE RULE 12(B)(7) MOTION \n \n14. Brewster seeks an order judicially dissolving PBB under N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 55-14-30.  ( See Compl. ¶  112.)  Defendants argue  that “the shareholders in a \ncorporation are necessary parties to an action seeking judicial dissolution” and  that \nBrewster failed to join two of PBB’s shareholders (Lee’s husband and Leonard’s wife) \n \n \nas parties to this lawsuit.  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 3 [“Defs.’ Op. Br.”], \nECF No. 15 .)  Defendants contend “the Court should either order the shareholders \njoined or dismiss the claim” under Rule 12(b)(7).  (Defs.’ Op. Br. 3.)   \n15. This issue is squarely governed by statute : “It is not necessary to make \nshareholders parties to a proceeding to dissolve a corporation unless relief is sought \nagainst them individually.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-31(b) (emphasis added); see also \nBrady v. Van Vlaanderen, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *34 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 19, \n2017).  Brewster has not asserted any claims against  the absent shareholders, and \nhe has not alleged any wrongdoing by them.  Instead, Brewster alleges that they are \n“not employed or engaged in the management of” PBB and do not “exercise or benefit \nfrom the control or economic rights or benefits of their ownership independent of the \nrespective spouses.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 12–13, 16–17.)  \n16. The absent shareholders are therefore not necessary parties .  The Court \ndenies the motion to dismiss the claim for judicial dissolution. \nIII. \nTHE RULE 12(B)(6) MOTION \n17. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency of the \ncomplaint.”  Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs Grp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d \n755, 758 (1986).  “Dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when one of \nthe following three conditions is satisfied: (1) when the complaint on its face reveals \nthat no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when the complaint o n its face reveals the \nabsence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; (3) when some fact disclosed in the \n \n \ncomplaint necessarily defeats plaintiff’s claim.”  Jackson v. Bumgardner , 318 N.C. \n172, 175, 347 S.E.2d 743, 745 (1986). \n18. In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6)  motion, the Court must treat the well -pleaded \nallegations of the complaint as true and view the facts and permissible inferences “in \nthe light most favorable to” the non-moving party.  Ford v. Peaches Entm’t Corp., 83 \nN.C. App. 155, 156, 349 S.E.2d 82, 83 (1986); see also Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 98, \n176 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1970).  “[T]he court is not required to accept as true any \nconclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact.”  Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, \n147 N.C. App. 52, 56, 554 S.E.2d 840, 844 (2001).  \nA. Breach of Fiduciary Duty & Civil Conspiracy \n19. Brewster asserts his claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Powell, Lee, \nand Leonard.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 113–17.)  He alleges that these three Defendants , “as \nmajority and controlling shareholders” of PBB, “owe fiduciary duties to Mr. Brewster \nas the minority shareholder.”  (Compl. ¶  115.)  He further alleges that Powell, Lee, \nand Leonard breached their fiduciary duties by “thwart[ing]” Brewster’s reasonabl e \nexpectations and misusing their control to benefit themselves to Brewster’s \ndetriment.  (Compl. ¶ 115.)   \n20. Defendants contend that the complaint fails to state a claim because Powell, \nLee, and Leonard did not own a majority of PBB’s shares at the time of the alleged \nwrongdoing.  (Defs.’ Op. Br. 5–6.)  As a result, Defendants contend, they did not owe \nany fiduciary duty to Brewster as a minority shareholder.  ( Defs.’ Op. Br. 5.)  In the \nalternative, Defendants argue that their alleged actions did not consti tute a breach \n \n \nof any duty and that Brewster did not suffer any cognizable injury.  (Defs.’ Op. Br. 7–\n8.) \n21. To state a claim  for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must allege that: \n“(1) defendant owed plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) defendant breached his  fiduciary \nduty; and (3) the breach of fiduciary duty was a proximate cause of injury to plaintiff.”  \nMiller v. Burlington Chem. Co., LLC , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJan. 27, 2017) (citing Farndale Co., LLC v. Gibellini, 176 N.C. App. 60, 68, 628 S.E.2d \n15, 20 (2006)).  A fiduciary relationship exists when a person places special confidence \nin a party who “is bound to act in good faith and in the best interest of the” person \nreposing the confidence.  Lynn v. Fed. Nat’l Mortg. Ass’n , 235 N.C. App. 77, 81, 760 \nS.E.2d 372, 375 (2014).   \n22. Corporate shareholders generally do not owe a fiduciary duty to one another.  \nSee Freese v. Smith, 110 N.C. App. 28, 37, 428 S.E.2d 841, 847 (1993) .  But there is \nan exception: a controlling shareholder owes a fiduciary duty to protect the interests \nof minority shareholders.  See Gaines v. Long Mfg. Co. , 234 N.C. 340, 344 –45, 67 \nS.E.2d 350, 353 –54 (1951).   Typically, a controlling shareholder is a majority \nshareholder (or a group of shareholders with a n aggregated majority interest acting \nin concert).  See id. at 345, 67 S.E.2d at 354 (citing S. Pac. Co. v. Bogert, 250 U.S. 483, \n487–88 (1919)); Loy v. Lorm Corp., 52 N.C. App. 428, 432, 278 S.E.2d 897, 901 (1981).  \nIn a recent decision addressing an issue of first impression, the North Carolina Court \nof Appeals held “that a minority shareholder exercising actual control over a \ncorporation may be deemed a ‘controlling shareholder’ with a concomitant fiduciary \n \n \nduty to the other shareholders.”  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC, 796 S.E.2d 324, \n330 (N.C. Ct. App. 2016), review allowed, writ allowed, 369 N.C. 751, 799 S.E.2d 616 \n(2017). \n23. It is at best doubtful whether the complaint adequately alleges that Powell, \nLee, and Leonard are majority shareholders of PBB.  Each individual is a minority \nshareholder—Powell (20%), Lee (10%), and Leonard (10%) —and their aggregate \ninterest (40%) does not amount to a majority.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 7, 11, 15.)  Brewster \npoints to the fact that their spouses hold another 40%, but there are no  allegations \nreasonably suggesting that Powell, Lee, and Leonard controlled their spouses’ shares \nduring the relevant timeframe.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 8–9, 12, 16; Defs.’ Op. Br. 4–5.) \n24. Thus, the question is whether Brewster has “alleged facts from which it is \nreasonable to infer that a minority shareholder exercised actual control over the \ncorporation’s actions.”   Corwin, 796 S.E.2d at 332.  To determine whether a \nshareholder exercised actual control, courts may evaluate many factors, including  \n“the shareholder’ s percentage of voting shares, the relationship between the \nshareholder and the corporation, the shareholder ’s ability to appoint  directors, and \nthe shareholder’s ability to affect the outcome of particular transactions.”  Id. at 331.  \nA conclusory allegation of control is insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.  See id. \nat 332. \n25. Construing the complaint liberally, the Court concludes that Brewster has \nadequately alleged actual control.  The complaint expressly alleges that Powell, Lee, \nand Leonard acted in concert for purposes of making PBB’s financial and \n \n \nmanagement decisions.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 48–50, 55–56.)  Their combined 40% interest, \nalthough not a majority, is sufficiently large to permit an inference of control so long \nas the complaint includes other allegations tending to show the exercise of actual \ncontrol.  See Corwin, 796 S.E.2d at 332 ; see also Kahn v. Lynch Commc’n Sys. , 638 \nA.2d 1110, 1114 (Del. 1994)  (finding defendant with minority ownership of 43.3 \npercent exercised control over plaint iff’s business affairs) ; Williamson v. Cox \nCommuns., Inc., 2006 Del. Ch. LEXIS 111, at *16 n.48 (Del. Ch. June 5, 2006) (citing \ncases).   \n26. Here, the allegations do tend to show  that Powell, Lee, and Leonard used \ntheir collective interest to control PBB.  In October 2015, Powell, Lee, and Leonard  \nelected themselves as sole directors of the corporation  at a special shareholders \nmeeting.  (Compl. ¶¶ 70–73, Ex. D; see also Mem. in Opp’n to Mot. to Dismiss 6, ECF \nNo. 16.)  As newly elected directors, they quickly adopted new Corporate By -Laws \nand a Shar eholder Agreement, which Brewster alleges were designed to encumber \nhis rights as a minority shareholder.  (Compl. ¶¶ 73, 75–77.)  Domination and control \nover the board of directors  is often treated as a hallmark of  minority control in \nanalogous cases.  See Corwin, 796 S.E.2d at 332 (citing In re Morton’s Restaurant \nGrp., Inc., 74 A.3d 656, 664 –65 (Del. Ch. 2013)); see also White v. Kincaid, 149 N.C. \n415, 420, 63 S.E. 109, 111 (1908) (addressing fiduciary relationship when “controlling \nnumber of stockholders are exercising their authority in dictating the action of the \ndirectors”).  \n \n \n27. The complaint is less clear concerning the extent of control exercised by  \nPowell, Lee, and Leonard  prior to their election as directors.  Brewster does not \nidentify, for example, the makeup of the board of directors before October 2015, nor \ndoes he explain the relationship between the board and Powell, Lee, and Leonard \nduring that period.  He does alle ge, though, that Powell, Lee, and Leonard  were \nofficers of PBB, controlled PBB’s bank accounts, hired and fired permanent \nemployees, held exclusive management meetings, and maintained exclusive access to \nvarious corporate and financial records .  (Compl. ¶¶ 48, 56.)  Standing alone, these \nallegations might not be sufficient to overcome the presumption that minority \nshareholders are not controlling shareholders.  Paired with their later conduct as \ndirectors, though, the allegations of pervasive financial control support an inference \nthat Powell, Lee, and Leonard exercised control over PBB even before October 2015 .  \nAs our Supreme Court has explained, “[i]t is the fact of control” rather than \n“the particular means by which or manner in which the control is exer cised” that \nmatters.  Gaines, 234 N.C. at 344–45, 67 S.E.2d at 353 (citation omitted).  \n28. Taken together, the complaint’s allegations show that Powell, Lee, and \nLeonard acted in concert, jointly made all of PBB’s key financial and management \ndecisions to the  exclusion of Brewster, named themselves as PBB’s directors , and \nthen rewrote the company’s By-Laws and imposed a new Shareholder Agreement.  At \nthe pleading stage, these allegations are sufficient to give rise to an inference that \nPowell, Lee, and Leonard  were acting as controlling shareholders and, therefore, \nowed a fiduciary duty to Brewster as a minority shareholder.   \n \n \n29. Defendants also argue  that, even if a fiduciary relationship existed, \nBrewster has not alleged any breach of the fiduciary duty or any injury resulting from \na breach .  Specifically, Defendants  focus on Brewster’s loss of employment,  \ncontending that “the Complaint does not allege any facts demonstrating that a \nfiduciary duty owed to [ Brewster] required that PBB retain him as a permanent \nemployee.”  (Defs.’ Op. Br. 7.)   \n30. This is too narrow a reading of the complaint.  As Defendants’ brief \nrecognizes, lost employment is Brewster’s “chief complaint” but not his only \ncomplaint.  (Defs.’ Op. Br. 7.)   Brewster alleges more broadly that Defendants \nbreached their fiduciary duties to him by marginalizing him within PBB (Compl. \n¶¶ 48, 56, 60) ; limiting his ability to exercise his minority interest in PBB (Compl. \n¶¶ 48, 60, 72–77); and devaluing his shares (Compl. ¶¶ 48, 81–83).  Defendants ignore \nthese allegations and provide no reasoned basis to conclude that they are insufficient \nto support Brewster’s claim.  Accordingly, read in a light most favorable to Brewster, \nthe complaint  sufficiently alleges a breach of th e fiduciary duties owed by a \ncontrolling shareholder to a minority shareholder.  \n31. Finally, citing Norman v. Nash Johnson & Sons’ Farms, Inc., 140 N.C. App. \n390, 405, 537 S.E.2d 248, 258 –59 (2000) , Defendants argu e that Brewster cannot \nbring an individual claim for breach of fiduciary duty  while also seeking judicial \ndissolution.  (See Defs.’ Op. Br. 5 .)  The Court find s no support in Norman for this \nassertion and notes that plaintiffs are generally permitted to  plead alternative  \ntheories of recovery based on the same conduct or transaction.  See N.C. R. Civ. P.  \n \n \n8(e)(2).  Brewster’s assertion of a claim for judicial dissolution therefore does not \nautomatically require dismissal of his claim for breach of fiduciary duty. \n32. For these reasons, the Court concludes that Brewster has adequately stated \na claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  The Court also concludes that Brewster has \nstated a claim for civil conspiracy.  Defendants offer no independent basis to dismiss \nthe conspiracy claim other than their arguments that the underlying claim for breach \nof fiduciary duty should be dismissed.   Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss Brewster’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and civil conspiracy.  \nB. Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices \n33. Brewster’s claim for unfair or deceptive trade practices  is premised on the \nsame alleged conduct underlying his claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  (See Compl. \n¶¶ 125, 127.)  Defendants contend that the claim must be dismissed because the \nalleged conduct concerns only “the internal operations of PBB” and was therefore not \nin or affecting commerce.  (Defs.’ Op. Br. 9.) \n34. By statute, “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” \nare “unlawful.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  75-1.1.  As construed by our Supreme Court, this \nlanguage is broad enough “to regulate a business’s regular interactions with other \nmarket participants” but not so broad as to capture conduct “solely related to the \ninternal operations” of a business.  White v. Thompso n, 364 N.C. 47, 51 –52, 691 \nS.E.2d 676, 679 (2010).  Thus, “any unfair or deceptive conduct contained solely \nwithin a single business is not covered by” section 75 -1.1.  Id. at 53, 691 S.E.2d at \n680. \n \n \n35. This case is a classic shareholder dispute, having nothing to do with the type \nof unfair market conduct section 75 -1.1 was designed to address .  Brewster alleges \nthat Defendants ’ wrongful acts  include “obscuring company by -laws, dissipating \ncorporate assets, unlawfully terminating [Brewster], and obstructing [Brewster] from \naccess to his corporate assets and records.”  (Compl. ¶ 127.)  Each and every alleged \nact, taken as true, is clearly internal to PBB, a single market participant.  See, e.g., \nWheeler v. Wheeler , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 38, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. A pr. 25, 2018) \n(granting motion to dismiss in “dispute between the shareholders of a corporation \nregarding its internal management and the shareholders’ right to fair value for their \nownership interest”); Technik v. WinWholesale, Inc. , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 5, at  *23 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 13, 2012)  (granting motion to dismiss in “case center[ing] on \nPlaintiff’s termination as president of” corporation). \n36. Brewster’s claim is part of a regrettable trend in North Carolina business \nlitigation.  There exists an impulse to turn every shareholder dispute or disagreement \nbetween members of a limited liability company into a section 75 -1.1 claim.  In a \ngrowing body of case law following White, our courts “have recognized [these] disputes \nfor what they really are: intra -company feuds about internal operations.”  Potts v. \nKEL, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 24, at *14 (N.C.

Yet time and time again, section 75 -1.1 appears \nwhere it does not belong, with consequences that are significant and unhealthy.  The \nroutine addition of section 75 -1.1 claims in these cases  invites avoidable motions \npractice—driving up  the cost of litigation , taxing the resources of the Court , and \nexposing the plaintiff to a potential award of attorney fees under section 75 -16.1.  It \nalso impedes settlement  discussions by introducing remedies (including treble \ndamages) that would otherwise b e unavailable, thereby distorting the parties’ \nincentives and their perceived risks.   It is no surprise  then that “[c]ourts strive to \nkeep section 75 -1.1 (along with its promise of extraordinary damages) within its \n \n \nproper legal bounds.”  Post v. Avita Drugs, LLC , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *9 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Oct. 11, 2017). \n38. Here, Brewster’s allegations fall squarely within the rule stated in White \nand its progeny.  The Court therefore grants Defendants’ motion and dismisses the \nclaim for unfair or deceptive trade practices with prejudice. \nC. Remedial Claims \n39. The complaint purports to assert two causes of action for preliminary and \npermanent injunctive relief.  ( See Compl. ¶¶ 97–100, 101–04.)  But injunctions are \nremedies, not independent causes of action.   See, e.g., Revelle v. Chamblee, 168 N.C. \nApp. 227, 230, 606 S.E.2d 712, 714 (2005) (“A preliminary injunction is an ancillary \nremedy, not an independent cause of action.”) .  Accordingly, for purposes of clarity, \nthe Court grants Defendants’ motion to the extent it seeks dismissal of the purported \ncauses of action for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.  The Court renders \nthis decision without prejudice to Brewster’s ability to pursue whatever remedies he \nmay be entitled to by law or equity pursuant to his prayer for relief, which the Court \nconstrues to include requests for injunctive relief.  The Court will assess any motion \nfor a preliminary or permanent injunction, if filed, on its own merits and not as part \nof this Order .  See LendingTree, LLC v. Intercontinental Capital Grp., Inc. , 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 54, at *16–17 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 23, 2017). \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n40. For these reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the \nmotion to dismiss as follows.  \n \n \na. The Court DENIES the motion to dismiss  Brewster’s claims for judicial \ndissolution, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy. \nb. The Court  GRANTS the motion to dismiss the claim for  unfair or \ndeceptive trade practices and DISMISSES that claim with prejudice. \nc. The Court GRANTS the motion to dismiss the purported claims for \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief but does so without prejudice \nto Brewster’s right to pursue these remedies at an appropriate time. \n \nThis the 26th day of July, 2018. \n /s/ Adam M.
