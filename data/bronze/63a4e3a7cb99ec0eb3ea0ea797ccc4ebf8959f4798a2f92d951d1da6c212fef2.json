The \ncase was designated as exceptional under Rule 2.1 of the General Ru les of Practice and \nProcedure for the Superior and District Courts and assigned to the unders igned Special Superior \nCourt Judge for Complex Business Cases by order of  the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of \nNorth Carolina dated October 14, 2003.   \n{4} Following a dispute and appeal on the issue of  venue, the parties agreed to transfer \nvenue of this matter to Henderson County and also agreed not to challenge the assignment of the \ncase to the Business Court.  (Consent Order, Apr. 28, 2004.)   \n{5} The disputes between Plaintiff and Defendants Willcox, John S. Heinitsh, Nichols, and \nReginald D. Heinitsh, Jr. were compromised and approved by the Court in a Partial Consent \nJudgment dated June 13, 2005.  Plaintiff and De fendant Wachovia filed cross motions for \nsummary judgment on the issue of breach of fiduciary duty on February 28, 2006.  The Court \nheard oral arguments on the motions on Apr il 13, 2006.  All other claims, counterclaims, and \ncrossclaims between the parties have been resolved. \n \nII. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. \nTHE PARTIES \n{6} Plaintiff Beulah R. Heinitsh is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina.   \n{7} Defendant Wachovia Bank, National Associa tion f/k/a First Un ion National Bank, \nN.A. (“Wachovia”) is a national banking associat ion with its principal place of business in \nMecklenburg County, North Carolina.   \n{8} Defendant Agnes H. Willcox is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina. \n{9} Defendant John S. Heinitsh is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina. \n{10} Defendant Isabel H. Nichols is a resident of Transylvania County, North Carolina. \n{11} Defendant Reginald D. Heinitsh, Jr. (“Reg., Jr.”) is a resident of Transylvania County, \nNorth Carolina. \n{12} Plaintiff is the widow of Reginald D. Heinitsh, Sr. (“Reg., Sr.”). \n \n{13} Defendants Willcox, John Heinitsh, Nichols, and Reg., Jr. (“the children”) are the \nchildren of Reg., Sr. and Isabel Sloan Heinitsh (“Isabel”).   \n{14} Reg., Sr. and Isabel were married in 1941 and divorced on February 19, 1976.   \n{15} Reg., Sr. and Plaintiff were married on Ma rch 13, 1976.  They remained married until \nReg., Sr.’s death on September 27, 1992.   \nB. \nTHE 1987 AGREEMENT \n{16} In 1985, the children filed a lawsuit against their father in the District Court of \nTransylvania County.  Under a settlement agreement dated January 5, 1987 (“1987 Agreement”), \nthe children agreed to dismiss the suit.  Reg., Sr. ag reed to incur two obligations in return.  First, \nhe agreed to create an irrevo cable trust, funded with $900,000.  These funds were to be used for \nthe benefit of Isabel and Reg., Sr. during their lives.  At their respective deaths, the funds were to \nbe transferred to Isabel’s estate.  Reg., Sr. also agreed to pay $100,000 to Defendant Willcox in \nher capacity as Isabel’s guardian.  (Compl. ¶ 7.)   \n{17} Second, Reg., Sr. entered into a contract to make  a will.  He agreed that at least eighty \npercent of his residuary estate would pass to the children.  Ho wever, the contract also provided \nthat Reg., Sr. could place all or part of the propert y that was to go to the children in trust.  The \nincome would be paid to his su rviving spouse, and the remainde r would go to the children upon \nher death.  If the surviving spouse was Beulah Inma n (now Plaintiff Beulah Heinitsh), then the \ntrust could provide for the trustee in  its discretion to i nvade the principal of the trust for  health, \nsupport, and maintenance of Beulah Heinitsh.   (Compl. ¶ 8.)   \nC. \nTHE WILL AND MARITAL TRUST \n{18} On January 6, 1987, Reg., Sr. executed a Last Will and Testament.  (Compl.  ¶ 9.)  As \ncontemplated by the 1987 Agreement, the Will directed that eighty percent of the residuary \nestate be distributed to a trust known as the Beulah R. Heinitsh Marital Tr ust (“Marital Trust”).  \n(Compl. ¶ 10.)  Income was to be paid  to Plaintiff during her life.  So long as Plaintiff remained \nunmarried following Reg., Sr.’s death, she was also eligible to rece ive distributions of principal \nas the trustee deemed necessary to provide fo r her health, support, and maintenance.  The \nchildren were to receive the remaining principal and income at Plaintiff’s death.  (Compl. ¶ 11.)   \n \n{19} The Will appointed Wachovia 1 to serve as both personal re presentative of Reg., Sr.’s \nestate and trustee of the Marital Trust.  (Compl. ¶ 13.)   \n{20} Reg., Sr. died on September 27, 1992.  (Compl. ¶ 14.)   \nD. \nTHE 1996 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \n{21} During the administration of the estate of Reg., Sr., certain controversies arose \nregarding the valuation of Lake Toxaway Company (“LTC”), a real estate development company \nfounded by Reg., Sr. in 1960.  ( See Compl. ¶ 16.)  Controversies also arose regarding the actions \nof the officers and directors of LTC prior to Re g., Sr.’s death.  These controversies delayed the \nclosing of Reg., Sr.’s estate and consequently th e funding of the Marital Trust for a number of \nyears.  (Compl. ¶ 18.)  In 1996, LTC, Plaintiff, and Reg., Jr . resolved these disputes and entered \ninto a Settlement Agreement and Release (“1996 Settlement Agreement”).  (Compl. ¶ 19.)  The \n1996 Settlement Agreement allowed the estate to be closed and permitted funding of the Marital \nTrust.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 4.)   \n{22} With the closing of the estate, Wachovia wa s able to establish the Marital Trust as \ncontemplated by Reg., Sr.’s will.  For tax reasons, Wachovia established two trusts—a \nQualifying Terminable Interest Property trust and a Nonqualifying Termin able Interest Property \ntrust (collectively “the Trusts”).  (Statement of Stipulated Facts Between Pl. Beulah Heinitsh and \nDef. Wachovia Bank, N.A. ¶ 3, Feb. 13, 2006.)  As authorized by the will, the Trusts were \ncreated to hold eighty percent of  the residuary of Reg., Sr.’s estate .  (Compl. ¶ 28.)  As part of \nthis share in the residuary es tate, the Trusts came into ownership of 2,975 shares of common \nstock of LTC, constituting 48.217% of the issued and outstanding stock of LTC.  (See Compl. ¶¶ \n15, 29.)  Reg., Jr. was LTC’s largest shareholder with 3,147 shares.  (Pooling Agreement 2.)  \nTogether, the estate (and even tually the Trusts) and Reg., Jr. owned 99.2% of the outstanding \nstock of LTC.  (Settlement Agreement and Release, Dec. 31, 1996 1.)             \n{23} Wachovia and Reg., Jr., as shareholders of LTC, executed a Pooling Agreement \ncontemporaneously with and as a condition to the effectiveness of the 1996 Settlement \nAgreement.  (Compl. ¶ 20.)  Under the Poolin g Agreement, Wachovia and Reg., Jr. agreed to \n                                                 \n1 The Will was executed prior to the 2001 merger of First Union Corporation and Wachovia Corporation, see First \nUnion Corp. v. SunTrust Banks, Inc. , 2001 NCBC 9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2001), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2001%20NCBC%2009A.pdf, and appointed First Union as personal \nrepresentative and trustee.  For convenience and clarity, th e Court refers to the trustee as “Wachovia” throughout \nthis Order.   \n \nvote their shares to elect a majority of directors who would vote for a declaration of dividends by \nLTC according to a Dividend Policy which was at tached to the Pooling Agreement.  (Pooling \nAgreement 2.)  The Dividend Policy provided as follows: \nLTC shall pay dividends each year, equal to:  (i) the product of the combined \nhighest federal and North Carolina inco me tax rates (currently 47.15%) and the \nNet Income before taxes of LTC and (ii) the Adjusted Net Excess Cash.  \nDividends under the Dividend Policy shall be paid for each fiscal year of LTC on \nor before March 31 of the following fisc al year without further action of the \nBoard of Directors of LTC, and the first such dividend shall be paid on or before \nMarch 31, 1997, for LTC’s 1996 fiscal year. \n \n(Pooling Agreement Ex. A.)  The LTC board of  directors ultimately adopted the Dividend \nPolicy.  (Compl. ¶ 22.)   \n{24} Plaintiff entered into the 1996 Settlement Agreement “with the understanding and \nintent that the Dividend Policy would cause LTC to pay dividends each year to the Trusts, which \ndividends would be income to the Trusts and distri buted to her as the sole income beneficiary of \nthe Trusts.”  (Compl. ¶ 24.)   \nE. \nTHE PRESENT DISPUTE \n{25} After the Settlement Agreement, Pooling Agreement, and Dividend Policy were in \nplace, the parties entered a period of relative peace.  LTC con tinued to realize ordinary income \nfrom the development and sale of real estate.  This income was paid as dividends to the \nshareholders, including the Trusts.  (Compl.  ¶ 33.)  Until 2002, Wachovia considered the LTC \ndividends to be trust income, and distributed them to Plaintiff as the sole income beneficiary of \nthe Trusts.  (Statement of Sti pulated Facts ¶ 7.)  In 2002, Wac hovia noticed a change in LTC’s \nbusiness practices.  Rather than selling develo ped land in the normal course of business, LTC \nappeared to be liquidating a s ubstantial portion of its real es tate assets, including undeveloped \nand unimproved tracts.  LTC indicated to Wachovia “that it would thereafter operate primarily as \na retail real estate brokerage business,” (Zorigian Aff. ¶ 11), rather than a real estate development \ncompany.  This change in business practices generated far more income than LTC had realized in \nyears past or expected to earn in the future as a real estate developer.  (Zorigian Aff.  ¶ 12.)  LTC \ncharacterized this income as capital gain, ra ther than ordinary income, on its 2001 financial \nstatements and tax returns.  (Zorigian Aff.  ¶ 13.)  LTC was, in effect, liquidating its real estate \nholdings.  These events caused W achovia to question whether the di vidends the Trusts had been \n \nreceiving from LTC were properly characterized as  income or principal.   If the dividends \nconsisted of proceeds from a partial liquidation of  LTC, they should have been characterized as \nprincipal and left for the children as contingent remainder beneficiaries, rather than distributed to \nPlaintiff as the sole income beneficiary.  To help resolve this question, Wachovia sought advice \nfrom legal and accounting professionals.  (Zorigian Aff. ¶ 14.)   \n{26} As a result of these consultations, Wachovia concluded that “a si gnificant part of the \ndistributions from LTC to the trusts for tax year 2001, a lesser but material part of tax year 2000 \nand most of the distributions projection from 2002 and 2003 should be allo cated to principal.”  \n(Zorigian Aff. ¶ 15.A.)  Plaintiff took issue with  this conclusion and a dispute arose between her \nand the children as to the proper characterization of the LTC dividends.  (Zorigian Aff. ¶ 16.)  \nWachovia was caught in the middle.  This dispute culminated in the filing of this action, in \nwhich Plaintiff contends that all distributions paid by LTC to th e Trusts should be allocated to \nincome and paid to her.  (Compl. ¶¶ 53–54.)  Th e Complaint also allege s breach of fiduciary \nduty and unfair and deceptive trade practices against Wachovia.  (Compl. ¶¶ 57–70.)  All parties, \nincluding Wachovia, asked the Court to declare wh ether the distributions we re trust principal or \ntrust income.  The distributions paid by LTC to the Trusts for 2001 and 2002 total $6,886,491 \n(the “Disputed Funds”).  (Statement of Sti pulated Facts ¶ 9.)  Wachovia paid Plaintiff \n$2,021,660 from the 2001 distribution and thus reta ined $4,864,831 of the Disputed Funds.  The \n$4,864,831 is referred to as the “Retained Funds .”  (Statement of Stipulated Facts  ¶ 10.)  \nWachovia placed the Retained Funds into a single money market fund.  (Statement of Stipulated \nFacts ¶ 11.)  On March 31, 2004, the Court entered an  Order approving the investment of the \nRetained Funds as principal by Wachovia until th is litigation was resolved.  (Order, Mar. 31, \n2004.)   \nF. \nTHE BENEFICIARIES’ SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND ALLEGED DAMAGES \n{27} On December 24, 2004, Plaintiff and the con tingent remainder beneficiaries of the \nTrusts agreed to settle their differences over the Disputed Funds.  They agreed on an amount that \nwould be allocated to principal and an amount that would be allo cated to income.  On June 14, \n2005, the Court entered a Partial Consent Judgment  approving the terms of the beneficiaries’ \nsettlement.  Plaintiff continues to seek damages against Wachovia for breach of fiduciary duty \nfor investing the Retained Funds in a money mark et account during the pende ncy of the dispute.  \n \nShe “contends that the Court may calculate da mages by analyzing what the market value and \nincome performance of the Retained Funds w ould have been had Wachovia invested the \nRetained Funds when it received them in the sa me investment mix as the Bank selected on April \n14, 2004” when the Court ordered they be invested  as principal until the case was resolved.  \n(Statement of Stipulated Facts ¶ 19.)  Thus, Plaintiff argues that damages should be calculated as \nif the Retained Funds had been invested as principal.       \n{28} The Retained Funds were invested at a lo w rate.  The money market account where \nWachovia placed the Retained Funds earned an estimated annual yield ranging from 0.720% to \n1.580%.  By comparison, the assets that were treate d as principal were inve sted in a tax-exempt \nmunicipal bond fund, earning an estimated annu al yield ranging from 4.565% to 5.208%.  (Pl. \nBeulah R. Heinitsh’s Statement of Claims Against Wachovia Bank, N.A. ¶ 9.)   \n \nIII. \nMOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nA. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n{29} Summary judgment is proper “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show th at there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact and that any party is entitle d to judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. \nP. 56(c).  “It is not the purpose of the rule to resolve disputed material issues of fact but rather to \ndetermine if such issues exist.”  N.C. R. Civ. P.  56 cmt.  The burden of showing a lack of triable \nissues of fact falls upon the moving party.  See, e.g., Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. \nCo., 313 N.C. 488, 491, 329 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1985).  Once this burden has been met, the \nnonmoving party must “produce a forecast of eviden ce demonstrating that [it] will be able to \nmake out at least a prima facie case at trial.”  Collingwood v. Gen. Elec. Real Estate Equities, \nInc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989).  The Court must exercise caution in granting \na motion for summary judgment.  N.C. Nat’l Bank v. Gillespie , 291 N.C. 303, 310, 230 S.E.2d \n375, 379 (1976).     \n \n \n \n \nB. \nRELEVANT TRUST LAW \n{30} There is remarkably little guidance from  trust law commentator s or our appellate \ncourts regarding situations such as this in which a trustee is faced  with a dispute among \nbeneficiaries over the proper charact erization of funds.  In the ab sence of specific authority, the \nCourt must rely on general principl es of fiduciary and trust law.  It is clear that a “trustee under \nany trust” is a fiduciary.  N.C.  Gen. Stat. § 32-2 (2005) .  A fiduciary relati onship “exists where \nthere has been a special confid ence reposed in one who in e quity and good conscience is bound \nto act in good faith and in due regard to the one reposing confidence.”  Moore v. Bryson, 11 N.C. \nApp. 260, 265, 181 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1971).  The details of  a trustee’s fiduciary duty in investing \nproperty is defined by statute as follows:   \nIn acquiring, investing, rei nvesting, exchanging, retain ing, selling, and managing \nproperty for the benefit of another, a fi duciary shall observe the standard of \njudgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing, whic h an ordinarily \nprudent person of discretion and intelligence, who is a fiduciary of the property of \nothers, would observe as such fiduciary . . . . \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 32-71(a).  More specifically, “[a] trustee shall invest and manage trust assets as \na prudent investor would, by considering the purposes, terms,  distribution requirements, and \nother circumstances of the trust. ”  Id. § 36C-9-902(a) (emphasis adde d).  In carrying out these \nduties, “the trustee shall exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution.”  Id.  The statute specifically \nauthorizes the trustee to consider “[n]eeds for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or \nappreciation of capital” when making investment and management decisions.  Id. § 36C-9-\n902(c)(7).   \n{31} As custodians of the property of others, trus tees must be cautious  and, to a certain \nextent, conservative in their a pproach to investing.  The requi rement of caution “requires the \ntrustee to invest with a view both to safety of the capital a nd to securing a reas onable return.”  \nRestatement (Third) of Trusts § 227 cmt. e ( 1992).  However, “the degree of conservatism \nrequired and thus the degree of risk permitted for a particular trust is ultimately a matter for \ninterpretation and judgment.”  Id.  The trustee must “make reasonable efforts to ascertain the \npurposes of the trust and to understand the types of investments suitable to those purposes in \nlight of all the relevant circumstances.”  Id.   \n \n{32} Although a trustee is generally obligated to  diversify investments and endeavor to \nsecure a reasonable return, the trustee must also  consider the specific facts and circumstances \nbefore it.  Trusts “differ considerably in their risk-bearing capacities,” and “[i]f a trust cannot \ntolerate adverse outcomes in the short run, the tr ustee should not adopt a high risk-reward \nstrategy.”  Id.  An example of when a trust would not be  able to tolerate short-run adversity \nwould be when there is a dispute as to the proper  characterization of funds.  In that situation, \nadditional caution is warranted.  One treatise notes as follows: \nOccasionally the trus tee has good reason for holding the trust property in an \nunproductive condition and he will not be liable to pay to the beneficiary for \neither interest or the value of the use m easured in any other way.  Thus where the \nmoney is held under a mistake of law, or  where the money is held during a period \nwhen there is no duty to pay over or invest, or where th e trustee has in good faith \npaid the money to the wrong party under a mi stake of law, or where the trustee is \nholding the money to await the determinati on of conflicting claims to it, or there \nis no unreasonable delay in applying th e trust money and no use of it by the \ntrustee for his own purposes . . . there may be no liability to pay interest.  \n \nGeorge Gleason Bogert et al., The Law of Trusts and Trustees  § 863 (2d rev. ed. 1978).  A good \nexample of this principle in action is found in the New Jersey case of Liberty Title & Trust Co. v. \nPlews, 61 A.2d 297 (N.J. Ch. 1948), modified on other grounds , 70 A.2d 784 (N.J. Super. Ct. \nApp. Div. 1950), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds , 77 A.2d 219 (N.J. 1950).  In \nPlews, the trustee did not invest funds which came  into his possession after the death of the \ntrust’s life tenant.  Id. at 297.  After the life tenant died, al l parties were of the opinion that the \ndisputed issues could be resolved quickly and that a distribution could be made sooner rather \nthan later.  Id.  Ultimately the case took mu ch longer to resolve than the parties contemplated.  \nId. at 298.  However, the court foun d that the trustee was not negligent in his decision to keep \n“the cash on hand liquid for distribution.”  Id.  The court held that “[a] fiduciary who has a \nreasonable expectation that he may be called upon on an early date to make distribution may, for \na reasonable time, hold the cash uninvested for the purpose of making such distribution.”  Id.  \nThe trustee reasonably believed it  would be called on to distribut e the cash in the immediate \nfuture, and appropriately and in good faith pla nned for that event.  “It is only when under \ncircumstances where a failure of the trustee to i nvest trust funds may be deemed negligent that \nsuch trustee is held liable . . . .”  Id.   \n \n{33} The trustee’s good faith in th e commission of its duties is an important consideration \nfor North Carolina courts in revi ewing the trustee’s actions.  In Carter v. Young, 193 N.C. 678, \n137 S.E. 875 (1927), the Supreme Court of North Carolina stated the following: \nWhen it appears that a trustee has exer cised, or proposes to exercise, such \ndiscretion in good faith, and with an honest purpose to effectua te the trust, the \ncourts will not undertake to supervise or control his actions.  They will not \nundertake to set aside or over-ride his judgment in matters clearly committed to \nhis discretion, and to substitute therefor the judgment of others, or their own \njudgment, upon the sole allegation that the action of the trustee is not wise or just.   \n \nId. at 681–82, 137 S.E. at 877.  Accordi ngly this Court will not overt urn the actions of a trustee \nacting in good faith to carry out the intentions of the grantor.   \nC. \nANALYSIS \n{34} As trustee of the Marital Trusts, Wachovia stood in a fiduciary relationship to both \nPlaintiff as income beneficiary and the children as remainder beneficiaries.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § \n32-2.  In dealing with trust funds, Wachovia was th erefore subject to the rules described above.  \nThe Court must determine if there is a genuine issue of material fact over whether Wachovia ran \nafoul of these rules.  Given the facts of this case, the Court concludes that no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact exists.   \n{35} As noted above, the law requires trustees to be cautious and consider all the relevant \ncircumstances in making investment decisions.  The evidence here shows that Wachovia made \nits decision to place the Retained Funds in a mo ney market account after careful consideration of \na number of circumstances unique to this trust.  When a dispute arose between the income and \nremainder beneficiaries, Wachovia wisely saw the need to be especially cautious in light of the \nHeinitsh family’s history of litigation.  These pa rties had taken their dis putes to the courts on \nseveral prior occasions, and it was reasonable to conclude that this matter might ultimately be the \nsubject of litigation.  The children filed a lawsuit against their father, Reg., Sr., in 1985, resulting \nin the contract to make a will and the contempl ation of the Trusts.  Controversies arose during \nthe administration of Reg., Sr.’s estate, lead ing to the 1996 Settlement Agreement.  And \npredictably, a legal controversy ar ose regarding trust distributions, resulting in the filing of this \naction.  Historically, the various factions of the family ultimately settled their disputes.   \n \n{36} When a dispute arose as to the proper characterization of the LTC dividends, \nWachovia considered this history of conflict and settlement.  If  it characterized the funds as \nincome, it was likely to be  sued by the remainder beneficiaries.  If it characteri zed the funds as \nprincipal, it was likely to be sued by the income beneficiary.  On the horns of this dilemma, the \ntrustee placed the funds in a money market account and urged the parties to settle the dispute. \n{37} Wachovia’s decision to keep th e funds in a money market account during the time it \nwas attempting to broker a compromise was reas onable under the circum stances.  Although the \nparties had a history of conflict, Wachovia hoped to resolve the matter and distribute the funds \naccordingly.  Even after this action was commenced, the parties consented to stay the litigation \nin the hopes of resolving the matter through a mediat ed settlement conference.  The mediator did \nnot declare an impasse until July 1, 2003.  Based on these good faith settlement discussions, \nWachovia planned for the possibility that the funds would have to be distributed quickly.  Such a \npossibility required that the funds be kept liquid, which Wachovia accomplished through the \nmoney market investment.   Had Wachovia invested the Disputed Funds as principal and without \nregard for liquidity, the funds w ould not have been readily availa ble for distribution in the event \nof a settlement, thus exposing the trustee to liability on yet another front. \n{38} Wachovia was well within its discretion to consider a potential settlement and the \nresulting need for liquidity in its decision to keep the Retained Funds in a money market account.  \nThe relevant statute explicitly au thorizes trustees to consider “[n]eeds for liquidity” in managing \ntrust assets.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 36C-9-902(c)(7).  There is al so authority in the commentary and \nfrom another jurisdiction indicating that it is proper for trustees faced with conflicting claims to \nfunds to keep the funds as liquid as possible.  See Plews, 61 A.2d at 298; Bogert, supra, § 863.  \nIn Plews, the trustee was faced with a dispute be tween beneficiaries and expected a quick \nresolution.  Id. at 297.  The dispute took longer than anticipated to resolve.  Id. at 298.  \nNevertheless, the court held that the trustee was not liable for holding the funds uninvested for \nthe sake of liquidity.  Id. at 299.  Wachovia was faced with a si milar situation here.  There was a \ndispute between beneficiaries, and a settlement c ould have come at any time, whether as a result \nof informal discussions between the parties or the mediated settlement conference convened after \nthe filing of the complaint.  Like the trustee in Plews, the trustee here had “a reasonable \nexpectation that he may be called upon on an  early date to make [a] distribution.”  Id. at 298.  \nBarring negligence or bad faith, a trustee will not be held liable in these circumstances.   \n \n{39} There is no genuine issue of  material fact on the issue of Wachovia’s good faith in \ntaking the actions described above.  Wachovia’s ra tionale in carrying out its duties is found in \nthe affidavit of William Edmond Zorigian, the trus t officer responsible for the Heinitsh Trusts.  \nAccording to Mr. Zorigian, \nWachovia’s primary concern was making su re that the Retained Funds did not \ndecline in value.  Therefor e, instead of investing the Retained Funds in any asset \nthat potentially fluctuated in value, the Retained Funds  were invested in a money \nmarket account . . . .  In my opinion, prio r to this Court’s Order of March 31, \n2004, which allowed Wachovia to invest the Retained Funds as trust corpus, it \nwould have been imprudent to invest th e Retained Funds in any asset that was \nsubject to market fluctuations, including fixed income securities. \n \n(Zorigian Aff. ¶¶ 19, 22.)  Plainti ff has offered no evidence to indicate that Wachovia was not \nacting in good faith or was negligent in its duty to properly balance the interests of the income \nand remainder beneficiaries other than the low return on the funds.  On the contrary, Wachovia’s \nactions with regard to the Retained Funds were fair to all parties.  By placing the Retained Funds \nin a money market account, there was no risk that  they would become th e victim of a downturn \nin the market.  The Retained Funds were also liquid enough to be readily available for possible \ndistribution to the income beneficiary.   \n{40} The Court also notes Plaintiff’s inconsistent position with respect to these funds.  This \nlawsuit arose because Plaintiff and the children had a disagreement over whether the funds were \nto be characterized as trust income  or trust principal.   It is Plaintiff’s position that these funds \nwere income and that Wachovia should have paid  the funds to her without delay.  However, \nPlaintiff also argues to this C ourt that it was improper for Wac hovia to invest the funds in a \nmoney market account and that th e trustee should have invested the funds as it would have \ninvested trust principal.  \n{41} Wachovia considered the funds to be in dispute.  As Mr . Zorigian indicated in his \naffidavit, “[b]ecause of the ongoing dispute be tween Beulah Heinitsh and the Remainder \nBeneficiaries as to whether the retained Funds were principal or income . . . Wachovia did not \nconsider the Retained Funds to be trust corpus.  Accordingly, absent intervention from the Court \nor consent from all of the bene ficiaries, until the dispute was resolved, it would not have been \nappropriate to invest the Retain ed Funds as trust corpus.”  (Zorigian Aff. ¶ 19.)  Wachovia was \nfaced with the following situation:  Plaintiff was arguing that the Funds were income.  The \nchildren were arguing that the funds were principal.   For Wachovia to ignore Plaintiff and invest \n \nthe funds as principal would have been an odd solution indeed.  Wachovia was protecting the \ninterests of both income and remainder beneficiaries.   \n{42} It is the trustee’s job to make these t ypes of decisions and carefully balance the \ninterests of the income and remainder benefi ciaries.  Wachovia acted reasonably and in good \nfaith, and the Court does not find its decisions to be negligent, improper, or a breach of fiduciary \nduty.  To do so would discourage persons and institutions from serving as trustees.  Trustees, \ninstitutional or otherwise, are sometimes caught in the middle of  disputes between beneficiaries.  \nIn these situations, the law directs trustees to use caution, consider all the surrounding \ncircumstances, and carefully balance the interest s of both income and remainder beneficiaries.  \nWachovia did not cause the disput e in this case.  When the di spute arose, the trustee acted \nconservatively and in good faith.  There is no genuine  issue of material fact  as to whether these \nactions were in breach of the trustee’s fiduciary duties to Plaintiff.     \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{43} Based on the foregoing, it is hereby OR DERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that \nDefendant Wachovia’s Motion for Summary Judg ment is GRANTED.  Plaintiff’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment is DENIED.   \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED, this the 11th day of June, 2007. \n    \n "
