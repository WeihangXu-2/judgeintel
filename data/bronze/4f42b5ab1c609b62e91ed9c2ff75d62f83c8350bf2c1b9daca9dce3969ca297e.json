THIS MATTER is before the Court upon Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions \nAgainst Defendant SS&C Technologies, Inc. Pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 37 (the \n“Motion”) in the above-captioned case.

Wolf, Chaffin Family \nLimited Partnership, and Solaris Capital, LLC. \n \nAlston & Bird, LLP, by Ryan P. Ethridge, Michael A. Kaeding, and \nJessica P. Corley, for Defendant SS&C Technologies, Inc. \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \n \nI. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n2. The Court has previously discussed the claims and allegations involved in \nthis action in the Court’s Order and Opinion on SS&C’s Motion to Dismiss, reported \nat Bradshaw v. Maiden, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 80 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2015)  (the \n“Motion to Dismiss Opinion”) .  This case arises from an alleged multi -million dollar \n“Ponzi scheme” run by Defendant Stephen A. Maiden  (“Maiden”) through a hedge \nfund titled the Maiden Capital Opportunity Fund, LP (the “Fund”).  Defendant SS&C \nTechnologies, Inc. (“SS&C”) was the Fund’s administrator from approximately 2007 \nthrough the Fund’s collapse in 2013.  Plaintiffs were investors in the Fund. \n3. Plaintiffs’ allegations against SS&C center on SS&C’s performance of its \nadministrative duties.  To give three examples, Plaintiffs contend that SS&C did not \nfollow standard GAAP procedures, did not obtain reasonable documentation to verify \nthe accuracy of informa tion provided to SS&C by Maiden , and continued  issuing \ncapital statements to Plaintiffs despite SS&C’s knowledge of record inaccuracies .  \nBradshaw, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 80, at *16 , *22–23.  As a result of these practices, \nPlaintiffs allege that SS&C communicated false information to Plaintiffs and caused \nPlaintiffs to suffer financial loss  by allowing Maiden’s Ponzi scheme to continue \nunnoticed.  Id. at *9–10. \n4. In an effort to discover relevant information about the policies and \nprocedures SS&C had in place while it was administering the Fund, Plaintiffs served \nSS&C with Plaintiffs’ First Set of Interrogatories and First Requests for Production \nof Documents (the “Requests for Production”) on August 21, 2015.  Of those requests, \nRequests 20–22 and 35 sought the following: \n20. All writings, recordings, and p hotographs that relate or refer to SSC’s \npolicies, standards, and practices from 2006 to 2015 with respect to hedge \nfund administration. \n \n21. All writings, recordings, and photographs that relate or refer to SSC’s \npolicies, standards, and practices from 20 06 to 2015 that apply to SSC’s \naccounting work for hedge funds. \n \n22. All writings, recordings, and photographs that relate or refer to SSC’s \npolicies, standards, and practices from 2006 to 2015 that apply to SSC’s \nrecord keeping for hedge funds. \n \n. . . .  \n \n35. All writings, recordings, and photographs that relate or refer to SSC’s \npolicies, procedures, and standards from 2006 to 2015 for entering into \nadministrative and/or accounting engagements with hedge funds. \n \n(Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 2, at 8–9, 11, ECF No. 128.2.)   \n5. In response to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production, SS&C agreed to produce  \nall the documents SS&C contended  it had that “relate[d] directly to its work for the  \nFund.”  (Mem. Law Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Compel Disc. Def.  12, ECF No. 68.)   SS&C \nobjected to Plaintiffs’ Requests 20 –22 and 35, however, arguing that these requests \nwere vague, unduly burdensome,  overly broad, and not reasonably limited in \ntemporal scope.  (Mem. Law Opp’n P ls.’ Mot. Compel Disc. Def.  Ex. 2, at 31–35, 46–\n48 [hereinafter “Answers to Requests”], ECF No. 71.)  In addition, SS&C contended \nthat Requests 20–22 and 35 were not relevant to any remaining claims or defenses in \nthe case as a result of the Court’s Motion to Dismiss Opinion.  (Answers to Requests \n31–35, 46–48.) \n6. The Motion to Dismiss Opinion altered the course of this case in several \nways.  Plaintiffs brought claims against SS&C for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding \nand abetting common law fraud, gross negligence, grossly negligent \nmisrepresentation, aiding and ab etting constructive fraud, violation of N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 78A-52(c)(2), civil conspiracy, and punitive damages.  Bradshaw, 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 80, at * 10.  With respect to Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of fiduciary duty, the \nCourt concluded that SS&C’s duties w ere limited under North Carolina law to the \nduties SS&C was obligated to perform under the agreement between SS&C and the \nFund.  Id. at *36.  Consequently, and because Plaintiffs had failed to plead that \nPlaintiffs reposed confidence in SS&C or that SS&C h ad occupied a position of \ndominance over Plaintiffs, no fiduciary duty existed between SS&C and Plaintiffs .  \nId.  Accordingly, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs’  claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  \nId.  The Court also dismissed, for unrelated reasons, Plaintiffs’ claim for aiding and \nabetting common law fraud.  Id. at *38. \n7. With respect to Plaintiffs’ claim for gross negligence, t he Court concluded \nSS&C’s motion to dismiss should be denied in a limited capacity: \n[T]he Court concludes that SS&C’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs ’ gross \nnegligence claim . . . should be denied insofar as Plaintiffs ’ claim is based on \nallegations that SS&C knowingly and willfully disseminated false and \ninaccurate information to Plaintiffs, knowingly and willfully failed to utilize \nGAAP and/or other applicable accounting standards required of SS&C under \nthe [agreement with the Fund] in preparing the financial information SS&C \nprovided to Plaintiffs, knowingly and willfully manipulated the Fund ’s \naccounting, and all other willful and knowing acts Plaintiffs plead that were \nin violation of SS&C ’s duties under the [agreement with the Fund ] and \napplicable law. \n \nId. at *23–24.  The Court also limited Plaintiffs’ claim for grossly negligent \nmisrepresentation in this manner: \n[T]he Court will allow the claim to proceed at this early stage and will assume \nfor purposes of this Motion that a claim for grossly negligent \nmisrepresentation is properly stated by alleging the elements of a claim for \nnegligent misrepresentation, together with allegations of willful and wanton \nconduct, similar to the allegations necessary to support Plaintiffs ’ claim for \ngross negligence as discussed above. \n \nId. at *26.  The Court allowed Plaintiffs’ claims for aiding and abetting constructive \nfraud, violation of section 78A -56(c)(2), civil conspiracy, and punitive damages to \nproceed to discovery.  Id. at *48. \n8. In responding to Plaintiffs’ Requests  20–22 and 35 , SS&C relied on the \nabove-quoted portions of the Motion to Dismiss Opinion  to assert, in essence, that \n“any SS&C internal policies, standards and practices applicable to [the information \nsought by Requests 20–22 and 35] are not relevant to the remaining claims” because \nthose claims “are strictly limited to knowing and willful vi olations of the standards \nand duties imposed on SS&C under the terms of the [agreement with the Fund].”  \n(Answers to Requests 32, 34–35, 47.)  As a result, SS&C argued, it was not required \nto produce further documents in response to Requests 20–22 and 35.  \n9. Not satisfied with SS&C’s answers and objections, Plaintiffs filed a motion \nto compel (the “Motion to Compel”) .  Plaintiffs countered SS&C’s arguments by \ncontending that Requests  20–22 and 35  sought relevant information because “a \npattern of noncompliance  with policies and standards is a relevant factor in the \ndetermination of willful or wanton negligence. ”  (Pls.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Compel \nDisc. 10, ECF No. 90.) \n10. At the April 27, 2016 hearing on the Motion to Compel, the Court questioned \ncounsel for SS&C as follows: \n All right.  [Counsel for SS&C], let me ask you, for example, with No. \n22, he’s asking for documents that relate to the policies, standards, and \npractices that apply to SS&C’s recordkeeping for hedge funds.  It seems \nbeyond dispute that SS&C had a recordkeeping obligation under the \n[agreement with the Fund].  So is SS&C’s position that there are no such \npolicies, standards, and practices? \n \n(Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 10, at 32 [hereinafter “Tr.”], ECF No. 128.10.)  In \nresponse, counsel for SS&C stated, “There are no documents, correct.”  (Tr. 32.)  SS&C \ntook the position that there were no documents to be produced pursuant to Plaintiffs’ \ndiscovery requests because SS&C allegedly had no written policies, standards, and \npractices that related to the work it did for the Fund.  (Tr. 32–33.)   \n11. After further discussion on this point between the Court and SS&C’s \ncounsel, counsel for Plaintiff interjected: \n Your Honor, here’s the problem that I’ve got with, you know, how we’re \napproaching this.  They’re making a relevancy determination on what policies \nand procedures apply to what they were supposed to be doing for the [Fund].  \nI mean, we’re in the discovery stage. . . .  \n \n . . . [T]o have them say we made this relevancy determination without \nhaving an opportunity ourselves to look at the documents seems a little \nunfair, particularly at the discovery stage. \n \n(Tr. 33–34.) \n \n12. Following this statement from Plaintiffs’ counsel, t he Court attempted to \nclarify SS&C’s position  by asking whether SS&C had policies, standards, and \npractices that related to hedge fund administration , accounting, or engagement in \ngeneral.  (Tr. 34–37.)  SS&C stated that there we no documents  responsive to those \nbroad inquiries either.  (Tr. 34 –37.)  In light of SS&C’s representations, the Court \nstated it “would be inclined to grant the Plaintiffs’ motion as to [Requests 20–22 and \n35].”  (Tr. 37.)  The Court further remarked, “It appears that’s no skin off [SS&C’s] \nback because you say there are no such policies, practices, standards.  And I suppose \nif you all engage in further discovery  . . . [and] you think that that’s not an accurate \nstatement, then I guess we’ll come back here.”  (Tr. 37.) \n13. The Court memorialized its oral ruling in the Order on Motions1 to Compel \nentered May 20, 2016 (the “Order Compelling Production”).  In the Order Compelling \nProduction, after noting SS&C’s contentions, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs’ \nRequests 20 –22 and 35 were reasonably calculated to lead to  the discovery of  \nadmissible evidence and granted Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel as to those requests:   \n Plaintiffs’ Requests No. 20 –22 and 35 seek:  “Documents that refer or \nrelate to SS&C’s policies, standards, and practices that apply to: (1) SS&C’s \nwork in hedge fund administration (RPD 20), (2) SS&C’s accounting work for \nhedge funds (RPD 21), and (3) SS&C’s record keeping for hedge funds (RPD \n22).  Plaintiffs also requested documents that refer or relate to SS&C’s \npolicies and standards for entering into administration or accounting \nengagements with hedge funds (RPD 35). ”  Defendants contend that these \nrequests are irrelevant because the Court’s August 10 Order determined that \nthe duti es SS&C owed to Plaintiffs were largely constrain ed by the \n[agreement] entered into between SS&C and the Fund.  Defendants also take \nthe position that there are no responsive documents that have not already \nbeen produced.  The Court concludes that these re quests are reasonably \ncalculated to lead to admissible evidence, and the Court therefore grants \nPlaintiffs’ Motion as to Requests 20–22 and 35. 2 \n \n(Order Mots. Compel 4, ECF No. 102 (emphasis omitted) (citations omitted).) \n                                                 \n1 The Court also ruled on a motion to compel  brought by SS&C.  The details of that motion \nare irrelevant to the current matter before the Court. \n \n2 Rule 26 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure permits “[p]arties [to] obtain \ndiscovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter \ninvolved in the pending action.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b )(1).  “To be relevant for purposes of \ndiscovery, the information [sought] need only be ‘reasonably calculated’ to lead to the \ndiscovery of admissible evidence.”  Shellhorn v. Brad Ragan, Inc., 38 N.C. App. 310, 314, 248 \nS.E.2d 103, 106 (1978) \n \n14. Approximately one year later, in June 2017, SS&C conducted its depositions \nof expert witnesses retained by Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs’ experts were prepared to testify \nthat SS&C lacked relevant policies and procedures.  In questioning these experts , \ncounsel for SS&C referred to SAS 70 or SOC -1 reports (“SAS 70-type audits”) and \nasked how the existence of those reports would influence the experts’ opinions.  (Pls.’ \nBr. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 14, Dep . Joseph P. Belanger 27 8–81, Dep . Frank \nBuckless 207, ECF No. 128.14 .)  SAS 70s or SOC -1s are reports prepared by third \nparties on policies and procedures placed in operation at service organizations like \nSS&C.  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 6, ECF No. 128.6.)  At least one of SS&C’s \nprevious deponents, George Schnell, had mentioned these aud its were done, but \nSS&C had not indicated prior to the depositions of Plaintiffs’ experts that SS&C  \nbelieved the audit documents were relevant to Plaintiffs’ experts’ opinions regarding \nSS&C’s policies and procedures.  SS&C contends that it did not so indi cate because \nit was unaware that Plaintiffs’ experts were going to offer opinions based on SS&C’s \nalleged failure to have policies or procedures in place.   \n15. Following the depositions, SS&C produced 417 pages of SAS 70-type audits \ncovering SS&C’s administration and accounting policies and procedures for the years \n2008–12.  These documents purportedly lent credence to SS&C’s case.  During a later \ndeposition, SS&C’s expert witness testified that although he had already formed the \nmajority of his opinions, reviewing SS&C’s SAS 70 -type audits reinforced and \nprovided further support for those opinions. \n16. Plaintiffs also discovered, through their own efforts, additional SAS 70-type \naudits for the years 2006 and 2007.   Later still, Plaintiffs  obtained policy and \nprocedure manuals generated by SS&C’s Investor Relations business unit through a \nsearch of New York courthouse records.  \n17. Following these developments, Plaintiffs initiated a Business Court Rule  \n(“BCR”) 10.9 request for a telephone conference.  In light of the nature of the issues \nreported by Plaintiffs , the Court exercised its discretion under B CR 10.9(b)(1) and \nordered Plaintiffs to file a formal motion and brief concerning the matters discussed \nin their 10.9 statement .  Plaintiffs then filed the Motion, asking the Court to strike \nSS&C’s answer and affirmative defenses or enter judgment by default against SS&C. \n18. The Motion is fully briefed, a hearing has been held, and the Mot ion is ripe \nfor determination. \nII. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n19. Rule 37(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure permits a court to \norder a variety of sanctions against a party who fails to obey a court order regarding \ndiscovery.  See F.E. Davis Plumbing Co . v. Ingleside W. Assocs. , 37 N.C. App. 149, \n152, 245 S.E.2d 555, 557 (1978).  These sanctions include, but are not limited to, the \nestablishment of facts, the exclusion of evidence, the striking out of pleadings or parts \nthereof, or the dismissal of an action.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2).   \n20. “The imposition of sanctions under Rule 37 ‘is in the sound discretion of the \ntrial judge and cannot be overturned absent a showing of abuse of that discretion.’”  \nIn re Pedestrian Walkway Failure, 173 N.C. App. 237, 246, 618 S.E.2d 819, 826 (2005) \n(quoting Bumgarner v. Reneau, 332 N.C. 624, 631, 422 S.E.2d 686, 690 (1992)).  The \ntrial court will only be held to have abused its discretion “ where the court's ruling is \nmanifestly unsupported by reason or is so arbitrary that  it could not have been the \nresult of a reasoned decision.”  E. Brooks Wilkins Family Med., P.A. v. WakeMed, 244 \nN.C. App. 567, 578, 784 S.E.2d 178, 185 (2016).  \n21. Upon motion by a party, and i n lieu of dismissal or other severe sanctions, \nor in addition to them, Rule 37(b)(2) provides that the trial court shall “require the \nparty failing to obey the [discovery] order to pay the reasonable expenses, including \nattorney’s fees, caused by the failure, unless the court finds that the failure was \nsubstantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses \nunjust.”  Id. at 578, 784 S.E.2d at 185–86 (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)).  Because \nawarded expenses are required to be “reasonable, the record must contain findings of \nfact to support the award of any expenses, including attorney’s fees.”  Benfield v. \nBenfield, 89 N.C. App. 415, 422, 366 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1988).   \n22. Plaintiffs con tend the newly discovered and produced documents prove \nSS&C disobeyed the Order Compelling Production.  In particular, Plaintiffs argue \nthat the existence of the SAS 70 -type audits necessarily means SS&C must have \nwritten policies and procedures a third party can audit—policies and procedures that \nhave not been produced.  Plaintiffs also argue SS&C’s failure to turn over the SAS \n70-type audits earlier and SS&C’s failure to produce the recently discovered policy \nmanuals at any time are direct violations of the Court’s Order Compelling Production. \n23. In response, SS&C asserts that it did not violate the Order Compelling \nProduction.  SS&C argues that the Court did not compel the production of audit forms \nor policy manuals because Plaintiffs’ discovery requests sou ght “SS&C’s policies \ngoverning the services SS&C provide[d] to clients like the  . . . Fund” and SS&C “did \nnot have other written policies or procedures governing these services.”  (Pls.’ Br. \nSupp. Mot. Sanctions Ex. 16, ECF No. 128.16.)  SS&C now acknowledges that some \nof its business units that SS&C claims did not work with the Fund do have written \npolicies and procedures.  These include the policy manuals Plaintiffs obtained.  SS&C \nmaintains that it was not required to produce these policies or procedures , however, \nbecause they were not applicable to SS&C’s  Fund Services NY unit —the unit that \nworked on the Fund.  ( See Def.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions 9 , ECF No. \n132.)  SS&C further argues that the SAS 70 -type audit documents , which SS&C \nacknowledges did apply to SS&C’s Fund Services NY unit , were not required to be \nproduced because they “are an independent auditor’s opinion regarding its \nexamination of SS&C’s internal controls ” and “are not SS&C’s own written policies \nor procedures.”  (Def.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions 7.)  \n24. Based on its review of the record and the arguments of counsel, the Court \ncannot agree with SS&C.  To the contrary, the Court concludes that SS&C failed to \ncomply with the Order Compelling Production and that  Plaintiffs are entitled to \nreasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, directly attributable to that failure.  \n25. Repeatedly throughout this dispute, SS&C has maintained that it was only \nrequired to produce written policies or procedures relating to the work it contends it \ndid for the Fund.  While a selective reading  of the April 27, 2016 hearing transcript \ncan be used to support SS&C’s argument, the larger context of the discussion at that \nhearing and the plain language of  both Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production and the \nCourt’s Order Compelling Production demonstrate SS&C’s real discovery obligations \nwere broader. \n26. The fact the Order Compelling Production was not limited to the written \npolicies and procedures SS&C contends are applicable to its work for the Fund should \nhave been apparent to counsel for SS&C following the April 27, 2016 hearing.  SS&C \npoints to one statement by the Court at this hearing to support SS&C’s limited view \nof its obligations : “[I]t seems to me the Plaintiff is entitled to receiv e any policies, \nstandards, and practices that exist for the services that the Defendant provided.”  (Tr. \n33.)  While this quote is accurate, it was not offered as a final determination.  Indeed, \nalmost im mediately thereafter Plaintiffs’ counsel  voiced concern s that SS&C  was \nnarrowly interpreting Plaintiffs’ discovery requests and was “making a relevancy \ndetermination on what policies and procedures appl[ied] to what [SS&C was] \nsupposed to be doing for the [Fund].”   (Tr. 33.)  That concern prompted the Court to \ninquire “are there policies, standards, and practices that relate to hedge fund \nadministration that SS&C believes exist that control and  govern their conduct, \nbut . . . just don’t control and govern their conduct in this particular representation?”  \n(Tr. 34.)  In other words, the Court directly and specifically inquired as to whether \nSS&C ha d policies and procedures that  were followed in other hedge fund \nrepresentations generally but not the one at the center of this litigation.  In response, \ncounsel for SS&C stated, “I believe the answer to that is no.”  ( Tr. 34.)  The Court \nasked similar questions with respect to SS&C’s other obligations and received \nnegative answers to each.  (Tr. 35–37.) \n27. At one point  during this exchange , SS&C reframed its answers: “Policies \nand procedures related to the work we did here, recordkeeping, administration . . . do \nnot exist.”  (Tr. 35  (emphasis added).)  This caused Plaintiffs’ counsel to interject \nagain:   \n But, your Honor, the problem is he’s saying we’re ma king a \ndetermination as to what relates to the work we did here .  I mean, we’ve got \na different -- a vastly different view of what [SS&C’s] obligations were as the \nadministrator for the [Fund]. . . . [D]on’t let them determine in the discovery \nphase of this case what is a relevant policy or procedure.   \n \n(Tr. 35.)   The Court then stated, “I thought that, you know, [that] hedge fund \nadministration was probably the broadest description, and [SS&C] is saying they \ndon’t have any,” referring to the Court’s previous question about policies, standards, \nand practices relating to hedge fund administration.  (Tr. 35–36.)  Counsel for SS&C \nthen responded that unless the requests “related to  . . . fund[] administration as  \nanything [SS&C does], meaning all of our documents,” there were “no documents that \nfit that description” for the requested time period.3  (Tr. 36.)  \n                                                 \n3 SS&C repeats this argument in its brief, asserting that “[t]aken literally, [Plaintiffs’] \nRequests seek almost every document at SS&C.”  (Def.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions \n3.)  While the Court is certain SS&C is correct that it has “written policies governing certain \naspects of its business (everything from human resources to cybersecurity ),” (Def.’s Mem. \nLaw Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions 2), the Court is likewise confident—and SS&C’s subsequent \ndocument productions since the September 22, 2017 hearing c onfirm—that certain \ndocuments at SS&C refer or relate to the hedge fund administration, accounting, and \nrecordkeeping parts of SS&C’s business and that these documents are distinguishable from \nthose that do not. \n28. Plaintiffs’ complaints about SS&C’s attempts to limit requested discovery to \nwhat SS&C considered applicable, and the Court’s questions about a wider range of \ndocuments than those concerning policies and practices SS&C alleges were applicable \nto the Fund , make SS&C’s continued practice of interpreting the Court’s Order \nCompelling Production in a narrow manner unjustifiable.  The plain language of the \nOrder Compelling Production  shows Plaintiffs requested—and the Court ordered —\nthat SS&C produce:  \n[d]ocuments that refer or relate to SS&C’s policies, standards, and practices \nthat apply to: (1) SS&C’s work in hedge fund administration  (RPD 20), (2) \nSS&C’s accounting work for hedge funds  (RPD 21), and (3) SS&C’s record \nkeeping for hedge funds (RPD 22) . . . [as well as] policies and standards for \nentering into administrative or accounting engagements with hedge funds.   \n \n(Order Mots. Compel 4 (emphasis added).)  The Order Compelling Production was not \nlimited to written copies of policies SS&C contends were applicable to the finite \nnumber of services provided to the Fund by one of SS&C’s business units, nor was it \nlimited to documents written by SS&C employees.  The scope of the Order Compelling \nProduction included documents referring to or relating to several general categ ories \nof services that SS&C offers to hedge fund  clients.  The objections SS&C in itially \nmade to Plaintiffs’ Requests 20–22 and 35 suggest SS&C understood the breadth of \nthese general categories.  (Answers to Requests 32, 34 –35, 47.)  SS&C’s apparent \nbelief that the Order Compelling Production somehow limited SS&C’s obligations \nunder Plaintiffs’ requests is unsupported.  \n29. Further, neither the Court’s statement at the April 27, 2016 hearing—that \nthe oral ruling would be  “no skin off [SS&C’s] back”4—nor the Order Compelling \nProduction acknowledged, as SS&C contends they did , (see Def.’s Mem. Law Opp’n \nPls.’ Mot. Sanctions 7), that SS&C had produced all necessary responsive documents \nas of the hearing .  Instead, the statements  acknowledged only that SS&C  had \nrepeatedly represented to the Court that no responsive documents existed and, thus, \nthat SS&C would not be required to make further productions if it was indeed true  \nthat all responsive documents encompassed by Plaintiffs’ requests had already been \nproduced.   \n30. Finally, any confusion resulting from the colloquy between the Court and \nSS&C at the hearing should have been completely resolved by the express wording of \nthe Order Compelling Production , which contained unambiguous and unequivocal \nlanguage.  To the extent SS&C believed the Court’s oral ruling and the Order \nCompelling Production  were inconsistent, or in the event  SS&C discovered it had \ndocuments it previously characterized as nonexistent, SS&C’s recourse was to file a \nmotion for clarification or reconsideration  of the Order Compelling Production .  \nInstead of taking this course, SS&C unilaterally created a limitation on the scope of \nits obligations arising from the Order Compelling Production. \n                                                 \n4 “One party’s need for information must be balanced against the likelihood of an undue \nburden imposed upon the other.”  Willis v. Duke Power Co., 291 N.C. 19, 34, 229 S.E.2d 191, \n200 (1976).  The Court’s “no skin off your back” statement reflected the Court’s conclusion—\nbased on SS&C’s counsel’s re presentations that no responsive documents remained to be \nproduced—that ordering SS&C to produce the requested documents relating to  its general \nhedge fund services would not impose an undue burden on SS&C. \n31. Plaintiffs have now belatedly obtained, through both SS&C’s and Plaintiffs’ \nefforts, documents referring to or relating to policies, procedures, and practices that \napply to SS&C’s  administration, accounting, and recordkeeping services  for hedge \nfunds.  Some of these documents allegedly apply to business units other than  those \nworking with the Fund.  Some—such as the SAS 70-type audit documents—refer to \nthe policies and procedures of the specific business unit SS&C contends worked for \nthe Fund.  Almost all  refer or relate to policies or procedure s applicable to SS&C’s \nwork regarding hedge funds.  The Court finds that, in failing to timely produce these \nand related documents , SS&C failed to comply with  the Order Compelling \nProduction.  For the reasons explained above, t his failure was not substantially \njustified. \n32. While nothing in the record leads the Court to conclude at this time that  \nSS&C’s conduct was motivated by bad faith, a lack of bad faith does not shield SS&C \nfrom all possible sanctions .  Rather, when “a party compelled to provide discovery \n[fails] to do s o, an award of reasonable costs is mandatory” unless the failure is \nsubstantially justified or an award would be unjust due to other circumstances .  \nCaruso v. Hennessy , No. COA06 -646, 2007 N.C. App. LEXIS 578, at *8 –9 (N.C. Ct. \nApp. Mar. 20, 2007) (citing Kent v. Humphries, 50 N.C. App. 580, 590, 275 S.E.2d 176, \n183 (1981)); see N.C. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2) (stating “the court shall require” paymen t of \nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees,  “unless the court  finds that the failure was \nsubstantially justified” or that the award is unjust because of the circumstances).  The \nprovisions of Rule 37 that mandate an award of reasonable expenses are not meant \nto punish but to reimburse a successful movant.   See Benfield, 89 N.C. App. at 422, \n366 S.E.2d at  504.  Here, the Court concludes Plaintiffs are entitled to this \nreimbursement.  \n33. SS&C’s failure to comply with the Court’s Order Compelling Production  \nrelates to a key issue in this case.  As a result of SS&C’s failure, Plaintiffs have spent \na significant amount of their own time and money looking into the existence and \nlocation of responsive documents —in particular, by attempting to address SS&C’s \ndiscovery deficiencies through inquiries in multiple depositions and by paying for the \ninvestigation and evaluation of a significant number of records.  While the Court has \nno reason to believe that SS&C’s counsel intentionally defied the Court’s Order \nCompelling Production, the Court is nonetheless troubled by SS&C’s failure to comply \nwith its obligations to search for and produce documents responsive to the Requests \nfor Production and subject to production under the Order Compelling Production, \ngiven the plain terms of each.   \n34.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs shall be permitted to recover  reasonable expenses, \nincluding attorneys’ fees, directly attributable to  SS&C’s failure  to produce the \nrequested documents following the Order Compelling Production.  See WakeMed, 244 \nN.C. App. at 579, 784 S.E.2d at  186 (affirming the trial court’s award of fees \n“attributable to the [defendants’] efforts related to [the plaintiff’s] deficient \ndiscovery”); American Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Griffin , 39 N.C. App. 721, 727, 251 S.E.2d \n885, 888 (1979) (affirming the trial court’s award of reasonable expenses caused by a \nfailure to comply with  a discovery order); Kornegay v. Aspen Asset Grp., LLC , 2007 \nNCBC LEXIS 5, at *17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 28, 2007) (“At a minimum, however, the \nCourt ‘shall require the party failing to obey the order to pay the reasonable expenses, \nincluding attorney’s fees, caused by the failure[.]’” (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2))), \naff’d, 204 N.C. App. 213, 693 S.E.2d 723 (2010). \n35. The Court has considered Plaintiffs’ request for more severe s anctions—in \nparticular, that the Court strike SS&C’s answer and affirmative defenses or enter \njudgment by default against SS&C—and concludes that such relief is not appropriate \non the current record, which lacks evidence of SS&C ’s participation in intentional \nevasion or other bad faith behavior.  The Court will not hesitate to impose more severe \nsanctions, however, should SS&C fail to abide by the Court’s orders hereafter  or if \nthe Court later becomes convinced that SS&C fully understood its obligations under \nthe Order Compelling Production yet failed to produce its responsive documents.  \n36. As a final argument, SS&C claims that Plaintiffs brought this dispute to the \nCourt before fulfilling their meet-and-confer obligation under BCR 10.9(b).  As stated \nby SS&C,  Plaintiffs initiated a conference regarding this dispute to address the \nexistence of unproduced documents before submitting a BCR 10.9 statement to the \nCourt.  (Def.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions 5.)   At that conference, counsel \nfor Plaintiffs asserted that there must be wri tten policies and procedures  that had \nnot been produced, arguing that the third party creating the SAS 70-type audits could \nnot have audited unwritten policies.  (Def.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions 5.)  \nSS&C’s counsel disagreed but stated it would ask SS&C to confirm that the SAS 70-\ntype audits did not, “in fact, reference written policies and procedures applicable to \nthe [Fund] engagement.”  (Def.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. Sanctions 5–6.)  Because \nPlaintiffs did not wait for SS&C to conduct this inquiry, SS&C believes Plaintiffs’ \nMotion should be denied. \n37. The Court disagrees that Plaintiffs failed to follow the procedures set out \nin BCR 10.9(b).  Plaintiffs initiated a conference with SS&C prior to submitting their \nBCR 10.9 e-mail to the Court in an attempt to avoid bringing this discovery dispute \nfor judicial resolution.  When Plaintiffs asked about policies and procedures referred \nto in the SAS 70 -type audits, they received SS&C’s familiar  denial that written \npolicies or procedures applicable to the Fund representation existed.  This was the \nsame answer that Plaintiffs had taken issue with at the prior hearing—an answer in \nwhich SS&C unilaterally altered the scope of Plaintiffs’ requests  in a manner \ncontrary to the Court’s Order Compelling Production.  Plaintiffs were not required to \nwait while SS&C confirmed an answer that was not a response to Plaintiffs’ query.  \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n38. WHEREFORE, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion,  hereby \nORDERS as follows: \na. As to the requested documents: \ni. The parties are currently engaged in ongoing discussions \nregarding the production of documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ \nRequests 20 –22 and 35  pursuant to the Court’s September 22, \n2017 oral order, the October 16, 2017 Order to Meet and Confer , \nand multiple subsequent orders imposing similar obligations and \nnarrowing and focusing the scope of the required production \nunder the Order Compelling Production .  The provisions o f the \nCourt’s September 22 , 2017 oral order, the October 16, 2017 \nOrder to Meet and Confer, and all subsequent o rders imposing \nsimilar obligations , including, most recently, the April 2, 2018 \nOrder to File Joint Report , are incorporated into this Order  and \nshall control the production of these responsive documents.   \nii. SS&C shall make witness (es) available for a Rule 30(b)(6) \ndeposition concerning the newly produced documents  at SS&C’s \nexpense, should Plaintiffs wish to conduct such a deposition. \nb.  As to Plaintiffs’ expenses: \ni. SS&C shall pay to Plaintiffs their reasonable expenses, including \ntheir reasonable attorneys’ fees, directly attributable to SS&C’s \nfailure to comply with the Order Compelling Production that were \nincurred between the entry of the Order Compelling Production \nand SS&C’s final, above-ordered production.   \nii. SS&C shall not, however, be required to pay Plaintiffs their \nexpenses attributable to other aspects of Plaintiffs’ prosecution of \nthis action , including, in particular, P laintiffs’ expenses \nattributable to written, document, or deposition discovery to the \nextent that discovery would have occurred regardless of SS&C’s \ncompliance with the Order Compelling Production. \niii. Plaintiffs shall have through and including May 25, 2018 to file \nall evidence and materials in support of Plaintiffs’ request for \nreasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, as well as a \nsupporting brief of no more than 2,500 words. \niv. SS&C may agree to satisfy Plaintiffs’ request for expenses by \nfiling a document to that effect , and any payment by agreement \nshall be made by SS&C on or before June 8, 2018 or at such time \nas the parties may agree.   \nv. In the event SS&C does not agree with Plaintiffs’ request for \nexpenses, SS&C shall file its brief in opposition to the amount of \nPlaintiffs’ requested expenses, inc luding Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ \nfees, together with any supporting materials, no later than June \n8, 2018.  That brief shall be of no more than 2,500 words. \nvi. Plaintiffs will be permitted to file a reply brief in further support \nof its request for expenses no later than June 18, 2018.  That brief \nshall be of no more than 1,250 words. \nvii. All briefs shall otherwise comply with BCR 7.8. \nviii. If necessary, the Court will set a hearing on Plaintiffs’ request for \nreasonable expenses by separate order. \nSO ORDERED, this the 9th day of May, 2018. \n \n \n       /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III    \n       Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n       Special Superior Court Judge  \n         for Complex Business Cases  \n "
