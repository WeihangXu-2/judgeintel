Philip Morris USA, Inc., 2023 NCBC 33. \nParker, Poe, Adams, & Bernstein LLP, by Kay H. Miller and Dylan Z. \nRay, for Respondent Philip Morris USA, Inc. \n \nEarp, Judge. \nI. NATURE OF THE DISPUTE \n \n3. Philip Morris  USA, Inc. (“Philip Morris”) is a corporation domiciled in \nVirginia and authorized to do  business in North Carolina.   It is one of an affiliated \ngroup of companies owned by Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria Group”).  (R.16.)2 \n4. Philip Morris is required to pay an annual franchise tax for the privilege of \ndoing business in this State.  See N.C.G.S. § 105-122 (2012).  For tax years 2012–14, \nPhilip Morris used its “Capital Base” to calculate its franchise tax in accordance with \nSection 105-122(b).3 \n5. During the relevant period,4 Section 105-122 specified that a corporation’s \nCapital Base was to be calculated by first totaling the amount of the company’s \n“issued and outstanding cap ital stock, surplus, and undivided profits.”  From that \nnumber, deductions were permitted  for various liabilities, among them definite and \naccrued legal liabilities, declared dividends, depreciation reserves, accrued taxes, and \nreserves for certain environmental or recycling equipment.  Id. § 105-122(b).   \n \n2 Citations to the Official Record on Judicial Review, (ECF No. 15), are denoted as “R.” \n \n3 Section 105- 122(d)(2) provides that in order for a taxpayer to use its Capital Base to \ndetermine its franchise tax liability, the Capital Base calculated “shall not be less than fifty-\nfive percent (55%) of the appraised value as determined for ad valorem taxation of all the real \nand tangible personal property in this State of each corporation nor less than its total actual \ninvestment in tangible property in this State.” \n \n4 The statute has since been amended. \n6. The adjustments were not limited to deductions, however .  Relevant here, \nthe statute required that “[e]very corporation doing business in the State which is a \nparent, subsidiary, or affiliate of another corporation” add to its capital stock, surplus, \nand undivided profits  “all indebtedness owed [by it] to a parent, subsidiary, or \naffiliated corporation” (an “affiliate payable”).  On the other hand, i f the corporation \nloaned capital to its affiliate, the corporation could subtract from its Capital Base the \namount of indebtedness owed to it (an “affiliate receivable”)—but only “to the extent \nthat the debt [w as] included in the tax base of the parent, subsidiary, or affiliated \ndebtor corporation reporting for taxation under the provisions of this section.”  In \nother words, in order for a corporation su bject to North Carolina’s franchise tax to \ndeduct an affiliate receivable,  the affiliate receiving the loan had to be  subject to \nNorth Carolina’s franchise tax.  See id. § 105-122. \n7. During the 2012–14 period, Philip Morris borrowed money from and loaned \nmoney to various affiliates of Altria Group.  Some of these affiliates  were subject to \nNorth Carolina’s franchise tax, but others were not.  (R.62–64.)  \n8. In 2016, t he N orth Carolina Department of Revenue (“Department”)  \nconducted an audit of Philip Morris’ franchise tax liability for the 2012–14 tax years.  \nPhilip Morris took the position during the audit that it should be able to deduct from \nits Capital Base any  amounts it loaned to its affiliates, regardless of whether the \ndebtors were subject to North Carolina’s franchise tax.  The Department rejected that \nposition and determined that Philip Morris ’ deduction of these amounts from its \nCapital Base had resulted in the underreport ing of its tax liability for each of the \naudited years.5  (R.10, 58, 62–64, 185.) \n9. Following the audit, Philip Morris objected to the proposed assessment and \nrequested further review.  (R.9–13.)  The company framed the issue for this Court’s \nreview in its brief as follows: \n[T]he Department calculated the ‘affiliated indebtedness’ component of \nthe franchise tax base to require the addition of Philip Mor ris’ \nintercompany ‘payables’ to all of its affiliates (the creditor corporations) \nregardless of whether the affiliates filed North Carolina franchise tax \nreturns, but permitted a deduction for Philip Morris’ intercompany \n‘receivables’ from its affiliates (the debtor corporat ions) only if the \naffiliates were doing business in North Carolina and filing franchise tax \nreturns. \n \n(Respondent’s Brief, [“Resp. Br.”] 3, ECF No. 24.) \n \n10. On 31 August 2020, the Department issued a Notice of Final Determination \nupholding its determination and assessing more than $300,000.00 in franchise taxes, \npenalties, and interest for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014.  (R.16–22.)  \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n11. On 27 October 2020 , Philip Morris filed a petition with the Office of \nAdministrative Hearings (“OAH”) challenging the tax assessment.  (R .1.)  In its  \nsubsequent motion for summary judgment in that proceeding, Philip Morris argued \nthat Section 105-122(b)’s differing treatment of affiliate receivables, which turned on \nwhether the affiliate was  subject to North Carolina ’s franchise tax , violated the  \n \n5 According to the Department, its determination was also based on adjustments made to \nPhilip Morris’ calculation of “Other Reserves,” but Philip Morris objected only to the \ntreatment of affiliated debt.  (R.58, 19, 10–13.) \ndormant commerce clause of the United States Constitution .6  Therefore, Philip \nMorris argued that application of the statute to it was unconstitutional.  (R.174–80.) \n12. Citing Section 105-241.17 of the North Carolina General Statutes , the \npresiding administrative law judge (“ ALJ”) determined that OAH  was required “to \nexamine the constitutional claim made by [Philip Morris] to determine if dismissal is \nappropriate ‘because the sole  issue [was] the constitutionality of the statute.’  ”  In \naddition, the ALJ determined that if the issue was “the application of [the] statute,” \nOAH was required to issue a final decision.   Conflating the two concepts, the ALJ \nthen concluded, “this tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction to render a final decision \nin this case because [Philip Morris] has properly claimed that the sole issu e in this \ncase is the constitutionality of the statute  at issue, as applied to Petitioner, alone.” \n(R.241.) \n13. But the tension between the ALJ’s treatment of the case as one involving \nthe application of the  statute to Philip Morris as opposed to its constitutionality  is \nevident in footnote 6 of the ALJ’s opinion.  There, the ALJ wrote:  “In response to this \ntribunal’s questioning if the complained -of provision is generally enforceable  . . . \nPetitioner could not describe a s ituation where the complained of provision could be \napplied constitutionally , if a court found it was unconstitutional as applied to \nPetitioner.  This tribunal believes a facial challenge could be sustained in the \nSuperior Court.”   (R.245, n.6 .)  Nevertheless, the ALJ accepted Philip Morris’ \n \n6 The so-called “dormant commerce clause” is a reference to an analysis used to determine \nwhether state and local laws violate the U.S. Constitution because they place an undue \nburden on interstate commerce.  See, e.g., Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 \n(1977). \ncharacterization of its challenge as one involving the application of Section 105 -122 \nonly to the company and proceeded to decide the case.     \n14. After determining that OAH had jurisdiction, the ALJ held that the statute \nas applied to Philip Morris was unconstitutional because it violated the dormant \ncommerce clause.  She found problematic the statute’s differing treatment of affiliate \nindebtedness between companies that were subject to North Carolina’s franchise tax \nand those that were n ot.  To remedy the constitutional infirmity, the ALJ granted \nPhilip Morris’ motion for summary judgment and ruled that “[w]hen calculating \n[Philip Morris’] Capital Base  for Franchise Tax liability purposes  . . . [the \nDepartment] may not apply the second half of the final sentence of Section 105-122(b), \nwhich reads:  ‘to the extent that the debt has been included in the tax  base of the \nparent, subsidiary, or affiliated debtor corporation reporting for taxation under the \nprovisions of this section.’  ” ( R.249.)  The ALJ then reversed and rescinded the \nDepartment’s Notice of Final Determination.  (R.249.) \n15. The Department petitions this Court for judicial review of the ALJ’s \ndecision.  (See Petitioner’s Brief, [“Pet. Br.”] 1, ECF No. 19.)  It also moves to strike \nexhibits that were not made part of the Record but that Philip Morris referenced and \nattached to its briefing on appeal to this Court.  (See Mot. Strike, ECF No. 28.)    \n16. After filing the petition , the Department moved to b ifurcate these \nproceedings so that the issue of OAH’s jurisdiction to render the decision below would \nbe addressed before the merits of the Department’s appeal  were considered.  ( Mot. \nBifurcate, ECF No. 11.)  The Court granted the Department’s motion and entered a \nScheduling Order on 2 May 2022, requiring , as an initial matter,  briefing and oral \nargument limited to the jurisdictional issue.  (Order, ECF No. 18.)   The Court has \nreviewed this briefing and conducted a hearing on 16 November 2022 at which both \nparties participated through counsel .  The jurisdictional issue is now ripe for \ndisposition.  \nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n17. When conducting judicial review of a final agency decision, “the court shall \ndetermine whether the petitioner is entitled to the relief sought in the petition based \nupon its review of the final decision and the official record.”  N.C.G.S. § 150B-51(c).  \nThe court acts in an appellate capacity to determine whether the evidence supports \nthe agency’s findings of fact, whether the findings support the agency’s conclusions of \nlaw, and whether the conclusions of law are proper statements and applications of \nthe law.  See Mann Media, Inc. v. Randolph Cty. Planning Bd. , 356 N.C. 1, 12 –13 \n(2002).  The Court may reverse or modify a final agency decision if the agency’s \nfindings, inferences, conclusions, or decision are: \n(1) In violation of constitutional provisions; \n \n(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the \nagency or administrative law judge; \n \n(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; \n \n(4) Affected by other error of law; \n \n(5) Unsupported by substantial evidence admissible under G.S. §§ \n150B-29(a), 150B-30, or 150B-31 in view of the entire record \nas submitted; or \n \n(6) Arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 150B-51(b). \n18. Whether OAH had subject matter jurisdiction  is a question of law  that is \nreviewed de novo.  See N.C.G.S. § 150B-51(b)(4), (c).  Under the de novo standard of \nreview, the court “considers the matter anew and freely substitutes its own judgment \nfor that of the lower [tribunal].”  Midrex Techs. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 369 N.C. 250, \n257 (2016)  (cleaned up).  The scope  of  the Court’s review is limited to “the final \ndecision and the official record.”  N.C.G.S. § 150B-51(c). \nIV. ANALYSIS \n19. The Department seeks to reverse the decision below and to reinstate its \nFinal Determination assessing Philip Morris’ franchise tax liability.  The immediate \nquestion before the Court is whether OAH was the proper forum  to decide a \nconstitutional challenge to Section 105-122(b), or whether the appropriate course was \nfor the ALJ to dismiss Philip Morris’ petition for lack of jurisdiction .  See N.C.G.S. \n§ 105-241.17. \nA. OAH Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Determine the Constitutionality of \nThis Statute. \n20. The Administrative Procedure Act’s provisions establishing  OAH’s \njurisdiction do not address challenges to th e constitutionality of a tax statute.   See  \nN.C.G.S. §  150B-23.  Instead, a taxpayer’s standing to bring such a challenge is \naddressed in Section 105 -241.17, which requires the taxpayer to meet the following \nconditions before filing a civil action challengi ng constitutionality in the Superior \nCourt of Wake County:  \n(1) The taxpayer exhausted the prehearing remedy by receiving a \nfinal determination after a review and a conference[;]  \n \n(2) The taxpayer commenced a contested case at the Office of    \nAdministrative Hearings[;] \n  \n(3) The Office of Administrative Hearings dismissed the contested \ncase petition for lack of jurisdiction because the sole issue is \nthe constitutionality of a statute and n ot the application of a \nstatute[;] \n \n(4) The taxpayer has paid the amount of tax, penalties, and \ninterest the final determination states is due[;] and  \n \n(5)  The civil action must be filed within two years of the \ndismissal. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 105-241.17 (1)–(5).  Subpart three is at issue here.   \n \n21. The Department argues that OAH lacked subject matter jurisdiction to \ndecide the constitutionality of Section 105 -122(b) because OAH is not a court  of \ngeneral jurisdiction  and therefore has limited power to adjudicate disputes .  The \nDepartment observes that Section 150B-23, which delineates  the issues subject to \nOAH’s review, does not address a statute’s constitutionality.   Rather, Section 7A -\n45.4(b)(1) provides that the North Carolina Business Court , a court of general \njurisdiction, is the designated forum to hear constitutional challenges to tax statutes \nbrought pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 105-241.17.  See N.C.G.S.  § 7A-45.4(b)(1). \n22. The Department is correct.  Constitutional challenges to tax statutes are \nheard by the North Carolina Business Court.  See Forsythe v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, \n2022 NCBC LEXIS 106, at *21 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 9, 2022) (observing that a civil \naction under § 105-214.17 that challenges the constitutionality of a tax statute “can \nonly proceed as a mandatory complex business case before a Business Court Judge”).  \nHowever, to have standing to bring a civil action in which  the sole issue is a tax \nstatute’s constitutionality, the taxpayer must first satisfy the statutory conditions in \nN.C.G.S. § 105-241.17, including the requirement that OAH dismiss the contested \ncase petition for lack of jurisdiction.  N.C.G.S. § 105-241.17(3).   \n23. This is where, as the Department argues, the ALJ misstepped.  Even after \ntwice recognizing that the sole issue in this case is the constitutionality of Section \n105-122(b), (R.241, 243, n.4), the ALJ did not dismiss the case.  Rather, she concluded \nthat Philip Morris “may elect to proceed [before OAH] with a claim that Section 105-\n122(b) is unconstitutional as applied to [the company] without having to show that \nthe statute is generally enforceable.”  (R.247.)  Then, focusing on the portion of \nN.C.G.S. § 105-241.17(3) that excepts matters involving  “application of a statute”  \nfrom dismissal,7 the ALJ concluded that an “as -applied” constitutional challenge  is \none that involves application of a  statute and held that “[t]his tribunal  . . . has \njurisdiction and must render a final decision on this matter.”  (R.247.)  \n24. The Department contends that the ALJ wrongly interpreted the last seven \nwords of Section 105 -241.17(3) (“and not the application of a statute”) in isolation, \nwithout considering the language of the statute as a whole.  (Pet. Br. 8.)  When read \nin context, the Department argues that the statute requires OAH to dismiss any case \nin which the sole issue is the constitutionality of a statute, regardless of whether the \nchallenge to constitutionality is facial or as-applied. (Pet. Br. 8.)    \n \n7 Section 105 -241.17(3) provides:  “The Office of Administrative Hearings dismissed the \ncontested case petition for lack of jurisdiction because the sole issue is the constitutionality \nof a statute and not the application of a statute.” \n25. The Court agrees with the Department.  Section 105 -241.17 does not \nauthorize OAH to examine whether a tax statute is unconstitutional on its face or as \napplied to a particular taxpayer when determining whether OAH has jurisdiction.  If \nthe sole issue is a c onstitutional challenge —any constitutional challenge —section \n105-241.17 mandates that the matter is one for the courts.  Indeed, our Supreme \nCourt has made clear that “North Carolina courts have the authority and \nresponsibility to declare a law unconstitutional ,” Hart v. State , 368 N.C. 122, 126 \n(2015), and that “ a statute’s constitutionality shall be determined by the judiciary, \nnot an administrative board ,” In re Redmond, 369 N.C. 490, 493 ( 2017) (citations \nomitted).  See also Great American Insurance Co. v. Gold, 254 N.C. 168, 173 (1961) \n(the “question of constitutionality of a statute is for the judicial branch”) ; cf. Emp. \nSec. Comm’n v. Peace, 128 N.C. App. 1, 8 –9 (1997) (“OAH was established as part of \nthe executive branch pursuant to N.C. Const. art. III, § 11, it is not a court[.]”). \n26. As the title and content of the statute makes plain, the overarching purpose \nof Section 105 -241.17 is to venue constitutional challenges to tax statutes in the \ncourts and leave to OAH a  review of matters involving the technical misapplication \nof those statutes.  The reference in Subsection 3 to “application of a statute,” then, \nmerely reflects an effort to distinguish misapplication challenges from constitutional \nones—not facial constitutional challenges from those that are as applied.   \n27. The canons of statutory construction support the Court’s conclusion. First, \nNorth Carolina law is clear that “[p]ortions of the same statute dealing with the same \nsubject matter are to be considered and interpreted as a whole, and . . . every part of \nthe law shall be given ef fect if this can be done by any fair and reasonable \nintendment.”  Huntington Props., LLC v. Currituck Cty ., 153 N.C. App. 218, 224 \n(2002) (cleaned up); s ee also In re Hardy , 294 N.C. 90, 95– 96 (1978) (“Words and \nphrases of a statute may not be interpreted out of context, but individual expressions \nmust be construed as a part of the composite whole and must be accorded only that \nmeaning which other modifying provisions and the clear intent and purpose of the \nact will permit.”) (citations omitted); State v. Tew, 326 N.C. 732, 739 (1990) (“All parts \nof the same statute dealing with the same subject are to be construed together as a \nwhole, and every part thereof must be given effect if this can be done by any fair and \nreasonable interpretation.”).  “Consequently, ‘a provision will not be read in a way \nthat renders another provision of the same statute meaningless.’ ” State v. Daw, 277 \nN.C. App. 240, 254 (2021) (quoting Brown v. Brown, 112 N.C. App. 15, 21 (1993)).  \n28. Further, our appellate courts have instructed that “[s]tatutes dealing with \nthe same subject matter must be construed in pari materia , and harmonized, if \npossible, to give effect to each.”  Hoffman v. Edwards,  48 N.C. App. 559, 564 (1980)  \n(citations omitted) ; see also Carter -Hubbard Publ’g Co., Inc. v. WRMC Hosp. \nOperating Corp., 178 N.C. App. 621, 626 (2006) (“Statutes in pari materia must be \nharmonized, to give effect, if possible, to all provisions without destroying the \nmeaning of the statutes involved.”) (cleaned up).   \n29. Philip Morris’ interpretat ion of section 105 -241.17 violate s these basic \ntenets.  Viewing  the statute as a whole, it is clear from its title  (“Civil action \nchallenging statute as unconstitutional”) and first line (“[a] taxpayer who claims that \na tax statute is unconstitutional may bring a civil action in the Superior Court of \nWake County” ) that it speaks to a taxpayer’s standing to bring constitutional \nchallenges.  It then sets out the conditions a taxpayer must meet to proceed to court.  \nThose conditions are designed to ensure the sole issue is a constitutional one.  If OAH \nhad jurisdiction to decide as-applied constitutional challenges, the legislature would \nhave drafted section 105-241.17 to distinguish “as applied” from other constitutional \nchallenges in its title, first line, an d the initial clause of 105- 241.17(3).   That is not \nthe case. \n30. Moreover, harmonizing Sections 105 -241.16 and 105- 241.17 with Section \n7A-45.4,8 and giving effect to the words of each statute, the Court concludes that \nPhilip Morris’ interpretation of the final seven words is contrary to legislative intent.  \nIf OAH had jurisdiction to decide as-applied constitutional challenges, the legislature \nwould have excluded “as applied” challenges from its mandate in Section 7A-45(b)(1) \nthat the Business Court decide all constitutional challenges to tax statutes.  It did \nnot.   \n31. Furthermore, b ecause the distinction between facial and as -applied \nconstitutional challenges is not always clear, 9 basing a forum’s jurisdiction on that \n \n8 Section 7A -45.4(b)(1) mandates that both appeals from contested tax cases pursuant to \nSection 105 -241.16 and civil actions challenging the constitutionality of a tax statute be \ndesignated to the Business Court. \n \n9 To understand what an “as-applied” constitutional challenge is, it is helpful to contrast it to \na facial challenge.  The former term is used when the language of a statute, neutral on its \nface, has an unconstitutional effect when applied to particular circumstances.  “An as-applied \nchallenge to a statute contest[s] whether it ‘can be constitutionally applied to a particular \ndefendant, even if the statute is otherwise generally enforceable. ’ ” Kelly v. State , 2022-\nNCCOA-675, at ¶ 21 (quoting State v. Packingham, 36 N.C 380, 383 (2015)).  For example,  \ndistinction would create fundamental uncertainty.  As the Court of Appeals recently \nobserved, “[t]here is no clear-cut test to distinguish facial challenges from as-applied \nchallenges.”  Kelly v. State, 2022-NCCOA-675, at ¶ 23 (citing Citizens United v. FEC, \n558 U.S. 310, 331 (2010)).  In fact, “the line between facial and as-applied relief is a \nfluid one, and many constitutional challenges may occupy an intermediate position \non the spectrum between purely as -applied relief and complete facial invalidation.”  \nAFSCME Council 79 v. Scott , 717 F.3d 851, 865 (11th Cir. 2013).  The reality that \nthis spectrum exists and that constitutional challenges do not always fall neatly into \none category or the other supports vesting jurisdiction for constitutional challenges \nin the courts absent unequivocal instruction from the General Assembly.   See Great \nAm. Ins. Co., 254 N.C. at 173 (“Administrative boards have only such authority as is \nproperly conferred upon them by the Legislature.”).   \n \nCryan v. Nat'l Council of YMCA of the United States, 280 N.C. App. 309 (2021), involv ed \nN.C.G.S. § 1-17(e), a statute allowing the victim of sexual abuse as a minor to bring an action \nfor claims arising from that abuse within two years of the date the perpetrator was criminally \nconvicted.  Defendant argued that the statute, as applied to it, was unconstitutional because \nit would result in a revival of particular claims against it that had been barred by the statute \nof limitations prior to the enactment of s ection 1-17(e).  The Court of Appeals determined \nthat the challenge was not to the language of the statute itself, but rather that, as applied to \nthe defendant’s circumstances, the statute had an unconstitutional effect.  Id. at 317. \n \nIn contrast, a facial challenge is one in which the language of the statute is constitutionally \ninfirm and there is no application of the language that would be constitutional.   “[A] facial \nchallenge ‘is an attack on the statute itself’ rather than its application.” Kelly, 2022-NCCOA-\n675, at ¶ 22 (quoting State v. Grady, 372 N.C. 509, at 522 (2019) ). For example, in State v. \nLovette, 233 N.C. App. 706 (2014), the defendant “contend[ed] that [a] new sentencing statute \n[was] erroneous as written because it ‘vest[ed] the sentencing judge with unbridled discretion \nproviding no standards[.]’ ”  Id. at 715.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the challenge \nwas facial in nature “ because defendant is arguing that no matter what the trial court ’s \nultimate determination was, the new sentencing statute is unconstituti onal because of the \namount of discretion given to the trial court in making its determination.”  Id. at 716.  Thus, \nthe argument was over the language of the statute, not its application. \n32. In short, neither the North Carolina Constitution nor the General Statutes \nanywhere vest OAH with jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of a tax statute.  \nIndeed, the appellate case law is to th e contrary.  See, e.g., Central Telephone Co. v. \nTolson, 174 N.C. App. 554, 559 (2005) (holding that i t was a “well-settled rule” that \nthe former Tax Review Board “lacked the authority or jurisdiction to make a \ndetermination regarding the constitutionality of tax resulting from the application of \n[a tax statute].”); cf. State ex rel. Utilities Comm’n v. Carolina Utilities Customers \nAss’n, 336 N.C. 657, 673 (1994) (“As an administrative agency created by the \nlegislature, the [Utilities] Commission has not been given jurisdiction to determine \nthe constitutionality of legislative enactments.”)  As the ALJ in the instant case aptly \nobserved, “[t]he ‘judicial powers’ granted OAH cannot include the power to unmake a \nlaw by declaring a statute unconstitutional.” (R.241.)\n10   \n33. A tribunal only has “the power to hear a case” when it has subject -matter \njurisdiction.  Forsythe v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 106, *6 (quoting  \nUnion Pac R.R. v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, \n558 U.S. 67, 81 (2009)).  Conversely, the lack of subject matter jurisdiction “divests \nthe [tribunal] of any authority to adjudicate.”  In re Z.T.B., 170 N.C. App. 564, 572 \n(2005).

However, a  \ndetermination of whether a forum has jurisdiction is for the Court and does not turn on a \nparty’s conduct.  See In re T.R.P., 360 N.C. 588 (2006) (“Jurisdiction rests upon the law and \nthe law alone.  It is never dependent on the conduct of the parties.”) (citation omitted). \nlegal effect.  See Monarch Tax Credits, LLC v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue , 2021 NCBC \nLEXIS 9, at **16–17 (N.C. Super Ct. Jan. 25, 2021) (“[W]here a taxpayer challenges \nas unconstitutional the application of a tax statute to his own liability . . . an \nadministrative remedy must first be pursued even if the constitutional challenge is \nthe sole issue, and the administrative law judge is required to dismiss the contested \ncase for lack of jurisdiction before a judicial challenge is ripe.”). \n34. The cases cited by Philip Morris to contend that the ALJ had jurisdiction to \nrender the  decision below  were decided under different circumstances and, \nconsequently, are unpersuasive.  In Quad Graphics, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’ t of Revenue, \nQuad Graphics petitioned for judicial review of OAH’s decision requiring it  to pay \nsales tax on certain sales to North Carolina customers.  T he ALJ first determined \nthat Quad Graphics was a “retailer” as defined by N.C.G.S. § 105 -164.3(35)(a) and \nthen found that the sales at issue were properly sourced to North Carolina under \nN.C.G.S. § 105-164.4B(a)(2) and § 105-164.4B(d)(2)(b).  Despite acknowledging that \nshe was “barred” from ruling on constitutional challenges, the ALJ nevertheless \nopined that the physical presence of Quad Graphic’s sales representative in North \nCarolina created a sufficient constitutional nexus with the State to support the \nimposition of North Carolina’s sales tax.   \n35. In its opinion reversing the ALJ ’s decision , the Business Court  \nacknowledged that, by determining a constitutional issue, the ALJ had strayed \nbeyond her jurisdiction .  See Quad Graphics, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Rev enue, 2021 \nNCBC LEXIS 56, at *5 n.6  (N.C. Super. Ct. June 23, 2021) (“It is well established \nthat in North Carolina, constitutional questions must be resolved by the courts and \nnot by the State’s administrative agencies.”).  The Court then analyzed whether OAH \nhad misapplied the term “retailer” in the relevant tax statute.  Concluding that the \nterm had been applied correctly, the Court moved to Quad Graphic’s argument that \nthe Department’s imposition of a sales tax in the  circumstances presented violated \nthe commerce clause of the United States Constitution .  The Court  began by \ndetermining that the challenge was to the manner in which the statute was applied \nto the particular taxpayer.  It was not  a facial challenge in which no constitutional \napplication of the statute existed and its enforcement in any context was prohibited.  \nId. at *20–21. \n36. The Court ultimately held that North Carolina did not have a  “sufficient \ntransactional nexus” with the sales  at issue to impose a sales tax without violating \nthe commerce clause and, therefore, that imposition of the sales tax on Quad Graphics \nwas unconstitutional.  Id . at *41.  On appeal, the North Carolina Supreme Court \ndisagreed, reversing the trial court’s o rder and entering summary judgment for the \nDepartment.  Quad Graphics, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 382 N.C. 356 (2022). \n37. Although the trial court ruled on the constitutionality of the tax statute as \napplied to Quad Graphics without first requiring OAH to dismiss the case for lack of \njurisdiction under Section 105-241.17, Quad Graphics was not a case in which the \n“sole issue” to be decided was the constitutionality of a statute .  The case concerned \nboth misapplication and constitutional issues, and it reached this Court on an appeal \nfrom a summary judgment ruling that involved misapplication.  Once vested with \njurisdiction, this Court decided the constitutional law issue.  The Supreme Court’s \nsubsequent opinion centered on the Court’s analysis of that issue, but it did not speak \nto OAH’s jurisdiction to address the constitutional law issue in the first place.  Id.  \n38. In N.C. Dep’t of Revenue v. Graybar Electric Company, Inc., another case \nrelied upon by Philip Morris, the Department filed a petition for judicial review after \nOAH entered summary judgment for Graybar holding that (1)  the Department had \nmischaracterized certain dividends for purposes of calculating the corporation’s net \neconomic loss (“NEL”) deduction, and (2)  a reduction of its NEL  deductions was \nunconstitutional because it resulted in income being taxed twice.   The Court first \naddressed the NEL deduction before turning to the constitutionality of the tax statute \nas applied to Graybar.  Because it concluded that it was Graybar, not the Department, \nthat had misapplied the statute , t he Court reversed OAH’s decision and entered \nsummary judgment for the Department.   N.C. Dep’t of Revenue v. Graybar Electric \nCompany, Inc., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 2, at *23 (N.C. Super Ct. Jan. 9, 2019). \n39. As for the constitutional law issue, the Court observed that, in light of the \nALJ’s application of the statute to Graybar, the ALJ had not deemed it necessary to \nweigh in on Graybar’s constitutional argument , except to agree generally with \nGraybar’s contention that the Department’s position resulted in double taxation of  \nthe same income.  Consequently, OAH did not render a decision bas ed on the \nconstitutionality of a tax statute and, therefore, the Business Court on appeal did not \nneed to address OAH’s jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues.  Instead, the Court \nconcluded that the “applied constitutional challenges” presented by the case were \nproperly before the Business Court because N.C.G.S. § 150B-51(d) afforded the Court \nthe ability to enter any order allowed by Rule 56.  Id. at *23–24.  In that context, the \nCourt then rejected Graybar’s constitutional challenges to the statute as applied.  Id. \nat *28.  \n40. As with Quad Graphics, Graybar presented both misapplication and \nconstitutional issues.  It reached the Business Court as a result of an appeal from a \nsummary judgment ruling that involved misapplication.  The Court therefore did not \naddress OAH’s jurisdiction to decide  constitutional issues, and neither did the \nSupreme Court, which affirmed the Business Court’s order and opinion per curiam .  \nN.C. Dep’t of Rev. v. Graybar Elec. Co., 373 N.C. 382 (2020).11  \n41. The Court recognizes the expertise  of OAH’s adjudicators with res pect to \ntax matters, and its decision in no way implies that these able public servants lack \nthe ability to decide as-applied constitutional challenges to tax statutes.  The Court \ndecides only that the language of Section 105 -241.17 does not enable them to  do so.  \nThe bedrock constitutional principle mandating the separation of powers among the \nthree branches of government counsels for a clear, unmistakable direction to this \nagency of the executive branch before it may be permitted to do the work of the other \ntwo branches of government.  See N.C. Const. art. I, § 6 (“The legislative, executive, \n \n11 Other cases cited by Philip Morris in its brief to support the premise that OAH has \njurisdiction to decide cases in which the sole issue is an “as applied” constitutional challenge \nwere decided by OAH itself, limiting their persuasive effect.  There is no indication that any \nof these cases were reviewed by a court.  See Cottonwood Pre -Elementary, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t \nof Revenue, 2021 WL 6802992 (N.C.O.A.H. Dec. 15, 2021); Mooresville Hospital Mgt. Assocs., \nInc. v. N.C. Dep’t of HHS , 2002 WL 32002727 (N.C.O.A.H. Nov. 26 2002); Watkins v. N.C. \nDep’t of HHS, 2007 WL 4385665 (N.C.O.A.H. Aug. 7, 2007); Valley Proteins, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t \nof Agriculture & Consumer Servs., 2020 WL 8613525 (N.C.O.A.H. Dec. 21, 2020).   \nand supreme judicial powers of the State government shall be forever separate and \ndistinct from each other.”).   No such direction exists in Section 105-241.17.   \n42. To be sure, other states have delegated  responsibility for addressing as -\napplied constitutional challenges to their administrative agencies, at least as a first \nstep.  Some limit the agency’s role to development of the factual record.  Others allow \nfor an administrative determination of constitutionality, which is then subject to \nappeal to a court.  However, in those states, unlike in North Carolina, the jurisdiction \nof the agency is expressly delineated by statute or in well-developed case law.  See, \ne.g., Code of Ala. § 40-2B-2(g)(6) (“The Alabama Tax Tribunal shall decide questions \nregarding the constitutionality of the application of statutes to the taxpayer  . . . but \nshall not have the power to declare a statute unconstitutional on its face.”); \nCommonwealth v.  DLX, Inc ., 2001 Ky. LEXIS 59, at **6–7 (“Exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies is not necessary when attacking the constitutionality of a \nstatute or a regulation as void on its face.  This is because an administrative agency \ncannot decide constitutional issues  . . . [However,] exhaustion of administrative \nremedies is not futile to an as-applied challenge to a statute.”); Richardson v. Board \nof Dentistry, 1995 Tenn. LEXIS 788, at ** 20 (“In cases in which a party challenges \nthe application of a statute in a given situation, the Tennessee courts have \nacknowledged the agency’s authority to resolve the issue before submitting the \nmatter to judicial review.”).  Again, the difference between North Carolina and these \nstates lies in the language of N.C.G.S. § 105-241.17. \n  \nB. The Constitutional Challenge to this Statute is Facial, Not As-Applied. \n \n43. Even if North Carolina’s OAH had jurisdiction to determine as -applied \nconstitutional challenges as Philip Morris contends, OAH could not have decided this \ncase because the challenge presented here is facial, not as-applied.  The distinction is \nevident in the remedy the ALJ ordered.  She d id not find that the statute was \nmisapplied and order that it be applied differently; instead, she ordered that the \nDepartment not apply the final clause of Section 105-122(b) to Philip Morris at all. \n44. That clause permits a deduction from the taxpayer’s C apital Base for \naffiliate receivables, but only “to the extent that the debt has been included in the tax \nbase of the parent, subsidiary, or affiliated debtor corporation reporting for taxation \nunder the provisions of this section.”  According to the ALJ, applying this portion of \nthe statute to Philip Morris, which has both affiliates that are subject to North \nCarolina’s franchise tax and those that are not, violates the dormant commerce clause \nbecause “[t]he complained -of provision of the Franchise Tax treat s [Philip Morris] \ndifferently based solely on the interstate element of its business.”  (R.248.)12  \n45. The Department argues that prohibiting it from applying the statute as \nwritten prevents it from administering the tax statute, something the ALJ lacks the \nauthority to order.  (Pet. Br. 11.)   The Department observes that nowhere in the \nALJ’s listed powers did the General Assembly afford the ALJ the ability to render a \nportion of a statute inoperable, see N.C.G.S. § 150B-33 (enumerating the powers of \nan administrative law judge), nor did the legislature vest  the ALJ with authority to \n \n12 As stated above, the ALJ recognized that the challenge was a facial one in footnote 6 of her \nopinion. \norder injunctive relief , see N.C.G.S. §  105-241.19 (action for injunction is not \npermitted).  (Pet. Br. 12.)  Instead, the Department contends that under Section 105-\n241.17, Philip Morris’ exclusive mechanism to challenge the constitutionality of a tax \nstatute is to institute a civil action in the Superior Court of Wake County.  Before it \ncan do so, however, OAH is required to review the case, determine that the sole issue \nis the constitutionality of a tax statute, and dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.  \n(Pet. Br. 14.)   \n46. Philip Morris responds that it did not ask OAH to determine whether the \nstatute was generally enforceable, only whether it was constitutional “as applied” to \nit.  (Resp. Br. 17.)  However, Philip Morris’ decision to request a remedy limited only \nto itself does not transform a facial challenge into an as -applied one.13  The forum’s \njurisdiction does not turn on the taxpayer’s characterization of the issue .  See Kelly, \n2022-NCCOA-675, at ¶ 23 (“a court is not restricted per se by a party's categorization \nof its challenge as facial or as -applied and may conduct its own review to determine \nwhether the party’s challenge is facial or as-applied”); cf. Islamic Cmty. Ctr. for Mid \nWestchester v. City of Yonkers Landmark Pres. Bd ., 258 F. Supp. 3d 405, 415  (2017) \n(a trial court may determine if the plaintiff’s claims are facial or as applied despite \nthe plaintiffs’ assertions).  If that were so, simply by labelling a constitutional \n \n13 Despite characterizing the issue as an as -applied challenge, Philip Morris writes in its \nsummary judgment brief below: “ [The] differential treatment between corporations doing \nbusiness in North Carolina and those not doing business in the state is the epitome of the \ndiscrimination prohibited by the Commerce Clause.”  (Pet. Brief Supp. Mot. SJ 1, R.171.)  \nThus, Philip Morris’ argument is not that the statute was misapplied only to it , but that it \nwould be constitutionally impermissible to apply it to any corporation .  The words of the \nstatute itself are being challenged, not the manner of its application to Philip Morris.\n \nchallenge as one of misapplication, a taxpayer would be able to carve out, only for \nitself, a remedy from which other corporations comparably situated would not benefit \nsimply because they had yet to challenge the statute’s constitutionali ty themselves.  \nThe result would be an undesirable patch-work quilt of tax law at the administrative \nlevel.  Nothing in the statutory scheme suggests that such an undesirable result was \nthe General Assembly’s intent.  See Ayers v. Board of Adjustment, 113 N.C. App. 528, \n531 (1994) (in giving the ordinary meaning to the words of a statute, the Court should \n“avoid interpretations that create absurd or illogical results”).   \n47. In sum, d eterminations regarding the constitutionality of this statute are \nthe province of t he judiciary , and this Court does not read Section 105 -241.17 to \ndistinguish as -applied challenges from that general principle.  Even if  it did , as \nreflected in the remedy ordered by the ALJ, this case presents a facial constitutional \nchallenge, not an as -applied one .  Accordingly , the Court REVERSES the Final \nDecision and REMANDS the matter to O AH with instructions to DISMISS the case \nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n14 \nV. PETITIONER’S MOTION TO STRIKE \n48. The Scheduling Order in this case required the parties to brief the issue of \nwhether OAH had subject matter jurisdiction to render the decision below.  Both \nparties submitted briefs with attached exhibits.   Included in Philip Morris’ \n \n14 In reaching this determination, the Court does not express an opinion regarding whether \nthe tax statute in question is, or is not, constitutional.  This is a determination for another \nday should Philip Morris opt to proceed as provided by statute. \nsubmission were exhibits 13–16, which contain tax information about taxpayers that \nare not parties and that cover years not at issue in this case. \n49. The Department complains that exhibits 13 –16 were never introduced to \nthe tribunal below and are not part of the official record filed with this Court.  It  \nmoves to strike the exhibits as an improper unilateral attempt to expand the record.  \n(Pet. Br. Mot. Strike 2–5, ECF No. 29.) \n50. Philip Morris responds that the motion comes too late, and, in any event, \nsupplementation of the record in this manner is permiss ible.  It contends that the \ninformation contained in exhibits 13–16 did not exist until after the date of the ALJ’s \nhearing, and it argues that if it were not permitted to present the exhibits for the \nCourt’s consideration, it would be left without a way to respond to the Department’s \nargument regarding the ALJ’s remedy.  Finally, Philip Morris argues that Business \nCourt Rule 7 permits it to include exhibits with a brief.  (Resp. Motion Strike 4, ECF \nNo. 30.) \n51. The Court has discretion to determine whether to allow the exhibits.  See, \ne.g., N.C. State Board of Ed uc. v. N .C. Learns, Inc., 231 N.C. App. 270, 285 (2013) \n(“[T]he Court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record \nwhen deemed desirable.”) (cleaned up).   I t is persuaded to do so because the \ninformation contained within them developed after the hearing below, Philip Morris \ndeems the information important to its position, and counsel has professed confusion \nover the applicability of BCR 7. 15  Accordingly,  the Court determines that  the \ninterests of justice and fairness are advanced by permitting the exhibits. \n52. Therefore, given the circumstances presented, the Court  DENIES the \nPetitioner’s Motion to Strike, and it has considered exhibits 13–16 when making its \ndetermination with respect to the Department’s Petition. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n  \n53. For the reasons stated herein, OAH’s Final Decision is REVERSED and \nthis matter is REMANDED to OAH with instructions to DISMISS this action for lack \nof subject matter jurisdiction.  Petitioner’s Motion to Strike is DENIED.  \n IT IS SO ORDERED, this the 3rd day of May, 2023. \n \n \n /s/ Julianna Theall Earp \n Julianna Theall Earp \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 The Court first observes that it is BCR 13, rather than BCR 7, that governs appeals from \nOAH to this Court.
