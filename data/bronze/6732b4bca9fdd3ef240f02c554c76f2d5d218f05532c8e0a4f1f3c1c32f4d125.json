Worley, Jr. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \n \nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \n1. The Court makes the following findings of fact solely for purposes of \ndeciding the PI Motion.  These findings are not binding on the Court  in later \nproceedings in this action.  E.g., Lohrmann v. Iredell Mem’l Hosp., Inc., 174 N.C. App. \n63, 75, 620 S.E.2d 258, 265 (2005) (“It is well settled that findings of fact made during \na preliminary injunction proceeding are not binding upon a court at a trial on the \nmerits.”). \n2. Plaintiff First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) is a Del aware \ncorporation with its principal place of business in Wake County, North Carolina.   \n(Verified Compl., ECF No. 3 at ¶ 21.) \n3. Defendant KS Bancorp, Inc. (“KS  Bancorp”) is a North Carolina \ncorporation with its principal place of business in Johnston County,  North Carolina.  \n(Id. at ¶ 22.)  KS Bancorp is a small, regional bank with nine locations in eastern \nNorth Carolina.  At all times relevant to this matter, KS Bancorp had 1,309,001 \nshares of common stock outstanding.  (Harold T. Keen Aff., ECF No. 25, Attach. C at \n¶ 6.)  KS Bancorp is a privately owned corporation whose common stock is generally \ntraded on the Pink ® Open Market.   Plaintiff currently owns nearly 9% of the \noutstanding shares of KS Bancorp.  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 1.) \n4. Defendant Harold T. Keen (“Keen”) is the President and Chief Executive \nOfficer of KS Bancorp.  The other individual Defendants are officers and directors of \nKS Bancorp.  (Id. at ¶¶  24–31; KS Bancorp and the individual Defendants are \ncollectively referred to as “Defendants”.)  Keen and his family members own over 13% \nof KS Bancorp’s common stock.  (ECF No. 25, Attach. C at ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff alleges that \nKS Bancorp’s Board members, executives, and senior leadership own approximately \n20% of KS Bancorp’s outstanding common stock.  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 9.) \n5. KS Bancorp’s charter provides that any “Business Combination,” such \nas a merger or acquisition, requires the “affirmative vote of the holders of seventy -\nfive percent (75%) or more of the outstanding Voting Shares, voting separately a s a \nclass” or the “affirmative vote of at least seventy -five percent (75%) of the Whole \nBoard of Directors.”  (ECF No. 3, Ex. 2 at §§  7.1(a), 7.2.)  Plaintiff alleges that these \nchange of control provisions and “the compositio n of [KS Bancorp’s] ownership  . . . \nmake any change of control event virtually impossible without the approval of [KS \nBancorp’s] existing board of directors.”  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 39.) \n6. In or around spring of 2017, KS  Bancorp’s Board of D irectors (the “KS \nBoard”) approved a plan to convert KS Bancorp into a Subchapter S corporation (the \n“Sub S Plan”).  (Id. at ¶ 40.)  The Sub S Plan would have required KS Bancorp to buy \nout many of its shareholders, including its institutional shareholders.  (Id. at ¶ 41.)  \nAt the time the KS Board approved the Sub S Plan, KS Bancorp’s common stock was \ntrading at approximately $19 to $24 per share.  (Id. at ¶ 42.)   \n7. After learning of the plan to convert KS  Bancorp to a Subchapter S \ncorporation, on June 30, 2017, Plaintiff made an unsolicited Indication of Interest to \nKS Bancorp expressing its desire to merge with KS Bancorp.  (ECF No. 25, Ex . 2.)  \nPlaintiff proposed to purchase additional shares of KS Bancorp at $33 per share.  The \nIndication of Interest was “non-binding” and expired on July 14, 2017.  (Id.)  Plaintiff \nalleges that KS Bancorp intended to purchase shares under the Sub S Plan “at a price \nmaterially less than $33 per share.”  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 42.)  KS Bancorp apparently did \nnot notify its shareholders about Plaintiff’s Indication of Interest. \n8.   On July 11, 2017, the KS Board rejected the Indication of Interest in a \nletter from Keen to Plaintiff.  (ECF No. 3 at 44 ; ECF No. 3, Ex 3.)  The letter stated \nthat after a full review, the KS Board  had determined that “the Board’s recently -\nadopted strategy of reorganizing as an S corporation [was] more beneficial to the KS \nshareholders than the strategy of accepting the unsolicited Indication of Interest.”  \n(Id.)   \n9. On July 13, 2017 , Plaintiff provided KS  Bancorp with a second \nIndication of Interest, i ncreasing the purchase offer to $35 per share in cash and/or \npreferred stock.  (ECF No. 25, Ex. 2.)  Plaintiff also publicly announced the proposal \nin a press release in order to alert KS Bancorp’s shareholders of the offer.  (ECF No. \n3 at ¶  46.)  The KS Board engaged an investment banking firm and conducted an \nanalysis of the Indications of Interest.  (ECF No. 25, Attach. C at ¶ 9.)  On September \n11, 2017, the KS Board unanimously rejected the Indications of Interest, resolving \nthat the “continued independent operation of KS is in the best interest of its \nshareholders.”  (Id.) \n10. On October 25, 2017, the KS Board announced that it had withdrawn \nits plan to pursue its Sub S Plan.  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 49; ECF No. 3, Ex. 5.) \n11. On December 19, 2017, Plaintiff obtained approval from the Federal \nReserve to purchase up to 80% of KS  Bancorp’s outstanding common stock .1  (ECF \nNo. 3 at ¶¶ 52–54; ECF No. 25, Ex. 4.)  The period to acquire these shares was set to \nexpire on March 19, 2018, but can be extended at the discretion of the Federal Reserve \nthrough December 19, 2018.  (Id. at ¶ 54.) \n12. On January 30, 2018, Plaintiff began contacting KS  Bancorp’s \nshareholders, offering to purchase their shares at $35 per share in cash.  (William O. \nGalloway Aff., ECF No. 9, Ex . 2 at ¶  3.)  Several shareholders expressed interest in \nselling their shares to Plaintiff at the price of $35 per share .  By February 9, 2018, \nPlaintiff had purchased an additional 52,300 shares of KS Bancorp common stock at \n$35 per share.  (Id. at ¶ 6.) \n13. In early February 2018, the KS Board met to consider Plaintiff’s actions.  \n(ECF No. 25, Attach. C at ¶  14.)  On February 7, 2018 , the KS Board adopted a \n“Shareholder Rights Plan” (sometimes referr ed to as a “ poison pill”).  (Id. at ¶ 15.)  \nThe KS Board also declared a dividend of one “right” for each share of common stock.  \n(Id. at ¶  17.)  The Shareholder Rights Plan provides that if a party ( an “Acquiring \nPerson”) acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of KS Bancorp’s common stock, \nthe KS Board may, in its sole discretion, activate the rights.  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 57.)  In \nthat event, the Rights Plan would, inter alia, permit all shareholders to purchase \nadditional shares of KS Bancorp’s common stock at 50% of the then current per share \n                                                 \n1 Plaintiff applied to the Federal Reserve pursuant to 12 CFR § 225.11(c), which requires that \na bank holding company submit an application to the Federal Reserve in order to acquire the \nsecurities of an additional bank or bank holding company.   12 CFR § 225.11(c) (2018); ECF \nNo. 25, Ex. 3. \nmarket price, subject to the right of KS Bancorp to exchange all or part of the \noutstanding rights for shares of KS Bancorp common stock, at an exchange ratio of \none share of common stock per right.   (Id.)  The Shareholder Rights Plan, however, \nprovides that upon activation of the plan, an Acquiring Person’s rights “shall become \nnull and void” and an Acquiring Person has no rights to purchase or acquire shares \nof common stock under the Shareholder Rights Plan.  (Id.; ECF No. 3, Ex. 8 at § 8(e).) \n14. Defendants claim the Shareholder Rights Plan “was intended to \nreassure [KS Bancorp’s] employees and clients, protect the value of [KS Bancorp’s] \nbusiness, strengthen the [KS] Board’s negotiating leverage with potential acquirers, \nand provide adequate time to evaluate whether alternatives other than continued \nindependent operations or [Plaintiff’s] Indications of Interest would be in the best \ninterests of [KS Bancorp] and its  shareholders.”  (ECF No. 25, Attach. C at ¶  16.)  \nPlaintiff contends that  “the effect of the [S hareholder] Rights Plan is to further \nempower [KS Bancorp’s management and the KS Board] and to protect them from \nchange of control events to ensure that they remain in place” and that the plan \n“prevent[s] KS [Bancorp’s] shareholders from receiving . . . a superior price for their \nKS [Bancorp] common stock.”  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 60.) \n15. On February 9, 2018, KS Bancorp announced the adoption of the \nShareholder Rights Plan in a press release .  (ECF No. 3 at ¶  56; ECF No. 3, Ex.  7.)  \nIn conjunction with the Shareholder Rights Plan, KS Banco rp announced a Share \nRepurchase Program in which the corporation would repurchase up to an aggregate \nof $2.75 million of KS Bancorp’s outstanding common stock “at management’s \ndiscretion [and] at prices management considers attractive.”  ( ECF No. 3, Ex. 7. )  \nPlaintiff contends the Share Repurchase Program will have the effect of further \nentrenching the KS Bancorp’s management and the KS Board.  (Id. at ¶¶ 63–64.) \n16. Upon learning about the adoption of the Shareholder Rights Plan, \nPlaintiff ceased its efforts to acquire additional KS Bancorp stock in order to avoid \ntriggering the Rights Plan.  (Id. at ¶  59.)  At the time it ceased purchasing shares, \nPlaintiff had acquired 52,300 addition al shares of KS Bancorp’s common stock; was \nin the process of finalizing additional purchases of 110,499 shares; and was in contact \nwith other shareholders owning 86,678 shares.  (ECF No. 9, Ex. 2 at ¶¶ 6–8.) \n17. On February 15, 2018, Plaintiff filed its Verified Complaint.  In its \nVerified Complaint , Plaintiff  alleges claims for declaratory judgment , seeking a \ndeclaration that the Shareholder Rights Plan is unlawful under North Carolina law  \npursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §§  55-6-01(a) and 55 -6-24(b) (hereinafter, “G.S.”) (ECF \nNo. 3 at ¶¶ 68–72) and breach of fiduciary duty (id. at ¶¶ 77–83).  Plaintiff also seeks \na preliminary and permanent injunction (id. at ¶¶ 73–76). \n18. On February 15, 2018 , Plaintiff also filed the PI Motion  with an \naccompanying brief and affidavits.  (ECF Nos. 7–9.) \n19. On February 16, 2018, this matter was designated a mandatory complex \nbusiness case by the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court and  was \nassigned to the undersigned by the Chief Judge of the North Carolina Business Court.  \n(ECF Nos. 1 and 2.) \n20. Plaintiff filed additional affidavits on February 26, 2018 and March 1, \n2018.  (ECF Nos. 17 and 22.)  On March 7, 2018, Defendants filed a brief in opposition \nto the PI Motion along with several exhibits and affidavits  (ECF Nos. 24 and 25) ,2 \nand on March 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed a reply brief (ECF No. 27).  On March 12, 2018, \nthe Court held a hearing on the PI Motion.  The PI Motion is now ripe for \ndetermination. \nANALYSIS \n21. A preliminary injunction may be issued during litigation when “it \nappears by affidavit that a party thereto is doing or threatens or is about to do . . . \nsome act . . . in violation of the rights of another party to the litigation respecting the \nsubject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.”  G.S. § 1-485(2).  \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy and will not be lightly granted.”  \nTravenol Labs., Inc. v. Turner , 30 N.C. App. 686, 692, 228 S.E.2d 478, 483 (1976).  \nThe movant bears the burden of establishing the right to a preliminary in junction.  \nPruitt v. Williams, 288 N.C. 368, 372, 218 S.E.2d 348, 351 (1975).  \n22. To obtain a preliminary injunction, a movant must show “a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of his case and . . . [that the movant] is likely to sustain \nirreparable loss unles s the injunction is issued, or if, in the opinion of the Court, \nissuance is necessary for the protection of his rights during the course of litigation.”  \nAnalog Devices, Inc. v. Michalski, 157 N.C. App. 462, 466, 579 S.E.2d 449, 452 (2003); \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiff submitted at the hearing and subsequently filed various objections to Defendants’ \nAffidavits (ECF No. 28).  To the extent these objections constitute a motion to strike, the \nCourt denies the motion. \naccord Looney v. Wilson, 97 N.C. App. 304, 307 –08, 388 S.E.2d 142, 144 –45 (1990).  \nLikelihood of success means a “reasonable likelihood.”  See A.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. \nMcClure, 308 N.C. 393, 404, 302 S.E.2d. 754, 761 (1983). \n23. The issuance of an injunction is “a matter of di scretion to be exercised \nby the hearing judge after a careful balancing of the equities.”  State ex rel. Edmisten \nv. Fayetteville St. Christian Sch. , 299 N.C. 351, 357, 261 S.E.2d 908, 913 (1980).  A \npreliminary injunction “should not be granted where there is a serious question as to \nthe right of the defendant to engage in the activity and to forbid the defendant to do \nso, pending the final determination of the matter, would cause the defendant greater \ndamage than the plaintiff would sustain from the conti nuance of the activity while \nthe litigation is pending.”  Bd. of Provincial Elders v. Jones , 273 N.C. 174, 182, 159 \nS.E.2d 545, 551 –52 (1968); accord Cty. of Johnston v. City of Wilson , 136 N.C. App \n775, 780, 525 S.E.2d 826, 829 –30 (2000) (noting that a co urt should weigh “the \nadvantages and disadvantages to the parties” in deciding whether to issue a \npreliminary injunction). \nA. Standing \n24. Preliminarily, Defendants challenge Plaintiff’s standing to bring this \naction.  (Mem. Law Opp. Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 2 4 at pp.  12–14.)  \nDefendants, however, focus their standing argument solely on Plaintiff’s claim for \nbreach of fiduciary duty.  Defendants contend that the breach of fiduciary duty claim \nbelongs to KS Bancorp and must be pursued derivatively or pursua nt to one of the \ntwo exceptions recognized under Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks, 346 N.C. 650, 658, \n488 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1997) ( describing the two exceptions as  “(1) where there is a \nspecial duty, such as a contractual duty, between the wrongdoer and the shareholder, \nand (2) where the shareholder suffered an injury separate and distinct from that \nsuffered by other shareholders” ).  Plaintiff, however, is not arguing its likelihood of \nsuccess on its fiduciary duty claim.  It argues only the merits of its claim for a \ndeclaratory judgment t hat KS Bancorp’s adoption of the Rights Plan was unlawful \nunder the North Carolina Business Corporation Act , G.S. §§  55-1-01 et seq.  \n(“NCBCA”). \n25. Plaintiff contends that it has standing to pursue an injunction because \nthe KS Board’s adoption of the Shareholder Rights Plan was  ultra vires, and that it \nhas standing under G.S. § 55-3-04.  Section 55-3-04, entitled “Ultra vires,” provides \nin per tinent part that a “corporation’ s po wer to act may be challenged  . . . [i]n a \nproceeding by a shareholder against the corporation to enjoin the act.”  G.S. § 55-3-\n04(b)(1); see also Norman v. Nash Johnson & Sons’ Farms, Inc. , 140 N.C. App. 390, \n397, 537 S.E.2d 248, 254 (2000) (recognizing that a shareholder may bring an \nindividual claim “to enjoin an ultra vires act by the corporation”);  1-3 Robinson on \nNorth Carolina Corporation Law  § 3.06 (2017)  (Section 55 -3-04(b)(1) “ permits a \nshareholder to raise the claim of ultra vires in a proceeding to enjoin the act .”).  The \nCourt concludes that G.S. §  55-3-04(b)(1) gives Plaintiff, as a shareholder of KS  \nBancorp, standing to bring suit to enjoin an allegedly ultra vires act of KS Bancorp \nat this stage in the litigation.3 \n                                                 \n3 The Court does not decide here whether Plaintiff will have standing to pursue other claims \nin the future under this statute. \nB. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n26. In support of its Motion, Plaintiff argues only the merits of its claim for \na declaratory judgment that KS Bancorp’s Shareholder Rights Plan is void under the \nNCBCA.  Accordingly, the Court will consider only that claim in determining \nPlaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits. \n27. Plaintiff argues that the Shareholder Rights Plan violates the NCBCA \nbecause KS Bancorp is not a public corporation and under the NCBCA only public \ncorporations may enact poison pill plans that discriminate against shares of the same \nclass.  Defendants contend that the NCBCA permits all corporations, public or \nprivate, to enact poison pill s.  Defendants further contend that the NCBCA only \nprohibits discrimination between shares, not between shareholders, and the KS \nBancorp Shareholder Rights Plan only treats shareholders of its common stock, and \nnot the shares, differently. \n28. Plaintiff seeks a declaration that the KS Board’s adoption of the \nShareholder Rights Plan is unlawful pursuant to G.S. §§  55-6-01(a) and 55 -6-24(b) \nbecause KS Bancorp is not a “public corporation” auth orized to adopt a poison pill \nplan under the statutes.  (ECF No. 3 at ¶¶ 68–72.)  Section 55-6-01(a) of the NCBCA \nprovides, in pertinent part, as follows: \nThe articles of incorporation must prescribe the classes of \nshares and the number of shares of each class that the \ncorporation is authorized to issue.  If more than one class \nof shares is authorized, the articles of incorporation must \nprescribe a distinguishing designation for each class, and, \nprior to the issuance of shares of a class, the preferences, \nlimitations, and relative rights of that class must be \ndescribed in the articles of incorporation.   All shares of a \nclass must have preferences, limitations, and relative rights \nidentical with those of other shares of the same class unless \nthe articles of incorporation divide a class into series.   \n \n(Emphasis added.)  KS Bancorp’s Charter provides for two classes of shares: common \nand preferred.  (ECF No. 3 at Ex. 2, p. 1.)  The common stock is not divided into series.  \nPrior to the KS Board’s adoption of the Shareholder Rights Plan, all shares of KS  \nBancorp’s common stock had the same preferences, limitations, and rights.  (See id.) \n29. Section 55-6-24 of the NCBCA provides as follows: \n(a) A corporation may issue rights, options, or warrants \nfor the purchase of shares of the corporation.  The board of \ndirectors, or officers of the corporation who are designated \nby the board of directors pursuant to G.S. 55-6-21(a), shall \ndetermine the terms upon which the rights, options, or \nwarrants are issued, their form and content, and the \nconsideration for which the shares are to be issued. \n \n(b) In the case of a public corporation, the terms and \nconditions of such rights, options or warrants may include, \nwithout limitation, restrictions or conditions that preclude \nor limit the exercise, transfer or receipt of such rights, \noptions or warrants by the holder or holders or beneficial \nowner or owners of a specified number or percentage of the \noutstanding voting shares of such public corporation or by \nany transferee of any such holder or owner, or that \ninvalidate or void such rights, options or warrants held by \nany such holder or owner or by such transferee.  \nDeterminations by the board of  directors whether to \nimpose, enforce, waive or otherwise render ineffective any \nsuch restrictions or conditions may be judicially reviewed \nin an appropriate proceeding. \n \n30. A public corporation is  defined as “any corporation that has a class of \nshares registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as \namended.” G.S. §  55-1-40(18a).  KS Bancorp is not a “public corporation” under the \nNCBCA because it does not have any shares registered unde r Section 12 of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.  (ECF No. 3 at ¶ 34; ECF No. 3, Ex. 1.) \n31. The Court must interpret the statutory language at issue to determine \nwhether a non -public corporation, like KS Bancorp, is authorized to adopt a poison \npill plan.  The Supreme Court of North Carolina recently summarized the basic \nprinciples used by our courts when interpreting the language in a statute as follows: \nQuestions of statutory interpretation are ultimately \nquestions of law for the courts  . . . . The principal goal of \nstatutory construction is to accomplish the legislative \nintent.  The best indici a of that intent are th e language of \nthe statute, the spirit of the act and what the act seeks to \naccomplish.  The process of construing a statutory \nprovision must begin with an examination of the relevant \nstatutory language.  It is well settled that where  the \nlanguage of a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no \nroom for judicial construction and the courts must construe \nthe statute using its plain meaning.  In other words, if the \nstatutory language is clear and unambiguous, the court \neschews statutory construction in favor of giving the words \ntheir plain and definite meaning. \n \nWilkie v. City of Boiling Spring Lakes , No. 44PA17, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 67, *13 –14 \n(Mar. 2, 2018) (citations and quotations omitted); see also N.C. Dep’t of Corr. v. N.C. \nMed. Bd., 363 N.C. 189, 201, 675 S.E.2d 641, 649 (2009) (“When the language of a \nstatute is clear and without ambiguity, it is the duty of this Court to give effect to the \nplain meaning of the statute, and judicial construction of legi slative intent is not \nrequired.  However, when the language of a statute is ambiguous, this Court will \ndetermine the purpose of the statute and the intent of the legislature in its \nenactment.”). \n32. “Usually, words of a statute will be given their natural, approved, and \nrecognized meaning.”  Wilkie, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 67, at *17.  “Courts should give effect \nto the words actually used in a statute and should  neither delete words used nor \ninsert words not used in the relevant statutory language during the  statutory \nconstruction process.”  Midrex Techs. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 369 N.C. 250, 258, 794 \nS.E.2d 785, 792 (2016) (citation s and quotations omitted).  The court should “give \nevery word of the statute  effect, presuming that the legislature carefully chose each \nword used.”  N.C. Dep’t of Corr., 363 N.C. at 201, 675 S.E.2d at 649. \n33. Applying these principles, the Court concludes that the plain meaning \nof the relevant statutes cited above , when read togethe r, is that only public \ncorporations as defined by the NCBCA are authorized to adopt poison pill shareholder \nplans that “preclude or limit,” “invalidate or void,” or otherwise discriminate between \nthe rights attached to shares within the same class of stock.  See G.S. § 55-6-24.  In \nother words, Section 55-6-24, permitting public corporations to discriminate between \nthe rights attached to shares within the same class of stock, functions as an exception \nto the general rule in Section 55 -6-01(a) that “[a] ll shares of a class must have \npreferences, limitations, and relative rights identical with those of other shares of the \nsame class” unless divided into series.   \n34. Nevertheless, even if the Court were to conclude that there were \nambiguity in the statutory language, the available information regarding the General \nAssembly’s intent behind the statutes supports the same interpretation.  The NCBCA \nwas amended in 1989 to add Section 55-6-24 in response to court decisions from other \njurisdictions holding that pois on pill plans violated statutes, such as Section 55-6-\n01(a), that required that all shares of the same class have the same rights and \nrestrictions.  The North Carolina C ommentary to the amend ed Section 55 -6-24 \nprovides: \nSubsection (b) contains special provisions that do not \nappear in either the prior law or the Model Act and are \ndesigned to eliminate uncertainty as to the validity of \ncertain rights plans created by companies with a class of \nsecurities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934. . . . Specifically, the rights plans typically used as \ndefenses to hostile takeovers (called “poison pills”) create \npurchase or conversion rights that are not exercisable in \nthe hands of a hostile bidder.  Without explicit statutory \nlanguage to the contr ary, for example, such a \ndiscriminatory feature might be hel d to violate the \nrequirement of G.S. 55 -6-01 that all shares of the same \nclass have the same rights  . . . .  The drafters were of that  \n(sic) view that rights plans should not be generally \nprohibited.  Several states, including New York, \nPennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Hawaii, have adopted \nexplicit validating language similar to that included in this \nsection. \n \nG.S. § 55-6-24 cmt. \n \n35. The C ommentary strongly supports the conclusion that in enacting \nSection 55-6-24(b), the General Assembly was concerned with providing publicly \ntraded North Carolina corporations the ability to adopt poison pill  plans in the face \nof an attempted hostile takeover bid.  See Parsons v. Jefferson-Pilot Corp., 333 N.C. \n420, 425, 426 S.E.2d 685, 689 (1993) (“[T]he commentary to a statutory provision can \nbe helpful in some cases in discerning legislative intent.”). \n36. Defendants contend that Section 55-6-24(b) merely “sought to clarify \nthat rights plans would not violate other pro visions of the North Carolina Business \nCorporation Act” and “does not address whether private corporations may adopt such \nplans.”  (ECF No. 2 4 at p. 20.)  Defendants argue that the 1989 amendment to the \nstatute did not reference non -public corporations bec ause poison pills were rarely \nused by private, closely-held corporations at that time, so there was “no need” for the \nlegislature to address private corporations.  ( Id. at pp. 21 –22.)  The Court is not \npersuaded by this argument.  I t conflicts with two te nets of statutory construction:  \n(1) expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the expression of one thing is the exclusion of \nanother, Baker v. Martin, 330 N.C. 331, 337, 410 S.E.2d 887, 890 –91 (1991); and (2) \nthat every word of a statute should be given effect, N.C. Dep’t of Corr., 363 N.C. at \n201, 675 S.E.2d at 649.  The use of the term “public corporation” in Section 55-6-24(b) \nmust be interpreted to mean that private corporations we re excluded from its \nprovisions, and the term would be superfluous in the statute if the General Assembly \nactually intended to include all corporations. \n37. In addition, in response to the court decisions invalidating poison pill \nplans, some states amended their corporation acts to authorize all corporations, \npublic or private, to adopt poison pill shareholders’ rights plans, see, e.g., Ariz. Rev. \nStat. § 10-624(C); Colo. Rev. Stat. § 7-106-205(3); Ga. Code Ann. § 14-2-624(c), while \nothers passed amendments permitting only public corporations, or public \ncorporations with a minimum number of shareholders, to adopt such  plans, see, e.g., \nN.Y. Bus. Corp. Law §  505(a)(2) (only public corporations ); S.C. Code  Ann. § 33-6-\n240(B) (only public corporations); Idaho Code §§  30-1701(11) and 30 -1706(1) (only \npublic corporations with 50 or more share holders); S.D. Codified Laws §§  47-33-3(n) \nand 47-33-5 (only public corpo rations with 50 or more shareholders).  There is no \nreason to believe that the North Carolina General Assembly did not bring the same \nconsiderations to bear as the legislatures in these other states in deciding to adopt \nSection 55-6-24 and limit authority to adopt poison pill plans to public corporations. \n38. Defendants also argue that Section 55-6-01(a) only requires that shares, \nand not shareholders, be treated identically, and that under the Shareholder Rights \nPlan only shareholders are treated differently .  The Court is not persuaded by this \nargument.  Other provisions of the NCBCA support the notion that shares cannot be \npractically separated from shareholders’ rights arising out of those shares.  For \nexample, Section 55-11-01 provides that boards of directors may adopt and \nshareholders may approve a “plan of  merger” for merger of one corporation into \nanother.  The statute further provides, in relevant part, that “[t] he plan of merger \nmust set forth:  . . . (3) The mann er and basis of converting the shares of each \ncorporation into shares, obligations, or other securities of the surviving or any other \ncorporation or into cash or other property in whole or part. ”  G.S. §  55-11-01(b).  In \nthe North Carolina Commentary to Section 55-11-01, the legislature noted that the \ndrafters believed that, with the exception of public corporations under Section 55 -6-\n24(b), the current law of North Carolina “does not permit discrimination among the \nholders of shares of a single class  in the kind of property that can be received in a \nmerger; all the shares of a single class must be treated the same, both in value and \nkind.”  G.S. § 55-11-01 cmt. (emphasis added). \n39. In addition , following amendment, the current Model Business \nCorporation Act  explicitly permits shareholders to be treated differently.   (Model \nBusiness Corporation Act, ECF No. 27, Ex. 1 at § 6.01(e) (“Any of the terms of shares \nmay vary among holders of the same class or series so long as such variations are \nexpressly set forth i n the articles of incorporation.” ).)  Section 6.01(e) of the Model \nBusiness Corporation Act was revised in 2001 to “allow for variations among \n[share]holders, so long as the terms are stated in the articles of incorporation,”  and \nthis revision post -dates t he 1989 revision of the NCBCA.  (Model Business \nCorporation Act § 6.01 cmt.)  The NCBCA has not been amended following the Model \nBusiness Corporation Act amendment to follow the revised Model Business \nCorporation Act in that respect, suggesting that the legislature did not intend for \nSection 55 -6-01(a) to mean that only shares, but not shareholders, be treated \nidentically.   \n40. The Court recognizes that there is case law from other jurisdictions \nsupporting the proposition that anti-discrimination provisions such as the one in the \nNCBCA only require that shares, and not shareholders, be treated identically.  See, \ne.g., Dynamics Corp. of Am. v. CTS Corp. , 637 F. Supp. 406, 408 (N.D. Ill. 1986) ; \nNeuberger Berman Real Estate Income Fund, Inc. v. Brown Trust No. 1B, 342 F. Supp. \n2d 371, 374 –75 (D. Md. 2004) .  However, the Court finds it difficult to divorce the \nrights that a shareholder possesses in his  or her shares from the rights inherent in \nthe shares themselves.  See Farrish-Stafford Co. v. Charlotte Cotton Mills , 157 N.C. \n188, 189–90, 72 S.E. 973, 974 (1911) (“It is elementary that a corporation as a rule \nmust treat all shareholders of the same class alike.”); 1-19 Robinson on North \nCarolina Corporation Law § 19.04 n.6 (2017) (noting that the provision requiring all \nshares in the same series to have identical rights was moved to Section 55 -6-01(a) \n“with modifications not intended to change” the rule described in Farrish-Stafford \nCo.).  Absent any specific guidance on the issue from the NCBCA’s statutory \nlanguage, commentary, or legislative history, the Court declines at this stage of the \nlitigation and based on the record currently before it to interpret Section 55 -6-01(a) \nas permitting shareholders of the same class of shares to be treated differently based \non the number of shares they hold.  \n41. Because KS Bancorp is not a public corporation under the NCBCA, it is \nnot permitted to enact a Shareholder Rights Plan that discriminates between the \nrights attached to shares of stock within the same class.   Accordingly, Plaintiff has \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim for declaratory \njudgment. \nC. Irreparable Harm and Balancing the Equities \n42. The question of whether Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if  this \nCourt does not issue the injunction is much more difficult.  Plaintiff contends that it \nwill be irreparably injured if the injunction is not issued because it will lose the \nopportunity to purchase up to 80% of KS Bancorp’s common stock under the Federal \nReserve’s current approval. 4  (Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 8 at pp. \n                                                 \n4 That approval expires on March 19, 2018.  At the hearing, however, Plaintiff’s counsel stated \nthat Plaintiff will seek an extension of the March 19, 2018 deadline.  As noted above (¶ 11), \nat Plaintiff’s request, the Federal Reserve may extend the deadline until December 19, 2018. \n15–18.)  Plaintiff argues that it will lose both “the opportunity to increase its \nownership of shares of [KS Bancorp]’s common stock, and all the rights attendant \nwith those shares.”  (Id. at p. 18.)  Plaintiff asserts that its loss is irreparable because \nthere currently are “willing shareholders who want to sell” their shares to Plaintiff, \nand there is a “limited market for [KS Bancorp’s] shares and a limited window of \ntime” for Plaintiff to purchase those shares.  ( Reply Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Prelim. \nInj., ECF No. 27 at p. 10.) \n43. Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s “alleged injury is speculative and \nremote” because the Federal Reserve could extend Plaintiff’s approval to purchase \nKS Bancorp’s shares, and it is unlikely that Plaintiff would be able to acquire 80% of \nKS Bancorp’s stock.  (ECF No. 24 at pp. 8–9.) \n44. In its reply, Plaintiff makes the additional argument that it, and KS \nBancorp’s other shareholders, are being subjected to per se irreparable injury because \nthe Shareholder Rights Plan is unlawful and ultra vires.  In support of its argument, \nPlaintiff relies on Asarco, Inc. v. Court, 611 F. Supp. 468 (D.N.J. 1985) .  In Asarco, \ndefendant Weeks Petroleum, Inc.  (“Weeks”) began acquiring plaintiff Asarco , Inc.’s \n(“Asarco”) stock with the intent of gaining control of Asarco.  Id. at 469–70.  Asarco’s \nboard of directors concluded that Weeks’ acquisition of control would not be in its \nshareholders’ best interest.  Id. at 470.  In response, the board approved the issuance \nof Series C Preferred Stock to prevent Weeks or other outside investors from \nacquiring a controlling stake in Asarco .  Id.  Asarco intended to issue , as a dividend \nto shareholders, one-tenth of a share of Serie s C Preferred Stock for each share of \ncommon stock held by the shareholder.  Id. at 471.  The Series C Preferred Stock \ncarried with it certain rights and privileges, including “if any person or group becomes \nthe ‘beneficial owner’ of more than 20 percent of either Asarco ’s common stock or its \nSeries C Preferred, then each one-tenth of Series C owned by anyone other than the \n20 percent holder would have five votes in all matters submitted to the common \nstockholders.  The Series C shares owned by the 20 percent holder would . . . have no \nvoting rights.”  Id. \n45. Weeks moved to preliminarily enjoin Asarco and its board of directors \nfrom issuing the Series C Preferred Stock, contending, inter alia, that it violated the \nNew Jersey Business Corporation Act because the Act prohibited a corporation from \nissuing a class of shares having different voting rights.  Id. at 472.  The district court \nagreed with Weeks, holding: \n[I]n adopting the voting provisions of Asarco Series C \nPreferred Stock, Asarco’s Board of Directors exceeded the \nauthority which the New Jersey Business Corporation Act \nconferred upon them.  Thus issuance of the stock would be \nunlawful. . . . \n \nNeither N.J.S.A. 14A:7 -2 nor any other provision of the \nBusiness Corporation Act confer upon the corporation or its \ndirectors the power to issue classes of shares which have \ndiffering voting rights within the same class or which \nmodify previously issued classes of shares so as to confer \ndifferent voting rights upon shares within that c lass.  \nAsarco’s Series C Preferred Stock has this effect and \nconsequently its issuance would be ultra vires and void. \n \nId. at 479–80. \n \n46. In Asarco, the district court also held that:  \nWeeks has established irreparable injury if Series C \nPreferred Stock is issued.  It holds a substantial block of \nAsarco common stock and evidently plans to acquire in \nexcess of 20 percent of the total common shares \noutstanding.  If it does so, its vote wil l be illegally diluted \nby virtue of the new preferred.  Weeks’ opportunity to make \na tender offer will be limited by an unlawful device and \ncorrespondingly the opportunity of other shareholders to \nreceive a tender offer will be impaired.  All this constitutes \nirreparable injury. \n \nOnce the new stock is issued, it will be in the hands of the \ncommon stockholders in the first instance, and then \nundoubtedly large amounts of it will be traded separately \nfrom the common.  All manner of equities may arise which \nwill make it difficult or impossible to restore the parties to \nthis proceeding to the status quo ante.  This too presents a \nthreat of irreparable injury. \n \nId. at 480 (citations omitted). \n47. Finally, in balancing the equities, the district court in Asarco opined \nthat permitting Weeks to acquire a controlling interest in Asarco might well cause \nharm to the corporation and its shareholders, but “to allow” the board of directors’ \n“unlawful measures” to be employed in defense of a hostile takeover “would only \nensure that injury of a different kind would be inflicted upon the shareholders and \nupon Asarco.”  Id. \n48. While the Court finds that the Asarco court did not hold that the board \nof directors’ ultra vires  approval of the Series C Preferred Stock caused per se \nirreparable harm to the plaintiff, its holding is supportive of Plaintiff’s claim that it \nwill suffer irreparable injury in this case if the KS Bancorp poison pill plan is not \nenjoined.  As in Asarco, if KS Bancorp is not required to terminate, or is prohibited \nfrom taking action under, the Shareholder Rights plan, then Plaintiff’s acquisition of \n15% of the common stock will likely cause its ownership stake to be significantly \ndiluted by “an illegal device,” and other shareholders’ opportunity to receive an offer \nof purchase from Plaintiff “will be impaired.”  Id. at 480.  If Plaintiff then ultimately \nprevailed in this lawsuit it would be extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, to \nrestore it to its prior position or to calculate an amount of damages that would \ncompensate for its injuries.  The Court concludes that under the circumstances \npresent in this case, the injury to Plaintiff’s rights would be irreparable. \n49. Finally, the balancing of the equit ies also favors  Plaintiff, albeit \nnarrowly.  Although Defendants may have a legitimate interest in maintaining KS \nBancorp as an independent business and in representing its shareholders in the event \nof attempted hostile takeover of the corporation, the use of the unlawful mechanism \nof a poison pill plan to do so effectively negates Defendants’ right to assert any \nequities inherent in that interest.  In addition, as Plaintiff contends, KS Bancorp’s \nArticles of Incorporation already contain provision s providing certain protections \nfrom a hostile takeove r or merger.  The Articles of Incorporation require approval \nfrom the holders of  75% of the outstanding voting shares  or 75% of the KS Board \nbefore any business combination can be approved.  (Stipulation, ECF No. 26, Ex. A at \n§ 7.2.)  If the injunction issues, Defendants are not without a defensive mechanism to \nattempt to prevent a hostile takeover.   \n50. Because the Court finds that: (1) Plaintiff has a likelihood of success on \nthe merits of its declaratory judgment claim, (2) Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm \nif an injunction does not issue, and (3) the balancing of the equities favors Plaintiff, \nthe Court concludes that the Motion should be GRANTED. \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: \n51. Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED; and \nDefendants are IMMEDIATELY ENJOINED and PROHIBITED  from taking any \naction under the Shareholder Rights Plan or from adopting any similar “poison pill”  \nplans while this litigation is pending. \n52. On or before 5:00 p.m. on April 4, 2018 , Plaintiff shall post a bond of \n$25,000 with, and in a form satisfactory to, the Clerk of Superior Court of Wake \nCounty.  If Plaintiff fails to post the required bond by 5:00 p.m. on April 4, 2018, the \ninjunction shall dissolve immediately. \nSO ORDERED, this the 21st day of March, 2018. \n \n/s/ Gregory P.
