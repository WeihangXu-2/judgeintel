This case involves  a dispute between the parties regarding payment to \nPlaintiff Rossabi Law PLLC (“Plaintiff”) for the legal representation of Defendants \nGreater Greensboro Entertainment Group, LLC (“GGEG”) and N C lub, LLC (“N \nClub” and collectively referred to with GGEG as “Defendants”) in litigation with the \nCity of Greensboro.  Plaintiff raises two claims against both Defendants: (1) a claim \nfor breach of contract based on an alleged contingent fee agreement between Plaintiff \nand Defendants  for the payment of Plaintiff’s legal fees (the “Contingency \nAgreement”); and (2) an alternative claim for recovery on the basis of quantum \nmeruit.  (Compl. ¶¶ 68–85, ECF No. 3.) \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n4. On 21 August 2020, Defendants filed Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment (the “Summary Judgment Motion”) requesting that the Court grant \nDefendants summary judgment as to both of Plaintiff’s claims.  (ECF No. 56.) \nFollowing briefing and oral argument on the Summary Judgment Motion, on 5 May \n2021, the Court entered the Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment (the “Order and Opinion”).  (Order & Op.  Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF  No. \n \n \n70 [“Order & Op.”].) 1  By the Order and Opinion, the Court denied the Summary \nJudgment Motion as to both claims. \n5. Five days after entry of the Order and Opinion, on 10 May 2021, Defendants \nfiled Defendants’ Motion to Reconsider Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment (the “First Motion”).  (ECF No. 71.)   \n6. On 11 June 2021, Plaintiff filed Plaintiff’s Response to Defendants’ Motion \nto Reconsider (the “Response Brief”).  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Reconsider, ECF No. 75 \n[“Resp.”].) \n7. On 17 June 2021, Defendants file d the Motion and separately filed \nDefendants’ Brief in Support of Motion and Amended and Re stated Motion to \nReconsider Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (the \n“Amended Brief in Support”).  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. & Am. & Restated Mot. \nReconsider Order & Op. Defs.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 77 [“Am. Br.”].) \n8. Defendants filed the Motion and Amended Brief in Support seemingly only \nmodifying the First Motion with the addition of one paragraph and in form to bring \nthe First Motion into compliance with Rule 7.2 of the North Carolina Business Court \nRules (the “BCR(s)”).\n2  (Am. Br. 1.)  \n \n1 The Court sets forth herein only the portions of the procedural history relevant to its \ndetermination of the Motion.  A  more detailed description of the procedural background of \nthis case can be found in the Order and Opinion.  (Order & Op. ¶¶ 35–41.)   \n \n2 BCR 7.2 provides that “[e]ach motion must be set out in a separate document.”  The First \nMotion and its brief in support were filed as a single PDF document.  In other words, the \nFirst Motion was not set out in a separate document and therefore not  filed in compliance \nwith BCR 7.2. \n \n \n9. On 17 June 2021, Defendants filed Defendants’ Reply Brief in Support of \nMotion and Amended and Restated Motion to Reconsider Order and Opinion on \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (the “Reply”) replying to the Response \nBrief.  (Defs.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. & Am. & Restated Mot. Reconsider Order & Op.  \nDefs.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 78 [“Reply”].) \n10. On 18 June 2021, Plaintiff filed Plaintiff’s Response to Defendants’ \nAmended Motion to Reconsider noting that in filing the Motion, Defendants \nseemingly only cured their defect in the form of the First Motion and Plaintiff had no \nadditional arguments  to make  than those in the Response Brief.  (ECF No. 79.)  \nTherefore, Plaintiff did not file an additional response to the Motion. \n11. Accordingly, the Court conside rs the First Motion withdrawn and the \nCourt, considering the Amended Brief in Support, Response Brief, and R eply, rules \non the Motion as amended.   \n12. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on 8 July 2021.  (See ECF No. 80.)  \nThe Motion is now ripe for resolution.   \nIII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND3 \n13. A central and important dispute in this case, both factually and legal ly, is \nwhether the Contingency Agreement was actually signed by Defendants’ authorized \nagents.  Third- Party Defendant Amiel Rossabi (“Rossabi”) provided to the Court a \nwritten but unsigned copy of the Contingency Agreement, dated 25 January 2018, \nwhich provides in relevant part: \n \n3 The Court does not make findings of fact on the Motion.  The Court recites relevant facts, \nboth undisputed and disputed, to provide context for the Court’s ruling herein. \n \n \n[Plaintiff] will represent [Defendants] with respect to the [Cone Deni m \nAction], with the understanding that [Plaintiff] will receive a contingent \nfee equal to 331 3� % of the amount of recovery.  The recovery shall mean \nany compensation GGEG and/or N Club receive, whether through \nsettlement or otherwise related to the [Cone Denim Action].  If some or \nall of the compensation is not monetary, the value of such compensation \nshall be calculated to determine the full amount of recovery. \n \n(Aff. Amiel J. Rossabi Ex. J, ECF No. 63.10 [“Contingency Agreement”].)\n4      \n14. The Contingency Agreement provided to the Court contains two signature \nblocks: one for GGEG and one for N Club.  (Contingency Agreement 4.)  A signed copy \nof the Contingency Agreement has not been provided to the Court at this time, and \nDefendants deny that the Contingency  Agreement was ever signed on behalf of \nDefendants.  (Aff. Rocco Scarfone ¶¶ 45–46, ECF No. 585 [“Scarfone Aff.”]; Aff. Jeffrey \nFurr ¶¶ 30–31, ECF No. 58 [“Furr Aff.”].)  Defendants also deny that Scarfone or Furr \napproved the Contingency Agreement.  (Furr Aff. ¶33.)   \n15. Section 3.3 of GGEG’s Operating Agreement  (the “Operating Agreement”) \nprovides:  \nThe Vice -President of [GGEG] shall be notified of all legal matters \nincluding but not limited to leases, contracts, agreements, fees, and \nmajor expenditures of [GGEG] prior to their being incurred.  “Major \nExpenditure” is defined as any expenditure exceeding Ten Thousand \nDollars ($10,000.00 )[.]  Prior to entering any of the above or a Major \nExpenditure, the Vice -President and President shall discuss and \nmutually agree.  Upon the event they do not agree then an agreement \nwill be reached by a Majority in Interest of the Members. \n \n(Scarfone Aff. Ex. 2 § 3.3 [“Operating Agreement”].) \n \n4 “Cone Denim Action” is used herein as defined in the Order and Opinion.  (Order & Op. ¶ \n18.)  \n \n5 In filing Defendants’ brief supporting the Summary Judgment Motion, Defendants filed \ntheir supporting brief and exhibits all as one PDF document located at ECF No. 58. \n \n \n16. The “Majority in Interest” is defined by the Operating Agreement as “any \ncombination of a specified group of Members which, in the aggregate, owns more than \n50% of the Percentage Interests of such specified group of Members.”  (Operating \nAgreement § 2.1.)  A t all times relevant to this dispute, GGEG had three members: \nRossabi, Rocco Scarfone (“Scarfone”), and Jeffrey Furr (“Furr”), (Scarfone Aff. ¶¶ 2, \n6; Furr Aff. ¶ 2), and Scarfone has acted as the President of GGEG and Furr has acted \nas the Vice President of GGEG, (Scarfone Aff. ¶ 3; Furr Aff. ¶ 3).   \n17. On 9 October 2015, Rossabi, Furr, and Scarfone signed  corporate records \ntitled Minutes of Action Without Meeting by the Members and Managers of Greater \nGreensboro Entertainment Group, LLC (“GGEG’s Minutes”) .  (Rebuttal Aff. Rocco \nScarfone Ex. 11, ECF No. 65 [“Scarfone Rebuttal Aff.”].)  GGEG’s Minutes tend to \nshow that as of 9 October 2015, Furr owned 50%, Scarfone owned 47%, and Rossabi \nowned 3% of GGEG.  GGEG’s Minutes are signed by Rossabi.  (Scarfone Rebuttal Aff. \n¶ 3.)  Scarfone testified  that the ownership of GGEG did not change between 9 \nOctober 2015 and 10 August 2018.  (Scarfone Rebuttal Aff. ¶ 3.) \n18. By contrast, Rossabi testified in opposition to the Summary Judgment \nMotion, by way of the submission of the Affidavit of Amiel J. Rossabi (the “Rossabi \nAffidavit”), that Scarfone held the Majority in Interest.  (Aff. Amiel J. Rossabi ¶ 69, \nECF No. 63 [“Rossabi Aff.”].)  The Rossabi Affidavit specifically represents that \nScarfone and Furr “ignore key provisions of the GGEG Operating Agreement” and  \nthat Scarfone “held the Majority in Interest and he agreed to and signed the written \n \n \ncontingency fee agreement[,]” (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 69), thereby properly binding GGEG to \nits terms. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n19. Under Rule 54(b), an interlocutory ruling, like the Order an d Opinion, “is \nsubject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims \nand the rights and liabilities of all the parties.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule 54(b).  “Rule \n54(b) is the source of authority for what litigants typically r efer to as ‘motions to \nreconsider.’ ”  Tetra Tech Tesoro, Inc. v. JAAAT Tech. Servs., LLC, 250 N.C. App. 791, \n798 (2016) (citing Akeva , L.L.C. v. Adidas Am., Inc., 385 F. Supp. 2d 559, 565 \n(M.D.N.C. 2005)).  “Because North Carolina courts have not articulated a standard \nfor reconsideration under Rule 54(b), this Court has regularly sought guidance from \nanalogous federal cases” addressing the similarly worded Federa l Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54(b).  Charlotte Student Hous. DST v. Choate Constr. Co. , 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 21, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing Bohn v. Black , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 50, at *7 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 16, 2018); W4 Farms, Inc. v. Tyson Farms, Inc., \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 99, at *4– 5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, 2017)).  In doing so, this \nCourt has explained that deciding whether to grant or deny “[a] motion for \nreconsideration under Rule 54(b) is within the trial court’s discretion.”  W4 Farms , \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 99, at *5 (citing Akeva, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 565 ; Ward v. FSC I, \nLLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 19, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 7, 2017)). \n20. “A motion for reconsideration is not a vehicle to identify facts or legal \narguments that could have been, but were not, raised at the time the relevant motion \n \n \nwas pending.”  Julianello v. K-V Pharm. Co., 791 F.3d 915, 923 (8th Cir. 2015).  This \nCourt has summarized the grounds upon which a trial court will generally grant a \nmotion to reconsider an interlocutory order as follows: “(1) the discovery of new \nevidence, (2) an intervening development or change in the controlling law, or (3) the \nneed to correct a clear error or prevent manife st injustice.”  W4 Farms, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 99, at *5 (quoting RF Micro Devices, Inc. v. Xiang , 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n74550, at *3–4 (M.D.N.C. June 8, 2016)). \n21. “The limited use of a motion to reconsider serves to ensure that parties are \nthorough and accurate in their original pleadings and arguments presented to the \nCourt.  To allow motions to reconsider offhandedly or routinely would result in an \nunending motions practice.”  Wiseman v. First Citizens Bank & Tr. Co. , 215 F.R.D. \n507, 509 (W.D.N.C. 2003) (citation omitted).  As a result, motions for reconsideration \nare rarely granted.  See W4 Farms, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 99, at *5.      \nV. ANALYSIS \n22. Defendants do not argue that the discovery of new evidence or an \nintervening change in law warrants reconsidering the Order a nd Opinion.  \nDefendants contend that reconsideration is appropriate because the Order and \nOpinion was “based upon clear error” and the C ourt limits its consideration to this \nargument.  (Am. Br. 2.) \n23. Specifically, Defendants contend that the Court’s statemen t in the Order \nand Opinion that “Scarfone was the owner of a Majority in Interest of the Members \n[of GGEG] is a clear error.”  (Am. Br. 2.)  It is Defendants’ position that the record is \n \n \nundisputed that for the Contingency Agreement to be binding on them, the Operating \nAgreement required Furr to approve the Contingency Agreement and no such \napproval was given.   (Am. Br. 2.)  Defendants contend that , as a result of Furr’s \nfailure to approve  the Contingency Agreement,  they are entitled to summary \njudgment on the breach of contract claim.  (Am. Br. 3–4.)    \n24. In most instances, the parties seemingly make the same arguments on \nbehalf of, or against, both Defendants.  However, the Court believes t here is a \nmeaningful distinction between the evidence before it regarding the two entities and \naddresses GGEG and N Club separately herein.   \nA. N Club \n25. The Complaint and record are clear that Plaintiff asserts a claim for breach \nof the Contingency Agreement against both GGEG and N Club.  (Compl. ¶¶ 69 –75.)  \nPlaintiff alleges that Plaintiff and Defendants, both GGEG and N Club, “entered into \nand agreed to” the Contingency Agreement.  (Compl. ¶ 69.)  The Contingency \nAgreement before the Court is addressed to bot h GGEG and N Club.  ( See generally \nContingency Agreement.)  Its terms provide that Plaintiff is entitled to a certain \npercentage of both Defendants’ recovery in the Cone Denim Action and “recovery shall \nmean any compensation GGEG and/or N Club receive[.]”   (Contingency Agreement \n1.)  The Contingency Agreement includes a signature block for both GGEG and N \nClub.  (Contingency Agreement 3.)   Therefore, even if the breach of contract claim \nwas ultimately dismissed against GGEG, th at would not be d eterminative of \nPlaintiff’s breach of contract claim against N Club.   \n \n \n26. However, t here is no evidence in the record before the Court that an \noperating agreement was ever negotiated and signed for N Club, who the owners and \nmanagers were during the relevant time period, and what their ownership \npercentages were.6  Accordingly, the Court is unable to discern whether Scarfone was \nauthorized to sign the Contingency Agreement on behalf of N Club and bind N Club \nto its terms.  The record does include a Professional Services Review Agreement dated \n24 October 2017 seemingly sent to Scarfone on behalf of N Club and signed by “Rocco” \non behalf of N Club.  (Scarfone Aff. Ex. 5.)  The record also includes a Settlement and \nRelease of all Claims dated 24 April 2018 signed  by Scarfone in his capacity as \nmanager of N Club.  (Scarfone Aff. Ex. 8.)  Therefore, a reasonable inference could be \ndrawn that Scarfone had the authority to sign the Contingency Agreement on behalf \nof N Club.7       \n27. As a result, the Court concludes that, as to N Club, Defendants have failed \nto demonstrate the need to correct a clear error in this Court’s Order and Opinion .  \nTherefore, Defendants’ request that the Court, upon reconsideration, grant N Club \npartial summary judgment as to the claim for breach of the Contingency Agreement, \nshould be DENIED.   \n \n6 The evidence of record on these points is scarce.  Scarfone’s and Furr’s respective affidavits \nstate Scarfone is a member and manager of N Club and Furr is a member of N Club.  \n(Scarfone Aff. ¶2; Furr Aff. ¶ 2.)  Taking these statements together, there is still a less than \nclear picture of the ownership and structure of N Club.  \n \n7 At the hearing on the Motion, counsel for Defendants indicated that N Club and GGEG \nhave similar, or the same, operating agreements.  However, no operating agreement of N \nClub has been made a part of the record before the Court and the Court declines to consider \nthis statement by counsel for Defendants as evidence on the point.   \n \n \nB. GGEG \n28. The Court now turns to Defendants’ contention that Scarfone did not have \nthe authority to bind GGEG to the Contingency Agreement and Plaintiff’s responsive \nargument that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether Scarfone had apparent \nauthority to sign the Contingency Agreement on behalf of GGEG.  \n1. The Holder of the Majority in Interest  \n29. Importantly, the record before the Court on summary judgment appeared \nto be in dispute as to the ownership interests of GGEG at the time the Contingency \nAgreement was submitted by Rossabi to Scarfone.   While Defendants introduced \ntestimony and documents tending to show that Scarfone did not own the Majority in \nInterest of GGEG, Plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that, at the relevant \ntime, Scarfone was owner of the Majority in Interest of GGEG  and thus entitled to \nunilaterally approve the Contingency Agreement notwithstanding Furr’s \ndisagreement. \n30. This dispute was critical to the Court’s analysis of the Summary Judgment \nMotion because, as Defendants point out, the Operating Agreement requires that, if \nFurr and Scarfone disagreed with a legal agreement of the type subject to this \nlitigation, a Majority in Interest of GGEG’s members were required to approve it. \n31. At the hearing on the Motion, counsel for Plaintiff conceded that GGEG’s \nMinutes were va lid and effective and were signed by Rossabi ; that Rossabi was \nmistaken about the ownership interests when he signed the Rossabi Affidavit ; and \n \n \naccordingly, at the time relevant to this litigation, Scarfone did not hold a Majority \nin Interest of GGEG.     \n32. As an initial matter, regardless of Rossabi’s subsequent concession, the \nCourt was in error in its Order and Opinion in its statement as undisputed fact that \nScarfone held the Majority in Interest  of GGEG.  (Order & Op. ¶¶ 10, 53.)  Upon \nfurther consideration, the record initially before the Court disclosed a disputed issue \nof fact on this point.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Motion in part to the extent \nthat the Court recited in paragraphs 10 and 53 in the Order and Opinion that \nScarfone held the Majority in Interest.  Those statements are hereby withdrawn.   \nBased on Rossabi’s subsequent admission to the Court, through his counsel, it is clear \nand undisputed that Scarfone did not own a Majority in Interes t in GGEG at the \nrelevant time.      \n2. Authority to Sign the Contingency Agreement  on Behalf of \nGGEG \n33. As a result of the Court’s conclusion  that it is an undisputed fact that  \nScarfone was not the owner of the Majority in Interest in GGEG at the relevant time, \nthe Court determines it proper to reconsider GGEG’s right to summary judgment as \nto Plaintiff’s claim for breach of the Contingency Agreemen t.  Simply p ut, because \nScarfone did not own the Majority in Interest of GGEG, if he, as President, and Furr, \nas Vice President, disagreed on whether to enter into the Contingency Agreement , \nScarfone could not unilaterally bind GGEG  to the terms of the Con tingency \nAgreement.  Defendants contend that the evidence is undisputed that Furr did not \n \n \nagree with the Contingency Agreement and, regardless of Plaintiff’s evidence that \nScarfone purportedly represented to Rossabi that he would sign the Contingency \nAgreement, Scarfone had no authority to do so. \n34. Plaintiff contends that , notwithstanding its concession as to the owner of \nthe Majority in Interest of GGEG , the Motion should nonetheless be denied because \nthe Court cannot determine from the undisputed facts that  (1) Furr did not approve \nthe Contingency Agreement and (2) Plaintiff  “knew that Furr had not approved the \n[Contingency Agreement] and that Plaintiff’s reliance on Scarfone’s apparent \nauthority was, therefore, unreasonable as a matter of law.”  (Resp. 4 –5 (emphasis in \noriginal).) \n35. Plaintiff’s position that “[t]here is a material question as to whether \nScarfone and Furr discussed the [Contingency Agreement] and whether Furr \napproved it” is mistake n.  (See Resp. 6.)  Based on the Court’s careful review of the \nrecord, it concludes that it  is an undisputed fact that Furr did not approve the \nContingency Agreement.  (Furr Aff. ¶ 33.)  Furr, by way of his affidavit, attests that \nhe never approved any con tingent fee agreement with Plaintiff.  (Furr Aff. ¶ 33.)   \nPlaintiff does not allege that Furr approved the Contingency Agreement.  Nor does \nPlaintiff offer any evidence to rebut Furr’s statement that he never approved the \nContingency Agreement.  \n36. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s argument that the Motion should be denied rests \nupon Plaintiff’s position that a genuine question of fact  exists “on the material issue \nof apparent authority[.]”  (Resp. 7 (emphasis omitted).)  It is Plaintiff’s position that \n \n \n“unless [D]efendants can prove that [P]laintiff had actual knowledge that Scarfone ” \ndid not have authority to bind Defendants to the Contingency Agreement , the \nContingency Agreement is binding on Defendants.  (Resp. 8 (emphasis omitted).) \n37. Defendants contend that apparent authority does not apply in this instance \nbecause Rossabi, as a member of GGEG, is charged with knowledge of the terms of \nGGEG’s Operating Agreement.  (Reply 6.)   The Court, at least in part, agrees with \nDefendants. \n38. “Apparent authority is defined as ‘that authority which the principal has \nheld the agent out as possessing or which he has permitted the agent to represent \nthat he possesses.’ ”  Media Network, Inc. v. Mullen Advert., Inc., 2007 NCBC LEXIS \n1, at *49 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 19 , 2007) (citing Zimmerman v. Hogg & Allen , 286 \nN.C. 24, 31 (1974)).  “Where a third party in good faith and with reasonable prudence \ndeals with an agent having apparent authority, the principal is bound by the agent’s \nacts.”  Foote & Davies, Inc. v. Arnold Craven, Inc., 72 N.C. App. 591, 595 (1985).  “Any \napparent authority that might otherwise exist vanishes in the presence of the third \nperson’s knowledge, actual or constructive, of what the agent is, or what he is not , \nempowered to do for his principal.”  Com. Solvents, Inc. v. Johnson, 235 N.C. 237, 242 \n(1952) (citation omitted).  \n39. Members of an LLC are generally charged with knowledge of the terms of \nthe LLC’s operating agreement.  See Levin v. Jacobson, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 66, at *7 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 25, 2016)  (citing Biesecker v. Biesecker, 62 N.C. App. 282, 285 \n(1983) (“[A] person signing a written instrument is under a duty to read it for his own \n \n \nprotection, and ordinarily is charged with knowledge of its contents.”)).  Accordingly, \nRossabi is charged with the knowledge of GGEG’s Operating Agreement and GGEG’s \nMinutes, both signed by Rossabi, which required the agreement by Furr and Scarfone \nor the approval of the Majority in Interest  to bind GGEG to the Contingency \nAgreement and that knowledge is further imputed to Plaintiff.  8   See Zloop, Inc. v. \nParker Poe Adams & Berstein, LLP , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 16, at * 17–18 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Feb. 16, 2018) (“[A] principal is generally bound by the knowledge and acts of its \nagent when the agent clearly acts within the  scope of his authority to conduct the \nprincipal’s business.”); see also CompoSecure, LLC v. CardUX, LLC , 206 A.3d 807,  \n823 (2018) (“[T]he knowledge of an agent acting within the scope of her authority on \nbehalf of the principal LLC is imputed to the LLC.”).  \n40. The record is devoid of any facts that tend to show that: (1) Furr agreed to \nthe Contingency Agreement , as required by GGEG’s Operating Agreement ; (2) any \nagent of GGEG represented to Plaintiff that Furr agreed to the Contingency \nAgreement; or (3) that Plaintiff, or any of its agents, believed Furr agreed to the \nContingency Agreement.\n9  The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiff has failed to \n \n8 While generally whether Rossabi was acting in the scope of his authority to conduct \nPlaintiff’s business would be a factual question, Plaintiff does not allege, or make any factual \nallegations that would support the conclusion, that Rossabi was acting on behalf of Plaintiff \noutside the scope of his authority.  \n \n9 In the Rossabi Affidavit, Rossabi testifie d that “[a]ll of the allegations contained in the \nComplaint in the captioned matter are true and accurate based on my first-hand knowledge, \nexcept for those allegations alleged upon information and belief, and as to those matters, I \nbelieve them to be true.”  (Rossabi Aff. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff in part relies on an allegation in the \nComplaint: “[u]pon information and belief, Scarfone then showed the written contingency fee \nagreement to Furr.”  (Compl. ¶ 52.)  This allegation made upon Rossabi’s belief is insufficient \nto create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Furr authorized the execution of the \nContingency Agreement.  See Aesthetic Facial & Ocular Plastic Surgery Ctr., P.A. v. Zaldivar, \n \n \nforecast any evidence that Plaintiff reasonably believed that Scarfone had the \nauthority to bind GGEG to the terms of the Contingency Agreement.  \n41. Therefore, even if the jury concluded that Scarfone represented to Rossabi \nthat he signed the Contingency Agreement, there is no evidence that Scarfone had \nauthority, actual or apparent, to properly bind GGEG.     \n42. In summary as to GGEG, the undisputed evidence shows that Furr did not \napprove the Contingency Agreement, and without such approval, Scarfone lacked \nauthority to bind GGEG to the Contingency Agreement.  Therefore, the Court  \nconcludes that  the Motion should be GRANTED and GGEG awarded partial \nsummary judgment as to the claim for breach of the Contingency Agreement.      \nVI. CONCLUSION \n43. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES \nin part the Motion.  The Court DENIES  the Motion to the extent N Club requests \nreversal of the Court’s denial of N Club’s Summary Judgment Motion  in the Order \nand Opinion .
