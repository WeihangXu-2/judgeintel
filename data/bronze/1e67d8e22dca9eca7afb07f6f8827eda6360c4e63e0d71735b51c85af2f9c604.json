Davis Trust’s (the “Ch arles Trust” or “Defendant”)  Motion for Summary \nJudgment1 (the “Charles Motion”) and Plaintiffs James H.  Q. Davis Trust (the “Jim \nTrust”) and William R. Q. Davis Trust’s (the “ Tad Trust,” collectively, “Plaintiffs”) \nMotion for Summary Judgment2 (the “Jim Motion”; together with the Charles Motion, \nthe “Motions”). \n2. After considering the Motions , the parties’ briefs in support of and in \nopposition to the Motion s, the relevant record, and the arguments of counsel at the \nhearing held on the Motions , the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion , DENIES \nDefendant’s Motion , and ENTERS  summary judgment for Plaintiffs on their \ndissolution claim.  \n \n1 (Charles B. Q. Davis Trust’s Mot. Summ. J  [hereinafter “Def.’s Mot. Summ. J”] , ECF No. \n47.) \n \n2 (Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 45.) \nJames H. Q. Davis Tr. v. JHD Props., LLC, 2023 NCBC 78A. \nEverett Gaskins Hancock LLP, by E.D. Gaskins, Katherine A. King, and \nJames Hash, for Plaintiffs James H. Q. Davis Trust and William R. Q. \nDavis Trust. \nMeynardie & Nanney, PLLC, by Joseph H. Nanney,  Jr, for Intervenor-\nDefendant Charles B. Q. Davis Trust.  \nNo counsel appeared for Defendants JHD Properties, LLC and Berry Hill \nProperties, LLC. \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background \n3. While the Court does not make findings of fact on a motion for summary \njudgment, “it is helpful to the parties and the courts for the trial judge to articulate a \nsummary of the material facts which he co nsiders are not at issue and which justify \nentry of judgment.”  Collier v. Collier, 204 N.C. App. 160, 161–62 (2010) (citation and \nquotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, the following background, drawn from the \nundisputed evidence submitted by the parties, is intended only to provide context for \nthe Court’s analysis and ruling and not to resolve issues of material fact. \n4. Many of the facts alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint have now been established \nby the undisputed evidence of record.  As the Court noted in its earlier Order denying \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss,\n3 this action arises from disagreements over estate \nplanning vehicles established by James H. Davis , M.D. (“Dr. Davis”).  In 2001 and \n \n3 (See James H. Q. Davis Tr. v. JHD Props., LLC, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 153, at *2 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Dec. 9, 2022); Order and Op. Def. Charles B. Q. Davis Trust’s Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 28.) \n \n2002, Dr. Davis set up two limited liability companies, JHD Properties, LLC (“JHD”) \nand Berry Hill Properties, LLC (“Berry Hill”; together with JHD, the “LLCs”).4  Dr. \nDavis also established four trusts, one for each of his sons, James H. Q. Davis (“Jim”), \nWilliam R. Q. Davis (“Tad”), Jonathon O. Q. Davis (“Jo n”), and Charles B. Q. Davis \n(“Charles”).5  Each son is the sole beneficiary of the trust bearing his name.6  The four \ntrusts are the only members of the LLCs, and each trust holds an equal, 25% equity \ninterest in both LLCs.7  Charles and Jim are the only managers of the LLCs; Tad and \nJon only have a membership interest with no management authority.8  \n5. The LLCs own four adjacent tracts of land in Wake County, North Carolina, \nwhich comprise approximately 68 acres (the “Property”).9  Except for one abandoned \nstructure, the Property is undeveloped.10  \n6. Under the LLCs ’ operating agreements  (the “Operating Agreements”) , \nwhich are substantially identical, neither company may take binding action without \n \n4 (Aff. Charles B. Q. Davis, dated July 17, 2023, at ¶ 5, [hereinafter “Charles Aff.”], ECF No. \n49; Aff. James H. Q. Davis, dated July 14, 2023, at ¶2, [hereinafter “Jim Aff.”], ECF No. 46.4.) \n \n5 (Jim Aff. ¶ 2; Charles Aff. ¶ 3.) \n \n6 (Charles Aff., ¶¶ 2–4.) \n \n7 (Charles Aff. ¶ 3.) \n \n8 (Jim Aff. ¶ 4; Charles Aff. ¶ 6.) \n \n9 (Charles Aff. ¶ 8; Jim Aff. ¶ 3.) \n \n10 (Charles Aff. ¶8; Jim Aff. ¶ 3.) \n \nthe consent of  “a [m]ajority of the [ m]anagers.”11  Because the LLCs have two \nmanagers, this provision in practice requires unanimous agreement between Charles \nand Jim to take binding action.12 \n7. The Operating Agreements provide that “[t]he purpose and business of [the \nLLCs] shall be to engage in the purcha se, development, rental, ownership, and sale \nof real property and in any other lawful business for which the limited liability \ncompanies may be organized under the Act.” 13  Charles and Jim have largely \ncooperated on matters necessary for the passive maintenance of the LLCs since their \nformation, including making tax payments , preparing Secretary of State filings, \nfinancing the LLCs, and selecting and managing the LLCs’ accountant.14 \n8. The LLCs have devoted part of the Property to timber in order to enjoy tax \nbenefits available to timber farms .15  The LLCs  have made only one timber sale, \nhowever—in 2004—which was before Dr. Davis’s death .16  Berry Hill was subject to \n \n11 (Compl. Ex. 1, Operating Agreement of JHD Properties, LLC , Art. 1.5, Ex. 2 , Operating \nAgreement of Berry Hill Properties, LLC , Art. 1.5 [hereinafter “Operating Agreements”] , \nECF No. 3.) \n \n12 “Except as otherwise may be expressly provided  . . . all decisions with respect to the \nmanagement of the business and affairs of the [LLCs] shall be made by action of a Majority \nof the Managers[.]”  (Operating Agreements, Art. 3.1.) \n \n13 (See Operating Agreements, Art. 1.5(a).) \n \n14 (Jim Aff. ¶4; Charles Aff. ¶ 16; Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Sum. J. Ex. 3, Dep. James H. Q. \nDavis, dated June 13, 2023, at 55:22–56:4 [hereinafter “Jim Dep.”], ECF No. 46.3.) \n \n15 (Charles Aff. ¶ 9; Jim Dep. 52:4–52:19; Jim Aff. ¶ 3.) \n \n16 (Jim Aff. ¶¶ 4, 5; Compl. ¶ 18; Answer Defendant-Intervenor Charles B. Q. Davis Trust ¶ \n18 [hereinafter “Answer”], ECF No. 29.) \n \na Forestry Management Plan , but that Plan expired in March 2022. 17  There is no \nevidence that JHD was ever subject to a Forestry Management Plan.  Although \nCharles and Jim both testified at their depositions that they would be willing to hire \na forestry manager and harvest timber on the P roperty, there is no evidence in the \nrecord to suggest that either manager  has attempted to reach agreement with the \nother to hire a forester, 18 and there is no other evidence that the LLCs intend to \nengage in timber harvesting or sale in the future.19   \n9. In 2016, a small portion of the Property was taken by eminent domain, \nresulting in the LLCs’ receipt of $129,866.67 in proceeds. 20  Other than the LLCs’ \nreceipt of these funds and the timber sale in 2004, the LLCs have produced no income \nsince their formation.21   \n10. Beginning in 2018 or 2019, Charles and Jim have disagreed about the use \nor disposition of the Property.22  Jim, supported by Tad and Jon, has favored a sale \nof the Property.23  Charles has opposed a sale.24   \n \n17 (Charles Aff. ¶ 11; Charles Aff. Ex. A, ECF No. 49.1; Jim Dep. 52:24–53:2.) \n \n18 (Charles Aff. ¶ 14; Jim Dep. 58:24–59:2.) \n \n19 (Charles Aff. ¶ 7; Jim Aff. ¶ 5.)   \n \n20 (Charles Aff. ¶ 13.) \n \n21 (Jim Aff. ¶ 5.) \n \n22 (Charles Aff. ¶ 25; Jim Aff. ¶ 4.) \n \n23 (Jim Aff. ¶ 4; Aff. William R. Q.  Davis, dated July 13, 2023, at ¶ 3, ECF No. 4 6.5; Aff. \nJonathan O. Q. Davis, dated July 13, 2023, at ¶ 3, ECF No. 46.6.) \n \n24 (Jim Aff. ¶ 5; Charles Aff. ¶ 19.) \n \n11. In April 2020, Charles sent Jim an e-mail suggesting that they create a plan \nfor the LLCs to develop the Property.25  Charles and Jim exchanged e -mails \ndiscussing proposals for the next two months, but they ultimately could not agree.26 \n12. Beginning in August 2020, Charles and Jim again exchanged numerous e-\nmails, this time concerning Jim’s interest in listing and selling the Property, and \nCharles’s interest in potentially buying the Property.27  These e-mails culminated in \nCharles presenting to Jim in April 2022 a non -binding term sheet by which Charles \noffered to negotiate with Jim for Charles’s purchase of the Property (“the Original \nTerm Sheet”).\n28  Jim responded by advising Charles  that the term sheet was \nunsatisfactory, and Charles and Jim were unable to reach an agreement to list or sell \nthe Property, either to Charles or to anyone else.29 \n13. In May 2022, Jim sought Charles’s permission to negotiate a contract with \na developer who had submitted a non-binding letter of intent to the LLCs to purchase \na majority of the P roperty (the “Letter of Intent”). 30  Charles responded to Jim’s \nrequest on 14 June 2022 with a revised term sheet (the “Revised Term Sheet”) but \nwithout authorizing Jim to negotiate with the developer.31  Charles did not act on the \n \n25 (Jim. Dep. Ex. 6, 8–9, ECF No. 50.5.) \n \n26 (Jim. Dep. Ex. 6, 1–10.) \n \n27 (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Def.’s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. R-2, ECF No. 52.2.)  \n \n28 (Charles Aff. ¶ 28; Jim Aff. ¶ 8.) \n \n29 (Charles Aff. ¶ 28; Jim Aff. ¶¶ 7, 8.) \n \n30 (Jim Aff. ¶ 8; Charles Aff. ¶ 29.) \n \n31 (Jim Aff. ¶ 9; Charles Aff. ¶¶ 29, 30.) \nLetter of Intent, and the Letter expired by its own terms on 30 June 2022.32  Jim did \nnot accept Charles’s Revised Term Sheet 33 and instead again asked Charles for \npermission to negotiate with the developer, which he did not receive.34  With Charles \nand Jim at loggerheads over the proper disposition or use of the Property for at least \nthe past three years, n o sale , development , or active use  of the Property has \noccurred,35 leading Plaintiffs to initiate this litigation.  \nB. Procedural History \n14. Plaintiffs filed this action against JHD and Berry Hill on 12 July 2022, \nseeking judicial dissolution of the LLCs under N.C.G.S. § 57D-6-02(2)(i).36  Plaintiffs \nallege that Charles  and Jim’s disagreement over  the disposition and use of the \nProperty has rendered it “impossible and impracticable” to conduct the business of \nthe LLCs, and that the LLCs should therefore be judicially dissolved.37   \n15. The Charles Trust  filed an unopposed Motion to I ntervene as a nominal \ndefendant in this action with the Wake County Clerk of Superior Court on 11 August \n2022,38 which it amended and re -filed on the Business Court docket on 18 August \n \n32 (Charles Aff. ¶ 29; Jim Aff. ¶ 8.) \n \n33 (Charles Aff. ¶¶ 29, 32; Jim Aff. ¶¶ 9, 10.) \n \n35 (Charles Aff. ¶¶ 33, 34; Jim Aff. ¶¶ 12, 13.) \n \n36 (Compl. ¶¶ 28–32, ECF No. 3.) \n \n37 (Compl. ¶¶ 28–32.) \n \n38 (Mot. Intervene, ECF No. 10.)  \n2022.39  The Court granted the Amended M otion to Intervene on 19 August 2022. 40  \nSince that time , Plaintiffs and the Charles Trust have been the active opposing \nparties in this litigation.  The LLCs have not retained counsel and thus have not \nappeared at any time.41  As noted, the Court denied Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss \non 9 December 2022. \n16. Plaintiffs and Defendant filed the current Motions on 17 July 2023. 42  The \nCourt held a hearing on the Motions on 7 September 2023 , at which Plaintiffs and \nDefendant were represented by counsel (the “Hearing”).  The Motion has been  fully \nbriefed and is now ripe for decision. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n17. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any part y is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.  R. Civ. P. 56(c).  An issue is genuine if it is \n \n39 (Am. Mot. Intervene, ECF No. 7.) \n \n40 (Order Granting Am. Mot. Intervene, ECF No. 11.) \n \n41 The Court and the parties agree that Charles and Jim, as the LLCs’ managers,  are the \nprimary disputants in this action.  ( See Am. Mot. Intervene  ¶¶ 5–8.)  Plaintiffs bring this \naction to remedy alleged deadlock in the affairs of the LLCs brought about by disagreement \nbetween Charles and Jim, which, among other things, has prevented the LLCs from agreeing \nto retain counsel to defend this litigation .  Without counsel, the LLCs cannot appear.  See \nLexisNexis, Div. of Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Travishan Corp., 155 N.C. App. 205, 209 (2002) \n(holding that, subject to limited exceptions not applicable here, “in North Carolina a [business \nentity] must be represented by a duly admitted and licensed attorney -at-law and cannot \nproceed pro se[.]”). \n \n42 (Pls.’ Mot. Summ. J.; Def.’s Mot. Summ. J.) \n“supported by substantial evidence,” and “an issue is material if the facts alleged \nwould constitute a legal defense, or would affect the result of the action, or if its \nresolution would prevent the party against whom it is resolved from prevailing in the \naction.”  DeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co., 355 N.C. 672, 681 (2002) (cleaned up). \n18. “The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579 (2002).  “Once the party seeking summary judgment \nmakes the required showing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a \nforecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing \nthat he can at least establish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. \nApp. 778, 784– 85 (20 00).  The responding party may not “rest upon the mere \nallegations or denials” in the pleadings, and its response “must set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e). \n19. When considering a motion for summary judgment, evidence must be \nviewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Pennington, 356 N.C. at \n579. \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n20. Plaintiffs’ sole claim in this action is that operatin g the LLCs is “not \npracticable” within the meaning of N.C.G.S. § 57D -6-02(2)(i) and that the LLCs \nshould therefore be judicially dissolved. 43  Plaintiffs and Defendant  both seek \nsummary judgment as to Plaintiffs’ claim.   \n21. Plaintiffs argue that the undisputed facts show that conducting the business \nof the LLCs is “not practicable” because Charles and Jim are deadlocked over the \ndisposition or use  of the P roperty, the Operating Agreements do not provide a \nmechanism to break the managers’ deadlock, and the value of the Property cannot be \nrealized unless the managers agree to develop or sell the Property .44  Plaintiffs \nfurther argue that Charles’s conduct has eroded the trust between the two managers \nsuch that judicial dissolution is the only way to overcome the deadlock.45   \n22. Defendant contends in opposition that no deadlock exists because Charles \nand Jim have agreed to maintain the LLCs’ existence by paying taxes and filing \ndocuments with the Secretary of State in furtherance of the LLCs’  timber and real \nestate holding businesses46 and because all four brothers agreed in a 6 May 2020 e -\nmail not to pursue a sale of the Property at that time.47  Defendant further contends \nthat deadlock does not exist because Charles and Jim have displayed an attitude of \n \n43 (See Compl.) \n \n44 (See Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 7, 8, ECF No. 46.)  \n \n45 (See Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 11; Jim Aff. ¶¶ 10–13.) \n \n46 (See Charles B. Q. Davis Trust’s  Br. Supp. Its Mot. Summ. J. 10  [hereinafter “Def.’s Br. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J.”], ECF No. 48.) \n \n47 (See Charles Aff. ¶ 27; Jim Dep. 70:07–70:11.) \n \ncooperation in their e- mail exchanges , but  in which they express  their persistent \ndisagreement concerning the disposition or use of the Property.48 \n23. Under the North Carolina  Limited Liability Company Act (the “Act”), \njudicial dissolution of a limited liability company is appropriate where “it is \nestablished that [ ] it is not practicable to conduct the LLC’s business in conformance \nwith the operating agreement  and [Chapter 57 D.]”  N.C.G.S. § 57D-6- 02(2).  The \nCourt considered the meaning of this statutory section at length in its ruling on the \nMotion to Dismiss and incorporates  that discussion here ,49 including the Court’s \nconclusion that “  ‘not practicable’ in section 57D -06-02(2)(i) . . . means ‘unfeasible’ \nand does not mean ‘impossible.’  ”  James H.  Q. Davis Tr. v . JHD Props., LLC , 2022 \nNCBC LEXIS 153, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 9, 2022).  The Court thus applies this \nunderstanding in determining whether the undisputed evidence compels a factfinder \nto conclude that “it is not practicable to conduct the LLC[s’] business in conformance \nwith the operating agreement and [Chapter 57D]” under section 57D-6-02(2)(i).  The \nCourt concludes that it does. \n24. As an initial matter, the Operating Agreements provide that the purpose of \nthe LLCs is “the purchase, development, rental, ownership, and sale of real property \nand in any other lawful business.”\n50  That the Operating Agreements include active \n \n48 (See Charles Aff. Ex. G, 1, ECF No. 49.7; Charles Aff. Ex. F, ECF No. 49.6; Charles Aff. Ex. \nC, 27–28, ECF No. 49.3; Jim Dep. 21:24–22:05; Charles Aff. ¶ 24 ; see also Def.’s Br. Supp. \nMot. Summ. J. 19.) \n \n49 See Davis Tr., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 153, at *7–14. \n \n50 (Operating Agreements, Art. 1.5(a).)  \n \nuses of land, like development, rental, and sale, shows that the Property was intended \nto be used or sold to maximize its value.  Indeed, it is evident from Charles’s and Jim’s \ndogged pursuit of their separate prefe rred uses or dispositions of the Property that \nthey recognize this expectation of active use. \n25. The Operating Agreements require Charles’s and Jim’s agreement for either \nof the LLCs to take binding action, and the undisputed evidence shows that Charles \nand Jim have not been able to reach agreement to permit the LLCs to engage in any \neconomic activity for at least the last three years.  The evidence Defendant relies on—\ne-mails exchanged proposing pathways forward wit h neither manager adopting the \nother’s plans—only strengthens the conclusion that Charles and Jim are deadlocked \nover whether to develop or sell the Property.  That the communications between the \nmanagers are cordial and cooperative in tone, while laudable, is not determinative.\n51  \nMore significantly, the communications show that the LLCs’ managers have failed to \nreach any concrete agreement for the disposition or use of the Property since at least \nearly 2020 with no reasonable prospect that they will reach agreement in the future.52 \n \n51 This Court noted in the Order and Opinion on Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss that in \nChisum v. Campagna, the Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed dissolution of a limited \nliability company, noting in particular that the trial court observed an extraordinary level of \nhostility and distrust between the company’s managers.  Davis Tr., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 153, \nat *10–11.  Such “acrimony and distrust” between managers supports a determination that \na limited liability company  should be dissolved, but  it is not a necessary  condition of \nmanagerial deadlock.   \n \n52 The managers’ deadlock is made all the more apparent by Charles’ s view that neither he \nnor Jim “has any obligation to consider or approve a sale of the [Property].”  (See Aff. Charles \nB. Q. Davis Supp. Mot. Dismiss ¶ 30, ECF No. 22 ; Jim Aff.  ¶11.)   The Court notes that \nCharles’s compliance with his fiduciary duties as a manager of the LLCs has not been placed \nat issue in this litigation. \n26. Similarly, the fact that over three years ago the four brothers agreed not to \nsell the Property does not refute the evidence of deadlock.  The question is not \nwhether the managers are capable of agreement but whether managerial deadlock is \npreventing the conduct of the LLCs’ businesses.  Here, the undisputed record shows \nthat Charles and Jim’s deadlock is doing precisely that.   \n27. In addition, Charles and Jim ’s agreement to maintain the LLCs’ existence \nand their willingness—but not agreement—to hire a forestry manager53 do not permit \na conclusion that the managers are not deadlocked and are successfully operating a \ntimber business or a real estate holding company , nor do they preclude a conclusion \nthat the manager s’ deadlock is preventing the LLC s from being operated in \naccordance with the Operating Agreements and Chapter 57D.  Indeed, as one federal \ncourt concluded long ago under a different statute but on facts similar to those here: \n[T]he defendant in error and its predecessor in interest owned and held \nthis tract of timber land as their only asset.  During that period they \nmade no use of the land, added nothing to it, took nothing from it, \nengaged in only such narrow activities as are incident to the ownership \nof property, and it would be going very far to say that such corporations \nare carrying on or doing business within the meaning of a revenue law. \n \nUnited States v. Hotchkiss Redwood Co., 25 F.2d 958, 959 (9th Cir. 1928) ; see also, \ne.g., Lane Timber Co. v . Hynson , 4 F.2d 666, 666  (5th Cir. 1925) (noting under \nRevenue Acts that “[o] wning land is not doing business, nor is paying taxes”);  \nPittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chi. & St. L ouis R.R. Co. v. United States, 74 F. Supp. 558, \n567 (Ct. Cl. 1947) (noting under Revenue Act that a party was not “doing \nbusiness . . . if its activities are limited to owning and holding property”).   \n \n53 (See Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 24; Jim Dep. 58:24–59:02.) \n28. In short, the core factual allegations of Plaintiffs’ Complaint are undisputed \nand show that the managers cannot agree on the use or disposition of the Property  \nand have not been able to reach agreement for at least three years , there is no \nmechanism in the Operating Agreements to break the deadlock, the LLCs have not \nconducted any economically useful activity since 2004, and there is no way for the \nLLCs to conduct any business, realize any profit, or dispose of any assets so lo ng as \nthe unbreakable deadlock persists.  The Court found that Plaintiffs’ allegations to \nthis effect were “sufficient to show that it is not practicable to conduct the LLCs ’ \nbusiness in conformance with the O perating Agreements and Chapter 57D”  in \ndenying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss,  Davis Tr., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 153, at *14, \nand the Court reaches this same conclusion based on the undisputed evidence, cited \nabove, that now establishes Plaintiffs’ allegations as true.   \n29. As it did in denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court draws support \nfor this conclusion, in the absence of helpful guidance from the North Carolina \nappellate courts, from courts in other states and jurisdictions applying the same, or \na nearly identical , “not practicable” standard used in this State .  Id.  at *14 –15 \n(collecting cases); see also, e.g., In re GR BURGR, LLC, 2017 Del. Ch. LEXIS 156, at \n*17 (Del. Ch. Aug. 25, 2017) (“ Where there are two 50% owners of a company, an \nunbreakable deadlock can form  a basis for dissolution even if the company is still \nengaged in marginal operations”); Vila v. BVWebTies LLC, 2010 Del. Ch. LEXIS 202, \nat *22, 54 (Del. Ch. July 6, 2010) (holding dissolution warranted where the managers \nwere deadlocked over “serious managerial issues” and the operating agreement \nprovided no method to break the deadlock); Kirksey v. Grohmann , 754 N.W.2d 825, \n831 (S.D. 2008) (holding dissolution appropriate where two coequal managers were \nin an “impenetrable deadlock”); Haley v. Talcott , 864 A.2d 86, 97 (Del. Ch.  Dec. 16, \n2004) (holding that dissolution was appropriate where there was “strident \ndisagreement” between the parties over the sole asset of an LLC).\n54 \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n30. WHEREFORE, for the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment , DENIES Defendant’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment , and ENTERS  summary judgment for Plaintiffs on their \ndissolution claim.  The Court will, by separate order, notice a conference with counsel \nto discuss the process for dissolution of JHD and Berry Hill, as well as the entry of a \ndecree of judicial dissolution under N.C.G.S. § 57D -6-05, and the process for the \nwinding up of JHD and Berry Hill under N.C.G.S. § 57D-6-07. \n SO ORDERED, this the 16th day of November, 2023. \n      \n     /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Chief Business Court Judge \n \n \n54 Defendant also argued at the Hearing that dis solution under Chapter 57D is not an \nappropriate remedy because the terms of the Operating Agreements set forth an exclusive \nlist of the ways the LLC s may be dissolved.  The Court disagrees  because Article 10.1(e) of \nboth Operating Agreements provides that the dissolution of the LLCs may occur upon “[t]he \nentry of a decree of judicial dissolution,” which is the relief Plaintiffs seek here.
