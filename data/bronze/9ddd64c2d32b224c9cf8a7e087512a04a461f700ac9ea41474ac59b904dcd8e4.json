Anglin for Plaintiff. \n \nWard and Smith, P.A. by John M. Martin and Michael J. Parrish for \nDefendant.  \n \nGale, Judge. \n \nI. I. I. I.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n \n {2} Plaintiff Brian Berger (“Berger”) was elected to serve a four-year term \non the Defendant New Hanover County Board of Commissioners (“Board”) to expire \nin December 2014.   \n{3} On April 22, 2013, the Board adopted a Petition in Amotion  to Remove \nBrian Berger from the New Hanover County Board of Commissioners (“Petition”) \ntogether with its several attachments, as well as a Notice of Hearing and set of \n Berger v. New Hanover Cnty. Bd. of Comm ’rs, 2013 NCBC 45.  \nAmotion Hearing Rules and Procedure (“Revised Hearing Rules”).  These were \nserved on Plaintiff on April 23, 2013 by the New Hanover County Sheriff.   \n{4} Berger filed his original Complaint and an Application for Temporary \nRestraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (“TRO application”), both dated May \n15, 2013.  Civil Summons was issued on May 16, 2013. \n{5} On May 16, 2013, Chief Justice Sarah Parker issued an Order  \ndesignating the matter as exceptional pursuant to Rule 2.1 of the General Rules of \nPractice for the Superior and District Courts and assigning the case to the \nundersigned. \n{6} The court held a telephone hearing on Plaintiff’s TRO application on \nFriday, May 17, 2013 and then entered an Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order on Monday, May 20, 2013, following earlier advices \nthe court provided counsel by e-mail on Saturday, May 18, 2013. \n{7} The Board held the noticed hearing on May 20, 2013 at which it \ndetermined by a majority 3–2 vote to remove Plaintiff from office.  The Board issued \nits written order on May 21, 2013 (“Order of Removal”).  During the hearing on \nPlaintiff’s motion for a TRO, the Board’s counsel indicated that the Board Chairman \nwould recommend that, in the event of removal, Plaintiff’s salary and benefits \nwould not be suspended at least for 30 days.  The Order of Removal includes such a \nprovision, with salary and benefits continuing to June 30, 2013. \n {8} Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint and his Motion for Stay Pending \nLawsuit (“Motion for Stay”), on June 14, 2013, seeking to remain in office pending \ncourt review of the Board’s action.  The court held a telephone conference on June \n17, 2013 and entered an Order on June 19, 2013, denying a stay, incorporating the \nBoard’s agreement that it would not fill any vacancy pending the court’s review, \nsetting the matter for hearing on July 16, 2013 on specifically identified legal \nissues, and providing a schedule for prehearing briefs.    \n {9} The court held the hearing on July 16, 2013.  The Parties agreed that \nthis court has authority to review the Board’s decision by certiorari , and the court \nproceeded to hear oral argument on legal issues raised by the Amended Complaint.  \nThe court further afforded the Parties the opportunity to file supplemental briefs to \naddress other due process issues first raised in Plaintiff’s July 14, 2013 \nMemorandum as well as their respective arguments on whether the record contains \nsufficient competent evidence to support the Board’s finding.  The court reserved its \nruling on all issues pending final briefs which were due on August 29, 2013. \n {10} On August 16, 2013, the Board filed a Motion for Protective Order \nnecessitated by Plaintiff’s effort to depose Commissioners Wolfe and Dawson to \nobtain additional testimony for the court’s consideration.  The court held a \ntelephone hearing at which it indicated it would grant a protective order because \nthe court’s review is limited to the record before the Board, and confirmed this oral \nruling by an Order entered on August 20, 2013. \n{11} Final briefs were timely filed on August 29, 2013.  Neither Party has \nrequested further oral argument.  The record has been submitted, the court has \nreviewed both written and video transcripts, and the issues have been fully briefed, \nargued, and submitted.  The matter is ripe for final ruling. \n \nII. II. II. II.    SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE BOARD SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE BOARD SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE BOARD SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE BOARD \n \n{12} The court here summarizes the proceeding before the Board only to the \nextent necessary to inform the court’s review of issues raised by the Amended \nComplaint as elaborated upon in the briefs.  Other details may have been omitted \nand are available for review in the written and video transcripts. \n{13} Berger was elected in November 2010 to serve a term on the Board to \nbegin in December 2010 and expire in December 2014.  The Board determined in or \naround April 2013 to initiate proceedings to determine whether Berger should be \nremoved from the Board.  The record is not entirely clear as to the extent to which \nthe Board further considered seeking local legislation to authorize a recall election. \n{14} The Board elected to use the common law procedure known as \n“amotion.”  On April 8, 2013, the Board directed the County Attorney to prepare the \nPetition to initiate the amotion proceedings.    \n{15} On April 22, 2013, the Board approved the Petition which included 28 \nexhibits and three affidavits attesting to the exhibits, as well as the Revised \nHearing Rules and a Notice of Hearing.  These materials were served on Plaintiff by \nthe Sheriff on April 23, 2013. \n{16} Omitting some specific details, the Petition alleges, in sum, that \nPlaintiff had violated the Board’s Code of Ethics, had created a hostile work \nenvironment, had created concerns for safety and security, had failed to adequately \ndischarge the duties of his office, in part because of his tardiness and failures to \nparticipate meaningfully in policy decisions, suffers from a deteriorated mental \nawareness, makes unsupported accusations, and has suffered a loss of confidence by \nthe Board and citizens.  The various exhibits related, among other things, to \nfourteen delineated acts of alleged criminal acts or domestic violence, and thirteen \nselected e-mails deemed to be in violation of the New Hanover County Information \nTechnology policy and which the Board contends reflects harassment of county staff. \n{17} The Revised Hearing Rules provide that Plaintiff would be allowed to \nhave counsel, that the Petition and its attachments would be considered for \nadmission into evidence, that Plaintiff would be allowed to present evidence and  \ntestimony, and to make closing statements.  Plaintiff did retain counsel who \nrepresented him at the Amotion Hearing.  Although the Revised Hearing Rules \nreserved the possibility of imposing time limits for evidence or argument, no such \nlimits were actually imposed.  Plaintiff filed a witness list before the hearing, \nincluding twenty-one potential witnesses, four of which were other Commissioners. \n{18} At  the hearing on May 20, 2013,  prior to beginning any evidentiary \npresentations, Board Chairman White stated that each of the five Commissioners, \nwere present, but that only Plaintiff would be allowed to testify, because the other \nCommissioners were to serve as “triers of fact.”  (Amotion Hr’g Tr. (hereinafter \n(“Tr.”) 11:9–15.)  Plaintiff’s counsel then made no request and took no further action \nto demand the right to examine any of the four Commissioners as to their potential \nbias in the nature of having made their determination before the presentation of \nevidence.   At no time during the hearing did Plaintiff ask that the Commissioners \nbe placed under oath or tender testimony that he believed they would provide had \nthey been called as witnesses. \n{19} Also prior to any evidentiary presentation, Commissioner Barfield \nstated his belief that the Board should have pursued legislation authorizing a recall \nelection rather than using the amotion procedure, as his concept of democracy was \nthat only voters should exercise power to remove an elected Board member.  He \nfurther expressed his concern that, “the decision has already been made.”  (Tr. 15:5–\n16:18.)   He did not further elaborate as to the specific factual basis for this concern.  \n{20} The Board then began the evidentiary presentations by accepting the \nAmotion Petition and each of the 28 exhibits and three affidavits over Plaintiff’s \nobjection that the North Carolina Rules of Evidence (“Rules of Evidence”) should be \napplied.  (Tr. 12:1–12, 17:2–18:2.)  The Board further accepted two additional \naffidavits which had not been included with the Petition.  Plaintiff made no specific \nobjection to these affidavits other than their admissibility under the Rules of \nEvidence.  (Tr. 9:2–10.)  In indicating that the Board would not apply the Rules of \nEvidence, Board Chairman White advised that Plaintiff would be allowed to \nchallenge the weight to be given any of the exhibits.  (Tr. 9:2–10, 12:2–4.)  He later \nadvised Plaintiff that he would also be allowed freely to introduce materials without \ncomplying with the Rules of Evidence.  (Tr. 40:21–41:12.)    \n{21} Board Chairman White stated the Board’s conclusion that the Petition \nand supporting materials satisfied the Board’s burden of proof and invited Plaintiff \nto present evidence.  (Tr. 19:4–8.)  After again challenging the Board’s acceptance of \nthe Petition and documents without a testifying witness, Plaintiff began his \nevidentiary presentation, which included two witnesses and a notebook of \ndocuments.  Plaintiff himself further made a statement after the evidence was \nclosed, but, as did other Commissioners made his statement during discussion of \nthe formal motion while not under oath.  \n{22} Plaintiff first called Sheila Schult, Clerk to the Board.  (Tr. 21:3–4.)   \nIn his initial examination, Plaintiff sought to challenge any conclusion that Plaintiff \nimproperly incurred travel expenses, including for example a failure to timely \ncheck-in on the first night of a multi-night hotel stay (Tr. 23:20–24:5), to rebut the \nassertion that the various allegations of criminal conduct should be considered \nbecause there was no evidence of an actual conviction (Tr. 25:5–10), and to \nchallenge the accuracy of the number of reported times that Plaintiff had been tardy \nfor Board meetings.  (Tr. 26:4–40:20.)  Plaintiff further established that the travel \npolicy referred to in the Petition had been actually adopted after Plaintiff incurred \nthe expense for the missed reservation. (Tr. 41:14–42:6.)   \n{23} Plaintiff’s counsel also examined Ms. Schult regarding the series of e-\nmails attached to the Petition.  She responded affirmatively when asked if she \nthought the e-mails evidenced harassment.  (Tr. 43:8–44:15.)  Plaintiff secured her \nagreement that Plaintiff had not threatened her physically.  (Tr. 43:22–48:20.)  As \nto the Petition’s allegation regarding Plaintiff’s improper access to county offices, \nMs. Schult acknowledged that there is no written policy that would prohibit a \nCommissioner from using his office 24 hours a day.  (Tr. 48:21–49:11.) \n{24} Board counsel’s examination concentrated on the limited errors in \nattendance records so that the records nevertheless demonstrate a large number of \ntimes Plaintiff was tardy even after adjusting for any errors that Plaintiff had \nnoted.  (Tr. 49:21–53:1.)   \n{25} Plaintiff next called Carolyn Bordeaux.  (Tr. 58:15–16.)  He first \nsolicited Ms. Bordeaux’s view that Plaintiff had not been convicted of any crime and \nthat DWI charges against him were pending.  (Tr. 59:22–60:8.)  He then began a \ncourse of examination to challenge “the impartiality of this … [B]oard.”  (Tr. 64:3–\n5.)  In substance, Plaintiff contended that bias was demonstrated because of a \nconversation Board Chairman White had after learning that Plaintiff intended to \nseek an order enjoining the May 20, 2013 hearing without first providing the Board \nnotice.  After learning from court officials that this request was being made, Board \nChairman White advised Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Cobb that the \nBoard wished to participate if any hearing on a request for injunction were to be \nheld.  (Tr. 65:21–70:13.)  Ms. Bordeaux had been directed by Plaintiff’s counsel to \nfile the original Complaint and application of a Temporary Restraining Order, \nalthough she is not employed by Plaintiff’s counsel. In doing so, Ms. Bordeaux met \nwith Judge Cobb.  (Tr. 60:18–68:4.)  At the hearing, during the course of Ms. \nBordeaux’s testimony, Plaintiff’s counsel admitted that he had requested an ex \nparte order and expressed his view that he was not obligated to attempt to provide \nnotice to the Board before seeking a restraining order.  (Tr. 64:6–66:7.)  Plaintiff’s \ncounsel directly inquired of Board Chairman White whether he made statements to \nJudge Cobb, in response to which Board Chairman White indicated that he had \nadvised Judge Cobb that the Amotion Hearing might be postponed if there were \nindications that Plaintiff was seeking assistance with regard to the Board’s \nconcerns as to his mental health status (Tr. 67:2–12.), but that he had not discussed \nthe merits of the Petition.  (Tr. 67:17–71:19.)  Plaintiff did not request to place \nBoard Chairman White under oath or to examine him further on his allegation of \nbias. \n{26} Judge Cobb, as well as the other Resident New Hanover County \nSuperior Court judges have recused themselves from participation in the case.  (Tr. \n71:11–19.)  They have had no further participation in the matter and the \nundersigned has had no communications with them about the matter. \n{27} In his continued examination of Ms. Bordeaux, Plaintiff solicited \ntestimony that she had never felt threatened by Berger, that she was not aware of \nhis having threatened anyone else, and that he suffers from autism.  Plaintiff did \nnot seek to qualify Ms. Bordeaux has having any training in regard to autism, nor \ndid her testimony indicate any basis upon which she based her conclusion.   \nPlaintiff’s counsel further solicited her opinion that the effects of autism include an \ninability to communicate and that communications by one suffering from autism \nmay be mistaken for threats.  (Tr. 72:15–74:10.)   \n{28} After Ms. Bordeaux’s testimony was completed, Plaintiff’s counsel \nindicated that Plaintiff would not testify and no further witnesses would be called.  \n(Tr. 76:10–77:3.)  Board Chairman White then indicated that Plaintiff would be \nallowed an opening and closing argument.  (Tr. 77:8–23.) \n{29} In his initial argument, Plaintiff’s counsel argued that the evidence \nregarding Berger’s criminal matters cannot serve the basis for a removal because \nthere has been no conviction, the criminal charges do not include felonies, and none \nof the charges relate to an “infamous crime” that might reflect an inability to serve \nas a Commissioner.  (Tr. 78:2–82:12.)  He then argued that there was no competent \nevidence by licensed professionals of any mental limitations that Plaintiff may have, \nand the Petition relied only on generalized allegations of mental incapacity.  (Tr. \n83:4–21.)  Plaintiff’s counsel asserted the insufficiency of the various categories of \nother evidence to prove a failure to complete job duties, to abide by established \npolicies, or to create a hostile environment.  (Tr. 83:22–92:16.)  He again noted his \nobjection that the exhibits to the Petition had been accepted without an adequate \nopportunity to respond.  (Tr. 93:9–16.)  Upon inquiry from Board Chairman White, \nPlaintiff’s counsel acknowledged that no limitation had been made on his ability to \nsubpoena witnesses or to introduce evidence other than limitations imposed on his \nright to examine fellow Commissioners.  (Tr. 94:9–23.)   \n{30} Board Chairman White offered to reopen the evidentiary record to \nallow Plaintiff to call additional witnesses.  Plaintiff’s counsel responded, “Well, \nunless I am given an opportunity to – to question any of the other Commissioners.  \nThat is where the – then I have no other witnesses that I would call at this time.”  \n(Tr. 94:20–23.)  This was the strongest statement Plaintiff ever made in opposition \nto the limitation on other Commissioners testifying.  However, Plaintiff again did \nnot seek to call any Commissioner and made no offer of what testimony he would \nsolicit if allowed to call them.  \n{31} Plaintiff’s counsel sought to tie the Board’s acceptance of the Petition \nwithout a supporting witness to bias.  He stated, “I question how this whole \nproceeding can be fair when Mr. Berger  -- when Mr. Ber - - when Mr. Berger even \nthough he has – we have been allowed to present evidence, there was no \nopportunity to cross examine the documents and there was also no opportunity for \nus to question any of the Commissioners who a  lot - - who a lot - - who have a lot of \nfactual evidence about  - - about this case and I guess at this point, any  - - any \nexamination of any of the Commissioners will just occur  - - will just possibly occur \non appeal.”  (Tr. 102:2–12.)  Plaintiff’s counsel closed his initial argument by \ncautioning the other Commissioners that they should restrict their consideration to \nthe evidence presented and not consider any personal experience beyond that \nevidence.  (Tr. 109:5–22.)   \n{32} The Board’s attorney was then allowed to present a closing argument.  \nIn significant part, her argument was limited to summarizing the evidence so as to \ndemonstrate its adequacy to prove Plaintiff’s unfitness for office and his lack of \ncapacity to perform as a functioning Board member.  She placed the greatest \nemphasis on evidence regarding a hostile work environment and other security and \nsafety concerns addressed in the Petition.  (Tr. 110:11–121:16.)   \n{33} Plaintiff’s counsel was then allowed a final argument, during which \nthere was some discussion of Board Chairman White’s personal observation of \nPlaintiff handing a letter to Governor McCrory and statements that Plaintiff had \nmade regarding this event on television and at a prior Board meeting.  (Tr. 126:23–\n127:10.)   \n{34} After arguments, the record was closed.  (Tr. 129:5–9.)  Commissioner \nWolfe made a formal motion to remove Plaintiff from the Board.  Vice-Chairman \nDawson seconded the motion.  The individual Commissioners then spoke as to their \npositions.   \n{35} Speaking first, Vice-Chairman Dawson relayed that she had personal \nexperiences with Plaintiff but that the Board nevertheless had come to the hearing \n“without any predetermined outcome hoping to learn new evidence.”  (Tr. 130:23–\n131:2.)  She explained the basis of her concern for and personal commitment to \nprovide for safety and security and the responsibility to assure a safe work \nenvironment.  (Tr. 131:17–136:12.)  She acknowledged Plaintiff’s counsel’s request \nthat she set aside personal issues.  (Tr. 136:20–22.)  She then recounted a personal \nexperience when Plaintiff falsely claimed that she would not work cooperatively \nwith him.  (Tr. 137:3–17.)  She expressed her wish that Plaintiff would resign and \nseek help for his personal problems.  (Tr. 138:19–23.)   \n{36} Plaintiff then spoke.  He disclaimed any basis for anyone other than \nhimself having any concern for safety.  He stated that he had been falsely accused \nand that the amotion process had been engineered with the intent to put a \npredetermined successor on the Board.  He suggested that he had been given only \ntwo or three days to prepare his defense.  During Plaintiff’s statement, Board \nChairman White asked for specific facts to support Plaintiff’s allegations.  (Tr. \n139:17–149:10.)   \n{37} Commissioner Barfield spoke next.  He again stated his view that the \namotion procedure is not a proper vehicle to remove an elected official, and \nindicated that this is his view even though he personally wished that Plaintiff was \nnot on the Board.  (Tr. 149:15–153:21.)  He stated,  “. . . I do not know what is in \nother people’s hearts.  I can only tell you what is in mine.  I do not have the ability \nto predict what is in someone’s heart but I can know from past conversations that in \nmy opinion, there was a foregone conclusion before we got here of what was going to \nhappen on this day.  Be that as it may, as I said before, I am not in agreement of \nthis process but I am in agreement that Mr. Berger needs to step down off of this \nboard and continue life in some other form, shape or fashion.”  (Tr. 153:12–21.)  \nAgain, Commissioner Barfield did not further provide specific details that would \ndocument that other Commissioners had made any final determination to remove \nPlaintiff before the hearing was held. \n{38} Commissioner Wolfe then spoke.  Among other comments, he \nexplained that he did not believe that the evidence regarding tardiness and non-\ncompliance with policies and procedures was alone adequate to justify removal.  (Tr. \n154:9–17.)  He expressed his greater concern that Plaintiff’s behavior represented a \nsafety threat.  He related his personal experience in seeing “senior staff ladies cry in \nfear.”  (Tr. 154:18–22.)  He further referenced that past efforts to remedy concerns \nby censuring Plaintiff had not succeeded.  (Tr. 155:20–156:7.)  \n{39} Board Chairman White spoke last.  He indicated that he had \napproached the hearing with an open mind and hope that Berger would respond to \nthe allegations with acknowledgment of problems and assurances that he was \nsecuring treatment for them.  But he concluded that there had been no effective \nrebuttal to the facts stated in the Petition and that the Board’s concerns had not \nbeen abated.  (Tr. 156:8–157:20.)  There was a brief exchange between Board \nChairman White and Plaintiff regarding the letter given to Governor McCrory.  (Tr. \n158:17–159:11.)  \n{40} Before the vote, Plaintiff’s counsel did not seek to examine any of the \nCommissioners as to personal observations shared in their statements. \n{41} Board Chairman White then called for a vote.  (Tr. 160:19–21.)  The \nBoard voted 3–2 in favor of removal.  Commissioners White, Dawson, and Wolfe \nvoted in favor.  Commissioners Barfield and Berger voted in opposition.  (Tr. \n160:19–161:10.)  Board Chairman White then directed New Hanover County staff to \nprepare Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  (Tr. 161:8–11.) \n{42} Board Chairman White signed the Order of Removal on May 21, 2013.   \nFindings 1 through 5 detail the procedural history.  Findings 6 through 10 are \nfindings adopting the factual allegations of the Petition with its supporting \ndocumentation.  Findings 11 through 14 state that Plaintiff was given a full and fair \nhearing.  Finding 15 records Commissioner Dawson’s personal observations.  \nFinding 16 records Commissioner Wolfe’s personal observations.  Finding 17 records \nCommissioner White’s statements as to his assessment of the evidence supported \nthe Petition and its supporting documentation.  Findings 18 and 19 reflect the \nBoard’s view that it has an obligation to respond to the evidence presented.  \nFindings 20 and 21 indicate the Board’s view that it has the power to act.  Based on \nthese findings, the Order of Removal then concludes that “there is sufficient \nevidence for the Board to determine that just cause exist [sic] to remove Brian \nBerger . . .” and then declared that Plaintiff was immediately removed but that no \naction would be taken to fill the vacancy for thirty days, and that Plaintiff’s salary \nand benefits would remain in effect until June 30, 2013. \n{43} Further specific allegations or evidence will be discussed as necessary \nin the following analysis.  \n \nIII.

STANDARD OF REVIEW AND THE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS PRE SENTED STANDARD OF REVIEW AND THE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS PRES ENTED STANDARD OF REVIEW AND THE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS PRES ENTED STANDARD OF REVIEW AND THE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS PRES ENTED \n  \n {44} Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint seeks judicial review of a quasi-judicial \nfinding by a governing body from which there is no specific right of appeal provided \nby law.  That finding is reviewable in the nature of \ncertiorari .  Russ v. Board of \nEducation , 232 N.C. 128, 130, 59 S.E.2d 589, 591 (1950).  Upon certiorari , the court \nsits as an appellate court rather than an original trial court charged with the duty \nof making its own findings of fact.  Weaverville Partners, LLC v. Town of \nWeaverville Zoning Bd. of Adjust. , 188 N.C. App. 55, 57, 654 S.E.2d 784, 787 (2008).   \nAs to matters of law, the court proceeds de novo , meaning that it is not required to \ngive deference to the governing body’s determination as to such issues.  Id.  at 58, \n654 S.Ed.2d at 787–88.  In contrast, as to matters of fact, the court’s inquiry is \nlimited to determining whether there was sufficient competent evidence to support \nthe finding, and if there was, the finding is conclusive, even if there was competent \nevidence to support a contrary finding.  In determining whether there is such \nevidence, the court examines the entire record below, and the process is referred to \nas a whole record test.  Id.  at 57–58, 654 S.E.2d at 787; see also  Batch v. Town of \nChapel Hill , 326 N.C. 1, 12, 387 S.E.2d 655, 662, cert. denied, 496 U.S. 931 (1990).   \n {45} In this case, the court is called upon to review both issues of law and \nfact.  Therefore it employs different standards of review.  Plaintiff’s factual and \nlegal arguments have evolved during the course of the proceeding.  In summary, the \nfollowing are the questions now properly before the court and the standard of \nreview the court must exercise: \n1.  Does the court have jurisdiction to review the Board’s action.  This is \nan issue law, to be determined de novo .  \n2.  May the common law amotion procedure be employed to remove an \nelected official if accompanied by adequate procedural safeguards and \nsupported by sufficient competent evidence?  This is an issue of law to \nbe determined de novo .  \n3.  Was Plaintiff entitled to due process and did he receive it?  This is an \nissue of law to be determined de novo . \n4.  Was there sufficient competent evidence to support the Board’s finding \nof just cause to remove Plaintiff from office?  This presents a mixed \nquestion of law and fact.  The court must first determine the standard \nby which the evidence is to be measured, and does so de novo .  It then \nutilizes the whole record test to determine if there was sufficient \ncompetent evidence to satisfy this legal standard.  \n5.  If the Board’s order to remove Plaintiff from office was valid, is \nPlaintiff nevertheless entitled to maintain his office until his successor \nis appointed and qualified?  This is an issue of law to be determined de \nnovo .   \n \nIV.  IV.  IV.  IV.  ANALYSIS ANALYSIS ANALYSIS ANALYSIS    \n    \nA. A. A. A.

The court has no \nauthority to grant this relief.  Alternatively, the Amended Complaint requests that \nthe court review the proceedings to determine “whether or not Plaintiff received a \nfair and impartial trial and if the actions he was alleged to have taken allow his \nremoval from office.”  (Am. Compl. Prayer for Relief, ¶ E.)   This is in the nature of \nreview by certiorari.  A Superior Court is authorized to review quasi-judicial \ndeterminations by governmental agencies by certiorari where no process of appeal is \notherwise provided.  Russ , 232 N.C. at 130, 59 S.E.2d at 591.  The North Carolina \nSupreme Court has recognized that, “when the motion is allowable only for cause[,] \nthe soundness of such cause is reviewable by the courts . . . .”  Burke v.

The court accepts the Amended Complaint as a \nproper petition for review of the Board’s finding by certiorari , the Parties have now \nfurnished the court with the record from below upon which the review is to be \nbased, the court has received briefs and heard oral argument, and the matter is \nproperly before the court for determination.   \n \nB.

North Carolina Supreme Court opinions compel this recognition, even though \nthe decisions were issued several years ago and the amotion procedure has been \nseldom used.  Plaintiff contends, however, that the procedure could not be used here \nfor two primary reasons.  First, he contends that the procedure has become \noutdated.  Second, he contends that the power of amotion has never been extended \nto a county government whose power is more constrained than a municipal \ncorporation.  The court is not persuaded by either of these assertions.  \n{48} The amotion procedure is derived from a corporation’s implied powers \nto achieve its purposes, and refers to the inherent power of a corporation to remove \na corporate officer for sufficient cause.  It originated in the English common law and \nwas a power exercised by municipal corporations at least as early as 1758.  Ellison \nv. Aldermen of Raleigh , 89 N.C. 125, 127 (1883), citing Lord Mansfield’s holding in  \nRex v. Richardson , 1 Burr. 539.  Ellison reviewed the removal of an elected town \nalderman.  In the course of its opinion, the North Carolina Supreme Court stated \nthat “there can be no serious doubt of the right of a corporate body to vacate the \nseat of a corporate officer for adequate causes arising subsequent to taking his seat \n….”  Id .     \n{49} Later in 1908, the North Carolina Supreme Court framed the issue as: \n“[t]he question presented is the right of the town commissioners to remove an \nofficial for cause and upon notice[,]” and then upheld the town’s exercise of that \nright.  Burke v. Jenkins , 148 N.C. 25, 27, 61 S.E. 608, 609 (1908).  There, the \ncommissioners had removed an elected city treasurer for his failure to abide by the \ncommissioners’ directions regarding the use of town funds.  Without citing Ellison , \nBurke upheld the city’s removal of the treasurer, and in doing so, discussed with \napproval Lord Mansfield’s holding in 1883 that the power to remove a corporate \nofficer “… is one of the common-law incidents of all corporations.”  Id .  The Burke \ncourt further held that the removal procedure cannot be implemented without \nnotice and an opportunity to be heard.  Id.  at 28, 61 S.E. at 609.  The court did not \nfurther elaborate on whether those requirements were because the officer was being \ndeprived of a property or liberty interest. \n {50} Burke was later cited in Stephens v. Dowell , 208 N.C. 555, 181 S.E. \n629 (1935).  In a somewhat different context, as late as 1950, the North Carolina \nSupreme Court utilized the term “amotion” to describe a procedure that it upheld.  \nRuss , 232 N.C. 128, 59 S.E.2d 589.  It is then clear that the North Carolina \nSupreme Court expressly recognized the amotion procedure to remove an elected \nofficial as a part of the English common law which was adopted and used in North \nCarolina, and that the North Carolina Supreme Court has not since indicated any \nintent to restrict the procedure. \n{51} Its adoption from common law is significant.  The North Carolina \nLegislature has expressed a policy that principles of the common law remain in full \nforce absent extraordinary circumstances.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 4-1 (2012) provides: \nAll such parts of the common law as were heretofore in force and use \nwithin this State, or so much of the common law as is not destructive \nof, or repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the freedom and \nindependence of this State and the form of government therein \nestablished, and which has not been otherwise provided for in whole or \nin part, not abrogated, repealed, or become obsolete, are hereby \ndeclared to be in full force within this State. \n  \n{52} Even the North Carolina Supreme Court has only limited ability to \nmodify the common law.  See  Wells v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. , 213 N.C. 178, 195 S.E. \n394 (1938).  Certainly, this trial court’s authority is even more constrained, and \nquite clearly, a trial court may not simply choose not to follow direct holdings of the \nNorth Carolina Supreme Court.   \n{53} Plaintiff suggests that the court can find an implied legislative policy \nrejecting a modern use of the amotion procedure because it has in other instances \nadopted local legislation providing for a recall election.  The court does not believe \nthat the potential of a recall election necessarily negates the common law amotion \nprocess.  It is clear the Legislature knows how expressly to impose limits on \nremoving an elected official and to increase judicial involvement in the process as it \ndid when providing procedures for removing elected sheriffs.  See N.C.G.S. § 128-\n16–20 (2011).    \n{54} Further, to restrict the county’s corporate power by implying a policy \nagainst amotion would require the court to ignore that the Legislature has directed \nthat a county board’s corporate powers should be construed broadly.  Section 153A-\n11 of the North Carolina General Statutes recognizes the county as a corporate body \nand N.C.G.S. § 153A-12 directs that the powers of the corporation shall be exercised \nby the Board.  N.C.G.S. § 153A-4 directs that: \nIt is the policy of the General Assembly that the counties of this State \nshould have adequate authority to exercise the powers, rights, duties, \nfunctions, privileges, and immunities conferred upon them by law.  To \nthis end, the provisions of this Chapter and of local acts shall be \nbroadly construed and grants of power shall be construed to include \nany powers that are reasonably expedient to the exercise of that power. \n \n{55} As to Plaintiff’s argument that a county’s power is not as great as that \nof a municipal corporation, the Legislature’s grant of authority to counties in \nN.C.G.S. Chapter 153A uses virtually identical language to the grant of authority to \nmunicipal corporations in Chapter 160A.  As to Plaintiff’s argument that the \namotion procedure has become archaic, the court notes that the Legislature \ncompletely recodified former Chapters 153 and 160 when enacting Chapters 153A \nand 160A.  It could have but did not retrench from the scope of its broad grant of \nauthority and direction that such authority be broadly construed.   \n{56} In sum, the court finds no basis to conclude that the amotion procedure \nrecognized at common law has become archaic or has been expressly or impliedly \nwithdrawn by either North Carolina’s appellate courts or the Legislature, and the \ncourt finds no basis for distinguishing between the authority that counties or \nmunicipal corporations have to utilize an amotion procedure.  There is then no basis \nin law to set aside the Board’s use of the amotion procedure so long as its use was \naccompanied by appropriate procedural safeguards and the Board’s findings and \nconclusions were supported by sufficient competent evidence.  Clearly, the court \nrecognizes that use of the amotion procedure has been and should be limited to \nextraordinary circumstances, for setting aside a decision of the electorate is not a \nlight manner.  For that reason, the courts remain vigilant to assure that the \namotion procedure is not misused for improper political or personal purposes.  But a \ntrial court does so, not by removing the power of amotion altogether, but by its \ncritical review of procedural safeguards employed and an appropriate examination \nof the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings.  The court now turns its \naddress to that review, leaving to the Legislature or higher courts any decision to \nabandon the amotion procedure itself.   \n \nC. C. C. C.

Although not particularly artfully or precisely stated, the claim is \nessentially that the process the Board followed was infirm because the Board was \nnot an impartial fact finder.  Referencing Commissioner Barfield’s expressed \nconcern that the outcome of the hearing had been decided in advance (Am. Compl. ¶ \n20), Plaintiff asserts that there is “an inference of a non-impartial arbiter.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 28.)  His prayer for relief asks the court to determine whether the hearing \nwas “fair and impartial.”  (Am. Compl. Prayer for Relief, ¶ E.)  Plaintiff’s \nsubsequent briefing raises a host of other procedural attacks, seeking largely to \nincorporate formal judicial procedures into the Board’s quasi-judicial \ndetermination. 1   \n{58} Before turning to the specific challenge, the court first notes the \nBoard’s contention that Plaintiff is not entitled any due process because he has no \nproperty right or liberty interest in his elected office.  (New Hanover County Board \nof Commissioners’ Supplemental Br. (hereinafter “Board Supp. Br.”) 6.)  But the \nBoard also acknowledges, as case law requires it must, that certain due process \nprocedures must accompany any quasi-judicial proceeding.  (Board Supp. Br. 10.)  \nThe North Carolina Supreme Court conditioned its recognition of the amotion \nprocedure to remove an elected official on at least notice and hearing.  Burke , 148 \nN.C. at 28, 61 S.E. at 609 .  In a later decision, the North Carolina Supreme Court \nheld that a “statutory proceeding for the amotion of a school committeeman is \njudicial or quasi -judicial in character,” and that requisite procedures must include \nnotice of the proceeding and charges presented, an opportunity to be heard and \nproduce evidence in defense, and a full and fair hearing in which findings were \nbased on evidence adequate to support the cause asserted as grounds for removal.  \nRuss , 232 N.C. at 129–30, 59 S.E.2d at 590–91.  As discussed more fully below, the \ncourt believes that once the right of a hearing attaches, there are other procedures \nthat must be followed to assure that this hearing is a fair one. \n \n1. 1. 1. 1.

First, the court addresses \nPlaintiff’s attack on the hearing procedures the Board implemented.  Second, the \ncourt addresses the challenge to the Board’s impartiality. \n{60} The court begins with Plaintiff’s claim that he was not given adequate \ntime to prepare for the hearing.  (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. (hereinafter “Pl.’s Supp. \n                                                 \n1  The court believes that the due process claim is limited to one of procedural due process.  Neither \nthe Amended Complaint nor implications drawn from its generalized allegations rise to the level \nnecessary to invoke a claim for the deprivation of substantive due process.  See Toomer v. Garrett , \n155 N.C. App. 462, 574 S.E.2d 76 (2002), rev. denied , 357 N.C. 66 (2003).    \nBr.”) 7–8.)  Plaintiff suggested he had only prepared for a few days, but it is clear he \nwas served with the Amotion Petition and its supporting documentation almost one \nmonth before the hearing.  (Tr. 144:9–14, 159:14–15.)  Plaintiff had adequate notice \nto file a witness list before the hearing and to prepare a notebook of exhibits he \nintroduced.  His argument that he was not given adequate time to prepare finds \nsimply finds no support in the record. \n{61} Next, the court addresses Plaintiff’s challenge stated in the original \nComplaint filed before the hearing that the Board threatened to shorten the time in \nwhich he might present his defense.  No such time limitations were imposed at the \nhearing.  (Tr. 77:20–22.)  Plaintiff was not foreclosed from presenting evidence \nbecause of time constraints.  (Tr. 77:20–22.)  There is then no due process argument \nto be made on that basis. \n{62} The court now addresses Plaintiff’s claim that the Board was required \nto follow the North Carolina Rules of Evidence (Tr. 10:11–20, 20:10–20) and because \nit did not he had no opportunity to “cross-examine the documents.”  (Tr. 20:15–20.)  \nA board conducting a quasi-judicial hearing is not required to implement and follow \nthe North Carolina Rules of Evidence.  See Cook v. Union Cnty. Zoning Bd. of \nAdjustment , 185 N.C. App. 582, 594, 649 S.E.2d 458, 468 (2007); In re Application \nof Raynor , 94 N.C. App. 173, 177, 379 S.E.2d 884, 887 (1989).  Plaintiff likewise was \nable to place materials in the record for consideration with the same latitude \nemployed by the Board.  (Tr. 12:1–4.)  As to the claim that Plaintiff was unable to \n“cross examine the documents,” one, of course, does not cross-examine documents.  \nThe argument is a variant on the attempt to impose the authenticating \nrequirements of the Rules of Evidence which the Board was not required to follow.  \nPlaintiff was given fair opportunity to attack the proper weight to be given to any \ndocument.  (Tr. 12:2–4.)  That satisfied the requirements for the quasi -judicial \nhearing. \n{63} The court turns to Plaintiff’s assertion that it was improper for the \nBoard to consider lay opinions as to Plaintiff’s mental condition or fitness for office.  \n(Pl.’s. Supp. Br. 26.)  Plaintiff acknowledges that North Carolina case law clearly \nestablishes that a witness may offer observations based on personal experience.  \n(Pl.’s Supp. Br. 26.)  Lay opinion as to a person’s mental or physical health can be \nconsidered.  Dunn v. Custer , 162 N.C. App. 259, 267, 591 S.E.2d 11, 16 (2004). 2   In \nfact, Plaintiff took advantage of this rule in presenting testimony from Ms. \nBordeaux.  To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the evidence simply was not \nadequate to support the Board’s finding, this is not a due process challenge. \n{64} Finally, the court finds no merit in Plaintiff’s assertion that the Board \nimproperly shifted its burden of proof to Plaintiff.  His argument fails to distinguish \nbetween the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion.  There is no argument \nthat the burden of proof was on the Board to demonstrate just cause for removal, \nand the court can review whether it had sufficient competent evidence to satisfy \nthis burden.  The due process inquiry is whether Plaintiff was given the opportunity \nto confront the Board’s evidence and to present evidence in his own behalf.  He \nclearly had this opportunity so long as the Board’s finding was based on the \nevidence presented.  The Board did not improperly shift its burden.  Likewise, if it \nconsidered Plaintiff’s voluntary choice not to testify in his own behalf, which is not \nclear, it would not have been improper.  See Jacobs v. Locklear , 65 N.C. App. 147, \n150, 308 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1983).  The court need to not further consider Plaintiff’s \nargument that the extent of that consideration cannot rise to the level of imposing \ncertain presumptions, as there is no evidence that the Board utilized or relied upon \nany such presumption. \n{65} In sum, the court concludes that the procedures the Board utilized \ncomported with due process so long as it proceeded the decision to remove was made \nby an impartial fact-finder based on evidence presented.  The court then turns to \nthis second part of its due process analysis. \n \n \n                                                 \n2  The Supreme Court of South Carolina considered lay opinion specifically in the context of one’s \nopinion as to a person’s rationality and found that lay opinion on the subject was proper.  See \nCrowley v. Spivey , 258 S.C. 397, 413, 329 S.E.2d 774, 784 (1985).   \n2. 2. 2. 2.  Plaintiff Plaintiff Plaintiff Plaintiff Did Did Did Did Not Prove Bias, But the Order of Removal Not Prove Bias, But the Order of Removal Not Prove Bias, But the Order of Removal Not Prove Bias, But the Order of Removal    Is Is Is Is Infected  Infected  Infected  Infected \nBy Including Findings of Fact By Including Findings of Fact By Including Findings of Fact By Including Findings of Fact Not Based on Evidence Presented Not Based on Evidence Presented Not Based on Evidence Presented Not Based on Evidence Presented    \n \n{66} Findings of fact numbers 15 and 16 \n3 in the Order of Removal are based \non statements by Commissioners Dawson and Wolfe made after the evidentiary \npresentation as to their personal observations and their personal interaction with \nunnamed county staff.  While it may not have been improper for these \nCommissioners to explain how their review of the evidence presented may have \nbeen informed by their personal experiences, due process considerations clearly \ncame into play when those personal experiences were themselves adopted as \nfindings of fact upon which the Board’s ultimate conclusion rested.  In examining \nwhether the conclusion resulted from a full and fair hearing before an impartial fact \nfinder, the court cannot simply disregard findings based on the experiences of the \nfact finders themselves and then determine whether other findings were sufficient.    \nThe single fact that the decision was not on its face limited to the evidence \npresented but extended to personal experiences of the fact finders requires that the \ncourt remand the matter for such further proceedings as the Board may choose to \nimplement.   \n{67} The court again returns to the Board’s assertion that Plaintiff has no \nproperty or liberty right in his elected office and was not therefore entitled to the \ndue process rights Plaintiff asserts.  (Board Supp. Br. 6–7.) 4  But, as noted above, \n                                                 \n3 The court separately closely considered finding of fact 17 which represents views Commissioner \nWhite’s expressed at the hearing.   But after that careful consideration, the court concludes that \nfinding 17 is not an improper finding outside the evidence, but may be considered a commentary on \nevidence actually presented.  \n4 The court agrees that the holding of an elected public office has not been recognized in North \nCarolina per se as a “property right.”  See Smith v. State , 289 N.C. 303, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976); Mial \nv. Ellington , 134 N.C. 131, 46 S.E. 961 (1903).  The Board cites several other federal and state cases \nwhich stand for this general proposition.  There are instances when it would be clear that no such \nright is being compromised, such as, for example, where one is not allowed to stand for election or \nnot allowed to take office after an election.  Likewise, a different circumstance may be at play when a \nsuperior authority eliminates an office altogether.  Due process may further be owed when removing \na person from office is accompanied by a loss of salary or benefits which may more classically satisfy \nthe definition of a “property right.”  The record is not entirely clear what rights may have flowed to \nPlaintiff, but the Order of Removal indicates that Plaintiff would lose benefits and salary as of the \neffective date of June 30, 2013.   \n \nthe North Carolina Supreme Court clearly conditioned the use of the amotion \nprocedure on notice and hearing.  Burke , 148 N.C. at 28, 61 S.E. at 609.  Implicitly, \nthe hearing must be a fair one.  Here, at the inception of the May 20, 2013 hearing, \nthe Board expressly stated its intent to provide Commissioner Berger a “full and \nfair hearing” (Tr. 18:16–20), and found in paragraph 14 of its Order for Removal \nthat it had done so.  The North Carolina Supreme Court has stated that, “[a]n \nunbiased, impartial decision-maker is essential to due process.”  Crump v. Board of \nEducation , 326 N.C. 603, 615, 392 S.E.2d 579, 585 (1990).  The court concludes that \nthe hearing required under Burke  must be a hearing before an unbiased, impartial \ndecision-maker which bases its determination on the evidence presented.  It need \nnot further analyze whether rights that Plaintiff has rise to the level of a property \nor liberty right. \n{68} Plaintiff relies heavily on Crump .  But, the court notes that Plaintiff \nvery clearly has not developed a factual record to support an assertion of bias as \nhad Crump .  In Crump , the North Carolina Supreme Court makes clear that such a \nrecord is essential, and  bias cannot rest solely on “inference,” so that Plaintiff’s \nreference to such an “inference” in the Amended Complaint cannot not support \nremanding the matter.  Crump , 326 N.C. at 616–17, 392 S.E.2d at 586.  Crump also \nmakes clear the Commissioners are not necessarily disqualified or biased solely \nbecause they have prior knowledge of significant facts.  Id.  Quite to the contrary, \nthey are entitled to a presumption that as fact finders they acted with honesty and \nintegrity even in the face of such prior knowledge.  Id .  Crump   also does not \nmandate that Plaintiff was necessarily entitled to call any Commissioner as a fact \nwitness beyond a limited inquiry necessary to assess bias.  \n{69} If the Board had not relied on fact findings based on the personal \nexperiences of the fact finders, the court would conclude on this record that Plaintiff \nhad failed to demonstrate a basis on which the Board’s finding would be set aside on \ndue process grounds.  The burden is on Plaintiff to demonstrate bias.  Plaintiff \nseeks to satisfy his burden by reference to two matters.  First, Plaintiff suggests \nbias was shown because the Board majority had already chosen Plaintiff’s successor \nthereby creating some personal interest.  (Tr. 143:21–23.)   There was no \nevidentiary basis to support the assertion, particularly where the Board Chairman \nexpressly denied the contention.  Even so, that fact would not support a conclusion \nof actual prejudice.  Second, Plaintiff refers to Commissioner Barfield’s concern that \nthe result of the hearing in favor of removal was inevitable.  (Tr. 15:7–8.)  Even if \none were to conclude that this expression, with no further supporting details, were \nadequate to support an “inference,” an inference is not sufficient.  It is true that \nfact-finder bias may be shown by proof of a “prejudgment of adjudicative facts.” \nCrump , 326 N.C. at 615, 392 S.E.2d at 585.  But proof of such bias requires much \nmore than innuendo or inference.  Rather, there is a “heavy burden” required to \nprove bias and the necessity to “overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity in \nthose serving as adjudicators.”  Braswell v. Haywood Reg’l Med. Ctr. , 352 F. Supp. \n2d 639, 646 (W.D.N.C. 2005) (quoting  Simpson v. Macon Cnty., 132 F. Supp. 2d 407, \n411 (W.D.N.C. 2001).   This record is significantly short of meeting such a heavy \nburden. \n{70} And, again, the Commissioners were not disqualified solely because \nthey had prior factual knowledge.   Cases establish that a decision maker is not \ndisqualified nor is the presumption of integrity overcome simply because she has \nprior knowledge related to the controversy.  Kea v. Dep’t. of Health & Human \nServs. , 153 N.C. App. 595, 605, 570 S.E.2d 919, 926 (2002).  In fact, in some \ninstances it may be inevitable that a decision maker will have prehearing \nknowledge of underlying facts.  See Evers v. Pender Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 104 N.C. \nApp. 1, 16, 407 S.E.2d 879, 887 (1991).  \n{71} In sum, Plaintiff has not proven bias.  Neither does the court conclude \nthat Plaintiff would be necessarily deprived of due process by being unable to call \nthe Commissioners as witnesses so long as the Board’s ultimate decision rested on \nonly other sufficient evidence presented.  The due process concern arose because on \nthe one hand the Commissioners were protected from testifying because they were \nfact finders but on the other hand they interjected their personal observations and \ninteractions into the fact findings upon which their action was based.    \n{72} The court has carefully considered the argument in the Board’s \nmemorandum that the Order of Removal can stand because there is sufficient \ncompetent evidence to support it even if findings 15 and 16 are disregarded.  Even if \nthe court accepts the sufficiency of other findings to support the ultimate \nconclusion, that conclusion would not cure the due process concern of a fact finder \nhaving interjected facts based only on personal experiences not presented in the \nform of evidence.  The court is guided by the holding in Crump which recognized \nthat a Board’s decision cannot be saved simply by disregarding the vote of a biased \nfact finder leaving an adequate majority of other fact finders.  Crump , 326 N.C. at \n618–20, 392 S.E.2d at 587–88.  The same logic applies to preclude dismissing due \nprocess concerns simply by disregarding certain fact findings based on the \nobservations or experiences of the fact finders.   \n{73} Again, the court has not found that there was bias.  It rather has held \nthat the ultimate conclusions were infected by the insertion of personal experiences \nof the fact finder that were not presented in the form of evidence and subject to the \nhearing procedures attendant to the presentation of other evidence.  The court \nconcludes that the ultimate decision should be by an impartial fact finder and \nshould be based only on the evidence presented at the hearing. \n{74} The court cautions that it also has not held that any removal from \noffice would be foreclosed even if bias could be proven in any further proceeding.  \nThe court is aware of no authority by which the Board could delegate its decision \nmaking by appointing a special committee as might a private corporation.  As such, \nother than a recall election, it is the only body having authority to consider removal.    \nThere are cases where courts have upheld even biased quasi -judicial decisions when \nthey were made by the only governmental body that had the power to make the \nfinding.  They did so employing a doctrine referred to as the “rule of necessity.”  See \nArnold Rochvarg, Is the Rule of Necessity Really Necessary in State Administrative \nLaw: The Central Panel Solution , 19 J. NAALJ 35 (1999) (discussing the application \nof the rule of necessity in state administrative agencies).  The court expresses no \nopinion on whether this rule of necessity would apply where there is the possibility \nof a resort to a legislatively authorized recall election.   \n    \nD. D. D. D.  The The The The Sufficiency Sufficiency Sufficiency Sufficiency and Competency of  and Competency of  and Competency of  and Competency of Evidence  Evidence  Evidence  Evidence to Find to Find to Find to Find Just Cause Just Cause Just Cause Just Cause for Removal  for Removal  for Removal  for Removal    \nMust Relate to the Duties of the Elected Office Must Relate to the Duties of the Elected Office Must Relate to the Duties of the Elected Office Must Relate to the Duties of the Elected Office    \n    \n{75} Having determined that it must remand the matter for the reasons \nstated, the court does not have before it the final record from which to determine an \nultimate finding as to sufficiency of competent evidence to support removing \nPlaintiff from his elected office.  The court believes it nevertheless appropriate to \nprovide observations from its studied review of the present record, the extensive \nbriefing and the cases and other legal authorities which have been cited.  A court \nreviewing a finding removing an elected official from office after having been given \nfull due process will utilize the deferential whole record test to judge the sufficiency \nof evidence, but before doing so, will be cognizant of the legal standard against \nwhich that evidence is to be measured.  That standard is not well-defined, in \nsignificant part because the amotion procedure has been so seldom used, \nparticularly in North Carolina.  But, it seems clear that a court called upon to make \nthat final review will necessarily be faced with achieving the balance between the \nextraordinary concept of overturning the results of an election and a set of facts \nwhich can also be extraordinary in its presentation of how an elected official has \nacted or failed to act so as to hamper the functioning of the office to which he or she \nwas elected or create safety, security, or liability concerns arising from his or her \naction or inaction in office. \n{76} Here, the Board utilized a standard of “just cause” or “reasonable just \ncause.”  That standard is consistent with the language of the North Carolina \nSupreme Court decisions.  In Burke , the court quoted with approval from a treatise \nthat referred to removal from office “for reasonable and just cause.”  Burke , 148 \nN.C. at 25, 61 S.E. at 609 (quoting  1 John. F. Dillon, The Law of Municipal \nCorporations  § 240 (4th ed.)).    \n{77} But the North Carolina case law provides no further concrete guidance \non what may be required to find “just cause.”  After substantial study, the court \nagrees with the Board’s position that ultimately the evidence must be measured on \na case by case basis on something less than a single comprehensively defined \nobjective standard.  That said, the notion of “cause” should not flex solely on the \nwhims of political winds.  But, the standard must be flexible enough that the \ngovernmental body has a reservoir of power to respond to that extreme set of facts \nthat challenges the integrity of the governmental process.  Ultimately, a court may \nbe unable to draw precise dividing lines that define when amotion may or may not \nbe appropriate.  The court concludes, however, that in all cases, a finding of cause to \nremove an elected official from office will depend upon conduct that is sufficiently \ntied to the duties of the elected office from which an elected official is being \nremoved.   \n{78} Each of the Parties have referenced Professor Lawrence’s article which \ndiscusses a series of hypotheticals designed to illuminate degrees of evidence which, \nbased on historical uses, might be adequate to support removal from office.  David \nM. Lawrence, Removing Local Elected Officials from Office in North Carolina , 16 \nWake Forest L. Rev. 547, 555–60 (1980).  Professor Lawrence suggests that grounds \nwhich support amotion may be grouped as disqualifying legal causes, such as \nfailure to meet a residency requirement, misconduct in office, and neglect of duty.  \nId. at 554.  He seeks to distinguish between “misconduct in office” and other \nevidence, which although is unsavory, does not impact official duties to a sufficient \nmanner to warrant removal.  As to the use of criminal offenses to prove misconduct \nin office, Dr. Lawrence observes a modern trend is to limit consideration to \nconvictions of felonies and offenses that involve a violation of official duties.  Id. at \n556.   \n{79} The court benefited from the article’s scholarship and thorough \nresearch.  But the evidence from case to case will seldom easily compress into \nconvenient categories one may use to fashion hypotheticals.  To the contrary, \nevidence will almost inevitably overlap categories.   A court will properly examine \nthe cumulative evidence rather than parsing individual acts into separate pockets.  \nSome evidence taken from personal life outside of office viewed in isolation may not \nappear appropriate to lead to removal, yet that same evidence may provide context \nfor matters that are manifested by acts in office.  No doubt, the evidentiary balance \nbecomes even more fragile if findings must be based on criminal charges \nunaccompanied by convictions.    \n{80} The court’s considered analysis also suggests that the tie between the \nevidentiary record and the duties of office upon which the fact finder perceives \nshould be more express than implied.  That is, that the burden of showing sufficient \ncompetent evidence in most instances would impose on the fact finder an obligation \nto make clear how it has measured the underlying evidence as against the duties \nand abilities expected of the office.  Again, the court recognizes that the standard is \nnecessarily imprecise.  While the court is not suggesting that this connection can \nalways be objective, it should be as far removed from subjective as reasonably \npossible.  References to perception as to loss of voter confidence are necessarily more \nsubjective than events or expressions which actually document such erosion of \nconfidence.  And, again, the court, as apparently did the courts at common law, \nrecognizes that some occurrences are so “infamous” that no further support is \nrequired. \n{81}     The court also carefully considered the Board’s references to Plaintiff’s \nfailure to abide by the Board’s Code of Ethics, and the Parties’ briefs address \nwhether a violation of such a code is competent evidence supporting removal.  The \ncourt reviewed the mandate of N.C.G.S. § 160A-86 which requires that the Board \nadopt such a code, and concludes that the phrasing of that statute amplifies that \nthere should be a tie between the conduct complained of to support removal and the \nduties of the office from which the official is to be removed.  The statute speaks in \nterms of the need to:  “obey all applicable laws regarding official actions…;” “uphold \nintegrity and independence of the board member’s office;” “avoid impropriety in the \nexercise of the board member’s official duties;” and “faithfully perform the duties of \nthe office.”  N.C.G.S. § 160A-86 (b) (1)–(4).   \n {82}  The court comments on Plaintiff’s argument that a court should not \nconsider a line of cases cited by the Board because they arise in the context of \nterminating employment of a public official as opposed from removing an elected \nofficial from office.  While there may be distinctions, the employment cases are not \naltogether irrelevant.  They recognize that a governmental body should not be \nparalyzed when faced with circumstances that create hostilities that thwart \ngovernment functions or threaten those whose efforts are critical to performing \nthose functions.  An elected official is not necessarily immune from the \ngovernment’s power to respond simply because he was elected.  Courts have clearly \nrecognized that a governmental body may take appropriate action when problems \narise regarding an elected official’s conduct tied to the duties of office.  E.g., Walker \nv. United States Postal Serv ., 4 F. App’x. 896 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Giessow v. Litz , 558 \nS.W.2d 742 (Mo. Ct. App. 1977).     \n{83} In addition to removal, a governmental body may in appropriate \ninstances be within its powers to implement extraordinary restrictions on an elected \nofficial’s access to government facilities, processes, computers, and e-mail systems.  \nE.g., Handy v. Lane Cnty., No. 6:12-cv-01548-AA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44177 (D. \nOr. Mar. 26, 2013).  A North Carolina federal district court has recognized actions \nnecessary to ameliorate adverse conduct may outweigh the elected official’s right to \nfree speech or expression of opinions.  See  Iglesias v. Wolford , 667 F. Supp. 2d 573 \n(E.D.N.C. 2009), aff’d , 400 F. App’x. 793 (4th Cir. 2010).  Here, the evidence \nincludes elements that admittedly may be more in the nature of inefficiencies and \ninconveniences, such as tardiness, but the Board also expressed great concern of \nactual or potential hostile work environment and genuine concerns for security and \nor personal safety.  Plaintiff attacked the evidence to the extent it could be \ncharacterized as subjective fears of future events.  The Board instead believed the \nevidence proved existing concerns.  A court is always in a more secure position when \nit is able to divine between the two based on concrete evidence, and sometimes \ntestimony may be more effective in distinguishing between the two than competing \narguments as to what conclusions should be drawn from documents.      \n{84} In summary, the matter must return to the Board for such further \nproceedings as it may elect to implement.  For that reason, the court has made no \nfinal determination as to the sufficiency of competent evidence to support the \nBoard’s conclusion that just cause exists to remove Plaintiff from office.  Should the \nmatter return to this or another court upon a finding of just cause to remove \nPlaintiff from office resulting from further proceedings, a primary focus of the \nevidentiary review will be the sufficiency of competent evidence tied to the duties of \nthe office from which the elected official is to be removed.   \n \nE. E. E. E.  A Finding o A Finding o A Finding o A Finding of Removal, Otherwise Proper, Would Not Be Precluded By f Removal, Otherwise Proper, Would Not Be Precluded By f Removal, Otherwise Proper, Would Not Be Precluded By f Removal, Otherwise Proper, Would Not Be Precluded By \nApplication of Application of Application of Application of Article VI, Section 10 of the Article VI, Section 10 of the Article VI, Section 10 of the Article VI, Section 10 of the North Carolina Constitution North Carolina Constitution North Carolina Constitution North Carolina Constitution    \n    \n{85} The Second Claim of the Amended Complaint asserts that even if the \nBoard otherwise has power to remove Commissioner Berger, his removal cannot be \neffective until his successor is chosen and qualified.  He bases his claim on Article \nVI, Section 10 of the North Carolina Constitution which provides:    \nIn the absence of any contrary provision, all officers in this State, \nwhether appointed or elected, shall hold their positions until other \nappointments are made, or, if the office is elective, until their \nsuccessors are chosen and qualified. \n \n{87} While again this issue may not now be ripe with the court now \nremanding the matter, the court observes that there is a paucity of cases \ninterpreting this provision.  The court construes the article as intending to allow for \ngovernment business to be able to proceed between an election and the seating of \nthe newly elected person, rather than to provide protection for the elected official \nwhose term has expired.  As such, it should not and would not preclude the removal \nof an elected official in term, provided there was just cause for doing so determined \nupon proper procedure, and his removal need not await the appointment of the \nsuccessor.  The court refused to issue an injunction against implementing the \nremoval on the basis of this Article because it concluded that Plaintiff was unable to \nshow the probability of success on that claim.  The court believes its decision to \ndecline that requested injunction on that ground was a correct one. \n \nIV.  IV.  IV.  IV.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW CONCLUSIONS OF LAW CONCLUSIONS OF LAW CONCLUSIONS OF LAW    \n \n    Based on the record reviewed, for the reasons stated, the court concludes as \nfollows: \n1.  The Parties are properly before the court and venue is proper; \n2.  The Amended Complaint was an appropriate request for a writ of \ncertiorari to review the determination of the Board; \n3.  The court has the power and jurisdiction to review the Board’s action \npursuant to N.C.G.S. § 1-269, the record below has been furnished, and \nthe matter is properly before the court; \n4.  An amotion procedure remains a lawful procedure that may be utilized \nfor the purpose of removing an elected official so long as such \nprocedure includes notice and hearing and is based upon sufficient \ncompetent evidence demonstrating reasonable and just cause for \nremoval; \n5.  Competent evidence demonstrating reasonable and just cause for \nremoval should relate to the duties of the elected office from which the \nelected official is to be removed; \n6.  Any hearing must be before an impartial finder of fact based on \nevidence presented; \n7.  Plaintiff has not presented a record demonstrating bias; \n8.  However,  the court cannot conclude that the Board’s Order of Removal \nwas made by an impartial fact finder based on evidence presented \nbecause that Order includes findings of fact based solely on the \npersonal experiences of the fact finders, including interactions with \nunnamed staff; \n9.  The Board’s Order of Removal must then be set aside without \nprejudice to the Board’s ability to convene a further hearing and to \ntake appropriate interim steps as necessary to provide for the conduct \nof the government’s business or for safety and security; \n10.  Plaintiff  is then restored to his elected office pending further proper \naction taken to remove him; and \n11.  In the event further proper action is taken to remove him, such \nremoval need not be delayed solely to await the appointment and \nqualification of his successor. \n \nIT SO ORDERED, this 5th day of September, 2013.
