Hunt for Nominal \nDefendant Saratoga Homeowners Association.  \n \nDavis, Judge.  \nINTRODUCTION \n1. The admonition to “Love thy Neighbor” has been in existence since time \nimmemorial.  The parties to this case, however, have instead embraced the entirely \nseparate maxim of “Sue thy Neighbor ,” engaging in a seemingly nonstop barrage of \nlawsuits against one another.  In the present action, six residents of a Cabarrus \nCounty neighborhood known as Saratoga have sued the members of their \nhomeowners’ association’s board of directors (the “Board”), alleging a nefarious course \nof conduct rife with conflicts of interest, ineptitude, and retaliation.  In response, \nDefendants have asserted counterclaims in which they accuse Plaintiffs of engaging \nin a concerted scheme to drive them out of the neighborhood.     \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n2. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and instead recites those \nfacts contained in the Complaint and documents attached to the Complaint that are \nrelevant to the Court’s determination of the Motions.  See, e.g.,  Concrete Serv. Corp. \nv. Inv’rs Grp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681 (1986); Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC \nv. Window World, Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 12, 2017).  \nAccordingly, the following facts are drawn from Plaintiffs’ Complaint and the relevant \ngoverning documents of the Association referred to in the Complaint. \nA. The Parties \n3. The residential neighborhood “Saratoga” is located in Cabarrus County, \nNorth Carolina.  (ECF No. 8.1, at p. 1.)  The Association —named in this action as a \nnominal defendant —is the homeowners’ association that encompasses all lots in \nSaratoga.  ( Id.)  The Association is a North Carolina nonprofit corporation with its \nprincipal office in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  (ECF No. 8.2, at p. 1.)   \n4. Plaintiffs John Bloxsom, Rebecca Bloxsom, Heath Drye, Caroline Drye, \nTintu Parameswar , and Do nna Parameswar (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) all live in \nSaratoga and are all members of the Association.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 1, 44.)   \n5. Defendants Neal Choquette (“Neal”), Wendy Choquette (“Wendy”), and \nGary Choquette (“Gary”) (collectively, the “Choquettes”) are residents of Mecklenburg \nCounty, North Carolina and all currently serve on the Association’s Board.  (Id. at ¶¶ \n2, 8.)   \n6. In addition to serving on the Board, Neal and Wendy own and operate \nfour other businesses  also named as defendants to this action:  American Land;  \nAtlantic Grading Co. Inc. f/k/a No Sniveling Grading Co. Inc. (“AGC”); Cedar Property \nManagement, LLC n/k/a Austerlitz Property Management, LLC (“CPM”); and Payne \nRock Investments, LLC (“PRI”) (collectively, the “Choquette Businesses”).\n1  (Id. at ¶ \n3.)  Gary and Wendy are employed by each of the Choquette Businesses.  (Id. at ¶ 5.) \nB. Prior Actions Between the Parties \n7. It is something of an understatement to say that this lawsuit is not the \nfirst legal dispute between the parties.  First, on February 20, 2018, the Parameswars \nfiled a complaint against Neal  in Superior Court , Mecklenburg County, alleging \nvarious incidents of malfeasance and misconduct  by him with respect to the \nParameswars and their property.  See Parameswar v. Choquette, Case No. 2018-CVS-\n3724 ( hereinafter, “Parameswar I ,” ECF No. 13).  Parameswar I  was ultimately \nresolved by  the Parameswars and Neal entering into a Settlement and Release \nAgreement on December 20, 2018, which incorporates by reference a subsequent \n \n1 The Choquette Businesses exist under the laws of North Carolina with their principal places \nof business in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina . However, the Choquettes utilize a \ncombination of the Choquette Businesses to transact business in Cabarrus County.  ( ECF \nNo. 3, at ¶ 4, 6.)   \nConsent Order signed by the Honorable Lisa Bell on January 17, 2019.  (“Settlement \nAgreement and Consent Order,” ECF No. 14.)   \n8. Second, on April 18, 2019, all of the named Plaintiffs in this case—along \nwith two additional Saratoga residents, Ronald and Sharon Kerr—filed a complaint \nsolely against the Association in Superior Court, Cabarrus County, alleging \nmalfeasance and misconduct b y the Association.  See Kerr v. Saratoga Homeowners \nAssoc., Case No. 2019 -CVS-1247 (hereinafter, “Parameswar II,” ECF No. 6, Ex. A).  \nIn Parameswar II, the only relief sought was the appointment of a receiver  for the \nAssociation.  Parameswar II was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on July 29, \n2021.  (See ECF No. 53.)   \n9. Third, on August 20, 2019, Neal and American Land filed a defamation \naction against all of the named Plaintiffs in  the above-captioned action—as well as \nagainst the Kerrs —in Superior Court, Cabarrus County.  See Amer. Land Corp. v. \nKerr, Case No. 2019-CVS-2923 (hereinafter, “Defamation Action,” ECF No. 27.1).  A \nvoluntary dismissal was taken as to all  defendants on December 4, 2020.  (ECF No. \n27.2.)   \nC. The Present Action  \n10. On November 6, 2020, Plaintiffs —this time, the Bloxsoms, Dryes, and \nParameswars—filed this lawsuit (the “Present Action”), purporting to assert claims \nboth individually and derivatively on behalf of the Association against the Choquettes \nand the Choquette Businesses .2  (ECF No. 3.)  Th e Complaint contains claims for \n \n2 The Court notes that although the introductory paragraph of the Complaint states that \nclaims are being asserted both individually and derivatively on behalf of the Association (ECF \nbreach of fiduciary duty and slander of title as well as a request that the Court enter \na declaratory judgment that  certain transactions conducted by Defendants are void \non conflict of interest grounds.  ( Id.)  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs also seek an \naccounting of the Association’s financial affairs  and request that the Court “ pierce \nthe corporate veil” as to the Choquette Businesses.3   \n11. The Present Action is predicated on (1) alleged violations by the Board \nmembers of various provisions of the Articles of Incorporation of the Association \n(“Articles,” ECF No. 10.2); the Bylaws of the Association (“Bylaws,” ECF No. 8.3); the \nDeclaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions for Saratoga Phase I and \nSaratoga Phase II (“Declaration,” ECF No. 8.1); the North Carolina Planned \nCommunity Act, N.C.G.S. § 47F -1-101, et seq.; and the North Carolina Nonprofit \nCorporation Act, N.C.G.S. § 55A -1-01, et seq.; and (2) allegations of certain “conflict \nof interest transactions” by Defendants and “ arbitrary, malicious, and c apricious \nenforcement of the Declarations and Bylaws.”  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 10–37.)   \n12. Although the Complaint sets out a long list of specific examples of \nDefendants’ failures as members of the Board to meet duties imposed upon them by \nthe Articles, Bylaws, the Declaration, and North Carolina law, Plaintiffs generally \nallege that (1) the Board has failed to adhere to corporate requirements (e.g., failure \nto keep adequate records, failure to provide adequate notice of meetings, failure to \n \nNo. 3, at p. 1), the Complaint fails to differentiate between those claims being brought \nindividually and those being asserted derivatively.   \n3 Plaintiffs also requested in their prayer for relief that the Court “appoint a receiver for the \nAssociation to operate the Association and to investigate the Choquettes’ breach of fiduciary \nduties.”  (Id. at p. 13.)  However, on April 16, 2021, Plaintiffs withdrew their request for the \nappointment of a receiver.  (ECF No. 51.)   \nkeep meeting minutes , and failure to o btain liability insurance ); and (2) the \nChoquettes use the Association as a means to harass Plaintiffs and to profit \nthemselves and the Choquette Businesses  at the expense of lot owners such as \nPlaintiffs (e.g., by levying assessments for their own benefit, accessing owners’ lots \nwithout permission , and engaging in “noxious, offensive, and/or illegal trades or \nactivities on the lots of the lot owners in Saratoga”).  (Id. at ¶¶ 13–37.)   \n13. On December 20, 2020, this matter was designated a mandatory \ncomplex business case and assigned to the Honorable Gregory P. McGuire.  (Design. \nOrd., ECF No. 1; Assign. Ord., ECF No. 2.)   \nD. The Pending Motions \n14. On January 8, 2021, the Association filed a motion to dismiss this action \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) in which it asserts that the present lawsuit has been abated \nbased on the prior pending action doctrine.  (ECF No. 6.)   \n15. On January 25, 2021, the Choquettes  and American Land also filed a  \nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) based , in part, upon the prior pending \naction doctrine .  The Choquettes’ Motion also makes the following additional \narguments: (1) Plaintiffs have failed to state valid claims for relief against Gary and \nWendy individually; and (2) due to the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order \nentered in Parameswar I, the doctrine of res judicata serves as a bar to some or all of \nPlaintiffs’ claims.  (ECF No. 12.)   \n16. On January 25, 2021, the Choquettes and American Land filed a n \nAnswer and Counterclaims (ECF No. 15.) , which asserted counterclaims for slander \nper se (Count I); abuse of process (Count II); intentional interference with business \nrelations (Count III); civil conspiracy (Count IV); and breach of contract (Count V). 4  \n(Id.)  These counterclaims are primarily based on the contentions of the Choquettes \nand American Land that Plaintiffs have (1) made defamatory statements about them; \nand (2) engaged in a concerted scheme to force them out of the Saratoga community \nand end their control over the Association.  (ECF No. 15, at pp. 9–12.)   \n17. On February 24, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss Counts II, III, \nand V of the counterclaims of the Choquettes and American Land.  (ECF No. 39.)   \n18. This matter came before Judge McGuire for a hearing on April 20, 2021.  \nOn July 1, 2021, this matter was reassigned to the undersigned.  (Reassign. Ord., \nECF No. 52.)  The Court notified the parties that the undersigned would be ruling \nupon the Motions presently before the Court, and the parties elected to provide the \nCourt with a transcript of the April 20 hearing in lieu of requesting rehearing.  Since \nthat date, the undersigned has thoroughly reviewed the hearing transcript, the \npleadings, the briefs of the parties, and all other applicable matters of record.  This \nmatter is now ripe for decision.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n19. A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency \nof the complaint.”  Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Investors Group, Inc. , 79 N.C. App. 678, \n681 (1986).  The Court’s inquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the \ncomplaint, treated as true are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be \n \n4 The counterclaim for breach of contract was asserted only against the Parameswars. \ngranted under some legal theory, whether properly labeled or not.”  Harris v. NCNB \nNat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. 669, 670 (1987).  In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, the court construes the complaint liberally and accepts all well -pleaded \nfactual allegations as true.  Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, 577 (2009); Krawiec \nv. Manly, 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018).   The Court, however, is not required “to accept \nas true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.” Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Hum an \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274 (2005) (citation omitted). \n20. Furthermore, the Court “can reject allegations that are contradicted by \nthe documents attached, specifically referred to, or incorporated by reference in the \ncomplaint.” Moch v. A.M. Pappas & Assocs., LLC , 251 N.C. App. 198, 206 (2016) \n(citation omitted).  The Court may consider any such attached or incorporated \ndocuments without converting the Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary \njudgment.  Id.  Moreover, the Court “may properly consider documents which are the \nsubject of a plaintiff’s complaint and to which the complaint specifically refers even \nthough they are presented by the defendant.”  Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin , 147 \nN.C. App. 52, 60 (2001) (citation omitted); see also Window World, 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n60, at *11.   \n21.  “It is well-established that dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper \nwhen ‘(1) the complaint on its face reveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; \n(2) the com plaint on its face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good \nclaim; or (3) the complaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.’ ”  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (quoting Wood \nv. Guilford Cty., 355 N.C. 161, 166 (2002)).   \nANALYSIS \nA. The Association’s Motion to Dismiss \n22. The sole argument for dismissal asserted by t he Association  in its  \nMotion is based on the  prior pending action  doctrine.  Specifically, the Association \nargues that the pendency of P arameswar II—largely involving the same parties —\nserves to abate the present action.  (ECF No. 6, at p. 1.)   \n23. Our Supreme Court has held that “ where a prior action is pending \nbetween the same parties for the same subject matter in a court within the state \nhaving like jurisdiction, the prior action serves to abate the subsequent action.”  \nEways v. Governor’s Island, 326 N.C. 552, 558 (1990).  “This is so because the court \ncan dispose of the entire con troversy in the prior action and in consequence the \nsubsequent action is wholly unnecessary.  By abating the second action, a multiplicity \nof actions is prevented.”  Clark v. Craven Regional Med. Auth., 326 N.C. 15, 20 (1990).  \nThe test for determining the  applicability of the doctrine is as follows: “Do the two \nactions present a substantial identity as to parties, subject matter, issues involved, \nand relief demanded?”  Cameron v. Cameron, 235 N.C. 82, 85 (1952). \n24. At the time the Association’s Motion was filed, Parameswar II remained \npending.  In Parameswar II, all of the named Plaintiffs in this case —along with the \nKerrs—brought an action alleging malfeasance and misconduct by the Association, \nseeking the appointment of a receiver for the Association.  (ECF No. 6, at Ex. A.)  The \nAssociation argues that Parameswar II abates the present action because it involves \nsubstantially the same plaintiffs and  because the relief sought against the \nAssociation—appointment of a receiver —is also one of the requested forms of relief \nset out in Plaintiffs’ complaint in the Present Action.  (ECF No. 6, at p. 3.)   \n25. However, on July 29, 2021, Plaintiffs (and the Kerrs) took a voluntary \ndismissal without prejudice of Parameswar II.  (ECF No. 53).5  Accordingly, because \nParameswar II is no longer pending, no basis currently exists for application of the \nprior pending action doctrine . The Association’s Motion  to Dismiss is therefore \nDENIED as MOOT.   \nB. Motion to Dismiss of the Choquettes and American Land \n26. In their Motion, the Choquettes and American Land advance three \narguments in support of the dismissal of this action as to them : (1) Plaintiffs have \nfailed to sufficiently allege valid claims for relief  against Gary and Wendy \nindividually; ( 2) the prior pending action doctrine mandates a finding that the \nPresent Action has a bated; and ( 3) as a result of the Settlement Agreement and \nConsent Order entered in Parameswar I, Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the doctrine \nof res judicata.  (ECF No. 12, at pp. 3–7.)   \n27. The argument advanced by t he Choquettes and American Land based \non the prior pending action doctrine is identical to the argument of the Association  \non that issue.  For the reasons set forth above, that ground for dismissal is now moot. \n \n5 Prior to that date, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their request for appointment of a \nreceiver in the Present Action.  (ECF No. 51.) \nTherefore, the Court must analyze only their two remaining arguments in support of \ndismissal. \ni. Individual Liability of Gary and Wendy \n28. The Choquettes contend that the Complaint lacks allegations of specific \nmisconduct by Gary or Wendy individual ly.  In response, Plaintiffs argue that the \nComplaint makes “numerous allegations . . . against Wendy and Gary with regards \nto their misconduct as members of the Board [.]”  (ECF No. 27, at p. 6; citing to ECF \nNo. 3, at ¶¶ 3–8 and 13–16.)  More specifically, Plaintiffs argue that they have \nalleged that these Defendants made themselves members \nof the board “such that they purport to act with absolute \ncontrol and discretion over the Saratoga neighborhood.”  \nThus, these allegations on the face of the Complaint \nunequivocally demonstrate that Wendy and Gary [ ] were \nin a position of power and control over the Association as \nthey engaged in self -dealing, breached their duties to the \nAssociation and Plaintiffs, failed to procure proper \ninsurance, and harassed Plaintiffs.  Gary and Wendy[’s] [ ] \narguments that, taking the allegations of the Complaint as \ntrue, they do not have notice of the claims made against \nthem are disingenuous and meritless here.  \n \n(Id. at p. 6.)   \n \n29. Under the law of this State, “a director, officer, or agent of a corporation \nis not, merely by virtue of his office, liable for the torts of the corporation or of other \ndirectors, officers, or agents.”  Green v. Freeman , 222 N.C. App. 652, 674 (2012) \n(quoting Oberlin, 147 N.C. App. at 57); see also Yates Constr. Co. v. Bostic, 2014 NCBC \nLEXIS 19, at *6–9 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 12, 2014).  Nevertheless, “[a] director or other \ncorporate agent can . . . be held directly liable to an injured third party for a tort \npersonally committed by the d irector or one in which he participated” where the \ndirector or corporate agent was actively involved  in the tortious conduct; mere \nawareness or knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing is not enough.  See Oberlin, 147 \nN.C. App. at 57; Red Fox Future, LLC v. Holbrooks, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 8, at *36 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Mar. 24, 2014) (granting summary judgment in favor of LLC member and \nfinding that the member’s “passive awareness of [other members’] actions hardly \nconstitutes active participation”).  Consequently, determination of the liability of a \ncorporation for tortious conduct does not automatically also result in a determination \nof individual liability of its officers or shareholders.  See Red Fox, 2014 NCBC LEXIS \n8, at *36–39. \n30. In Oberlin, our Court of Appeals considered, inter alia, whether the trial \ncourt had properly dismissed individual claims against three of four board members \nwhere allegations were made against them collectively and solely in their capacit ies \nas directors.  147 N.C. App. at 57.  T he Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s \ndismissal, reasoning that  the plaintiff “failed to allege sufficiently any wrongful \naction” on the part of three of the board members.   Id.  The Court of Appeals stated \nthat the plaintiff “simply allege[d] in a conclusory manner” that the board members \n“were kept fully apprised and informed” of the wrongdoing and that they participated \nin concealing it, but failed to allege their active participation.  Id.  Thus, the Court of \nAppeals upheld the dismissal of the claims against the director defendants because \nthe complaint “[did] not clarify how and to what extent [those] defendants actively \nand personally participated in the alleged wrongdoing.”  Id.    \n31. Here, although the Court acknowledges that the  Complaint rarely \ndifferentiates between the Choquette Defendants, Plaintiffs’ allegations, taken in the \nlight most favorable to them, allege that: (1) all three Choquettes—who make up the \nentire Board of the Association—committed various wrongful acts as members of the \nBoard that constituted a clear conflict of interest intended to benefit themselves or \nprivate businesses that they either owned or in which they otherwise had a financial \ninterest at the expense of the best interests of the Association (see, e.g., ECF No. 3, at \n¶ 17); and (2) all three Choquettes engaged in retaliatory actions against the Plaintiffs \n(Id. at ¶¶ 29–37).  Therefore, unlike in Oberlin, where the Court of Appeals stressed \nthe fact that the defend ant board members only had passive knowledge of the \nwrongdoing and participated in its concealment, the Complaint here alleges that the \nChoquettes—Neal, Gary, and Wendy—all actively participated in the various alleged \nwrongdoings.  While the level of detail in support of these allegations is minimal, the \nCourt finds them adequate to put the Choquettes on notice of the claims against them \nand sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.  Accordingly, the Choquettes’ motion to \ndismiss all claims against Gary and Wendy is DENIED.   \nii. Res Judicata  \n32. The Choquettes contend that in the Settlement Agreement and Consent \nOrder entered in Parameswar I , the Parameswars “forever released Neal [ ] and \nAmerican Land from any and all claims that existed or could exist.”  (ECF No. 12, at \np. 5.)  The Choquettes and American Land argue that  the doctrine of res judicata \ntherefore applies such that  “Plaintiffs’ claims as to these Defendants, specifically \nNeal [ ] and American Land, should be dismissed.”   (Id. at p. 6.)6   \n33. In response, Plaintiffs argue  that: ( 1) because Neal and the \nParameswars were the only parties to the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order, \nthe res judicata argument could not possibly apply as to the Dryes and the Bloxsoms; \n(2) the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order only released  Neal and the \nParameswars for liability for past acts, whereas the Complaint in the Present Action \nalleges acts occurring after the Settl ement Agreement and Consent Order were \nentered; and (3) the Parameswars’ obligation to release their claims against Neal no \nlonger existed based on N eal’s prior repudiation of the Settlement Agreement and \nConsent Order.  (ECF No. 27, at pp. 11–14.)   \n34. Our Supreme Court has held that “ [u]nder the doctrine of res judicata  \nor ‘claim preclusion,’ a final judgment on the merits in one action precludes a second \nsuit based on the same cause of action between the same parties or their privies.”  \nWhitacre P’ship v. BioSignia, Inc., 358 N.C. 1, 15 (2004).  “For res judicata to apply, \na party must show that the previous suit resulted in a final judgment on the merits, \nthat the same cause of action is involved, and that both the party asserting res \njudicata and the party against whom res judicata is asserted were either parties or \nstand in privity with parties.”  Williams v. Peabody, 217 N.C. App. 1, 5 (2011) (quoting \nState ex rel. Tucker v. Frinzi, 344 N.C. 411, 413–14 (1996)). \n \n6 Although none of the Plaintiffs in the Present Action  other than the Parameswars were \nparties in Parameswar I, the Choquettes nevertheless appear to be contending that their res \njudicata argument applies equally to all Plaintiffs. \n35. Initially, the Court notes that even assuming the Settlement Agreement \nand Consent Order could potentially have res judicata effect, only the claims asserted \nby the Parameswars in the present action would be implicated given that none of the \nother Plaintiffs here were parties in Parameswar I .  Moreover, the language in the \nSettlement Agreement and Consent Order only relieves the Parameswars and Neal \n“from any and all liability of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, \npremised on or arising out of any acts or omissions . . . which actions or omi ssions \noccurred on or before [December 20, 2018].”  (ECF No. 14, at p. 2 (emphasis added).)  \nBased on the Court’s reading of the Complaint  in the Present Action —which is \nadmittedly not a model of specificity —it cannot be said at this early stage of the \nlitigation that all of the alleged acts of Neal forming the basis for Plaintiffs’ claims \noccurred before December 20, 2018.   \n36. In addition, the parties disagree as to whether the obligations of the \nParameswars were terminated due to Neal’s alleged repudiation of the Settlement \nAgreement.  The Court is unable to resolve this issue at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage given \nthat it involves  a disputed question of fact.  Therefore, the Choquettes’ motion to \ndismiss this action as to Neal and American Land based on the doctrine of res judicata \nis DENIED.   \nC. Plaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims \n37. Plaintiffs seek dismissal of  the counterclaims asserted by the \nChoquettes and American Land ( hereinafter, “Counterclaimants”) for abuse of \nprocess (Count II), intentional interference with business relations (Count III), and \nbreach of contract (Count V).  \ni. Abuse of Process       \n38. “[T]he gravamen of a cause of action for abuse of process is the improper \nuse of t he process after it has been issued.”  Petrou v. Hale, 43 N.C. App. 655, 659 \n(1979).  In order to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), an abuse of \nprocess claim must allege the following two elements: \n(1) that the defendant had an ulterio r motive to achieve a \ncollateral purpose not within the normal scope of the \nprocess used, and  \n(2) that the defendant committed some act that is a \nmalicious misuse or misapplication of that process after \nissuance to accomplish some purpose not warranted or  \ncommanded by the writ. \n \nPinewood Homes, Inc. v. Harris, 184 N.C. App. 597, 602 (2007) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).   Accordingly, “[a] buse of process requires both an \nulterior motive and an act in the use of the legal process not proper in the regular \nprosecution of the proceeding , and that both requirements relate to the defendant’s  \npurpose to achieve through the use of the process some end  foreign to those it was \ndesigned to effect.”  Chidnese v. Chidnese, 210 N.C. App. 299, 310 (2011). \n39. Counterclaimants essentially allege that Plaintiffs, with an “ulterior \npurpose or motive,” committed the following  acts: filed various lawsuits against \nDefendants; filed reports with federal and state agencies  complaining about \nDefendants; interfered with real estate owned by the Choquettes and/or American \nLand; and issued subpoenas to companies owned or operated by the Choquettes \nand/or American Land.  (ECF No. 15, at ¶ 8.)  Counterclaimants  assert that these \nacts were “not proper” and constituted an “abuse of the legal process.”  (Id. at ¶ 9.)   \n40. Plaintiffs contend that the abuse of process counterclaim  is defective \nbecause it does not  adequately allege the second element of the tort .  Specifically, \nPlaintiffs argue that Counterclaimants have “failed to allege what non -judicial act \ntook place after the subpoenas were sent or lawsuits were filed to accomplish the \nulterior motives alleged.”  In resp onse, Counterclaimants contend that “by \npurposefully filing multiple legal proceedings as a vehicle to attempt to gain an \nadvantage on these Defendants” —primarily in an effort to force them  out of the \nSaratoga neighborhood—“the Plaintiffs have committed a willful act that will support \nan abuse of process claim.”   \n41. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that although the  abuse of process \ncounterclaim does allege an ulterior motive for Plaintiffs’ initiation of various prior \nlegal proceedings, there are no allegations in the counterclaim that Plaintiffs \ncommitted a subsequent act inconsistent with the process they had issued.  It is well \nestablished tha t “the mere filing of a civil action with an ulterior motive is not \nsufficient to sustain a claim for abuse of process. ”  Chidnese, 210 N.C. App. at  312 \n(2011).   \n42. Accordingly, the Court concludes that  Counterclaimants have failed to \nstate a valid claim for  abuse of process.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the  \nabuse of process counterclaim is GRANTED.   \n  \nii. Intentional Interference with Business Relations \n43. Plaintiffs likewise seek dismissal of the counterclaim denominated as a \nclaim for intentional interference with business relations.   This Court has held that  \n“[a] claim for tortious interference with ‘ business relations’  embraces claims for \ninterference with both existing contracts and prospective future contracts.”  E-Ntech \nIndep. Testing Services v. Air Masters, Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 2, at *30 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Jan. 5, 2017).  In their briefs, the Choquettes and American Land make clear that \ntheir counterclaim is one for tortious interference with prospective economic \nadvantage.  \n44. “An action for tortious interference with prospective economic \nadvantage is based on conduct by the defendant[ ] which prevents the plaintiff[ ] from \nentering into a contract with a third party.”  Walker v. Sloan, 137 N.C. App. 387, 392–\n93 (2000) (citing Owens v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., 330 N.C. 666, 680 (1992)).  In order \nto state a claim for tortious interference with prospective ec onomic advantage, “the \nplaintiff[ ] must allege facts to show that the defendant[ ] acted without justification \nin inducing a third party to refrain from entering into a contract with them which \ncontract would have ensued but for the interference.”  Radcliffe v. Avenel Homeowners \nAss’n, 248 N.C. App. 541, 567 (2016).   \n45. Counterclaimants allege that “Plaintiffs have committed intentional \nacts in a joint effort to prevent [Counterclaimants] from selling their remaining \nlots/properties in the Saratoga community .”  (ECF No. 15, at ¶¶ 11– 12.)  However, \nthere is no allegation that Plaintiffs actually induced a third party not to enter into a \ncontract with the Counterclaimants.  “The inducement required to establish a claim \nfor intentional interference with prospective economic advantage requires purposeful \nconduct intended to influence a third party not to enter into a contract with the \nclaimant.”  Simply the Best Movers, LLC v. Marrins’ Moving Sys. , Ltd., 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 28, at **6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 6, 2016) (quoting KRG New Hill Place, LLC v. \nSprings Investors, LLC, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 20, at **14– 15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, \n2015)).   \n46. Here, there is no allegation that Plaintiffs took any purposeful action \nthat was intended to specifically influence third parties (i.e., potential buyers of lots \nin Saratoga) not to purchase lots from Counterclaimants.  Instead, Counterclaimants \nhave alleged only that the numerous disputes and legal actions between the parties \nto this lawsuit  have caused third parties to shy away from buying property in \nSaratoga.  Counterclaimants have made no allegations of purposeful conduct by \nPlaintiffs intentionally directed at actual potential buyers.   \n47. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion seeking  dismissal of Counterclaimants’ \nintentional in terference with business relations  counterclaim is GRANTED.  See \nRegency Ctrs. Acquisition, LLC v. Crescent Acquisitions, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 7, \nat *23– 24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 24, 2018) (dismissing tortious interference claim \nwhere plaintiff did not allege defendant made any representations directly to third \nparty intended to influence the third party not to enter into a commercial lease with \nplaintiff); KRG, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 20, at **16– 17 (dismissing tortious interference \ncounterclaim where defendants did not allege that plaintiffs took any purposeful \naction intended to influence a third party not to enter into a commercial development \nagreement with defendants). \niii. Breach of Contract  \n48. Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the counterclaim for breach of contract \nshould be dismissed. In this counterclaim, Counterclaimants allege that the \nParameswars breached the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order entered in \nParameswar I by causing both a housing discrimination complaint and the Present \nAction to be filed.  (ECF No. 15, at ¶ 21.)   Plaintiffs contend that this claim is invalid \nbecause Neal previously repudiated the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order  \nby filing the Defamation Action , thereby terminating any obligations the \nParameswars had thereunder.  In response, Counterclaimants argue that the filing \nof the Defamation Action did not constitute a repudiation because none of the claims \nin that action arose before the Settlement Agreement and Consent Order w ere \nentered.   \n49. The Court previously addressed this repudiation argument with regard \nto the portion of t he Choquettes’ Motion seeking dismissal of the claims in the \nComplaint against Neal and American Land under the doctrine of res judicata.  As  \ndiscussed above, the Court is unable to resolve the parties’ differing contentions on \nthis issue at the  Rule 12(b)(6) stage.  Ac cordingly, Plaintiffs’ motion to  dismiss the  \nbreach of contract counterclaim is DENIED.   \n  \nCONCLUSION \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED  that the parties’ pending Motions are \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as follows:  \n1. The Association’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED as MOOT.   \n2. The Choquettes’ and Ameri can Land’s Motion  to Dismiss  is \nDENIED.  \n3. Plaintiffs’ Motion to  Dismiss Counterclaimants’ abuse of process \ncounterclaim is GRANTED. \n4. Plaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss Counterclaimants’  intentional \ninterference with business relations counterclaim is GRANTED. \n5. Plaintiffs’ Motion to Dismiss Counterclaimants’ breach of contract \ncounterclaim is DENIED. \n \n SO ORDERED, this the 15th of September, 2021.  \n \n       /s/ Mark A. Davis    \n       Mark A. Davis     \n       Special Superior Court Judge for  \n       Complex Business Cases  "
