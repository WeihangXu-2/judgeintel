Factual Background \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(1) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”); rather, \nthe Court recites only those facts that are relevant  and necessary  to the Court’s \ndetermination of the Motion.  See Aldridge v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2019 NCBC LEXIS \n53, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 15, 2019). \n5. Brett, Quint, Heath, and Keith are brothers; Iris is their mother.  (Compl. ¶ \n27.)  As of 2014, the four brothers each held a 10.6% minority interest in R&S , and \nIris, as trustee of the 2008 Iris B. Barefoot Living Trust , held a 57.6%  majority \n \n \nownership interest .2  Iris was also the sole manager of the company. 3  R&S was \nformed and operated for the purpose of holding, owning, and/or leasing real property, \nwhich included certain real property located at 501, 502, 503, and 519 Patton Avenue; \n2500, 2504, and 2506 Fieldcrest Road; and 607 Mariner Road in Greensboro, North \nCarolina (the “Property”).  (Compl. ¶¶ 32–35.) \n6. Kiser and Buchanan are managing members of both KB and Shamrock.\n4  \nBrett alleges that Quint engaged in various business d ealings with the KB \nDefendants and/or their affiliates  prior to and after the 2018 sale of the Property .  \n(See Compl. ¶¶ 86–98.) \n7. Non-party Shamrock Environmental Corporation (“SEC”), which Brett \nalleges is affiliated with the KB Defendants, leased the property located at 519 Patton \nAvenue from R&S.5  Brett claims that Quint informed Iris and other members of R&S \nthat SEC could no longer meet its financial obligations under the lease and was \nconsidering termination of the lease in 2017.  (Compl. ¶ 41.)  During that same year, \nBrett alleges that the KB Defendants or their affiliates approached R&S, through \nQuint, about purchasing the Property.  (Compl. ¶ 38.) \n \n2 (See Br. Supp. Defs.’ Joint Mot. Dismiss Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction & Failure State \nClaim [hereinafter “Defs.’ Br. Supp.”] Ex. C, Action of the Manager of R&S [hereinafter “2014 \nManager Action”], ECF No. 33.4; see also Compl. ¶ 28.)   \n \n3 (See Defs.’ Br. Supp. Ex. B, Operating Agreement of R&S § 5.6 [hereinafter “Operating \nAgreement”], ECF No. 33.3.) \n \n4 (See Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Joint Mot. Dismiss Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction & Failure State \nClaim [hereinafter “Pl.’s Opp’n Br.”] Ex. 2, ECF No. 36.2.)  The Court will hereafter refer to \nKiser, Buchanan, KB, and Shamrock collectively as the “KB Defendants.” \n \n5 (See Compl. ¶¶ 37, 40; see also Compl. Ex. 2, Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Real \nProperty 13 [hereinafter “Purchase Agreement”], ECF No. 5.) \n \n \n8. According to Brett, Iris suffered from migraines in 2017 and 2018, the effects \nand treatment of which prevented her from taking effective legal action on behalf of \nR&S during that time.  (See Compl. ¶ 53.)  Brett alleges that Quint exploited Iris’s \npoor health during this period, exerting undue influence to pressure her into selling \nthe Property for an “unconscionably low” price.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 55–56, 66–69, 80–83.)  \nSpecifically, Brett alleges that Quint failed to disclose to Iris (as well as to the other \nmembers of R&S) his business relationship with the KB Defendants and their \naffiliates and that he misrepresented SEC’s ability to comply with the terms of the \nlease.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 43, 107, 133, 139, 147, 194, 209 .)  Brett also claims that a \npicture of the 519 Patton Avenue  property was featured in  a 2017 appraisal of the  \nother seven parcels included in the  Property, thereby misleading Iris into believing \nthat the 2017 appraisal valuation included the entire Property.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 73–\n76.) \n9.  R&S sold the Property to KB on 6 February 2018 for $2,800,000 .  (See \nCompl. ¶ 81.)  Iris signed the Agreement for Purchase and Sale of Real Property (the \n“Purchase Agreement”) for R&S as manager of the Company .  (See Purchase \nAgreement 8.)  Brett alleges that the fair market value of the Property at that time \nwas “well in excess of $4,000,000.00, and lik ely between $5,000,000.00 to \n$6,000,000.00.”  (Compl. ¶ 82.)  Brett learned of the transaction when he received his \nshare of the proceeds from the sale as a distribution from R&S.  (Compl. ¶ 64.) \n \n \nB. Procedural History \n10. Brett, Iris, and R&S  commenced this actio n on 5 February 2021, one day \nbefore certain claims would be time-barred by the relevant statutes of limitations, by \nfiling an Application and Order Extending Time to File Complaint (the “Application  \nand Order”) .  (Appl. & Order Extending Time File Compl. [hereinafter “Appl.  & \nOrder”], ECF No. 3 ; see also Compl. ¶¶ 12, 16. )  That same day, former counsel for \nBrett, Iris, and R&S sent a letter to Quint, Keith, Heath, and the KB Defendants (the \n“Letter”), requesting that the parties “discuss [the] circumstances surrounding the \nsale before engaging in protracted litigation” and sign  a Tolling Agreement.  (Defs.’ \nBr. Supp. Ex. A [hereinafter “Letter”], ECF No. 33.2; see also Compl. ¶ 17.)  The file-\nstamped Application and Order and a proposed Tolling Agreement were attached to \nthe Letter.  (See Letter; see also Compl. ¶ 17.) \n11. Sometime between 5 and 25 February 2021, Iris decided not to join Brett in \nbringing suit, ( see Compl. ¶¶ 13– 16), so Brett alone filed the Complaint on 25 \nFebruary 2021, seeking relief against Quint and the KB Defendants based on eight \nderivative claims and six individual claims, (see generally Compl.).  Keith, Heath, and \nIris were included as nominal defendants and/or necessary parties an d R&S was \nincluded as a nominal defendant.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 7–9, 11.) \n12. Defendants filed their Motion on 25 June 2021.  After full briefing, the Court \nheld a hearing on the Motion on 19 August 2021 (the “Hearing”), at which all parties \nwere represented by counsel.  The Motion is now ripe for resolution. \n \n \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n13. Defendants’ Motion challenges the adequacy of Brett’s pre- suit demand in  \nasserting his derivative claims and Brett’s standing to bring direct claims  based on \nan alleged fiduciary duty owed by Quint to Brett. \n14. “Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court’s proper exercise of subject \nmatter jurisdiction [,]” In re Z.G.J., 2021- NCSC-102, ¶ 12 (citation omitted) , and \n“must be addressed, and found to exist, before the merits of the case are judicially \nresolved[,]” In re T.B. , 200 N.C. App. 739, 742 (2009) ( cleaned up ).  “[S]tanding \narguments can be presented under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6)[.]”  Finley v. \nBrown, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 1, 2017) (quoting Sykes v. \nHealth Network Sols., Inc. , 2013 NCBC LEXIS 52, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 5, \n2013)).   \n15. “Rule 12(b)(1) requires the dismissal of any action ‘based upon a trial court’s \nlack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim.’ ”  Watson v. Joyner-Watson, \n263 N.C. App. 393, 394 (2018) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)).  The plaintiff bears \nthe burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.  See Harper v. City of Asheville, \n160 N.C. App. 209, 217 (2003).  In ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of standing \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the Court “may consider matters outside the pleadings” in \ndetermining whether subject matter jurisdiction exists, Harris v. Matthews, 361 N.C. \n265, 271 (2007) , and must “view the allegations [of the complaint ] as true and the \n \n \nsupporting record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party[,]” Mangum v. \nRaleigh Bd. of Adjustment, 362 N.C. 640, 644 (2008). \n16. In contrast, in ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court \nmay only consider the pleading and “any exhibits attached to the [pleading,]” Krawiec \nv. Manly, 370 N.C. 602, 606 (2018) , in order to determine  “whether the pleadings, \nwhen taken as true, are legally sufficient to satisfy the elements of at least some \nlegally recognized claim[,]” Arroyo v. Scottie’s Pro. Window Cleaning, Inc., 120 N.C. \nApp. 154, 158 (1995).  Although the Court construes the pleading liberally and \ngenerally accepts all allegations as true, see Laster v. Francis, 199 N.C. App. 572, 577 \n(2009), the Court is not required “to acc ept as true allegations that are merely \nconclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences[,]” Good Hope \nHosp., Inc. v. N.C. HHS, Div. of Facility Servs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274 (2005) (citation \nomitted).  The Court may also ignore a pa rty’s legal conclusions set forth in its \npleading.  See McCrann v. Pinehurst, LLC, 225 N.C. App. 368, 377 (2013). \n17. “Dismissal of an action under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate when the \ncomplaint ‘fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.’ ”  Arnesen v. \nRivers Edge Golf Club & Plantation, Inc. , 368 N.C. 440, 448 (2015)  (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)).  The Supreme Court of North Carolina has \ndetermined that a “complaint fails in this manner when: ‘(1) the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals \nthe absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses \n \n \nsome fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.’ ”  Krawiec, 370 N.C. at 606 \n(quoting Wood v. Guilford Cnty., 355 N.C. 161, 166 (2002)). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n18. As an initial matter, the Court notes that Brett’s first and second claims for \nrelief—a demand for an accounting of R&S assets and a demand for access to \ncompany information and records —have been rendered moot because R&S has \ncomplied with these demands.  (See Case Management Report 3, ECF No. 28; see also \nDefs.’ Br. Supp. 2 n.1 , ECF No. 33 .)  As a result, the Court will grant Defendants’ \nMotion and dismiss these claims below. \nA. Brett’s Derivative Claims \n19. Brett has asserted derivative claims on behalf of R&S for (i) constructive \nfraud, constructive trust, embezzlement, and breach of fiduciary duty and the duties \nof loyalty, due care, and good faith against Quint; (ii) fraud and negligent \nmisrepresentation against Quint and the KB Defendants; and (iii) breach of contract \nagainst the KB Defendants.  Defendants  move to dismiss all of Brett ’s derivative \nclaims on the ground that he  failed to make a proper pre -suit demand as required \nunder N.C.G.S. § 57D- 8-01(a)(2) and therefore lacks standing to pursue any claims \non behalf of R&S .  ( See Defs.’ Br. Supp.  2.)  That provision requires that , prior to \nasserting a derivative claim, an LLC member must have: \nmade written demand on the LLC to take suitable action, and either (i) \nthe LLC notified the member that the member’s demand was rejected, \n(ii) 90 days have expired from the date the demand was made, or (iii) \n \n \nirreparable injury to the LLC would result by waiting for the expiration \nof the 90-day period. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2).  “[T]he challenge to the adequacy of any pre- suit demand \nis, inter alia, a challenge to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over the derivative \nclaims.”  Finley , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *8 (quoting Petty v. Morris, 2014 NCBC \nLEXIS 67, at *4 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 16, 2014)).  “ ‘A party’s standing to bring a \nderivative claim depends on’ compliance with ‘the demand requirement’ in N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 57D-8-01(a)(2).”  Azure Dolphin, LLC v. Barton, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 90, at *20 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 2, 2017) (quoting Petty, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 67, at *4), aff’d, 371 \nN.C. 579 (2018).   \n20. The demand requirement exists to give an LLC the opportunity “to remedy \nthe alleged problem without resort to judicial action, or, if the problem cannot be \nremedied without judicial action, to allow the [LLC], as the true beneficial party, the \nopportunity to bring suit first against the alleged wrongdoers.”  Zoutewelle v. Mathis, \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 95, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 13, 2018) (quoting Bridges v. \nOates, 167 N.C. App. 459, 467–68 (2004)).  Since demand is required to permit the \nLLC to take corrective action, it follows that the LLC must receive the demand to \nfulfill that statutory purpose.  See,  e.g., Kane v. Moore, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 157, at \n*34–35 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 26, 2018) (finding inadequate pre-suit demand based, \nin part, on absence of allegations of LLC’s receipt and rejection of demand); Miller v. \nBurlington Chem. Co., LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 27, \n2017) (finding relevant receipt of demand); Petty , 2014 NCBC LEXIS 67, at * 19–21 \n(same). \n \n \n21. Here, Brett first argues that he was excused from the demand requirement \nof section 57D-8-01(a)(2) because, at the time the Application and Order was filed, \nboth Iris and R&S were named plaintiffs in the suit.  (See Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 9, ECF No. \n36; see also Appl. & Order.)  Brett contends that, although the Application and Order \ngave notice of potential derivative claims, Iris, as the manager and majority member \nof R&S, “could direct the Company to take action on its own behalf.”  (Pl.’s Opp’n Br. \n9.)  Alternatively, Brett argues that (i) the Letter sent  to Quint, Keith, Heath, and \nthe KB Defendants satisfied the demand requirement of section  57D-8-01(a)(2); (ii) \nQuint’s refusal to enter into the Tolling Agreement constituted a rejection of the \ndemand by R&S under section 57D-8-01(a)(2)(i); and (iii) due to the imminent lapsing \nof the relevant statutes of limitations, “irreparable injury to the LLC would result by \nwaiting for the expiration of the 90 -day period.”  (Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 10 –14 (quoting \nN.C.G.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2)).) \n22. In opposition, Defendants conten d that Brett was not excused from \ncomplying with the demand requirement of section 57D-8-01(a)(2) and, additionally, \nthat the Letter did not constitute a proper demand under the statute for three \nreasons.6  First, Defendants argue that the Letter was sent  after the lawsuit was \ninitiated.  ( See Defs.’ Br. Supp. 7, 10 ; see also Defs.’ Reply 3. )  Second, Defendants \ncontend that the Letter was sent to three of the five members of R&S rather than to \nthe Company itself, so R&S could not properly reject it.  (See Defs.’ Br. Supp. 10–11; \nsee also Defs.’ Reply 3 .)  Third, Defendants argue that Brett failed to demonstrate  \n \n6 (See Defs.’ Br. Supp. 6–7, 9–12; Reply Supp. Defs.’ Joint Mot. Dismiss Lack of Subject Matter \nJurisdiction & Failure State Claim 2–4 [hereinafter “Defs.’ Reply”], ECF No. 43.)   \n \n \nthat any “irreparable injury . . . would result by waiting for the expiration of the 90 -\nday [response] period” otherwise required by section 57D-8-01(a)(2).  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. \n11–12 (quoting Compl. ¶ 22 ).)  For these reasons, Defendants argue, Brett lacks \nstanding to bring derivative claims on behalf of R&S. \n23. The Court agrees with Defendants.   \n24. Although the events that transpired between the filing of the Application \nand Order and the Complaint make the proc edural posture of this case somewhat \nodd, the fact that R&S was a party plaintiff at the time this suit was commenced does \nnot excuse Brett from complying with the demand requirement of section  57D-8-\n01(a)(2) when purporting to bring derivative claims on behalf of the Company.  To be \nsure, R&S could have asserted direct claims “in its own right” as a party plaintiff.  \n(See Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 9.)  However, to bring derivative claim s on behalf of an LLC, a \nmember must comply with the statutory demand requirement of Chapter 57D.   See \nIn re Harris Teeter Merger Litig., 2014 NCBC LEXIS 47, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. \n24, 2014) (“[T]he failure to make demand is fatal.”). \n25. Demand is a pre-suit requirement.  See, e.g., Garlock v. Hilliard, 2000 NCBC \nLEXIS 6, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 22, 2000) (“In determining whether the demand \nrequirement has been met the Court must compare the derivative claims asserted in \na complaint against the specific demands a plaintiff has made prior to filing suit .” \n(emphasis added) (citation omitted)); Kane, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 157, at *14 (“The pre-\nsuit demand required by section 57D -8-01(a) ‘must be made with sufficient clarity \n \n \nand particularity  . . . .’ ”  (emphasis added)) .  Although a civil action is generally \ncommenced with the filing of a complaint, Rule 3 states that: \nA civil action may also be commenced by the issuance of a summons \nwhen (1) [a] person makes application to the court stating the nature \nand purpose of his action and requesting permission to file his complaint \nwithin 20 days and (2) [t]he court makes an order stating the nature and \npurpose of the action and granting the requested permission. \n \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 3; see also Sink v. Easter, 284 N.C. 555, 558 (1974) (holding that filing \nan application and order extending time to file a complaint commences an action) ; \nWooten v. Warren, 117 N.C. App. 350, 353 (1994) (same). \n26. Here, Brett, Iris, and R&S  made application to the Mecklenburg County \nSuperior Court under Rule 3 , which the Mecklenburg Assistant Clerk of Superior \nCourt granted on 5 February 2021.  (See Appl. & Order.)7  Later that same day, former \ncounsel for Brett, Iris, and R&S sent the Letter to Quint, Keith, Heath, and the KB \nDefendants.  ( See Letter.)  Former counsel clearly noted that the Letter was in \nreference to the lawsuit captioned  “Robert and Sons, LLC, et. al. v. Quint \nBarefoot, et. al.” and enclosed a copy of the file-stamped Application and Order.  (See \nLetter.)  Because the filing of the Application and Order commenced this litigation , \nthe Letter did not constitute a pre-suit demand as required by section 57D-8-01(a)(2). \n27. In addition to its untimeliness, the Letter was not sent to R&S.  For a \ndemand to be effective, the member must make “written demand on the LLC [.]”  \nN.C.G.S. § 57D-8-01(a)(2) (emphasis added).  Delivery to the LLC must be made to “a \nperson or entity that has authority to cause the LLC to reject the demand” or through \n \n7 This action was later designated as a mandatory complex business case on 26 March 2021.  \n(ECF No. 1.) \n \n \nits registered agent.  Russell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina \nCorporation Law  § 34.04[5], at n.61.1 (7th ed. 2018)  [hereinafter “ Robinson on \nCorporation Law”]; see also Hilco Transp., Inc. v. Atkins, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 5, at *13 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 15, 2016)  (requiring that proper demand be addressed to \n“someone with authority to act on behalf of the corporation”). \n28. Section 12.1 of the  Operating Agreement of R&S  (the “Opera ting \nAgreement”) provides that “any notice, payment, demand, or communication required \nor permitted to be given by any provision of this Agreement shall be in writing and     \n. . . addressed as follows: if to the Company, to its principal office address[.]”   \n(Operating Agreement § 12.1 (emphasis added).)  The Operating Agreement goes on \nto state that R&S’s principal office address is “Iris B. Barefoot, 7 Elm Grove Court, \nGreensboro, North Carolina 27401.”  (Operating Agreement § 1.5.)  Brett alleges that \nIris, the majority member and manager of R&S, was “copied on the [Letter,]” (Compl. \n¶ 17), but neither Iris’s name nor the Elm Grove Court address appears in the Letter, \n(see Letter).  The Court further notes that while the 2014–17 annual reports for R&S \non file with the North Carolina Secretary of State include a different address —828 \nKnox Road, McLeansville, North Carolina 27301- 9227—as the Company’s principal \noffice address, ( see Pl.’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 1  [hereinafter “Annual Reports”] , ECF No. \n36.1), this address is not set forth in the Letter either, (see Letter). \n29. The Letter is instead addressed to the KB Defendants, Quint, Keith, and \nHeath.  (See Letter.)  The KB Defendants are not affiliated with R&S and  thus are \nnot in a position to make the Company take any action.  Moreover, Quint, Keith, and \n \n \nHeath, each a 10.6% minority member, did not possess the requisite authority, either \nindividually or collectively , to reject a demand on behalf of R&S.   (See Operating \nAgreement § 6.1 (“Unless authorized to do so by this Agreement or by the Managers, \nno Member . . . of the Company shall have the actual or apparent authority to . . . \ntake any action purporting to be on behalf of the Company.”).)   \n30. Brett nonetheless argues that delivery on the Company  was effective \nbecause Quint also served as a manager of R&S and, as such, possessed the requisite \nauthority to cause the C ompany to reject a demand.  (See Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 11.)   Brett \nalleges that, “[u]pon information and belief,” Quint served as a manager of R&S, but \nprovides no additional facts to support this allegation.  (Compl. ¶ 29; see also ¶¶ 85, \n105, 128, 144.)  Perhaps recognizing that fact, Brett appends  four annual reports on \nfile with the North  Carolina Secretary of State 8 to his Brief in Opposition to the \nMotion (the “Opposition”), which Quint filed on behalf of the C ompany as its \n“manager,” in support of his argument that Quint had the authority to reject a \ndemand made upon R&S.  (See Annual Reports; see also Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 11.) \n31. But e ven i f Quint w ere a manager of R&S , Quint still did not possess \nsufficient authority to reject a demand made on the Company.  The Company’s \nOperating Agreement specifically provides that: “When more than one (1) Manager \nis serving,  . . . the majority vote, consent, approval or ratification of the Managers \nthen serving shall be required to bind the Managers and to represent action by or on \n \n8 Brett correctly notes that “[t]he Court may take judicial notice of public filings available on \nthe North Carolina Secretary of State’s official website.”  Banc of Am. Merch. Servs., LLC v. \nArby’s Rest. Grp., Inc., 2021 NCBC LEXIS 60, at *5 n.3 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 30, 2021). \n \n \n \nbehalf of the Company.”  (Operating Agreement § 5.1 .)  Because Brett concedes that \nIris was a manager of R&S, 9 (see Pl.’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 3 ¶¶ 20, 25 [hereinafter “Brett \nAff.”], ECF No. 36.3), any rejection of a demand made on the Company would need to \nbe made by both Quint and Iris to be effective.  Therefore, the Letter did not constitute \nan effective demand on R&S because Quint , in his role as a manager,  did not have \nthe individual “authority to cause the LLC to reject the demand [.]”10  Robinson on \nCorporation Law § 34.04[5], at n.61.1. \n32. Lastly, Brett has also failed to demonstrate that any “irreparable injury to \nthe LLC would result by waiting for the expiration of the 90 -day [response] period” \nrequired by section 57D -8-01(a)(2).  Brett contends that “[e]ntering into the tolling \n \n9 There is also ample support for this fact in the record.  The Operating Agreement clearly \nstates that “Iris B. Barefoot is designated as the Manager of the Company.”  (Operating \nAgreement § 5.6.)  In a 2014 written consent, Iris signed the document as the sole manager.  \n(See 2014 Manager Action.)  Iris’s initials appear at the bottom of pages 1–7 of the Purchase \nAgreement and, under the signature block for the seller, the name “Quint” is crossed out as \nthe manager, the name “Iris” is hand-written above his name, and Iris signed the contract as \nmanager for R&S.  ( See Purchase Agreement 1 –8.)  The two deeds that effectuated the \ntransfer of the Property from R&S to KB are signed by Iris —again as manager.  (See Defs.’ \nBr. Supp. Ex. D, ECF No. 33.5.)   The Court additionally notes that a lthough Brett alleges \nthat Iris “lacked legal capacity” to make decisions and sign legal documents on behalf of R&S \nduring the relevant time period  “as a result of migraines and relat ed medication[ ,]” ( see \nCompl. ¶¶ 53 –54, 56, 65– 66, 136; see also Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 4, 6, 22), the record is devoid of \nevidence to support this conclusory allegation and the Court need not accept it as true.  See, \ne.g., Venable v. GKN Auto ., 107 N.C. App. 579 , 584 (1992) (affirming dismissal under Rule \n12(b)(1) where plaintiff’s allegations were “conclusory in nature”); see also  Neuse River \nFound., Inc. v. Smithfield Foods, Inc., 155 N.C. App. 110, 113 (2002) (“Since [the elements of \nstanding] are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the \nplaintiff’s case, each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on \nwhich the plaintiff bears the burden of proof[.]”) , overruled on other grounds by Comm. to \nElect Dan Forest v. Emps. Pol. Action Comm., 376 N.C. 558 (2021). \n \n10 The Court also notes that service on the Company ’s registered agent would have \nconstituted an effective demand under the statute, see Petty, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 67, at *17–\n18, but the Company’s registered agent is not listed as one of the recipients of the Letter and \nthere is no evidence of record that the Letter was sent to the registered agent .  ( Compare \nAnnual Reports, with Letter.) \n \n \nagreement was necessary to preserve the Company’s claims” that otherwise may have \nbeen barred by the relevant statutes of limitations.  (Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 12.)  Brett further \nargues that a tolling agreement would have given R&S the opportunity to “remedy \nthe alleged problem without resort to judicial action, or . . . to bring suit first against \nthe alleged wrongdoers.”  (Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 12 (quoting Bridges, 167 N.C. App. at 467–\n68 (citation omitted)).) \n33. While the Court agrees that a tolling agreement would have been necessary \nto preserve the Company’s claims if Brett had sought to comply with the ninety -day \nresponse period required by section 57D -8-01(a), Brett instead commenced this \nlawsuit by filing the Application and Order.  In doing so, he made a tolling agreement \nsuperfluous.  Not only could a tolling agreement no longer enable the parties to “avoid \njudicial action” as Brett contends —as noted, the filing of the Application and Order \ninitiated the judicial action—but in bringing this lawsuit, R&S, Iris, and Quint tolled \nall statutes of limitations on the claims asserted.  See, e.g. , Carl Rose & Sons Ready \nMix Concrete, Inc. v. Thorp Sales Corp., 36 N.C. App. 778, 780 (1978) ( noting that \n“[n]ormally, the statute of limitations is tolled when legal action is commenced”). \n34. Moreover, Brett’s claims of irreparable injury ring particularly hollow here.  \nNot only does he allege that he received  notice of the challenged sale in June 2018, \n(see Compl. ¶ 64 (“Brett had no knowledge that the sale of the Property occurred until \nafter the sale of the Property had closed, when the Company distributed the proceeds \nof the sale.”); Letter (“[T]he shareholders of [R&S] did not receive any proceeds from \nthe Property’s sale until June 2018[.]”)), but he also avers that he learned of \n \n \n“numerous irregularities and suspicious circumstances in the sale of the Property” \n“in the spring of 2020,” (Brett Aff. ¶ 11).  Yet he waited until the day before applicable \nstatutes of limitations expired to initiate suit and make his improper and untimely \ndemand.  It would appear, therefore, that any injury Brett claims to have suffered \ndue to the running of statutes of limitatio ns at the time he made his purported \ndemand was caused by Brett’s failure to act when he became aware of these alleged \nfacts and for no other reason.   \n35. The Court therefore concludes that b ecause R&S did not face any \n“irreparable injury,” Brett was not excused from complying with the ninety -day \ndemand requirement of section 57D-8-01(a)(2).\n  \n36. For the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that Brett does not have \nstanding to pursue his derivative claims on behalf of R&S due to his failure to comply \nwith the pre -suit demand required by section  57D-8-01(a) and will therefore grant \nthe Motion and dismiss Brett’s derivative claims without prejudice. \nB. Brett’s Individual Claims \n37. The Court now turns to Brett’s individual claims against Quint for (i) breach \nof fiduciary duty and the duties of loyalty, due care, and good faith; (ii) constructive \nfraud; (iii) constructive trust; (iv) embezzlement; and (v) fraud.  Because Defendants \nseek dismissal of Brett’s individual claims under both Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6), \n(see Defs.’ Br. Supp. 2, 16–23), the Court will analyze his claims under both standards, \nbeginning with Defendants’ challenge to Brett’s standing to bring hi s individual \nclaims under Rule 12(b)(1). \n \n \n38. It is a well-settled principle of North Carolina law that “[s]hareholders . . . of \ncorporations generally may not bring individual actions to recover what they consider \ntheir share of the damages suffered by the corporation.”  Barger v. McCoy Hillard & \nParks, 346 N.C. 650, 660 (1997) (quoting Taha v. Engstrand, 987 F.2d 505, 507 (8th \nCir. 1993)); see also Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 612 (2018).  Our \ncourts recognize two exceptions to this rule: shareholder s may bring an individual \naction when “(1) the wrongdoer owed them a special duty or (2) they suffered a \npersonal injury distinct from the injury sustained by the corporation itself.”  Corwin, \n371 N.C. at 612 (cleaned up).  Both the general rule  and its exceptions “are equally \napplicable in the LLC context.”  White v. Hyde , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 74, at *18 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Oct. 4, 2016). \n39. Under the special duty  exception, “the duty must be one that the alleged \nwrongdoer owed directly to the shareholder  as an individual.”  Barger, 346 N.C. at \n659.  The plaintiff must allege facts from which it may be inferred that “defendants \nowed a duty to plaintiff[ ] that was personal to plaintiff[ ] as [a  member] and was \nseparate and distinct from the duty defendants owed the [LLC,]” such as a breach of \na fiduciary duty owed to the member.  Id.  A fiduciary relationship is one in which \nthere has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and \ngood conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the \ninterests of the one reposing confidence, and it extends to any possible \ncase in which a fiduciary relationship exists in fact, and in which there \nis confidence reposed on one side, and resulting domination and \ninfluence on the other. \n \nKaplan v. O.K. Techs., L.L.C. , 196 N.C. App. 469, 472 (2009) (cleaned up) ; see also, \ne.g., Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, 340 (2019) (to similar effect). \n \n \n40. Brett argues that he has standing to bring his individual claims under the \nspecial duty exception, identifying three bases on which he asserts that Quint owed \nhim a fiduciary duty.  (See Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 18–23.)   \n41. Brett first contends that his fraternal relationship with Quin t formed “the \nbedrock of the trust and confidence Brett reposed in Quint[,]”  (Pl.’ Opp’n Br. 18; see \nalso Compl. ¶¶ 129– 30), b ut correctly concedes that, without more, a sibling \nrelationship is insufficient to support the existence of a fiduciary relationship , (see \nPl.’s Opp’n Br. 18).  See, e.g., White, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 74, at *20–21.   \n42. Brett next argues that Quint owe d him a fiduciary duty as the trustee of \nvarious unrelated trusts of which Brett or Brett’s children are beneficiaries.  (See Pl.’s \nOpp’n Br. 19–20; Compl. ¶ 130; Brett Aff. ¶¶ 4– 7.)  While it is true that “one of the \nmost fundamental duties of a trustee throughout a trust relationship is to maintain \ncomplete loyalty to the interests of his beneficiaries[,]” Howe v. Links Club Condo. \nAss’n, 263 N.C. App. 130, 149 (2018) (cleaned up), that duty is only with regard to the \nmanagement and administration of the trust, see In re Testamentary Tr. of Charnock, \n158 N.C. App. 35, 42 (2003) (“Trust beneficiaries may expect and demand the trustee’s \ncomplete loyalty in the administration of any trust .” (emphasis added) (citation \nomitted)).  Quint owes Brett (and Brett’ s children) a fiduciary duty to administer \nthese trusts in his (and their) best interests.  But this trustee appointment does not \nmake Quint Brett’s fiduciary as to all matters, including with respect to their roles \nas minority members of R&S, and therefore does not qualify as a “special duty” that \nwould provide Brett standing to pursue his individual claims against Quint. \n \n \n43. Brett’s last argument for establishing a fiduciary relationship with Quint is \nbased on Quint’s alleged exercise of “actual domination and control” over R&S, both \nas the “de facto majority member” and as a manager of the Company.  (Pl.’s Opp’n Br. \n16, 20–23.)  Brett’s Opposition does not distinguish between  the fiduciary duty of a \nmajority member and that of a manager.  (See Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 20–23.)  Because those \nduties are different, the Court will examine whether Brett has shown that Quint owes \nhim a fiduciary duty first as a manager and, second, as a de facto  majority member \nof R&S. \n44. In the corporate context, directors generally owe fiduciary duties to the \ncorporation rather than to the individual shareholders  such that “[w]hen these \nfiduciary duties are breached, a shareholder may sue the offending director in a \nderivative action.”  Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 141 (2013).  Indeed, the drafters \nof the 1990 North Carolina Business Corporation Act  specifically “intended to avoid \nstating [that] a duty [was] owed directly by the directors to the shareholders [because] \nthat might be construed to give shareholders a direct right of action on claims that \nshould be asserted derivatively.”  Robinson on Corporation La w § 14.01[2]; see also \nN.C. Commentary § 55-8-30 (1989) (second paragraph) (“The drafters decided not to \nbring forward the words ‘and to its shareholders’ in order to avoid an interpretation \nthat there is a duty running directly from directors to the share holders that would \ngive shareholders a direct right of action on claims that should be asserted \nderivatively.”). \n \n \n45. This same reasoning carries over to the LLC context.  M anagers of an LLC \nusually owe a fiduciary duty to the company, not to the LLC’s individual members, \nand “where it is alleged that [managers] have breached this duty, the action is \nproperly maintained by the [LLC] rather than any individual . . . [member].”  Kaplan, \n196 N.C. App. at 474 (quoting Governors Club, Inc. v. Governors Club Ltd. P’ship, 152 \nN.C. App. 240, 248 (2002)); see also N.C.G.S. § 57D-3-21(b).  But, unlike a corporation, \n“[a]n LLC is primarily a creature of contract[,]” Finkel v. Palm Park, Inc., 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 38, at *25 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 11, 2019) (quoting Crouse v. Mineo, 189 N.C. \nApp. 232, 237 (2008)), and “[t]he operating agreement governs the internal affairs of \nan LLC and the rights, duties, and obligations of . . . the company officials in relation \nto each other, the LLC, and the interest owners[,]” N.C.G.S. § 57D-2-30(a). \n46. Although not clearly stated in his Opposition, Brett argued at the Hearing \nthat the language of the Operating Agreement purports to extend the manager s’ \nfiduciary duty to the Company to the LLC’s members as well .  ( See Pl.’s Opp’n Br. \n22–23.)  In relevant part, the Operating Agreement provides that:  \n[T]he Managers shall conduct the business of the Company in good faith \nand with the care that an ordinary, prudent person would exercise in a \nlike position, under similar circumstances and in a manner the Manager \nreasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company and the \nMembers, including the safekeeping and use of all Company funds and \nother Company Assets for the exclusive benefit of the Company and the \nMembers. \n \n(Operating Agreement § 5.4 (emphasis added).)  Brett argues that this provision’s \ninclusion of the phrase “and the Members” was “intended to protect the disinterested \n \n \nmembers (including Brett) from self-dealing by other members and/or managers” and \n“provide[ ] protections for members that Quint disregarded.”  (Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 23.) \n47. The Court finds this argument unpersuasive.  The phrase “the Company \nand the Members” in Section 5.4 of the Operating Agreement parallels the langu age \nof former N.C. G.S. § 55-35: “Officers and directors shall be deemed to stand in a \nfiduciary relation  to the corporation and to its shareholders.”  Robinson on \nCorporation Law § 14.01[2] n.11 (emphasis added) (quoting N.C.G.S. § 55-35 (1989)).  \nBut, as noted above, the decision to remove the words “to its shareholders” from the \nfinal version of N.C.G.S. § 55 -8-30 was intended to clarify and “avoid an \ninterpretation that there is a duty running directly from directors to the shareholders \nthat would give shareholders a direct right of action[.]”  N.C. Commentary § 55 -8-30 \n(1989) (second paragraph).  Therefore, in the LLC context, the inclusion of the phrase \n“and the Members”  is not reasonably interpreted to create a duty running direct ly \nfrom the managers to the members that would give members a direct right of action. \n48. Because “[t]he rights and duties of LLC members [and company officials] \nare ordinarily governed by the company’s operating agreement, not by general \nprinciples of fiduciary relationships[,]” Pender Farm Dev., LLC v. NDCO, LLC, 2020 \nNCBC LEXIS 43, at *33 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 7, 2020) (alteration in original) (quoting \nStrategic Mgmt. Decisions v. Sales Performance Int’l, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at *10–\n11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 7, 2017) ), the members of R&S could have provided in the \nOperating Agreement that the managers owed a fiduciary duty to both the Company \nand the members, see, e.g. , id. at *33 –34 (concluding that a manager owed the \n \n \nmembers a fiduciary duty where the operating agreeme nt specifically provided that \n“[t]he duties of the [m]anagers to [the LLC] and the [m]embers are of a fiduciary \nnature” (first, second, and fourth alterations in original)); Finkel, 2019 NCBC LEXIS \n38, at *31 (recognizing a fiduciary duty owed by the managers to the members based \non the following language in the operating agreement: “[The managers shall] [b]e \nunder a fiduciary duty to conduct the affairs of [the LLC] in the best interests of the \nCompany and of the Members” (first, second, and fourth alterations in original)).  But \nthey did not, and, as pleaded here, any claim for an alleged breach of duty by Quint, \nas a manager of R&S, accrued to the Company derivatively rather than to Brett, as a \nmember, individually. \n49. The Court now turns to Brett’s argument  that Quint owed him a fiduciary \nduty as the de facto majority member of R&S.  Although members of an LLC generally \ndo not owe a fiduciary duty to each other or to the company, majority members do \nowe a fiduciary duty to minority members.  See Kaplan , 196 N.C. App. at  473.  \nSimilarly, in the corporate context, the majority stockholder of a corporation owes \nfiduciary duties to minority stockholders.  See Corwin, 371 N.C. at 616 (citing Gaines \nv. Long Mfg. Co., 234 N.C. 340, 344 (1951)).  But while our Supreme Court “has never \nheld that a minority  stockholder owes fiduciary duties to ot her stockholders, . . . it \nhas also never held that a minority stockholder cannot  owe fiduciary duties to other \nstockholders.”  Corwin , 371 N.C. at 616.  Although the Supreme Court determined \nthat resolution of that question was unnecessary to resolve the issue presented in \nCorwin, it applied the Delaware controlling -stockholder standard and discussed at \n \n \nlength the showing necessary to demonstrate that a minority stockholder exercised \nthe necessary control to be considered a “controlling stockholder”: \nIn Delaware, it is well settled law that only a ‘controlling stockholder’ \nowes fiduciary duties to other stockholders.  A stockholder is considered \ncontrolling if it owns more than 50% of the corporation’s voting power or \nif it exercises control over the busi ness and affairs of the corporation.  \nPut another way, a minority stockholder is considered a controlling \nstockholder if the minority stockholder exercise s dominion through \nactual control of corporate conduct.  This inquiry focuses on actual \ncontrol over the board of directors.  Actual control exists only when the \nallegedly controlling stockholder exercises such formidable voting and \nmanagerial power that it, as a practical matter, is no differently situated \nthan if it had majority voting control.  As a necessary prerequisite for a \nminority stockholder to exercise actual control, then, the stockholder’s \npower must be so potent that independent directors cannot freely \nexercise their judgment, fearing retribution. \n \nTo survive a motion to dismiss in Delaware, a claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty by a minority stockholder must contain more than the \nbare conclusory allegation that a minority stockholder possessed control.  \nRather, the complaint must contain well -pled fa cts showing that the \nminority stockholder exercised actual domination and control over the \ndirectors.  Even at the motion to dismiss stage, Delaware courts have \nnoted that this actual control test is not an easy one to satisfy as \nstockholders with very pot ent clout have been deemed, in thoughtful \ndecisions, to fall short of the mark. \n \nId. at 616 –17 (cleaned up).  Using this framework, the Court concludes that the \nComplaint does not adequately allege that Quint exercised actual control over the \nCompany’s manager and majority member, Iris. \n50. Because Quint owns far less than 50% of the Company’s voting power, Brett \nmust demonstrate that Quint exercised actual control over R&S in the form of “such \nformidable voting and managerial power that [he], as a practical ma tter, [is] no \ndifferently situated than if [he] had majority voting control.”  Id. (second alteration \nin original) (quoting In re KKR Fin. Holdings LLC S’holder Litig., 101 A.3d 980, 993 \n \n \n(Del. Ch. 2014)).  In his Complaint, Brett alleges numerous times , in conclusory \nfashion, that Quint exercised actual domination and control over the Company , (see, \ne.g., Compl. ¶¶ 106, 108, 132, 136–38), and that the sale of the Property and Iris’s \nsignatures on the associated documents were procured as a result of Quint’s fraud \nand undue influence over Iris, ( see, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 49, 55, 66, 80, 83 –84, 106, 108, \n136).  But the Complaint contains few, if any, details to explain how Quint controlled \nthe Company and Iris and  how he engaged in this alleged wrongdoing.  ( See, e.g., \nCompl. ¶¶ 31, 52 (other members relied on Quint’s knowledge and expertise); ¶ 38 \n(upon information and belief, Quint informed R&S of the KB Defendants’ interest in \npurchasing the Property); ¶¶ 41 –42, (upon information and belief, Quint informed  \nR&S that, according to Kiser and Buchanan, SEC was considering terminating its \nlease of the 519 Patton Avenue property or moving to another location); ¶ 46 (upon \ninformation and belief, Quint previously arranged for a reduction in SEC’s rental \npayments); ¶¶ 50, 57, 60 (Quint communicated information about the proposed sale \nto the other members).)  While these allegations demonstrate that Quint may have \nplayed a more active role in R&S than his brothers, even taken together, they do not \ncome close to showing “formidable” managerial control over the Company.  Cf. Pender \nFarm Dev., LLC, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 43, at *35 –37 (concluding the record contained \nsufficient evidence of manager’s “extensive” involvement with the LLC to create \nquestion of fact as to whether a de facto  fiduciary relationship existed between the \nmanager and the members). \n \n \n51. Brett additionally alleges that Quint “misinformed Iris as to the value of the \nProperty” by featuring a picture of the 519 Patton Avenue property on a 2017 \nappraisal of the other seven properties , (Compl. ¶ ¶ 56, 67 ; see also  ¶¶ 75– 76); \nhowever, the Complaint, as pleaded, does not allege  that Quint prepared the \nappraisal and/or requested inclusion of the picture.  Instead, the Complaint  merely \nalleges that Quint was “aware” of its inclusion in the 2017 appraisal , (see Compl. ¶ \n77), such that this action cannot properly be attributed to Quint. \n52. The Court fu rther notes that while Quint ’s alleged failure to disclose his \nrelationship and various business dealings with the KB Defendants to Iris and the \nother members of the Company may constitute a violation of the Operating \nAgreement,11 (see Pl.’s Opp’n Br. 22–23; see also Compl. ¶¶ 80, 84–86, 107, 134, 139, \n147, 194–99), this alleged inaction still does not provide the Court with any details \nas to how Quint exercised actual domination and control over Iris and her actions as \nmanager. \n \n11 As the Opposition correctly notes, the Operating Agreement states that \n \nno Member or Manager shall engage in any transaction with the Company in \nwhich the Member or Manager has a direct or indirect interest unless such \ntransaction is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of disinterested \nManagers or, if there are none, by Majority in Interest of the disinterested \nMembers knowing the material facts of the transaction and the Member's \ninterest. \n \n(Operating Agreement § 5.4.)  However, the Operating Agreement further states that “any \nMember or Managing Member may engage independently or with others in other business \nventures, or make or manage other investments, without the necessity of informing the \nCompany or the other Members. . . . [T]he pursuit of such ven tures shall not be deemed \nwrongful or improper.”  (Operating Agreement § 6.3.)  The Court need not decide whether \nQuint had a duty to disclose and/or whether the sale was nevertheless “authorized, approved \nor ratified” by Iris as the “Majority in Interest,” because this issue is not before the Court. \n \n \n53. Because the Complain t relies on conclusory allegations rather than “well -\npled facts,” Brett has failed to demonstrate that Quint exercised “formidable voting \nand managerial power” over Iris and the Company and, therefore, has not pleaded \nsufficient facts to show that Quint is a de facto majority member.  Corwin, 371 N.C. \nat 617 (“[A] claim for breach of fiduciary duty by a minority stockholder must contain \nmore than t he bare conclusory allegation that a minority stockholder possessed \ncontrol.  Rather, the complaint must contain well-pled facts showing that the \nminority stockholder exercised actual domination and control over the directors.” \n(cleaned up)); see also Neuse River Found., Inc, 155 N.C. App. at 113 (noting that the \nelements of standing must be supported “ in the same way as any other matter on \nwhich the plaintiff bears the burden of proof”); Venable, 107 N.C. App. at 584 \n(affirming dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) where plaintiff’s allegations were \n“conclusory in nature”) .  As a minority member, without more, Quint does not owe \nBrett, or any other member of R&S, a fiduciary duty.  See Kaplan , 196 N.C. App. at \n473.  Brett therefore lacks standing to pursue  his individual claims  against Quint \nbecause he has failed to plead facts showing that Quint owed him a fiduciary or other \nspecial duty.  Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants’ Motion to dismiss as to \nthose claims.\n12 \n \n12 The Court notes that e ven if Brett did have standing to bring his individual claims, the \nComplaint still fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nBrett’s individual claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud fail because the \nComplaint has not adequately pleaded the existence of a fiduciary duty.  Brett’s individual \nclaim for fraud also fails because it is based on Quint’s alleged fiduciary d uty to disclose \ninformation to Brett.  Lastly, Brett’s individual claim for embezzlement fails both because \nQuint did not owe Brett a fiduciary duty and because Brett seeks recovery of Company, rather \nthan personal, assets. \n \n \nC.  Brett’s Claims for Constructive Trust and Civil Conspiracy \n54. Finally, Defendants seek to dismiss Brett’s claims for constructive trust and \ncivil conspiracy  because each of the underlying claims on which these claims are  \npremised are subject to dismissal  and, additionally, because  a constructive trust is  \nnot a standalone claim for relief.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. 2 n.2, 24.)  The Court agrees. \n55. Defendants are correct that the imposition of a constructive trust is a  \nremedy, not a standalone claim.  See LLG-NRMH, LLC v. N . Riverfront Marina & \nHotel, LLLP, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 105, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, 2018) (“[A] \nconstructive trust is not a standalone claim for relief or cause of action.”).  \nAccordingly, the Court will grant Defendants’ Motion to dismiss Brett’s purported \nclaims for constructive trust. \n56. “To create civil liability for conspiracy there must have been a wrongful act \nresulting in injury to another committed by one or more of the conspirators pursuant \nto the common scheme and in furtherance of the objective.”  Krawiec, 370 N.C. at 613 \n(quoting State ex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway  Brands Mfg., LLC , 362 N .C. 431, 444 \n(2008)).  “[A] complaint sufficiently state[s] a claim for civil conspiracy when it \nallege[s] (1) a conspiracy, (2) wrongful acts done by certain of the alleged conspirators \nin furtherance of that conspiracy, and (3) injury as a result of that  conspiracy.”  \nRidgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, 362 N.C. at 444.  \n57. Brett bases his civil conspiracy claim against Quint and the KB Defendants \non the “unlawful activity described” in the Complaint.  (Compl. ¶ 1 11.)  Because the \nCourt has determined that all of Brett’s underlying claims must be dismissed, those \n \n \nclaims cannot provide a basis for Brett’s  civil conspiracy claim.  See, e.g. , Krawiec, \n370 N.C. at 615 (dismissing civil conspiracy claim where the claims a lleged as the \nunderlying wrongful acts were dismissed); see also, e.g., USA Trouser, S.A. de C.V. v. \nWilliams, 258 N.C. App. 192, 201 (2018) (“A civil conspiracy claim must be based on \nan adequately pled underlying claim.”).  As a result, the Court concludes that Brett’s \nclaim for civil conspiracy is  not supported by the requisite wrongful acts and must \ntherefore be dismissed.  See, e.g. , New Bar P’ship v. Martin , 221 N.C.
