The Supplemental Motions include Plaintiffs’ Motion for Leave to \nSupplement or, in the Alternative, to Amend Plaintiffs’ Complaint (“Motion to \nAmend”), Plaintiffs’ Motion for Clarification and Reconsideration (“Motion for \nReconsideration”), Defendants’ Motion to Bifurcate Trial (“Motion to Bifurcate”), \nand Defendants’ Supplemental Dispositive Motion (“Dispositive Motion”).   \n \nMoore & Van Allen, PLLC by James P.

Bell III, Virginia \nBell, Nissan Joseph, and Hickory Brands, Inc. \n \nGale, Judge. \n \n   Blythe v. Bell, 2013 NCBC 18. \n{2} The detailed facts and procedural history of the case are detailed in the \ncourt’s earlier Orders.  At the court’s February 5, 2013 status conference, the court \nmodified its Case Management Order to allow additional motions following the \ncourt’s ruling on the cross-summary judgment motions.  The Parties filed multiple \nbriefs on the Supplemental Motions, the court heard oral argument, and the \nMotions are ripe for adjudication.  In the interest of providing a more prompt ruling \nto facilitate preparation for the pre-trial conference set for April 18, 2013 and trial \nset for May 6, 2013, the court issues this Order recognizing that some of the \nsignificant issues would justify a more extensive discussion in the absence of those \nexigencies, particularly as related to the issues of fiduciary duties owed by the LLC \nmembers and the background of and scope of relief afforded for the Meiselman \nclaims.   \n \nI. I. I. I. \n PLAINTIFFS’ PLAINTIFFS’ PLAINTIFFS’ PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO AMEND MOTION TO AMEND MOTION TO AMEND MOTION TO AMEND    \n \n{3} Plaintiffs Motion to Amend includes several related but different \nrequests.  Plaintiffs seek: (1) pursuant to subsection (d) of N.C. R. Civ. P. 15 (“Rule \n15”) to “clarify” that the Third Cause of Action in the Amended Complaint expressly \ndenominated as the Third Cause of Action brought by William A.B. Blythe \n(“Blythe”) individually is, in fact, also a claim of constructive fraud by Drymax \nSports, LLC (“Drymax”) against Robert E. Bell III (“Robert Bell”) despite that there \nare other causes of action expressly denominated as such joint claims; (2) to further \nmodify that Third Cause of Action by adding additional factual allegations to \nsupport the claim that Mr. Bell misused his de facto control; (3) alternatively, \npursuant to Rule 15(a) to file the Second Amended Complaint expressly to state a \nclaim by Drymax against Robert Bell for constructive fraud; (4) to modify \nallegations of the Amended Complaint to conform to Plaintiffs having abandoned \nclaims that the Drymax Operating Agreement was adopted and should be enforced \nas such; (5) to supplement various claims with various factual allegations Plaintiffs \nindicate have occurred since the litigation was initiated, even though several of \nthese facts predate the Amended Complaint; and (6) to modify the prayer for relief \nto include an express request for dissolution in connection with Meiselman claims \nand to request that Blythe receive a capital credit for expenses he has incurred on \nbehalf of Drymax. \n{4} Amendments under Rule 15 are to be decided in the court’s discretion, \nalthough that discretion is not unlimited and should be reasonably exercised with \ndue regard to fairness to the parties in light of the circumstances and timing of the \nproposed amendment.  An absence of demonstrable prejudice caused by an \namendment may militate in favor of allowing the amendment, but other factors may \ndisfavor particularly a late amendment, and especially so where the amendment is \noffered to avoid the court’s ruling on post-discovery motions for summary judgment.  \nCompare Draughon v. Harnett Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 166 N.C. App. 449, 602 S.E.2d \n717 (2004) (supplemental pleadings should be granted absent substantial injustice), \nand Williams v. Craft Dev., LLC , 199 N.C. App. 500, 682 S.Ed.2d 719 (2009) \n(denying motion to amend after hearing on the cross-motions for summary \njudgment).    \n{5} The court has carefully analyzed both the Amended Complaint and the \nproposed Second Amendment in light of these principles so that the exercise of its \ndiscretion would be sound and fully considered.  To do so, it has revisited the \nextensive overall record, including substantial motion practice both before and after \nthe case was assigned to the undersigned, weighed the competing arguments as to \nfairness and the effect of the proposed amendment on trial, balanced Plaintiffs’ fair \nopportunity for trial against Defendants’ potential prejudice, including the loss of \nbenefit of the extensive briefing and motion practice to date, considered the impact \nand necessity, if any, of allowing the amendment in order to provide for \nadmissibility of  evidence developed during discovery based on the Amended \nComplaint, and fully considered the particular briefs and oral argument in regard to \nthe Motion to Amend.  Having done so, the court’s considered judgment is that in \nthe sound exercise of the court’s discretion, the Motion to Amend should be \nDENIED.  \n{6} Without being exhaustive as to all the factors the court took into \nconsideration in this exercise of its discretion, the court highlights certain factors it \nbelieved to be particularly significant.  First, the court believes that the proposed \nSecond Amendment cannot be fairly characterized as merely a technical \namendment, it is much more substantive than that; it is clearly intended to avoid \nthe import of the court’s prior rulings on the pleadings which had been closed, and it \nseeks to avoid any consideration of the fact that Blythe attacks Robert Bell’s misuse \nof control while no longer standing on allegations that Blythe himself had effective \ncontrol over Drymax.  Second, the Amended Complaint already includes allegations \nadequate for Blythe to fully pursue claims on Drymax’s behalf because of alleged \nmisuse of control by Robert Bell or interests he allegedly controls.  Third, the court \nhad carefully studied the various causes of action in the Amended Complaint when \npreparing its earlier orders on the cross-motions for summary judgment and had \nconcluded that the Third Cause of Action for constructive fraud had been \nintentionally stated as an individual claim by Blythe alone, and there is nothing in \nthe Second Amendment which now persuades the court otherwise.  While the \nAmended Complaint admittedly lodged complaints on behalf of Drymax, the court \ndoes not believe it would now be appropriate or fair to allow amendments to \nexpressly state a cause of action which easily could have been, but was not \nexpressly stated as a claim for constructive fraud by Drymax in the earlier \nAmended Complaint.  Fourth, the proposed Second Amended Complaint seeks to do \nmuch more than relabel the Third Cause of Action as being brought jointly by \nBlythe and Drymax.  It seeks to reorder multiple paragraphs of the Amended \nComplaint as well as to add additional allegations intended to force the court to \nmodify its prior ruling on the statute of limitations.  Fifth, the overall timing of the \nproposed amendment must be considered in light of Plaintiffs’ own earlier \ninsistence that the pleadings be closed and the case proceed to trial as early as \npossible.   \n{7} In addition to those factors that militate against the amendment, the \ncourt has carefully considered the potential prejudice to Plaintiffs by denying the \namendment and concluding that there is no prejudice which outweighs those \nfactors.  In particular, the court carefully considered whether allowing the Second \nAmendment is necessary to afford Plaintiffs fair opportunity to introduce evidence \ndeveloped during discovery.  This is not a case where discovery has revealed a new \ncause of action.  Rather, Plaintiffs seek to include in the pleadings themselves post-\nfiling evidentiary factors which they contend prove the causes of action that are \nalready included in the pleadings.  In fact, the court has already considered many, if \nnot all, of these allegations when earlier ruling on the cross-motions for summary \njudgment.   \n{8} As to the request to amend the prayer for relief, the court concludes \nthat it can appropriately fashion relief should Plaintiffs succeed without the need \nfor the amendment.  The court believes that the new express request for dissolution \nreflects the court’s earlier observation that it believes Meiselman remedies may, in \nfact, depend upon the court’s determination that dissolution may be necessary to \nunlock a minority owner’s protectable expectations.  The court concludes that the \nextensive references to Blythe’s Meiselman expectations throughout the Amended \nComplaint are already adequate to support the court’s consideration of dissolution \nshould Blythe persuade the fact finder of his Meiselman rights.  The court believes \nit may also, as necessary, take into consideration Blythe’s expenditures on \nDrymax’s behalf should those facts prove relevant in any of the equitable \nconsiderations the court must take into account.   \n{9} In sum, in the court’s discretion, the Motion to Amend is DENIED. \n \nII. II. II. II.  PLAINTIFFS’ PLAINTIFFS’ PLAINTIFFS’ PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION MOTION MOTION MOTION    FF FFOR RECONSIDERATION OR RECONSIDERATION OR RECONSIDERATION OR RECONSIDERATION    \n \n{10} Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration asks the court to withdraw \nseveral of the determinations of its February 4, 2013 Order, claiming that the court \nhas erred in its legal conclusions in three areas.  First, Plaintiffs ask to withdraw its \ndetermination that Blythe may not individually pursue a breach of fiduciary duty \nclaim against Robert Bell.  The court denies Plaintiffs’ request but elaborates below \non the basis for its determination.  Second, Plaintiffs ask the court to reverse its \ndetermination that Plaintiffs cannot proceed under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1.  The \ncourt refuses that request, and amplifies that in addition to the reasons stated in its \nFebruary 4, 2013 Order, to the extent that Plaintiffs seek to rely on statements \nmade by Hickory Brand, Inc. (“HBI”) to the general public, Plaintiffs have not \ndemonstrated that these statements have proximately caused damage to them, and \nthat Plaintiffs’ effort to recast their causes of action as claims for injury to \ncompetition is late and unavailing.  Third, Plaintiffs request that the court \nwithdraw its determination that claims which seek to enforce the Operational \nAgreement are not governed by the continuing wrong theory.  The court refuses that \nrequest without further comment or discussion.    \n{11} The court now turns to its determination that Blythe cannot proceed \nindividually on a claim for breach of fiduciary duties.  Initially, the court addresses \ntwo sentences from its earlier ruling highlighted in the Motion for Reconsideration. \n{12} First, Plaintiffs suggest that the court did not properly analyze \nBlythe’s individual claims because in paragraph 48 of its February 4, 2013 Order, \nthe court stated that, “[t]he court’s December 10, 2012 Order determined that no \nDrymax member has ever had majority control.”  More correctly, the court should \nhave noted that, “the court’s December 10, 2012 Order determined that no Drymax \nmember has ever owned a majority interest.”  The court’s determination that Blythe \nmay not proceed on an individual fiduciary duty claim does not depend upon a \nfinding that Robert Bell neither owned nor controlled a majority percentage.  It is \nevident from reading the remaining portions of the court’s February 4, 2013 Order, \nincluding but not limited to paragraph 48, that the court recognized and well \nconsidered Blythe’s assertions that Robert Bell owed Blythe individually a fiduciary \nduty, either because he had de facto control and therefore owed the duties of a \nmajority owner, or because Blythe has reposed such trust and confidence in Robert \nBell so as to cede him dominion and control leading to fiduciary obligations. \n{13} Second, Plaintiffs suggest that the court improperly concluded that \nRobert Bell did not have dominion and control adequate to create a particular \nfiduciary duty because of control that Blythe continued to have over Drymax-related \ntrademarks.  In particular, Plaintiffs highlight the court’s statement in paragraph \n49 of its February 4, 2013 Order that “Blythe also admits that he holds the power to \nterminate the use of the Trademarks . . . .”  Importantly, this sentence was in the \ncontext of the court’s consideration whether Blythe had developed a factual record \nadequate to support his claim that a fiduciary duty was owed to him because he had \nimposed trust and confidence to a degree necessary to support such a duty.  In that \nregard, both the objective facts and Blythe’s subjective beliefs are relevant in \nconsidering whether Defendants, in fact, “held all the cards” and Blythe believed \nthat he had ceded dominion and control to them.    \n{14} The record includes substantial evidence that Blythe believed he \nretained certain control despite having earlier assigned trademarks to Drymax.  For \nexample, in Exhibit 131, an e-mail from Blythe to Defendant Nissan Joseph \n(“Joseph”) dated January 27, 2007, Blythe expressed his view that if the Defendants \ndid not wish to proceed with Drymax as he envisioned the company, “tell me now \nand I will take back my technology and brand name and do it on my own.”  Blythe \nreiterated this frustration and his thought that he would take back intellectual \nproperty that he had contributed in paragraph 29 of his October 12, 2012 affidavit.  \nAnd, in his deposition, he admitted that the License and Supply Agreement was \nstill in force in 2007, a point at which presumably Blythe could have taken action to \nterminate that Agreement.  (Blythe Dep. 214:21–217:23).  The record is also clear \nthat neither Blythe nor Drymax actually controls the technology itself, but only the \nDrymax-related trademarks. \n{15} Having noted these potential corrections or clarifications of its prior \nOrder, the court affirms its view that Blythe is not entitled individually to proceed \non a breach of fiduciary duty claim and amplifies the reasoning which leads to this \nconclusion.  Again, it does so in a more abbreviated fashion than it would if writing \nwithout concern for the need for a more immediate ruling.  The court also notes that \nthe issues are addressed in the Motion for Reconsideration in a more thorough \nmanner than they were in Plaintiffs’ very extensive briefs on the cross-motions for \nsummary judgment.   \n{16} Blythe relies heavily on court decisions which afford a minority owner \nof a closely-held corporation an individual right to assert claims which can generally \nonly be maintained by corporations, not shareholders, when there is a market for \nshares.  Likewise, it is now appropriate for the court to consider whether claims \narising in the context of a closely-held corporation should receive some different \nfocus or inquiry in the context of a limited liability company, particularly where the \nclaims depend so heavily on arguments as to what contractual understandings the \nLLC members formed when the LLC was formed.  In fact, here Blythe first claimed \nthat the Drymax Operating Agreement he initially sought to enforce provided him \nnot only protection as a minority owner but had vested him with effective majority \ncontrol. \n{17} The North Carolina Court of Appeals has recognized that, in certain \ninstances, a group of owners of a closely-held corporation may be considered a \nmajority even though neither alone owned a majority interest, and that when their \npower of control is abused in those instances, a minority shareholder may need to be \nallowed to pursue claims individually despite the general rule that claims for harm \nto the corporation must be brought derivatively.  The court does not believe, \nhowever, that the Court of Appeals has determined that the general rule favoring \nderivative actions must be abandoned in all instances so that a minority owner \nalways has a right to proceed individually to assert breach of fiduciary claims for \ninjury to the corporation where the other owners take action as a majority which \ndisagrees with the minority owner’s view as to what best serves the corporation’s \ninterest.  And, even if there were such a rigid rule, which again the court believes \nthere is not, the rule should not necessarily be implemented in the context of a LLC, \nin no small part because of the freedom of contract granted to LLC members to \nobtain minority protections not available to shareholders of the closely-held \ncorporation and because the procedural hurdles which might defeat a derivative \nclaim on behalf of a closely-held corporation might not defeat a derivative claim on \nbehalf of the LLC. \n{18} Rather than itself recounting the line of cases to which the court refers, \nthe court references Judge Horton’s thorough summary in his opinion  in Norman v. \nNash Johnson & Sons’ Farms, Inc. , 140 N.C. App. 390, 537 S.E.2d 248 (2000).  But \nthe court cautions that Norman  and each of the line of cases it discusses should be \nconsidered in light of their particular facts.  It is also particularly significant to \nunderstand the legal factors which led Norman  and its predecessors to relax but not \nabandon the well-settled general principle that a corporate shareholder may not \nbring an individual action for rights accruing to the corporation unless the alleged \nwrongdoer owed the shareholder a special duty or the shareholder suffered an \ninjury separate and distinct from the corporation as stated by the North Carolina \nSupreme Court in Barger v. McCoy Hillard & Parks , 346 N.C. 650, 488 S.E.2d 215 \n(1997) and other cases.  See Russell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina \nCorporation Law § 17-2 (2012).  In those cases, the Court of Appeals recognized that \napplying the general rule would actually disserve the corporation’s interest which \nthe general rule seeks to protect, and defeating the minority’s right in light of the \npeculiar and egregious facts of those cases would champion corporate form over \ninjury to the corporation.  See  140 N.C. App. at 404, 537 S.E.2d at 258.  \n{19} Read consistently with the Barger line of cases, the Norman line of \ncases may be understood to find on their particular facts a “special duty” owed to \nthe minority shareholder, thus satisfying the Barger rule.  It is also noteworthy that \nNorman and other cases which it followed arose in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion.  Id.  at 401–04, 537 S.E.2d at 257–58.  \n{20} Norman also placed some significance on the procedural hurdles \nattendant to a derivative corporate action, and particularly the inflexible \nrequirement of a pre-litigation demand.  Id.  at 405, 537 S.E.2d at 258.  Here, the \nsame considerations do not necessarily prevail when considering a derivative action \non behalf of the LLC.  A LLC member does not face the same inflexible pre-\nlitigation demand requirements attendant to a derivative suit brought on behalf of a \nclosely-held corporation.  Pursuant  to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-8-01(a), a derivative \naction on behalf of a LLC is appropriate if: (i) the plaintiff does not have authority \nto cause the LLC to sue in its own right, (ii) the plaintiff was a member of the LLC \nat the time the action was brought and at other material times; and (iii) the \nmember-plaintiff alleges with particularity the efforts made to obtain the desired \naction from those with authority over actions of the LLC.  Crouse v. Mineo , 189 N.C. \nApp. 232, 244–245, 658 S.E.2d 33, 39 (2008); Mooring Capital Fund, LLC v. \nComstock N.C., LLC , 2009 NCBC LEXIS 32 (N.C. Super. Ct. November 13, 2009).  \nThere is no explicit language that a LLC member must make a written demand on \nthe LLC before filing the derivative action.  See generally , Robinson, supra , § \n34.04(5) n. 86.  A court may employ a liberal standard to find a derivative action on \nbehalf of a LLC has been stated even though the plaintiff made no effort to label it \nas such.  Crouse , 189 N.C. App. at 244–45, 658 S.E.2d at 40; Peak Coastal Ventures, \nLLP v. Sun Trust Bank , 2011 NCBC LEXIS 13 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 5, 2011). \n{21} There are other differences in the statutory requirements for a \nderivative action as between a corporation and a LLC.  The North Carolina \nBusiness Corporation Act § 55-7-41 requires that the derivative plaintiff must be \nable to demonstrate that she fairly represents the interests of the corporation.  \nDefendants sought to impose this standard when they challenged Blythe’s standing \nto bring a derivative action on Drymax’s behalf.  The court rejected Defendants’ \nargument, noting in part, that the North Carolina LLC Act did not incorporate \nthose provisions from the Business Corporation Act.   \n{22} The court also believes that the claims in this case are also factually \ndistinct from those before the North Carolina Court of Appeals in the cases on \nwhich Blythe relies.  Here, the court believes that the derivative claims provide an \neffective vehicle for redressing the wrongs of which Blythe seeks to complain \nindividually, and that the ability to litigate those claims will not be lost or \ncompromised by having them litigated as derivative claims.  Blythe is still free to \npursue his Meiselman claims individually, but the primary wrongs complained of as \nto injury to Drymax corporately can be adequately addressed through the derivative \nclaim.  Blythe has asserted a basis on which he claims that the individual \nDefendants owe a fiduciary duty to Drymax irrespective of whether Blythe succeeds \nin proving that Robert Bell individually had de facto control. 1  \n{23} In sum, for the foregoing reasons, the court continues to conclude that \nBlythe cannot proceed individually on a breach of fiduciary duty claim and the \nMotion for Reconsideration is DENIED. \n \nIII. III. III. III. \n DEFENDANTS’ MOTION T DEFENDANTS’ MOTION T DEFENDANTS’ MOTION T DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO BIFURCATE O BIFURCATE O BIFURCATE O BIFURCATE    \n \n{24} Defendants’ Motion to Bifurcate asks that trial of certain issues related \nto the statute of limitations be bifurcated pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 42(b)(1) and \nthat issues related to punitive damages be bifurcated pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \n1D-30.  The Plaintiffs and the court agree that Defendants have the statutory right \nto bifurcate issues related to punitive damages, and to that extent the Motion to \nBifurcate is GRANTED.  However, as to other issues, in the court’s discretion, the \nMotion to Bifurcate is DENIED. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The evidentiary record suggests that the asserted duties may arise because of Defendants’ various \nroles as members, managers, or directors.  The term “fiduciary” does not expressly appear in the \nNorth Carolina Limited Liability Company Act, but, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-22 imposes obligations \nof good faith and prudence on LLC managers and generally managers, and officers or directors of \nLLCs are thought to have fiduciary duties similar to corporate officers and directors.  Robinson, \nsupra , § 34.04(3).  The issue of manager duties is a bit muddled on the present record.  Drymax’s \nArticles of Organization, Article V, provided that: “[e]xcept as provided in Section 57C-3-20(a) of the \nNorth Carolina General Statutes, the members of the Company shall not be managers by virtue of \ntheir status as members.”  However, the Articles of Organization also did not specify any manager.  \nThe members never formally adopted an Operating Agreement denominated as such.  Section 57C-3-\n20(a) provides that during any period where neither the articles of organization nor an operating \nagreement designates managers, then all members shall be managers.  At the initial meeting of \n“Drymax Sports LLC Shareholders” on January 15, 2004, the members appointed each of the \nindividual members as a Board of Directors who then met as such and designated Blythe as a sole \nmanager but provided that financial and strategic decisions would be made by the Board.  The most \nrecent Drymax Annual Report lists Blythe, Robert Bell and Virginia Bell as Member/Managers and \nHBI as a Member.   \n \nIV. IV. IV. IV.  DEFENDANTS’ DEFENDANTS’ DEFENDANTS’ DEFENDANTS’ DISPOSITIVE MOTION DISPOSITIVE MOTION DISPOSITIVE MOTION DISPOSITIVE MOTION    \n \n{25} Defendants’ Supplemental Dispositive Motion seeks a summary \nadjudication on issues which Defendants contend were first put in a posture for \nsuch ruling by the narrowing of issues by the court’s February 4, 2013 Order, and \nwhich can now be made on the basis of uncontested facts.  In particular, Defendants \nrequest rulings that: (1) Plaintiffs have judicially admitted that the breach of the \nOperational Agreement, if any, first occurred no later than May 2007 so that claims \nrelated to enforcing that agreement are time-barred unless Plaintiffs can prove that \nDefendants are estopped from relying on a statute of limitations defense; (2) if the \nOperational Agreement was ever valid and enforceable, it was also terminable at \nwill and has as a matter of law now been terminated; (3) Blythe’s Meiselman claim \ndoes not support the award of money damages; (4) Plaintiffs’ quasi-contract claims \nmust be dismissed because the Parties were governed either by the Operational \nAgreement or the License and Supply Agreement; and (5) claims against Joseph are \nbarred by the statute of limitations.   \n{26} Defendants correctly note that Plaintiffs have on several instances \ncontended that the Operational Agreement should have been implemented as to the \nsale of socks no later than May 2007.  But Plaintiffs have further forecasted \nevidence adequate to withstand a summary adjudication in that they contend the \nevidence will further show that the Operational Agreement was, in fact, not ready \nto be implemented until a later point in time because of Defendants’ wrongful \nconduct.  The court believes that it must further evaluate Defendants’ argument \nafter Plaintiffs have been given the opportunity to present their trial evidence. \n {27} As explained during the recent hearing on the Supplemental Motions, \nthe court does not believe it should determine summarily whether the Operational \nAgreement was terminated even if it were otherwise valid and enforceable.  While \nDefendants point to evidence that HBI clearly indicated its intent not to implement \nthe Operational Agreement as to the sale of socks, Plaintiffs contend that a \ntermination defense cannot rest on this claim where HBI did so only to \nmisappropriate benefits of that contract for itself.  The court believes that \nDefendants’ termination defense must await resolution at trial in the context of the \noverall evidentiary record. \n{28} As to Defendants’ assertion that Blythe’s Meiselman claim does not \nsupport a monetary award, the court has reviewed Plaintiffs’ proposed jury issues \nand jury instructions, and it does not appear that Plaintiffs contend that the jury \nshould be given a damages issues based on Blythe’s Meiselman claims.  As the court \nexplained during oral argument, it believes that the Meiselman claim is an \nindividual claim separate and apart from the breach of fiduciary duty claims \nbrought derivatively by Drymax, even though they arise from a similar evidentiary \nrecord.  The court reserves its final determination of issues that it, rather than the \njury, is to decide.  But the court continues to believe that the Meiselman claim rests \non its statutory foundation, that the statute as it is presently worded constrains the \ncourt’s equitable powers, and that the court does not have the same broad equitable \npowers granted by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30, at the time of the Meiselman decision \nbecause of a subsequent statutory amendment.  Meiselman v. Meiselman , 309 N.C. \n279, 295, 307 S.E.2d 551, 561 (1983);  High Point Bank & Trust Co. v. Sapona Mfg. \nCo. , 2010 NCBC LEXIS 14, at * 15 n.4 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 22, 2010).    \n{29} As to the quasi-contract claims and claims against Joseph, the court \nbelieves that determination of these issues should also await trial.  \n{30} For these reasons, the Supplemental Motion is DENIED without \nprejudice to the court’s further consideration of the issues to be addressed at trial. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 8th day of April, 2013.   \n "
