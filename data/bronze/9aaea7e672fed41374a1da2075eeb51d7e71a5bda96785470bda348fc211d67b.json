  "raw_text": "PEAK Coastal Ventures, L.L.C. v. SunTrust Bank, 2011 NCBC 13. \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nCOUNTY OF FORSYTH \n \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n10 CVS 6676 \nPEAK COASTAL VENTURES, L.L.C.,  \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv.  \n \nSUNTRUST BANK and THE LAW FIRM \nOF HUTCHENS, SENTER & BRITTON, \n \nDefendants. \n \nORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n \n{1} THIS MATTER is before the Court on the motions to dismiss filed by \nDefendants SunTrust Bank and The Law Firm of Hutchens, Senter, & \nBritton.  After considering the submissions by counsel and hearing oral \narguments, for the reasons described below, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ \nmotions to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety.  \n \nW. Everette Murphrey for Plaintiff. \n  \nWilliams Mullen by Camden R. Webb for Defendant SunTrust Bank.  \n \nThe Law Firm of Hutchens, Senter & Britton, P.A. by Terry Hutchens \nfor Defendant The Law Firm of Hutchens, Senter & Britton, P.A.  \n \nGale, Judge. \n \n{2} Plaintiff PEAK Coastal Ventures , L.L.C. (“PEAK Coastal”) is a \nmember-managed limited liability company, which has no single majority \nmember.  Two minority members, Robert Richardson (“Richardson”) and \nRobert Pope (“Pope”), owning fifty percent (50%) of the company, caused this \naction to be filed in the company’s name to challenge action by its third \nmember Jeffrey Stec (“Stec”) who owns the remaining fifty percent (50%).   \nStec secured two loans in the company’s name from Defendant SunTrust \nBank (“SunTrust”) without written approval of a majority.  Defendant The \nLaw Firm of Hutchens, Senter & Britton, P.A. (“Hutchens, Senter & Britton” \nor the “law firm”) represented PEAK Coastal in those loan transactions.  The \nlarger of the two loans was an acquisition and construction loan, secured by a \ndeed of trust, which has been foreclosed upon pursuant to a final order of the \nClerk of Superior Court of New Hanover County.  The second loan was a line \nof credit facility.  \nThe Court is called upon by these motions to determine in the first \ninstance whether the minority member/managers of a limited liability \ncompany have standing to bring the action in the corporate name, or if not, \nwhether the Complaint, read liberally, states an actionable derivative claim.  \nThe standing issue is amplified by the company’s public filing which shows, \ncontrary to the Complaint’s allegation, that Stec was the only \nmember/manager when the Complaint was filed.  If the Court finds sufficient \nallegations of standing to withstand dismissal, the motions then inquire \nwhether the substantive claims must be dismissed for failure to state a claim \nupon which relief may be granted.  In that regard, Defendants assert that the \nlarger loan cannot be collaterally attacked after a final judicial determination \nof its validity.  As to the line of credit facility, Defendants contend that \ncontract and fiduciary claims must fail, and any unfair and deceptive trade \npractices claim depends on those underlying claims. \nThe Court determines that the minority member/managers do not have \nstanding and they have not stated a derivative claim.  Assuming standing, \nthe Complaint fails to state actionable claims upon which relief may be \ngranted.  Accordingly, the Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety. \n \nI.  Procedural History \n{3} Richardson and Pope, each a minority owner of PEAK Coastal, filed \nthis action in the company’s name in Forsyth County Superior Court on \nSeptember 9, 2010.  The case was designated as a complex business case \nupon Defendant SunTrust’s Notice of Designation.  The Complaint alleges \nthree claims of relief against Defendant SunTrust, including breach of \ncontract, constructive fraud, and unfair and deceptive trade practices, and \none claim against Defendant Hutchens, Senter & Britton, grounded on \nattorney malpractice.  As to the law firm, the Complaint alleges both \nnegligence and gross negligence.  Plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive \ndamages.  On November 12, 2010, in lieu of answer, Defendants filed \nseparate motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), which contend that \nthe minority member/managers had no standing to bring the corporate \naction, and that the claims are, in any event, without substantive merit.  The \nlaw firm additionally challenges venue through its Rule 12(b)(3) motion.  \nPlaintiff ultimately responded to these motions, but sixty-seven (67) days \nafter the deadline.\n  The Court considered the filings and elected not to \nexercise its power under its local rules to grant the motions summarily.  \nDefendant SunTrust filed a timely reply.  The Court heard oral argument on \nDefendants’ motions.  Issues beyond the briefs arose at the hearing.  The \nCourt then invited all parties to submit a supplemental brief on those issues \nand set a deadline for doing so.  Each Defendant timely filed a supplemental \nbrief.  Plaintiff submitted two briefs, both after the deadline.  Again, the \nCourt elected to consider fully Plaintiff’s late submissions. \n \nII. Facts \n{4} The facts stated presume the truth of Plaintiff’s allegations and grant \nPlaintiff favorable inferences, while recognizing that Defendants have \nforecasted that many facts are hotly contested.   \n{5} PEAK Coastal is a North Carolina limited liability company formed on \nDecember 7, 2006.  The Complaint alleges that when the relevant events \noccurred and the lawsuit was filed, the company was owed by three \nmember/managers according to the following share percentages: Stec (50%), \nRichardson (25%), and Pope (25%).  (Compl. ¶ 7.)1  When the company \nformed, its registered office, registered agent, and principal place of business \nwere located in Forsyth County.  When the company’s annual report was \nupdated in 2008, those locations were changed to Iredell County.  Richardson \nand Pope reside in Forsyth County.  The loans at issue were in connection \nwith property located in and a business to be conducted in New Hanover \nCounty and were closed in New Hanover County.  On August 26, 2010, \npursuant to N.C. Gen Stat. § 57-06-03, the North Carolina Secretary of State \nadministratively dissolved the company for its failure to file annual reports.  \nThe company has since been reinstated. \n{6} Defendant SunTrust is a Georgia corporation authorized to transact \nbusiness in North Carolina.  Defendant Hutchens, Senter & Britton is a \nNorth Carolina Professional Association with various law offices in North \nCarolina, including its office in New Hanover County which closed the loan \ntransactions at issue. \n{7} The contract to purchase real prop erty in Wilmington, NC to construct \nan exercise facility was executed on September 21, 2006.  On December 10, \n2006, Stec and Richardson approached SunTrust, requesting a $2.16 million \nloan to purchase and construct the facility.  SunTrust issued a March 14, \n2007 commitment letter stating conditions for the loan.  SunTrust would lend \nthe funds to a limited liability company to be created for the sole purpose of \ndeveloping the project.  (Compl., Ex. A at 1.)  Both Stec and Richardson would \nbe guarantors on the loan.  (Compl., Ex. A at 2.)  As a part of its loan review, \nSunTrust required the company to provide its operating agreement.  (Compl., \nEx. A at 7.)  Richardson provided SunTrust with copies of the PEAK Coastal \nOperating Agreement (“Operating Agreement”).  The Complaint implies that \n                                                 \n1  Defendant Hutchens Senter & Britton offered at oral argument PEAK Coastal’s annual \nreport dated September 23, 2008, which lists Stec as the sole member/manager, and urged \nthe Court to consider this evidence outside the pleadings to determine standing.  As noted \nbelow, the Court finds a lack of standing on other grounds, and in doing so, assumed the \ntruth of the allegation that each of the three members were managers at all relevant times.  \nthe Operating Agreement charged SunTrust and the law firm with \nknowledge that the company could not be bound to a loan contract without \nthe written approval of a majority interest.  (See Compl. ¶ 20.)  \n{8}  PEAK Coastal retained Defendant law firm to handle the title work \nfor the purchase of the real property and to close the loans.  On September \n12, 2007, PEAK Coastal closed on two loans with SunTrust: the $2.16 million \nloan for purchase and construction and a line of credit in the amount of \n$550,000.00.  Stec alone signed all the loan documents as “Authorized \nMember.”  He was the only signatory on the promissory note secured by a \nDeed of Trust pledging the real property as collateral for the two loans. \n{9} PEAK Coastal’s Operating Agreement 2 contains two paragraphs which \ncontrol the managers’ authority to take action on the company’s behalf.  The \nfirst paragraph of provision 3.1 states, in part: “At any time when there is \nmore than one Manager: (i) any one Manager may take any action permitted \nto be taken by the Managers, unless the approval of more than one of the \nManagers is expressly required pursuant to this Agreement or the [N.C. \nLimited Liability Company] Act . . . .”  The next paragraph of the same \nprovision states that for any action: \n  \nNo individual Manager, nor any number of Managers that is \nless than 51% of the Managers in the Company (by virtue of \ntheir percentage of membership interest . . .)  is/are authorized \nto bind the Company, contractually, on any matter in which the \nCompany incurs any liability of any type without a majority \napproval of the Managers. \n \n(See Operating Agreement, Article III- Right and Duties of Managers 3.1.)   \n                                                 \n2  The parties discuss provisions of the PEAK Coastal Operating Agreement.  Plaintiff \nspecifically refers to it in the Complaint.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 6, 20 , 23, 24.)  The Court believes \nthat the Operating Agreement is an inherent part of the Complaint’s allegations and that its \nprovisions can be reviewed on the Rule 12(b)(6) motion without converting it to a Rule 56 \nsummary judgment motion.  See Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60, 554 \nS.E.2d 840, 847 (2001). \n \n{10} Plaintiff alleges on information an d belief that neither SunTrust’s loan \nofficer nor the closing attorney read the Operating Agreement, and that they \nimproperly allowed the loans to close with only Stec executing the loan \ndocuments for PEAK Coastal.  The Complaint alleges that SunTrust acted \n“negligently” by failing to follow its own guidelines and allowing a single \nmember to sign for the loans in violation of the Operating Agreement.  \n(Compl. ¶ 23.) \n{11} After the closing, Stec ordere d a $250,000.00 draw on the new line of \ncredit.  The law firm’s closing attorney wrote the check from the law firm’s \ntrust account payable to Redline Holdings, LLC (“Redline”).  Plaintiff alleges, \nupon information and belief, that Redline is solely owned by Stec and neither \nhas any ownership interest in nor is owed any obligation by PEAK Coastal.  \nRichardson and Pope disclaim knowing that the credit line extended to PEAK \nCoastal would be used to fund Redline.  Plaintiff claims that SunTrust \nimproperly approved this loan without requisite authority from a majority \ninterest of PEAK Coastal.  (Compl. ¶ 24.)  \n{12} The Complaint additionally asserts that the closing attorney knew that \nthe site PEAK Coastal would use for its exercise facility was burdened by a \ndrainage and utility easement for the City of Wilmington measuring fifty (50) \nfeet.  The easement was not removed before the closing. \n{13} SunTrust foreclosed on the encumbered property.  The Clerk of \nSuperior Court of New Hanover County issued an Order Allowing \nForeclosure on March 3, 2009, in a special proceeding styled \nIn the Matter of \nthe Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by PEAK Coastal Ventures, LLC, \nRecorded in Book 5231, Pages 134, et seq. on September 13, 2007 in the New \nHanover County Registry, by Jerry A. Mannen, Jr., Appointed Substitute \nTrustee by Instrument Recorded in Book 5367, Pages 2294, et seq. in the \nNew Hanover County Registry, No. 09 SP 119 (“Foreclosure Proceeding”).  In \nits order, the Clerk found that the debt on which SunTrust sought to foreclose \nwas valid and that PEAK Coastal had adequate notice of the date and time of \nthe hearing as required by law.  Order Allowing Foreclosure on Deed of \nTrust, ¶¶ 6, 13 (N.C. Super Ct., Mar. 3, 2009).  PEAK Coastal did not appeal \nthe Clerk’s findings, which then became final.  Plaintiff now asks the Court to \nset aside the foreclosure based on its allegations that the underlying debt was \ninvalid.  The foreclosure proceeding did not involve the letter of credit.      \n       \nIII. Legal Standard \n{14} In order for the Court to have su bject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff \nmust have standing to bring the claim.  See Coker v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., \n172 N.C. App. 386, 391, 617 S.E.2d 306, 310 (2005).  “Standing refers to \nwhether a party has a sufficient stake in an otherwise justiciable controversy \nso as to properly seek an adjudication of the matter.”  Woodring v. Swieter, \n180 N.C. App. 362, 366, 637 S.E.2d 269, 274 (2006) (internal quotations \nomitted).  “A party has standing to initiate a lawsuit if he is a real party in \ninterest . . . .  A real party in interest is a party who is benefitted or injured \nby the judgment in the case, . . . [and] by substantive law has the legal right \nto enforce the claim in question.”  Mitchell, Brewer, Richardson, Adams \nBurge & Boughman, PLLC v. Brewer, ___ N.C. App. ___, 705 S.E.2d 757, 765 \n(2011) (internal quotations omitted).  If a party lacks standing to initiate an \naction, then the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear the matter, \nand the claims must be dismissed.3  See Coker, 172 N.C. App. at 391, 617 \nS.E.2d at 310.  In Mangum v. Raleigh Bd. of Adjustment, the North Carolina   \nSupreme Court stated that when examining standing, allegations should be \nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff whose standing has been \nchallenged.  362 N.C. 640, 644, 669 S.E.2d 279, 283 (2008).   \n The Court of Appeals has stat ed the Rule 12(b)(6) standard \nwhen the motion to dismiss challenges the standing of a member of a \n                                                 \n3  Standing can be raised pursuant to either Rule 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6).  The Defendants have \nnot brought a motion under Rule 12(b)(1).  A Court has inherent authority to examine its \njurisdiction on its own initiative and, if necessary, can look beyond the pleadings to resolve a \njurisdictional issue. \nlimited liability company which has brought a direct corporate action.  \nThe standard inquires: \n \nWhether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, \ntreated as true, are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief \nmay be granted under some legal theory, whether properly \nlabeled or not.  In ruling upon such a motion, the complaint is to \nbe liberally construed, and the court should not dismiss the \ncomplaint unless it appears beyond doubt that [the] plaintiff \ncould prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would \nentitle him to relief.  Rule 12(b)(6) generally precludes dismissal \nexcept in those instances where the face of the complaint \ndiscloses some insurmountable bar to recovery. \n \nCrouse v. Mineo, 189 N.C. App. 232, 237, 658 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2008) (internal \nquotations and citations omitted).  “When considering a motion under Rule \n12(b)(6), the court is not required to accept as true any conclusions of law or \nunwarranted deductions of fact in the complaint.”  Branch Banking & Trust \nCo. v. Lighthouse Fin. Corp., 2005 NCBC 3 ¶ 8 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 13, \n2005).  \n \nIV. Motions to Dismiss \nA. Attack on Standing \n{15} Defendant Hutchens, Senter & Br itton argues that Richardson and \nPope lack authority to bring this suit because: (1) they are not \nmember/managers authorized to bring the action on behalf of the company; \n(2) they have not stated a claim for derivative relief; and (3) they cannot \ncomply with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-6-04, which governs the winding up of a \ndissolved LLC. \n \n1. Authority to Bring a Direct Corporate Action \n{16} For Richardson and Pope to have standing to bring a direct action on \nthe company’s behalf, the record must contain facts that, if accepted as true, \nwould demonstrate that they are so authorized.  Hutchens, Senter & Britton \nfirst argues that Richardson and Pope were not in the first instance \nmanagers of PEAK Coastal when the Complaint was filed, and then \nnecessarily had no authority to act as managers.  The law firm relies on the \ncompany’s annual report on file at the time of the Complaint, which lists Stet \nas the sole member/manager.  In direct contrast, Plaintiff’s Complaint and \nsupplemental briefing state that Richardson and Pope were managers at the \ntime the Complaint was filed.  (Compl. ¶ 1; Supplemental Mem. of Pl. PEAK \nCoastal Ventures, LLC Regarding the Issues Before the Court on March 24, \n2011 and Why Def. SunTrust Bank’s Mot. to Dismiss Should be Denied 3.)  At \noral argument, Plaintiff suggested that Stec improperly and unilaterally \nchanged the official record of the company’s membership and handed the \nCourt a Certificate of Reinstatement issued by the North Carolina Secretary \nof State’s Office showing that the company was reinstated on March 10, 2011, \non the application of Richardson.\n4    \n{17} In light of the direct allegations in the Complaint, the Court believes \nthat the \nMangum standard, which mandates a liberal reading of the record \non plaintiff’s behalf, does not allow dismissal of the complaint on the sole \nground that Richardson and Pope were not managers and therefore had no \nauthority.  The determinative issue here is whether, as managers, they had \nauthority to authorize suit when they do not own a majority interest.5\n                                                 \n4  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-25 allows third parties dealing with a limited liability company to \n“rely conclusively upon its most recent annual report . . . on file with the Secretary of State \nas to the identity of its managers, except to the extent the person has actual knowledge that \na person identified therein as a manager is not a manager.”  This rule provides an efficient \nmechanism for firms doing business with companies to determine corporate governance.  \nBecause the Court resolves the standing issue on other grounds, it need not resolve any issue \nof whether the statutory presumption is overcome when the party relying on the statute had \nactual knowledge that the annual report is inconsistent with the company’s operating \nagreement. \n \n5  Hutchens, Senter & Britton argues that provision 3.2 of the Operating Agreement lists \nonly Stec and Richardson as managers so that there could be no majority without Stec’s \nparticipation.  However, Schedule A of the Operating Agreement lists all three men as \n{18} This then leads to Defendant Hutchens, Senter & Britton’s further \nargument in the alternative that the Operating Agreement requires a fifty-\none percent (51%) ownership interest to initiate any lawsuit on PEAK \nCoastal’s behalf, and the Complaint must be dismissed because the \nComplaint itself discloses that the two minority members do not together own \nthe requisite percentage.  Plaintiff acknowledges that a group representing a \nfifty-one (51%) membership interest is required to bind the company \ncontractually.  (\nSee Operating Agreement ¶ 3.1.)  Indeed, that is the basis of \nthe challenge to the loan agreements.  But Plaintiff argues that this provision \ndoes not control the right of the minority members to bring this action.  The \nCourt has struggled to define the basis on which Richardson and Pope assert \ntheir authority to bring the action in the name of the corporation.  It appears \nthat they argue, without reference to the Operating Agreement but relying on \nCrouse v. Mineo, 189 N.C. App. 232, 658 S.E.2d 33 (2008), that there is “an \ninherent right for minority members to sue on behalf of the corporation to \nprotect their individual interests . . . .”  (Pl.’s Resp. Br. 4.)  \nCrouse did not \nestablish such an inherent right.  It recognized a default statutory right of a \nmajority of managers that can be overridden by an operating agreement as a \nmatter of contract.  While Richardson and Pope may together constitute a \nmajority of the managers that would have statutory rights in the absence of a \ncontrary operating agreement, here there is such an agreement and it \nrequires a majority of ownership which they do not have. \n{19} In Crouse, the North Carolina Court of Appeals considered whether \none of two member/managers with equal ownership of a limited liability \ncompany had standing to bring a suit on behalf of the corporation.  See 189 \nN.C. App. 232, 237, 658 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2008).  The plaintiff relied on agency \nprinciples contained in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-23 to argue that a manager \n                                                                                                                                                 \nmember/managers, and as noted, the Complaint alleges that PEAK Coastal had three \nmember/managers when the suit was filed. \n \nhas “inherent authority to authorize lawsuits to protect the LLC’s interests.”  \nId.  The Court determined that filing a lawsuit is a management decision not \nrelated to the company’s usual course of business.  See id. at 239, 658 S.E.2d \nat 37.  “An act of a manager that is not apparently for carrying on the usual \ncourse of the business of the limited liability company does not bind the \n[LLC] unless authorized in fact or ratified by the limited liability company.”  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-3-23. \n{20} The Court noted that limited  liability companies are primarily \ncreatures of contract, and the default provisions of Chapter 57C of the North \nCarolina General Statutes (“the LLC Act”) “can be changed in virtually any \nway the parties wish . . . .”  \nId. at 237, 658 S.E.2d at 36 (quoting Russell M. \nRobinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporate Law § 34.01, at 34-2−34-\n3 (rev.7th ed. 2006)).  Because there was no written operating agreement that \nwould govern the dispute, however, the Court looked to the default provisions \nof the LLC Act to determine who could make a management decision.  \nSee id.   \nUnder the statute, to be authorized, “management decisions shall require the \napproval, consent, agreement, or ratification of a majority of the managers.”  \nN.C. Gen. Stat § 57C-3-20(b).  As a result, Crouse, as one of two managers, \ndid not have authority to bring suit in the corporate name.   \nUnlike Crouse, Richardson and Pope do constitute a majority of the \nmembers.  But, the Operating Agreement, unlike the default statutory \nprovision, does not authorize management by a majority of members; it \nrequires a majority of ownership. \n{21} In attacking SunTrust and the la w firm, Richardson and Pope rely on \nProvision 3.1 of the Operating Agreement, which states that on “any action,” \nno “number of Managers that is less than 51% of the Managers in the \nCompany (by virtue of the percentage membership interest . . .) . . . are \nauthorized to bind the Company, contractually, on any manner in which the \nCompany incurs any liability of any type without a majority approval of the \nManagers.”   \nRichardson and Pope apparently rely on another provision of the same \nsection to argue that they have authority to initiate litigation in the \ncompany’s name even though they do not own a majority interest.  As noted, \nthe opening paragraph to Section 3.1 states, in part: “At any time when there \nis more than one Manager: (i) any one Manager may take any action \npermitted to be taken by the Managers, unless the approval of more than one \nof the Managers is expressly required pursuant to this Agreement or the Act . \n. . .”  (Operating Agreement 3.1.)  The Court concludes that this language \nmust be read in harmony with the prior sentence, which allows managers to \nmake decisions and perform acts “customary or incident to the management \nof the Company’s Business.”  (Operating Agreement 3.1.)  As recognized by \nCrouse, filing a lawsuit is not an act that relates to the normal business \noperations of the company.  It follows that the opening paragraph to Section \n3.1 does not control Richardson and Pope’s authority, but rather the filing of \nsuit falls within the provisions of the Operating Agreement that require a \nmajority ownership interest.6   \n{22} Provision 3.1 should control even  if filing a suit is not expressly \nmentioned in that provision as a contract imposing liability on the \ncorporation, therefore requiring the approving of a majority of ownership \ninterest.   As corporations cannot represent themselves in a lawsuit, PEAK \nCoastal must obtain legal counsel to file suit.  In order to obtain counsel, \nundoubtedly, the company must enter into a contract with its attorney \nresulting in liability.  In order to authorize the suit, the managers must \nauthorize the contract to gain legal services.     \n The Court also notes that the terms of the Operating Agreement alter \nthe method for calculating a “majority” from a simple majority of managers to \na weighted majority of the managers “by virtue of their percentage \n                                                 \n6  Furthermore, interpreting that language to allow individual managers to initiate a lawsuit \nwould create a practical dilemma.  If any manager can take any action that managers are \npermitted to take, then once a lawsuit is filed by any member, any other member could act \nfor the corporation to dismiss it. \nmembership interest.”  (Operating Agreement 3.1.)  Under these terms, and \nwith the membership allotment described in the Complaint, Stec must \nparticipate in the decision to authorize a lawsuit.  The Complaint makes \nclear that he did not. \n{23} In sum, Richardson and Pope had no authority as managers to file a \ndirect corporate action. \n \n2. Standing for a Derivative Action \n{24} For Richardson and Pope to have brought an actionable derivative \nclaim, the record must contain facts that, if accepted as true, would \ndemonstrate that they complied with N.C. Gen Stat. § 57C-8-01.  In order for \na member of a limited liability company to bring a shareholder’s derivative \naction, (1) the plaintiff must be without authority to cause the limited \nliability company to sue in its own right, and (2) the plaintiff must be “a \nmember of the limited liability company at the time of bringing the action, \nand . . . [must be] a member . . . at the time of the transaction of which the \nplaintiff complains . . . .”  N.C. Gen Stat. § 57C-8-01 (a).  Additionally, “[t]he \ncomplaint shall allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the \nplaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the managers, \ndirectors, or other applicable authority and the reasons for the plaintiff's \nfailure to obtain the action, or for not making the effort.”  N.C. Gen Stat. § \n57C-8-01 (b).  Finally, Rule 23(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil \nProcedure requires that a complaint alleging a derivative action be verified. \n{25} Richardson and Pope satisfy the first element of N.C. Gen Stat. § 57C-\n8-01 (a) based on the Court’s determination that they were without authority \nto cause PEAK Coastal to initiate this suit.  They satisfy the second element \nof the statute by their allegation that Richardson and Pope were \nmember/managers of PEAK Coastal at relevant times.  (\nSee Compl. ¶¶ 1, 7, \n16, 11, 20.)7  Even so, in order to allow this action to proceed as a derivative \naction, the Court must find in the Complaint the particular efforts \nRichardson and Pope undertook to obtain the action they desired.  See N.C. \nGen Stat. § 57C-8-01 (b).  The Court has utilized the liberal approach in \nCrouse, which recognized that courts may find allegations in the Complaint \nthat could support a derivative action even though a plaintiff did not intend \nto proceed derivatively and did not expressly make the allegations in the \ncontext of a derivative action.  See 189 N.C. App. at 244, 658 S.E.2d at 40.  \nThose allegations are not there.  The Complaint alleges that Defendants \nallowed two loans to be closed by one member of the company in violation of \nthe company’s Operating Agreement, that Richardson and Pope were not \n“aware of or invited” to the closing, and that Defendants allowed a \n$250,000.00 check to be paid out of the newly established line of credit to \nStec’s Redline Holdings, LLC.  (Compl. ¶¶ 20, 23, 24.)  There is no mention of \nthe members demanding that Stec reimburse the company or authorize the \nsuit.  Plaintiff never alleges that Richardson and Pope even asked Stec to \nexplain his actions.  The Complaint does not satisfy the requirements of N.C. \nGen. Stat. §57C-8-01. \n{26} Additionally, Richardson and Pope  failed to verify the Complaint, so \nthat it does not meet the Rule 23(b) requirement. \n{27} In sum, the Complaint does not state an actionable derivative claim.      \n \n3. Plaintiff’s alleged failure to comply  \nwith N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-6-04 \n{28} Finally, Hutchens, Senter & Britton repackages its standing argument \nas a statutory claim under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-6-04.  It argues that \nRichardson and Pope lack the authority to bring this action because they \nwere not managers when the suit was filed and the company was then in \n                                                 \n7  The Complaint does not specifically allege they were such managers at the time the \nComplaint was filed, but that is the clear inference, which Plaintiff has clearly stated in its \nbriefs and oral argument.  The Court accepts for purposes of this motion that there are \nadequate pleadings to support this element. \ndissolution.  The Secretary of State administratively dissolved PEAK Coastal \non August 26, 2010.  The filing of a certificate of dissolution by the Secretary \nof State causes the limited liability company to be dissolved, and “its affairs \nshall be wound up.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-6-01 (5).  Absent a provision in the \noperating agreement or articles of organization to the contrary, only the \nmanagers of a company may wind up a company’s affairs on dissolution.  N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 57C-6-04.  Neither PEAK Coastal’s Operating Agreement nor its \narticles of organization alter that statutory provision.  Plaintiff filed the \nComplaint two weeks after its administrative dissolution.     \n{29} The law firm again relies on the annual report on file when Plaintiff \ninitiated the lawsuit, which lists Stet as its only manager, and argues that \nthe annual report conclusively establishes Stec as the only manager of the \ncompany.  Because Stec did not authorize the action as part of the business’s \nwinding up, it urges the Court to dismiss the Complaint for Plaintiff’s failure \nto comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57C-6-04.     \n{30} This argument fails for the same reasons as described above.  The \nCourt has accepted for purposes of these motions that Richardson and Pope \nwere managers of PEAK Coastal at all relevant times.   \n \n{31} In sum, Defendant Hutchens Senter ’s motion to dismiss for Plaintiff’s \nlack of standing is GRANTED on the grounds that no direct corporate action \nwas authorized by managers representing a majority in interest and the \nComplaint states no actionable derivative claim. \n  \nB. Motion to Dismiss for Improper Venue \n{32} Defendant Hutchens, Senter & Br itton moved to dismiss pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(3) for improper venue.  Plaintiff contends that venue in Forsyth \nCounty is proper in this action pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 1-79 and 1-82 \nbecause two of Plaintiff’s member/managers reside there.  Defendant law \nfirm argues that the Court must apply N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-76 because \nPlaintiff seeks to recover title to real property.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-76 \nrequires that actions for the “[r]ecovery of real property, . . .  or for the \ndetermination in any form of such right or interest” must be tried in the \ncounty in which the real property lies.  “Pursuant to this statute, an action \nmust be tried in the county where the property is located when the judgment \nto which a plaintiff would be entitled upon the allegations of the complaint \nwill affect the title to land.”  Fox Holdings, Inc. v. Wheatley Oil Co., 161 N.C. \nApp. 47, 52, 587 S.E.2d 429, 432 (2003).  Through its breach of contract claim, \nPlaintiff asks the Court to set aside the SunTrust foreclosure, arguing there \nis no valid note upon which to sue.  If Plaintiff were to succeed in this cause \nof action, its relief would undue the foreclosure, thereby affecting title to real \nproperty located in New Hanover County.  An action containing Plaintiff’s \ncollateral attack on a foreclosure in New Hanover County cannot be brought \nin Forsyth County.  \nThe Rule 12(b)(3) motion is mooted by the Court’s ruling on the Rule \n12(b)(6) motions.  While the Court believes venue is improper as to any action \nto set aside the foreclosure, if venue were the sole dispositive issue, the Court \nwould be inclined either to deny the motion because the claim regarding the \nforeclosure is being dismissed, or, alternatively, to consider its authority to \ntransfer venue while maintaining the case under the authority granted to the \nBusiness Court.   \n \nC. Breach of Contract Claim Against SunTrust \n{33} Defendant SunTrust moves to dism iss Plaintiff’s breach of contract \nclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  “The elements of a claim for breach of \ncontract are: (1) existence of a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms of \nthat contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000).  \nIn order for Plaintiff to support its claim for breach of contract, it must \nidentify an agreement between it and SunTrust, and it must demonstrate \nthat SunTrust failed to perform a duty arising under that agreement.  The \nCourt has separately examined the Complaint with respect to SunTrust’s \nattack on the line of credit agreement and the acquisition and construction \nagreement.  As to both, Plaintiff’s claims are founded upon the premise that \nStec had no authority to enter a contract on behalf of PEAK Coastal.  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 23, 26.)  It alleges that any contract executed on the company’s \nbehalf with Defendant SunTrust cannot be valid.  However, that issue has \nbeen finally resolved judicially as to the acquisition and construction loan. \n{34} As to the line of credit agreem ent, which was not the subject of the \nforeclosure action, SunTrust asserts that it cannot be liable for breach of \ncontract if the Court accepts the Complaint’s allegation that there was no \nvalid contract.  That is, the Complaint’s attack on the line of credit as an \ninvalid contract precludes the inconsistent assertion that SunTrust breached \nits obligations under such a contract.   \nThe Complaint identifies Defendant SunTrust’s breach as its continued \nviolation of “the terms and conditions of the Operating Agreement by \nallowing and instructing that all documents be signed by Jeff Stec only and \nalso in the credit line loan the bank authorized the issuance of a $250,000.00 \ncheck off said credit line made payable to Redline Holdings, LLC.”  (Compl. ¶ \n24.)  However, SunTrust was not a party to the company’s Operating \nAgreement.  The only agreements with SunTrust that Plaintiff identifies in \nthe Complaint are “contract[s] for the loans which included \npurchase/construction and line of credit to [PEAK Coastal] for their [sic] \nbusiness plan.”  (Compl. ¶ 22.)  There are no allegations that SunTrust \nbreached any duty arising under those agreements.  In fact, there is no \ndispute that SunTrust provided the funds it contemplated in its commitment \nletters.  As Plaintiff fails to allege SunTrust’s breach of any mutual \nagreement, its breach of contract claim as it relates to the line of credit \nagreement must fail.8\n{35} As to the purchase and constructi on loan, Defendant SunTrust argues \nthat Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim is barred by res judicata.  PEAK \nCoastal alleges that its contract with SunTrust is invalid, and it asks the \nCourt “to have the foreclosure set aside because one of the issues of any \nforeclosure is [that] there exists a ‘valid note.’”  (Compl. ¶ 26.)  SunTrust \nshows that the validity of the $2.1 million debt for purchase and construction \nwas established in a foreclosure proceeding in New Hanover County, and it \nargues that the ruling of the Clerk of Superior Court as to its validity bars \nPEAK Coastal from relitigating the validity of the underlying debt. \n When a party proceeds with a forecl osure sale pursuant to a deed of \ntrust, “issues decided thereunder as to the validity of the debt . . . are res \njudicata and cannot be relitigated.  Phil Mechanic Constr. Co. v. Haywood, 72 \nN.C. App. 318, 322, 325 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1985).  The doctrine of res judicata \nrequires: (1) a final judgment on the merits; (2) identity of the cause of action \nin both the prior and present suit; and (3) identity of parties or their privies \nin both suits.     \nHere, there is no dispute that on March 3, 2009, the Clerk of Superior \nCourt of New Hanover County entered an Order Allowing Foreclosure of \nDeed of Trust, in which the Clerk found that the loan by SunTrust in the \noriginal face amount of $2.16 million “is a valid debt of which SunTrust, as \nholder, is seeking foreclosure of the Deed of Trust.”  Order Allowing \nForeclosure on Deed of Trust, ¶¶ 1, 6 (N.C. Super Ct., Mar. 3, 2009).  “A \njudgment entered by a clerk of the Superior Court in a special proceeding in \nwhich such clerk has jurisdiction, will stand as a judgment of the court, if not \nexcepted to and reversed or modified on appeal, as allowed by statute.”  \nIn re \n                                                 \n8  If the breach of contract allegation related to the purchase and construction loan were not \ngoverned by the res judicata analysis below, the Court believes the claim would fail based on \nthe analysis above. \nAtkinson-Clark Canal Co., 234 N.C. 374, 377, 67 S.E.2d 276, 276 (1951).  The \nclerk entered a judgment on the merits.  After the ten (10) day appeal period \nexpired without appeal, a foreclosure sale took place.  (See Mem. of Law in \nSupp. of Def. SunTrust Bank’s Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. B.)  When plaintiffs do \nnot “perfect an appeal of the order of the Clerk of Superior Court, the clerk’s \norder is binding and plaintiffs are estopped from arguing those same issues . . \n. .”   Phil Mechanic Constr. Co, 72 N.C. App. at 322, 325 S.E.2d at 3.  PEAK \nCoastal’s failure to appeal the clerk’s decision made the judgment final. \n{36} Though contained within a brea ch of contract claim, Plaintiff \nchallenges the validity of its debt under the acquisition and construction \nloan.  This is the same issue decided in the foreclosure proceeding.  Both \nPEAK Coastal and SunTrust were parties both to the foreclosure action and \nto this suit.  Thus, the doctrine of \nres judicata bars Plaintiff’s attempt to \nchallenge the validity of the $2.16 million debt. \n{37} At oral argument, Plaintiff nevertheless invited the Court to exercise \nits equitable power to undue the foreclosure through Plaintiff’s collateral \nattack.  The Court has no such power.  If \nthe trustee faithfully performs his duties under the power of sale \nthen there is no irregularity in the sale which would allow a \ncourt of equity to set aside the sale.  “It is a uniform rule that \nwhere a decree of foreclosure has been rendered and a sale of \nproperty has been made thereunder, it cannot be attacked \ncollaterally and the title thus acquired overthrown, except on \nthe ground that the sale was void.” \n55 Am. Jur. 2d Mortgages \nSec. 830 (1971). \n \nGriffin v. Roberts, 88 N.C. App. 734, 737, 364 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1988).   \n   \nD. Constructive Fraud Claim Against SunTrust \n{38} Defendant SunTrust moves to di smiss Plaintiff’s constructive fraud \nclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Constructive fraud “arises where a \nconfidential or fiduciary relationship exists, which has led up to and \nsurrounded the consummation of the transaction in which a [party] is alleged \nto have taken advantage of his position of trust to the hurt of the [claimant].”  \nForbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, 528, 649 S.E.2d 382, 388 (2007) (internal \ncitations omitted).  Plaintiff alleges that it and SunTrust were fiduciaries \nwith respect to the commercial loan closing in which they participated.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 30−31.)  A fiduciary relationship exists where “there has been \nspecial confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound \nto act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing \nconfidence.”  \nBranch Banking & Trust Co. v. Thompson, 107 N.C. App. 53, 60 \n418 S.E.2d 694, 699 (1992).  An “ordinary debtor-creditor relationship \ngenerally does not give rise to such special confidence: the mere existence of a \ndebtor-creditor relationship . . . does not create a fiduciary relationship.”  Id. \nat 61, 418 S.E.2d at 699 (internal quotations and brackets removed). \n Plaintiff has pled no circumstances that would require SunTrust to act \nwith regard to the interests of PEAK Coastal.  The two were parties to a \ncontract in which SunTrust had a duty to lend money, and PEAK Coastal had \na duty to repay that sum with interest.  SunTrust’s alleged knowledge of \nPEAK Coastal’s business plan is standard in the banking industry as part of \nnecessary due diligence.  This knowledge alone does not give rise to a \nrelationship that imparts a fiduciary duty.  Because Plaintiff has failed to \nplead facts from which the Court could find that a fiduciary relationship \nbetween PEAK Coastal and SunTrust existed, Plaintiff’s constructive fraud \nclaim cannot survive.  \n \nE. Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Claim Against SunTrust  \n{39} SunTrust moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s unfair and deceptive trade \npractices claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  To prove unfair and deceptive \ntrade practices, a plaintiff must show: (1) that the defendant committed an \nunfair or deceptive act or practice; (2) which was in or affecting commerce; \nand (3) the plaintiff was damaged by the act.  \nFirst Atlantic Mort. Corp. v. \nDunlea Realty Co., 131 N.C. App. 242, 252, 507 S.E.2d 56, 63 (1998).  Under \nN.C. Gen Stat. § 75-1.1, “a trade practice is unfair if it is immoral, unethical, \noppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to customers.  A trade \npractice is deceptive if it has the capacity or tendency to deceive.”  Thompson, \n107 N.C. App. at 61, 418 S.E.2d at 700 (internal quotations and citations \nomitted).  A mere breach of contract, even if intentional, cannot support a \nclaim for unfair and deceptive trade practices absent substantial aggravating \ncircumstances.  Id. at 62, 418 S.E.2d at 700.  The Court agrees that Plaintiff \nhas not pled any aggravating circumstances that would elevate a normal \nbreach of contract dispute to a claim covered by N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1.  A \nloan officer making a mistake in not reading PEAK Coastal’s Operating \nAgreement is not such a circumstance.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 23, 34.)   \nPlaintiff argues in its supplemental filings that SunTrust committed an \nunfair and deceptive trade practice by “inequitably asserting [its] superior \npower while dealing with a subset of the population known to be necessitous \nand less sophisticated than borrowers in the prime market.”  (Supplemental \nMem. of Pl. PEAK Coastal Ventures, LLC Regarding the Issues Before the \nCourt on March 24, 2011 and Why Def. SunTrust Bank’s Mot. to Dismiss \nShould Be Denied 10.)  Plaintiff also acknowledges in that supplemental \nmemorandum that Richardson and Pope are general contractors and that \nStec is a “business man who ran numerous exercise clubs throughout North \nCarolina,” and admits its allegation that SunTrust “negligently” failed to \nfollow the Operating Agreement when allowing the loans to close is no more \nthan an allegation of simple negligence.  (Supplemental Mem. of Pl. PEAK \nCoastal Ventures, LLC Regarding the Issues Before the Court on March 24, \n2011 and Why Def. SunTrust Bank’s Mot. to Dismiss Should Be Denied 10.)  \nThere is no adequate pleading of misuse of superior power that rises to the \nlevel of an actionable claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices.  \n \n{40} In sum, for the various reasons st ated, Defendant SunTrust’s motion to \ndismiss the Complaint is GRANTED.  \n \nF. Other claims \n{41} At oral argument and in supplemental filings, both Defendants made \nadditional arguments to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims.  In order to rule on these \nissues, the Court would have to but will not consider facts beyond those \nalleged in the Complaint.   \n \nV. Conclusion \n{42} For the reasons noted above, it is HEREBY ORDERED that the \nComplaint is dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.  \n \n This, 5th day of May, 2011.  \n \n \n \n \n \n       "
