THIS MATTER is before the Court on Defendant Vincent Sabatino’s (“Mr. \nSabatino”) motion for summary judgment (the “Motion”) filed on May 19, 2017 .  \nHaving considered the Motion, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel at a hearing \nheld on February 5, 2018 , the Court DENIES the Motion and GRANTS summary \njudgment in favor of Plaintiff Micro Miniature Bearing Co., Inc. for the reasons stated \nherein. \nPope McMillan, P.A., by William A. Long, Jr. and Constantine H. \nKutteh, II, for Plaintiff. \n \nFitzgerald Litigation, by Andrew L. Fitzgerald and D. Stuart Punger, for \nDefendants. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n \n2. This consolidated action arises out of a dispute between Micro Miniature \nBearing Co., Inc. (“MMB”) and its former employees, including Mr. Sabatino and his \nwife, Shawn Barnett -Sabatino (“Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino”), who was also a minority \nshareholder in MMB.  Following the death of MMB’s founder in 2015, disagreements \narose between MMB and its  employees and shareholders  regarding MMB’s \noperations, which eventually resulted in MMB terminating  Mr. Sabatino and other \nemployees.  Thereafter, MMB and Mr. Sabatino, through their respective  counsel, \nnegotiated a possible transfer of certain domain names from Mr. Sabatino to MMB.  \nMr. Sabatino alleges that these negotiations resulted in a binding agreement that \nobligated MMB to purchase  four domain names from Mr. Sabatino for a total of  \n$16,000, but that MMB has refused to fulfil its contractual obligations.   In addition \nto the action filed by Mr. Sabatino, Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino brought claims against \nMMB in a separate action, and MMB filed an action against Mr. Sabatino, Mrs. \nBarnett-Sabatino, other former employee-shareholders, and a company formed by the \nindividual Defendants.  Following settlement of the claims filed by Mrs. Barnett -\nSabatino and MMB, ( see ECF Nos. 77 –78), and the subsequent dismissal of those \nclaims, (ECF No. 79), the only issue rema ining for determination is whether MMB \nbecame contractually obligated to purchase from Mr. Sabatino the rights to four \ninternet domain names for the sum of $16,000.  In the Motion, Mr. Sabatino asserts \nthat there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled, as a matter of \nlaw, to judgment in his favor finding the existence of an enforceable contract \nobligating MMB to pay him $16,000 for the four domain names. \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n3. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history that \nare relevant to its determination of the Motion. \n4. On January 28, 2016, Mr. Sabatino filed his Complaint against MMB in \nIredell County, Civil Action No. 16 CVS 198 , asserting a claim for breach of the \nsettlement agreement (the “Sabatino action”).  (Compl. 1–2, ECF No. 76  [“Sabatino \nCompl.”].) \n5. That same day, Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino filed a verified complaint in Iredell \nCounty, Civil Action No. 16 CVS 209, asserting claims individually and derivatively \non behalf of MMB against Carolyn Barnett (“Mrs. Barnett”) and MMB (the “Barnett-\nSabatino a ction”).  (Mem. Law Supp. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2, ECF No. 58.2  \n[“Barnett-Sabatino Compl.”].) \n6. On May 6, 2016, MMB filed a complaint in Iredell County, Civil Action No. \n16 CVS 1101, asserting various statutory and tort claims against Defendants Mrs. \nBarnett-Sabatino, Mr. Sabatino, John E. Miller, III (“Mr. Miller”), Wayne Baum, and \nJustice Bearing, LLC (the “MMB action”).   (Compl. 5, 8, 10 –11, ECF No. 1  [“MMB \nCompl.”].) \n7. The MMB action was designated as a mandatory complex business case by \norder of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina dated June 14, \n2016, (ECF No. 4), and was assigned to the undersigned by order dated July 6, 2016, \n(ECF Nos. 5, 7). \n8. On September 20, 20 16, the Court entered an order consolidating  the \nseparate actions.  (ECF Nos. 16, 35.) \n9. On May 19, 2017, Mr. Sabatino filed the Motion , supporting affidavits, \nexcerpts from Mrs. Barnett’s deposition testimony, and a brief in support.  (ECF Nos. \n37–38.) \n10. The Barnett-Sabatino and MMB actions have been resolved by a settlement \nagreement reached by the parties and approved by the Court on February 6, 2018, \n(ECF No. 77), and those claims have been dismissed, (ECF No. 79).  Thus, the only \nclaim left for resolution is Mr. Sabatino’s contract claim. \n11. The Motion has been fully briefed and is now ripe for resolution. \nIII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n12. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion for \nsummary judgment .  The following background, drawn from the reco rd and the \nevidence submitted in support of and in opposition to the Motion , is intended to \nprovide context for the Court’s analysis and ruling and is solely for purposes of this \nOrder and Opinion. \nA. Parties Relevant to the Sabatino Action \n13. MMB is a New Jersey corporation with its corporate offices in Mooresville, \nNorth Carolina.  (MMB Compl. ¶ 11; Answer ¶ 11, ECF No. 3.) \n14. Mr. Barnett’s wife, M rs. Barnett, has been involved in MMB ’s operations \nsince the company’s founding.  (MMB Compl. ¶ 13; Answer ¶ 13.) \n15. Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino, who is Mr. Barnett’s daughter and M rs. Barnett’s \nstep-daughter, began working for MMB in the early 1990’s.  (MMB Compl. ¶¶ 14–15; \nAnswer ¶¶ 14–15.) \n16. Mr. Sabatino is Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s husband, who also worked for \nMMB providing information technolog y services.  ( MMB Compl. ¶¶ 19–20; Answer \n¶¶ 19–20.) \nB. MMB’s Operations After Mr. Barnett’s Death \n17. After Mr. Barnett ’s death  in May 2015 , Mrs. Barnett became the sole \ndirector of MMB.  (See MMB Compl. ¶¶ 12–13; Answer ¶¶ 12–13.)  A dispute over \nMMB’s operations arose between Mrs. Barnett, on the one hand, and Mrs. Barnett-\nSabatino, Mr. Sabatino, and other employee-shareholders of MMB, on the other hand, \nthe facts of which are contested by the parties in ways not relevant to the Motion.  \n(See MMB Compl. ¶¶ 27–29; Answer ¶¶ 27–29; Barnett-Sabatino Compl. ¶¶ 18–25.) \n18. Around July 31, 2015, MMB terminat ed Mr. Sabatino’s employment.   \n(MMB Compl. ¶ 24; Answer ¶ 24 .)  MMB placed Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino on \nadministrative leave on September 10, 2015, (MMB Compl. ¶ 34; Answer ¶ 34), and \nlater terminated her employment on November 6, 2015, (MMB Compl. ¶ 18; Barnett-\nSabatino Compl. ¶ 25). \n19. In its complaint, MMB alleges that, incident to Mr. Sabatino’s termination, \nhe agreed to transfer control of four domain names to MMB, but has failed to do so.  \n(MMB Compl. ¶¶ 55–56.)  Mr. Sabatino denies these allegations.  (Answer ¶¶ 55–56.) \nC. Negotiations Between Mr. Sabatino and MMB \n20. In late 2015, Mr. Sabatino and Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino’s counsel, Andrew \nFitzgerald (“Mr. Fitzgerald”) , and MMB ’s counsel, Lisa Valdez (“Ms. Valdez”) , \ndiscussed by e-mail the terms of a possible settlement agreement that would resolve \nthe domain name dispute between Mr. Sabatino and MMB along with other disputes \nbetween MMB, on the one hand, and Mr. Sabatino and Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino, on the \nother.  (See Barnett-Sabatino Compl. ¶ 41; Sabatino Compl. ¶ 4, Ex. 1.) \n21. On December 11, 2015, Ms. Valdez e-mailed Mr. Fitzgerald (“Ms. Valdez’s \nFirst E-mail”) stating, in relevant part: \nOur client has authorized us to offer $12,500 for the purchase of the \ndomain name  . . . . This price includes and/or assumes a few \nconditions . . . . The purchase price will be held in trust by our firm until \nthe following can be satisfied: \n \n1. [MMB] will need to verify that the domain, all rights, \npasswords, and associated information has been transferred \nand assigned to it.  By domain, this includes [the four domain \nnames at issue] , which we believe are all registered to your \nclients.  Further [MMB] must verify the domain name is \nsecure and all possibilities of the email communication using \nthe domain are secure and can no longer be intercepted.  This \nverification may be done by a third party agreed upon by both \nour clients and the cost shared. \n2. It appears that Mrs. [Barnett-]Sabatino remotely dialed into \nher computer at MMB and deleted numerous MMB files , \nprograms, and copied the same.  . . . We expect these items \nreturned immediately, but in consideration of the purchase \nprice paid above, everything Mrs. [Barnett-]Sabatino deleted \nand/or copied – all electronic files, programs, proprietary \ninformation and any hard files she removed from the property \n– must be returned. \n \n(Def. Vincent Sabatino’s Mot. Summ. J.  Ex. to Ex. 2, at 7 –8, ECF No. 37.3 [“E-mail \nExchange”].)  Ms. Valdez further requested that Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino or Mr. Miller \nprovide MMB with information on how to correct a recurring problem with MMB’s e-\nmail system and that Mr. Sabatino return a key fob to MMB.  (E -mail Exchange 8.)  \nMs. Valdez  also stated that MMB was working to resolve a vacation pay matter \npreviously raised by Mr. Fitzgerald.  (E-mail Exchange 8.) \n22. On December 15, 20 15, Mr. Fitzgerald responded (“Mr. Fitzgerald’s First \nE-mail”) stating: \nMy client counters at $20,000.  MMB would receive the mmbearings.com \ndomain plus the others you mentioned  . . . . Once transferred [Mr. \nSabatino’s company] won’t have access to the domain name, hosting, or \nemail address administration.  . . . We’re not going to pay to have \nsomeone verify that [Mr. Sabatino’s company] transferred \neverything. . . . My understanding is that [MMB’s] new administrator \nwould be able to see with ease that [Mr. Sabatino’s company] was out of \nthe picture once the transfer takes place. . . . \n \nWe do not know what you are referring to regarding [Mrs. Barnett -\nSabatino] supposedly accessing files, etc.  You’ll have to provide specifics \nfor us to respond. \n \n(E-mail Exchange 6 –7.)  Mr. Fitzgerald further stated that  he believed that  the \nrecurring e -mail problem would become moot  after Mr. Sabatino transferred the \ndomain names.  (E-mail Exchange 7.)  As to the fob issue, Mr. Fitzgerald requested \nthat MMB “drop it” since the device was “deactivated and useless[,]” but said he \nwould ask Mr. Sabatino to return it.  (E-mail Exchange 7.)  Mr. Fitzgerald stated that \nthe vacation pay issue needed to be resolved quickly and raised two new issues: (1) an \nearlier promise that his clients would receive “$500 for a server shelf and some desk \ncabinets[,]” and (2) Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s dispute with MMB.  ( E-mail Exchange \n7.) \n23. On December 18, 2015, Ms. Valdez  responded to Mr. Fitzgerald’s First E -\nmail (“Ms. Valdez’s Second E-mail”) and provided information regarding the removal \nor deletion of MMB’s property, stating“[h]opefully this is enough information for your \nclient to now respond.”  (E-mail Exchange 5–6.)  Specifically, Ms. Valdez stated that \nMMB’s security records showed that on the morning that all files were deleted from \nMrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s computer, which was around the time that she was placed \non administrative leave, Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino came into the office early but left \nbefore other employees arrived.  (E-mail Exchange 6.)  As to other remaining issues, \nMs. Valdez responded that (1) she would ask her client to drop the fob issue , (2) the \nvacation pay should have been deposited that day,  and (3) MMB would agree to pay \n$500 for the server shelf and cabinets.  (E-mail Exchange 6.)  Ms. Valdez concluded \nby saying, “Please let us know your clients’ response to the deletion of the files as soon \nas possible as it is imperative to the compa ny’s operations.”  ( E-mail Exchange 6.)  \nMs. Valdez did not change her client’s  offer regarding the amount MMB would pay \nMr. Sabatino for the four domains. \n24. On December 18, 2015, Mr. Fitzgerald responded (“Mr. Fitzgerald’s Second \nE-mail”) stating that his “ clients deny having a role in the wiping, etc. [that you] \ndescribed . . . . [M]y clients seem adamant that they are not a part of any type of \nactivities you discussed[.]”  (E-mail Exchange 5.)  Mr. Fitzgerald further stated that \nhe had “ been authorized to counter at $18000 [sic], which includes the domain and \nthe cabinet[.]”  (E-mail Exchange 5.) \n25. On December 21, 2015,  Ms. Valdez responded in a third e-mail to Mr. \nFitzgerald’s denial that Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino took or deleted MMB’s property (“Ms. \nValdez’s Third E-mail”) by stating that “[w]e must have either a misunderstanding \nor a mystery[,]” and noting that MMB’s records showed that on the morning that the \nfiles were deleted, Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino arrived at MMB’s office just after 7:00 a.m. \nand left before other employees arrived.  (E-mail Exchange 4.)  Ms. Valdez’s Third E-\nmail also stated that she was “authorized to increase [her] client’s counter offer \n[sic] . . . to $16,000.  Hopefully this is agreeable with your clients and maybe we can \nget this resolved before Christmas.”  (E-mail Exchange 4.) \n26. Mr. Fitzgerald replied  that same  day (“Mr. Fitzgerald’s Third E -mail”), \naddressing details of when Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino was placed on leave and stating \n“[w]e will accept $16,00 [sic] for the domain and the cabinet.  Do you want to draw a \nrelease or agreement of some type?  I’m not sure what it would look like but I want \nyour client to be protected and satisfied with what the y’re [sic] paying for.”  (E-mail \nExchange 4.)  Ms. Valdez promptly replied (“Ms. Valdez’s Fourth E -mail”) that she \nwould “draft an agreement and send it to [Mr. Fitzg erald] for review .”  (E-mail \nExchange 4.) \n27. On January 7, 2016, Mr. Fitzgerald e-mailed Ms. Valdez (“Mr. Fitzgerald’s \nFourth E-mail”) requesting an update on the draft agreement.  (E-mail Exchange 1.)  \nMs. Valdez responded the next day  (“Ms. Valdez’s Fifth E-mail”), stating that she \n“had some difficulty getting [her] clients [sic] back in the game, so to speak,” because \nof disagreements that arose over the holidays between Mr. Sabatino and Mrs. Barnett \nand because of MMB’s “continued belief that [it has] already paid for the domain at \nthe time it was registered at [Mr.] Barnett’s request[.]”  (E-mail Exchange 1–2.)  Ms. \nValdez’s Fifth E-mail again reiterated the basis for MMB’s belief that Mrs. Barnett-\nSabatino took or deleted MMB’s property and stated that MMB’s current position was \nto insist that Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino return the electronic files, the computer (if she \ntook the computer), a company logo, and all hard copies of documents she took  from \nthe office.  (E-mail Exchange 1.) \n28. Thereafter, negotiations between the parties broke down, and these actions \nensued. \nD. Mr. Sabatino’s Claim \n29. Mr. Sabatino  asserts a claim for breach of contract,  alleging that MMB \nagreed to purchase the four domain names for $16,000 and Mr. Sabatino is ready and \nwilling to perform his contractual obligation, but MMB has refused to pay him in \nviolation of the contract.  (Sabatino Compl. ¶¶ 3–4, 7.) \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n30. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c).  “A genuine issue \nof material fact is one that can be maintained by substantial evidence.  Substantial \nevidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion and means more than a  scintilla or a permissible inference.”  \nUssery v. Branch Banking & Tr. Co., 368 N.C. 325, 335, 777 S.E.2d 272, 278–79 (2015) \n(citations and quotation marks omitted). \n31. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \nHensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc. , 193 N.C. App. 561, 563, 668 S.E.2d 349, 351 \n(2008).  The movant may make the required showing by proving that “an essential \nelement of the opposing  party’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or \nwould be barred by an affirmative defense, or by showing through discovery that the \nopposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of her claim.”  \nDobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 (2000). \n32. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784−85, \n534 S.E.2d 660, 664 (2000).  The Court must view the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the non-movant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83, 530 S.E.2d at 835.  Ho wever, \nthe non-movant “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [its] pleading, \nbut [its] response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth \nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  If [the non-movant] do[es] \nnot so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against [the non-\nmovant].”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56(e). \n33.  “Rule 56 does not require that a party move for summary judgment in order \nto be entitled to it.  However, th e nonmovant must be entitled to the judgment as a \nmatter of law.”  N.C. Coastal Motor Line, Inc. v. Everette Truck Line, Inc. , 77 N.C. \nApp. 149, 151, 334 S.E.2d 499, 501 (1985) (citation omitted).  Thus, under Rule 56(c), \na court may grant summary judgment  to the non -moving party where there is no \ngenuine issue of material fact and the non-moving party is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule 56(c); Elliott v. Enka -Candler Fire & \nRescue Dep’t, 213 N.C. App. 160, 170, 713 S.E.2d 132, 139 (2011). \nV. ANALYSIS \n34. The Court initially notes that the materials relied upon by MMB and Mr. \nSabatino are documents that generally are not considered by a court in ruling on a \nmotion for summary judgment.  Baker v. Bowden, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 31, at *7 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Apr. 3, 2017).  “On a motion for summary judgment the court may consider \nevidence consisting of affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, \ndocumentary materials, facts which are subject to judicial notice and any other \nmaterials which would be admissible in evidence at trial.”  Huss v. Huss, 31 N.C. App. \n463, 466, 230 S.E.2d 159, 161–62 (1976).  However, neither party has challenged the \npropriety of the Court’s consideration of the e -mail chain submitted by the parties \nand, in fact, both Mr. Sabatino and MMB filed a copy of the e -mail chain in support \nof and in opposition to the Motion.  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. to Ex. 2; Resp. & Mem. \nLaw Opp’n Def. Vincent Sabatino’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. to Ex . 3, ECF No. 47.2.)  \nFurther, the parties acknowledged during the hearing on the Motion that they relied \non no evidence other than that submitted in support of and opposition to the Motion \nand, if the case were tried, they would have no other evidence to p resent regarding \nthe existence of an agreement for purchase and sale of the domains.  Accordingly, the \nCourt will consider the e-mail chain submitted by the parties in ruling on the Motion.  \nSee E-B Grain Co. v. Denton, 73 N.C. App. 14, 20, 325 S.E.2d 522, 526 (1985) (“[A]s is \ntrue of other material introduced on a summary judgment motion, uncertified or \notherwise inadmissible documents may be considered by the court if not challenged \nby means of a timely objection.” (alteration in original)). \n35. “A compromise  and settlement agreement terminating or purporting to \nterminate a controversy is a contract, to be interpreted and tested by established \nrules relating to contracts.”  Harris v. Ray Johnson Constr. Co. , 139 N.C. App. 827, \n829, 534 S.E.2d 653, 654 (2000).  A valid contract requires mutual assent, mutuality \nof obligation, and definite terms.  Charlotte Motor Speedway, LLC v. Cty. of Cabarrus, \n230 N.C. App. 1, 7, 748 S.E.2d 171, 176 (2013).  “It is axiomatic that a valid contract \nbetween two parties can only exist when the parties assent to the same thing in the \nsame sense, and their minds meet as to all terms.”  Normile v. Miller, 313 N.C. 98, \n103, 326 S.E.2d 11 , 15 (1985) (quotation marks omitted) ; Apple Tree Ridge \nNeighborhood Ass’n v. Grandfather Mountain Heights Prop. Owners Corp., 206 N.C. \nApp. 278, 282, 697 S.E.2d 468, 472 (2010)  (“[T]here must be a meeting of the minds \nof the contracting parties upon all essential terms and conditions of the contract.”).  \n“If any portion of the proposed terms is not settled, or no mode agreed on by which \nthey may be settled, there is no agreement.”  Chappell v. Roth, 353 N.C. 690, 692, 548 \nS.E.2d 499, 500 (2001). \n36. “In the formation of a contract an offer and an acceptance ar e essential \nelements; they constitute the agreement of the parties. The offer must be \ncommunicated, must be complete, and must be accepted in its exact terms.”  \nWashington v. Traffic Markings, Inc. , 182 N.C. App. 691, 697, 643 S.E.2d 44, 48 \n(2007).  “[T]he offer must be one which is intended of itself to create legal relations on \nacceptance.”  Yeager v. Dobbins, 252 N.C. 824, 828, 114 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1960).  If the \nacceptance alters or adds terms, “there is no meeting of the minds and, consequently, \nno contract.”  Normile, 313 N.C. at 103, 326 S.E.2d at 15.  Stated differently, a party \ncannot seek enforcement of one essential or material term when it has not agreed to \nother essential or material terms.  Quantum Corp. Funding, Ltd. v. B.H. Bryan Bldg. \nCo., 175 N.C. App. 483, 490, 623 S.E.2d 793, 799 (2006). \n37. Notwithstanding the preference for settlement of claims without judicial \nintervention, “given the consensual nature of any settlement, a court cannot compel \ncompliance with terms not agreed upon[.]”  Chappell, 353 N.C. at 692, 548 S.E.2d at \n500.  Thus, “[s]ummary judgment in favor of the [party opposing enforcement of the \ncontract] is properly entered when the evidentiary forecast discloses that the parties \nnever reached a mutual understanding or meeti ng of the minds as to the essential \nterms of the contract.”  Elliott v. Duke Univ., Inc., 66 N.C. App. 590, 596, 311 S.E.2d \n632, 636 (1984). \n38. Mr. Sabatino argues that he is entitled to summary judgment because there \nare no genuine issues of material fact, a nd the e-mails create a clear, unambiguous \nagreement that left nothing conditional or uncertain.  (Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1.)  Mr. \nSabatino contends that Ms. Valdez ’s Third E-mail constituted an offer by MMB to \npay $16,000 for the domain names, which was accepted on Mr. Sabatino’s behalf  by \nMr. Fitzgerald’s Third E-mail.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. 3–5.)  Mr. Sabatino argues that, by \nthat point, Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s alleged taking of MMB’s property was no longer \nan outstanding term of the agreement because Mr. Fitz gerald’s previous e -mail \ndenied that his clients took MMB’s property and was, thus, a rejection of Ms. Valdez’s \noffer on th at issue.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. 3.)  According to Mr. Sabatino, Ms. Valdez’s \ncontinued references to the facts surrounding Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s alleged taking \nof property were not renewed offers ; rather,  Ms. Valdez  was merely  “talking \nnegatively about Mr. Fitzgerald’s position” on the issue.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. 3.)  As \nevidence that MMB agreed to buy the domain names without resolution of the return \nof property issue, Mr. Sabatino points to the fact that after the purported offer and \nacceptance, Ms. Valdez’s subsequent e-mails did not raise the issue of Mrs. Barnett-\nSabatino’s return of property again until several weeks later, and only upon being \nasked for an update on the draft agreement.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. 5 –6.)  Mr. Sabatino \nfurther argues that Ms. Valdez’s Fifth E-mail, stating that she was having difficulty \ngetting her client “back in the game” and that her client’s “current positio n” was to \ndemand the return of MMB’s property, (E-mail Exchange 1), demonstrates that MMB \nhad agreed to the exchange of the domains for $16,000, but was then attempting to \ndisavow that agreement, (Def.’s Br. Supp. 4).  Mr. Sabatino also submits as evidence \nhis own affidavit in which he testified that “[i]n December 2015, it was my \nunderstanding, from my attorneys, that a settlement agreement was reached \nwhereby I would receive $16,000 in exchange for me transferring 4 domains to MMB.”  \n(Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1, ¶ 5, ECF No. 37.1 [“Sabatino Aff.”].) \n39. Conversely, MMB contends that a binding contract was never formed \nbecause the parties did not reach agreement on Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s return of \nMMB property, which was a necessary condition for contract formation.  (Resp. Mem. \nLaw Opp’n Def. Vincent Sabatino’s Mot. Summ. J. 7 –9, ECF No. 47.4 [“Pl.’s Br. \nOpp’n”].)  MMB argues that the purported offer and acceptance resolved only the \nissue of price for the domain names, but that Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino’s return o f \nproperty remained an outstanding and material term.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n 8–10; see also \nE-mail Exchange 1, 4, 6–8.)  As evidence of its position, MMB points to Ms. Valdez’s \nFirst E-mail wherein she  made clear that MMB’s offer on the price for the domain \nnames was conditioned upon and part of the consideration for the return of MMB’s \nproperty.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n 7–8.)  MMB also offers Ms. Valdez’s affidavit in which she \navers that “[e]ach and every counter-offer [sic] I relayed to [Mr.] Fitzgerald . . . relied \nupon the inclusion of a condition as to the return of certain MMB company property” \nas described in Ms. Valdez’s First E -mail.  (Pl.’s Br. Opp’n Ex. 3, ¶ 6, ECF No. 47.2 \n[“Valdez Aff.”].)  Ms. Valdez further testified that “it was made clear throughout [her] \nemail communications that [her] client demanded return of the MMB property [.]”  \n(Valdez Aff. ¶ 8.) \n40. The Court has before it the entire e -mail exchange from which a contract \nwas allegedly formed, ( see E-mail Exchange 1 –8), and concludes that there are  no \ngenuine issues of material fact as to whether an agreement was formed. \n41. Upon careful review of counsel’s negotiations via e -mail, the  Court \nconcludes that Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s return of property was a material term of any \nproposed settlement agreement.  Ms. Valdez’s First E -mail stated that “ in \nconsideration of the purchase price  . . . , everything Mrs. [Barnett -]Sabatino deleted \nand/or copied . . . must be returned.”  (E-mail Exchange 8 (emphasis added).)  Where \na term or condition of the agreement is part of the consideration, it is material to the \nagreement.  See Chappell, 353 N.C. at 693 –94, 548 S.E.2d at 500 (“The mutually \nagreeable release was part of the consideration, and hence, material to the settlement \nagreement.” (quotation marks omitted)).  As Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino returning certain \nMMB property was part of the consideration for MMB’s agreement to purchase the \ndomain names, the Court concludes that such return of property was material to any \nsettlement agreement. \n42. Having concluded that Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s return of property was a \nmaterial term, the Court must next determine whet her counsel’s e -mail exchange \ndemonstrates mutual assent as to that term.  “The heart of a contract is the intention \nof the parties, which is ascertained by the subject matter of the contract, the language \nused, the purpose sought, and the situation of the parties at the time.”  Pike v. \nWachovia Bank & Tr. Co. , 274 N.C. 1, 11, 161 S.E.2d 453, 462 (1968).  “When a \ncontract is in writing and free from any ambiguity which would require resort to \nextrinsic evidence, or the consideration of a disputed fact, the intention of the parties \nis a question of law.”  Lane v. Scarborough, 284 N.C. 407, 410, 200 S.E.2d 62 2, 624 \n(1973). \n43. Notwithstanding Mr. Sabatino’s argument that Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino’s \nreturn of property was no longer  an outstanding issue after Mr. Fitzgerald deni ed \nthat his clients removed or deleted MMB’s property, Ms. Valdez and Mr. Fitzgerald \ncontinued to discuss the taking or deletion of MMB property in subsequent e-mails.  \n(See E-mail Exchange 1, 4.)  In response to Ms. Valdez’s initial demand that Mrs. \nBarnett-Sabatino return MMB’s property, Mr. Fitzgerald  requested more \ninformation so that his clients could respond to the allegations.  (E-mail Exchange 7.)  \nAfter Ms. Valdez’s Second E-mail provided the requested information, Mr. Fitzgerald \nstated that his clients denied taking or removing the property in question.  (E-mail \nExchange 5–6.)  Ms. Valdez’s Third E -mail responded to Mr. Fitzgerald’s denial by  \nstating that “[w]e must have either a misunderstanding or a mystery” and providing \ndetails regarding MMB’s belief that Mrs. Barnett -Sabatino remov ed or delet ed \nMMB’s property.  (E-mail Exchange 4.)  The purported acceptance in Mr. Fitzgerald’s \nThird E-mail also continued to discuss MMB’s basis for believing that Mrs. Barnett-\nSabatino remov ed or delet ed the property.  ( E-mail Exchange 4.)  Thus, t he very \ncommunications that Mr. Sabatino alleges to be the offer and acceptance that created \na contract demonstrate that a material term was unresolved when the contract was \nallegedly formed.  Additionally, Ms. Valdez clearly communicated from the outset \nthat MMB was unwilling to go forward with a settlement without the return of \nMMB’s property.  (See E-mail Exchange 4, 6–8.)  Thus, Ms. Valdez’s offer on the price \nfor the domain names and Mr. Fitzgerald’s acceptance of the same does not, based on \nany reasonable interpretation of the parties’ words and acts, indicate that the parties \nassented to the same thing in the same sense.  See Ray Lackey Enters., Inc. v. Vill. \nInn Lakeside, Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 9, at *16 –19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 29, 2016).  \nMr. Sabatino cannot now seek to enforce one material term, payment for the domain \nnames, when an agreement has not been reached on  another material term, the \nreturn of MMB’s property. \n44. The Court concludes that  there is no genuine issue of material fact that  \nmaterial terms remained unsettled, thus precluding the existence of a valid binding \ncontract.  Therefore, entry of judgment as a matter of law in MMB’s favor is proper. \n45. Alternatively, assuming arguendo that the parties reached a binding \nsettlement agreement, the Court concludes that Mrs. Barnett-Sabatino’s return of \nproperty was a condition precedent that has not been satisfied. \n46. “A condition precedent is a fact or event, occurring subsequently to the \nmaking of a valid contract, that  must exist or occur before there is a right to \nimmediate performance, before there is a breach of contract duty, before the usual \njudicial remedies are available.”  Chem. Realty Corp. v. Home Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n \nof Hollywood , 84 N.C. App. 27, 37, 351 S .E.2d 786, 792 (1987) (quotation marks \nomitted).  “Where parties enter a contract containing a condition precedent, they are \nbound when the condition is satisfied.  A condition precedent is an event which must \noccur before a contractual right arises . . . .”  Powell v. City of Newton, 364 N.C. 562, \n566, 703 S.E.2d 723, 727 (2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  “Breach or \nnon-occurrence of a condition prevents the promisee from acquiring a right, or \ndeprives him of one, but subjects him to no liab ility.”  In re Foreclosure of Goforth \nProps., 334 N.C. 369, 375, 432 S.E.2d 855, 859 (1993).  “In general, a condition creates \nno right or duty but is merely a limiting or modifying factor in a contract.”  Id.  \nConditions precedent are disfavored by the law and, as such, a contract provision will \nnot be construed as a condition precedent absent clear language requiring such a \nconstruction.  Mosley v. WAM, Inc. , 167 N.C. App. 594, 60 0, 606 S.E.2d 140, 144 \n(2004).  “[T]he use of such words as ‘when,’ ‘after,’ ‘as soon as,’ and the like, gives clear \nindication that a promise is not to be performed except upon the happening of a stated \nevent.”  In re Foreclosure of Goforth Props., 344 N.C. at 376, 432 S.E.2d at 859. \n47. Upon review of Ms. Valdez’s First E-mail, the initial offer made clear that \nthe return of MMB property was a necessary condition that had to occur before MMB \nbecame obligated to pay Mr. Sabatino for the domain names.  The initial offer in Ms. \nValdez’s First E -mail explicitly stated that the purchase p rice “includes and/or \nassumes a few conditions,” which conditions included the return of MMB’s property, \nand that “[t]he purchase price w [ould] be held in trust by our firm until” the stated \nconditions were met .  (E -mail Exchange 8 (emphasis added).)  Thes e statements \nexpressed MMB’s clear intent that any payment to Mr. Sabatino for the domain \nnames was contingent on the return of MMB’s property.  See In re Foreclosure of \nGoforth Props., 344 N.C. at 376, 432 S.E.2d at 859. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n48. For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES the Motion and GRANTS \nsummary judgment in favor of MMB. \nSO ORDERED, this the 21st day of February, 2018. \n \n \n \n /s/ Michael L.
