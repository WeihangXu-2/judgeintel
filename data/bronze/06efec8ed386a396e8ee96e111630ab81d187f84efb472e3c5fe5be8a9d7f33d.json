Plai ntiff also purchased at least one vehicle with \nEPDM components during the relevant time.  He br ings this claim individually and on behalf of \nall other North Carolinians who purchased products containing EPDM from 1994 until 2002.  He \nhas held himself out to be a person suitable to re present the interests of his fellow citizens.  His \n 2\ncounsel have likewise held themselves out to be suitable advocates for the interests of the North \nCarolina class members.     \n{5} Defendant Bayer AG is a corporation orga nized and existing under the laws of the \nFederal Republic of Germany, with its principa l place of business located in Leverkusen, \nGermany.  Bayer AG is a management holding company that ove rsees operations for some 350 \ncompanies worldwide.  The global en terprise operates in the fields  of health care, nutrition, and \nhigh technology materials.   \n{6} Defendant Bayer Polymers, LLC (n/k/a Baye r MaterialScience, LLC) is a limited \nliability company organized and existing under th e laws of the State of Delaware, with its \nprincipal place of business located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Plaintiff filed the First Am ended Complaint on December 23, 2004.  The case \nwas designated complex business and assigned to the undersigned Special Superior Court Judge \nfor Complex Business Cases by order of the Ch ief Justice of the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina dated March 15, 2005.   \n{17} Defendants filed motions to dismiss the original and first amended complaints in the \nsummer of 2004 and winter of 2005.  The Court heard oral arguments on the motions on \nNovember 21, 2005.  Following the hearing, the C ourt entered an order giving Plaintiff an \nopportunity to plead facts with more precision.   (Order, Nov. 22, 2005.)  Plaintiff filed the \nSecond Amended Complaint on December 8, 2005.  In January of 2006, Defendants renewed \ntheir motions to dismiss.   \n{18} This order addresses the Motion to Dism iss the Second Amended Complaint under \nRule 12(b)(6) of Defendants DSM Copolymer, Inc., Chemtura Corporation (successor by merger \nto Crompton Corporation and Uniroyal Chemical Company, Inc.), and ExxonMobil Chemical \nCompany.  This order also addresses the Motion of Defendant DSN Elastomers Europe B.V. to \nDismiss Second Amended Complaint under Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6).  \n3. \nPLAINTIFF’S ALLEGATIONS \n{19} Plaintiff alleges the following facts in his Second Amended Complaint: \n{20} As noted above, Defendants are involved in  the manufacture, di stribution, marketing, \nor sale of EPDM.  (2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1, 25.)  EP DM is a synthetic rubber with many and varied \n                                                 \n1 DSM Elastomers Holding Company, Inc., DSM Elastomers , Inc. and DSM Elastomers Americas were originally \nparties to this action.  By stipulation filed May 20, 2004, Plaintiff dismissed these three entities and substituted DSM \nCopolymer, Inc.  (Notice of Dismissal Without Prejudice and Stipulation Re:  Tolling and Acceptance of Service 1–\n2.)  DSM Copolymer, Inc. and DSM Elastomers Europe, B.V. are the only DSM-related parties currently involved \nas defendants in this action.   \n 4\napplications.  (Id. ¶¶ 21, 23.)  It is a “commodity product that is fungible among grades.”  ( Id. ¶ \n24.)  EPDM itself is not a consumer product.  Ra ther, it is a component found in many consumer \nproducts.  The amount of EPDM in a given pr oduct varies depending on the nature of the \nproduct.  For example, “[t]he EPDM roofing ma terial purchased by Plaintiff and other Class \nMembers is believed to contain at least 90 % EPDM” and “[t]he tires, window molding, hoses, \nand other rubber products purchased  by Plaintiff and other Class members is [sic] believed to \ninclude 1% or more EPDM.”  ( Id. ¶ 36.)  The crux of Plaintiff’s allegations is that the \nDefendants “engaged in a combination, conspir acy and scheme to suppress and eliminate \ncompetition by fixing the price of EPDM sold in the United States and elsewhere.”  ( Id. ¶ 27.)  \nThe conspiracy “consisted of a continuing agreement, understanding and concerted action among \nDefendants and co-conspirators.”  ( Id. ¶ 28.)  The Defendants allegedly colluded to issue price \nannouncements, allocate markets and customers among themselves, and actively conceal their \nuncompetitive actions from consumers in North Carolina.  ( Id. ¶ 30.)  These alleged actions are \nunder investigation by antitrust authorities in the United Stat es, Canada, and Europe.  ( Id. ¶¶ 32, \n34.) \n{21} As a result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff and other consumers “have been forced to \npay higher and supracompetitive prices for EPDM and were deceived and treated unfairly and \nunethically in their pu rchases of EPDM.”  ( Id. ¶ 44.)  Plaintiff paid these “supracompetitive \nprices” when he “purchased EPDM roofing ma terial and pond liner ma nufactured, distributed, \nand/or sold by one or more of the Defendants.”  (Id. ¶ 35.)  Plaintiff also purchased “at least one \nvehicle, components of which contain Defendants’ EPDM.”  ( Id.)  Plaintiff claims that he and \nother North Carolina class members absorbed a ll of the supracompetitive portion of the price \nbecause “middlemen passed on 100% or more of  the overcharge from the Defendants.”  ( Id. ¶ \n37.)   \n{22} In sum, Plaintiff claims that “Defendants we re parties to an illeg al cartel, agreement, \ncontract, combination, scheme and/or conspiracy designed to fix, raise, stabilize and maintain the \nprice for EPDM” and conceal their conduct from consumers.  ( Id. ¶ 49.)  “Defendants’ contract, \ncombination, scheme and/or conspiracy restrain ed trade or commerce in the State of North \nCarolina and affected commerce in North Carolina.”  ( Id.)  Plaintiff seeks “actual damages, \ntreble damages, plus costs, pre- and post-judgm ent interest and attorney s’ fees” under sections \n75-1 and 75-1.1 of the General St atutes of North Carolina.  ( Id. ¶¶ 48, 55.)  These provisions \n 5\nmake combinations in restraint of trade and unfa ir methods of competition illegal.  N.C. Gen. \nStat. §§ 75-1, 75-1.1 (2005).      \nB. \nMOTION TO DISMISS \n1. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{23} The purpose of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is to test the legal sufficiency \nof the pleading against whic h the motion is directed.  Sutton v. Duke , 277 N.C. 94, 99, 176 \nS.E.2d 161, 163 (1970).  In Branch Banking & Trust Co. v. Lighthouse Financial Corp. , 2005 \nNCBC 3 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 13, 2005), h ttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2005%20 \nNCBC%203.htm, this Court summarized the 12(b)(6) standard as follows: \n \nWhen ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must determine \n\"whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of  the complaint . . . are sufficient to state a \nclaim upon which relief may be granted.\"  In making its decision, the court must treat the \nallegations in the complaint as true.  The court must construe the complaint liberally and \nmust not dismiss the complaint unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff is entitled to \nno relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.  When \nconsidering a motion under Rule \n12(b)(6), the court is not require d to accept as true any \nconclusions of law or unwarranted deductions  of fact in the complaint.  When the \ncomplaint fails to allege the substantive elem ents of some legally cognizable claim, or \nwhere it alleges facts which defeat any clai m, the complaint should be dismissed under \nRule 12(b)(6). \n \nBranch Banking & Trust Co. , 2005 NCBC 3 ¶ 8 (citations omitted).  In this case, it is also \nrelevant that “[a] motion to dismiss a party’s claim for lack of standing is tantamount to a motion \nto dismiss for failure to state a claim upon wh ich relief can be granted according to Rule \n12(b)(6).”  Slaughter v. Swicegood, 162 N.C. App. 457, 464, 591 S.E.2d 577, 582 (2004).       \n2. \nSTANDING \n{24} The doctrine of standing is usually considered  in the context of federal jurisdiction \nunder Article III of the United States Constituti on.  North Carolina state courts use the term \n“standing” to “refer generally to a party’s right to have a court d ecide the merits of a dispute.”  \nNeuse River Found., Inc. v. Smithfield Foods, Inc. , 155 N.C. App. 110, 114, 574 S.E.2d 48, 52 \n(2002).  A court may not properly exercise subject matter jurisdic tion over the parties to an \n 6\naction unless the standing requirements are satisfied.  Aubin v. Susi, 149 N.C. App. 320, 324, 560 \nS.E.2d 875, 878 (2002).  The requirements are as follows: \n \n(1) “injury in fact”—an invasi on of a legally protected interest that is (a) concrete \nand particularized and (b) actual or immi nent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) \nthe injury is fairly traceable to the challe nged action of the defendant; and (3) it is \nlikely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision. \n \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  With its  concern over conjectural \ninjuries and speculative damage awards, standing is  frequently an issue in indirect purchaser \ncases such as this one. 2  The goal of the detailed analytical framework described below is to \ndetermine if indirect purchaser plaintiffs meet the broad standing requirements.     \n3. \nINDIRECT PURCHASER CASES IN FEDERAL COURT \n{25} In Hanover Shoe Co. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp. , 392 U.S. 481 (1968), and \nIllinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977), the United States Supreme Court addressed the \nissue of standing for indirect purchasers under federal antitrust law.  Hanover Shoe was a suit by \na shoe manufacturer against a ma nufacturer of shoe machinery.  392 U.S. at 483.  In defending \nthe treble damage suit, United argued that Ha nover suffered no injury because it simply passed \nthe illegal overcharges on to its customers.  Id. at 487–88.  The Supreme Court rejected this \n“passing-on” defense, and held that a direct purchaser was enti tled to damages regardless of the \nactual injury.  Id. at 488.   \n{26} In Illinois Brick , the State of Illinois brought suit as  an indirect purchaser against a \nmanufacturer and distributor of  concrete block.  431 U.S. at 726.  The issue was whether the \n“pass on” theory “may be used offensively by an indirect purchaser plaintiff against an alleged \nviolator.”  Id.  Justice White, writing for the Court as he did in Hanover Shoe , declined to \nconstrue the federal antitrust laws to allow for indirect purchaser suits.  Id. at 736.   With these \ntwo cases, the federal judiciary has decided “that the direct purchaser suit is on balance a more \n                                                 \n2   Indirect purchaser causes of action are generally based upon claims that the defendants conspired to fix prices in \nviolation of the antitrust laws.  They are indirect in the sense that the plaintiff did not purchase the price-fixed  \nproduct directly from a defendant but rather purchased the product further down in the distribution chain or \npurchased a product in which the price-fixed product was either used as a component or consumed in the \nmanufacturing process. \n 7\neffective instrument for enforcement of the antitrust rule prohibiting price fixing than the indirect \npurchaser suit.”  Crouch v. Crompton Corp., 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 30 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 26, 2004), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/OtherRefdocs/2004%20NCBC%207.htm; see also  William \nLandes & Richard Posner, Should Indirect Purchasers Have Standing to Sue Under the Antitrust \nLaws?  An Economic Analysis of the Rule of Illinois Brick, 46 U. Chi. L. Rev. 602, 634–35 \n(1979).   \n4. \nINDIRECT PURCHASER CASES IN STATE COURTS \n{27} Dissatisfied with the federal policy, some st ates enacted new statutes or interpreted \nexisting statutes to allow indirect purchase rs to recover under st ate antitrust laws.  See Crouch, \n2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 31.  These state pol icies favoring indirect purcha ser recovery were challenged, \nbut in California v. ARC America Corp. , 490 U.S. 93 (1989), the Supreme Court held that states \nmay allow indirect purchaser standing if they so choose.  Id. at 105–06.  As this Court has \npreviously discussed, the differences in the federal and state policie s regarding indirect \npurchasers create a number of problems.  See Adams v. Aventis, S.A. , 2003 NCBC 7 ¶ 23 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Aug. 26, 2003), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2003%20NCBC%207.htm.   \nDespite these problems, this system of dual en forcement is the law t oday, and the Court must \nwork within it.   \n5. \nINDIRECT PURCHASER CASES IN NORTH CAROLINA  \n{28} The section of North Carolina’s General Statutes that gives rise to a number of indirect \npurchaser cases is 75-16, which states as follows: \n \nIf any person shall be injured or the business of any person, firm, or corporation \nshall be broken up, destroyed, or injured by reason of any act or thing done by any \nother person, firm or corporation in viol ation of the provisions  of this Chapter, \nsuch person, firm, or corporation so injured shall have a right of action on account \nof such injury done, and if damages are assessed in such case judgment shall be \nrendered in favor of the plaintiff and ag ainst the defendant for treble the amount \nfixed by the verdict. \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-16 (2005).  In Hyde v. Abbot Laboratories, Inc. , 123 N.C. App. 572, 473 \nS.E.2d 680 (1996), the North Carolina Court of Appeals interpreted section 75-16 to allow \n 8\nindirect purchasers to sue manufactur ers for antitrust violations.   Id. at 584, 473 S.E.2d at 688.  \nHyde was a class action against manufacturers of in fant formula alleging violations of state \nantitrust laws.  Id. at 573, 473 S.E.2d at 681.   Plaintiffs were consumers who purchased the \nformula from retailers and distributors.  Id. at 574, 473 S.E.2d at 681–82.  The trial court granted \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of standing, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  Id. at 584, \n473 S.E.2d at 688.  Although Hyde  established indirect purchaser standing in North Carolina, it \ndid not delineate the scope and breadth of standing under the statute.  In Crouch v. Crompton \nCorp., this Court noted several im portant developments since Hyde and set certain boundaries \nfor indirect purchaser standing.  The most important of these developments was a 1996 \namendment to the North Carolina an titrust statutes revising those provisions to be “internally \nconsistent and consistent with federal antitrust laws.”  Act of June 3, 1996, ch. 550, 1995 N.C. \nSess. Laws 550.  This legislativ e signal required the Court to r econcile the indirect purchaser \nstanding statute with federal standing requirements.  Crouch, 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 49.   \n{29} The leading federal case on standing in cases such as this is Associated General \nContractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters , 459 U.S. 519 (1983) \n(AGC).  In AGC, the United States Supreme Court adopte d a five factor standing test.  In \nCrouch, this Court modified the AGC factors to recognize indi rect purchaser standing.  See \nCrouch, 2004 NCBC 7 ¶¶ 66–74.  Those factors were described in Crouch as follows: \n \n1.            Whether the plaintiff is a consumer or competitor in the allegedly \nrestrained market.  This inquiry focuses on the ma rket the alleged restraint was \ndesigned to impact and the in tent of the actor in engagi ng in the restraint.  One \nkey question is whether the plaintiff claims  injury in a market  collateral to the \nmarket in which the alleged restraint took place.  This factor recognizes that the \nantitrust laws are designed to see that customers in the relevant market get the \nbenefit of price competition.  This factor would have supported standing in Hyde.  \n2.                  The directness of the impact on the plaintiff .  This factor is modified \nto eliminate the restriction of Illinois Brick  against indirect purchaser standing.  \nBeing an indirect purchaser does not pr eclude standing.  However, the causal \nconnection between the act and the clai med injury cannot be too remote.  \nPurchasers in the direct chain of distribu tion are more likely to be able to show \nsufficiently direct injury than those outsi de the chain of distribution.  Purchasers \nwho buy the product which is the subject of the restraint are more likely to be able \nto show sufficiently direct injury th an those who purchas e a product with a \ncomponent which is the subject of the restraint.  Purchasers of products whose \nmanufacture was impacted by the rest raint face significant hurdles showing \nsufficiently direct impact.  Within the ch ain of distribution, the relative positions \n 9\nof the purchaser and the actor can be significant, depending on the length and \ncomplexity of the distribution chain.  Even though a purchaser is removed from \nthe direct restraint, he or she may still show direct injury.  See Blue Shield of Va. \nv. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 478-81 (1982).  This  factor would have supported \nstanding in Hyde. \n3.                  Whether there exist other indirect purchasers in the distribution chain \nwho are more directly impact ed by the alleged violation .  The nature of the \nmarket is significant here.  Courts must look at the nature of the product and the \nmarket for the product as well as the ch ain of distribution to determine the \nlikelihood of direct pass through of the cost of the restraint or in flated price.  The \nnature of the restraint must  also be considered.  Doubl e recovery among indirect \npurchasers should be avoided.  This f actor would have s upported standing in \nHyde where the distribution chain was short. \n4.                  The speculative nature of the damage claims .  As damage claims \nmove from direct to indirect and the distribution chain becomes more complex, \nthe possibility of factors intervening to affect causation and price multiplies, and \nclaims become more speculative.  It is  appropriate for purposes of determining \nindirect purchaser standing “to consider whether a claim rests at bottom on some \nabstract conception or speculative measure of harm.”  McCready, 457 U.S. at 475 \nn.11.  In McCready the Court noted that the courts  were required to be cautious \nwhen dealing with speculative, abstr act and impractical damage theories.  Id.  \nThis factor would not have  prevented standing in Hyde .  This factor focuses on \nsound economic analysis.  Important fact ors would include reliable demand and \nsupply curve studies and sufficient regressi on analysis to eliminate other factors \nin pricing. \n5.                  The risk of duplicative reco very and danger of complex \napportionment of damages .  While these factors are limited by the General \nAssembly’s creation of indirect purcha ser standing, they s hould not be totally \neliminated when considering the state claims.  The courts still have the same \ninterest in keeping the scope of a comp lex antitrust trial within judicially \nmanageable limits.  AGC, 459 U.S. at 543.  The factors are simply taken down a \nlevel and the Hanover Shoe/Illinois Brick restrictions eliminated.  State cases may \npresent apportionment issues which are simply too complex and for which there \nexists no measure of recovery which is not speculative.  It is clear that the General \nAssembly did not intend that every purchaser in the distribution chain have a right \nof recovery or that there be duplicative recovery among indirect purchasers.  Such \nan interpretation would be contrary to the clear guidance to follow federal \nprecedent and harmonize state antitrust law wi th federal law.  Rather, it should be \nclear that the General Assembly intende d that those who can show with some \ndegree of certainty that they were directly impacted by the alleged acts in restraint \nof trade should be able to recover even though they are indirect purchasers.  The \ncourts must be cognizant that the problem s between direct and indirect purchaser \ncases replicate themselves in state i ndirect purchaser cases where there are \nmultiple levels in the distribution chain and multiple distribution chains.  There \nshould only be one fund constituting the amount of the alleged overcharge to \nNorth Carolina residents, and the courts must guard against multiple liability for \n 10\nthe fund and prejudice to absent victims or non-class members.  The complexity \nof the distribution chain and the variety of consumers in Bruggers [Bruggers v. \nEastman Kodak Co., 2000 NCBC 3 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 17, 2000), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2000%20NCBC%203.htm.] highlight \nthe issues this factor would implicat e.  As the Supreme Court noted in AGC and \nIllinois Brick , massive and complex damages litigation undermines the \neffectiveness of treble damage suits.  Th e poor results obtained in settlement in \nthe North Carolina cases confirms this view. \n            \nId. ¶ 73(1)–(5).  The application of  these factors is a fact-intensive exercise.  The relative \nimportance of any single factor may vary considerab ly from case to case.  This Court’s decision \nin Crouch was not appealed and no appellate court has addressed the standing question.       \n6. \nANALYSIS \n{30} The Court now turns to the facts of th e case at bar.  Before applying the AGC factors, \nthe Court notes that this case presen ts the same problems encountered in Crouch.  Crouch \ninvolved price fixing of rubber processing chemicals used in the manufacture of automobile tires.  \nCrouch, 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 15.  In Crouch, the Court faced several problems:   \nFirst, the price-fixed item is a product consumed or altered in the manufacturing \nprocess.  Accordingly its use will vary with the type of . . . product being made.  It \nmay also vary with the natu re of the product . . . being used and how it is used in \nthe manufacturing process.  Different direct  purchasers . . . might use the various \n[products] in various ways in differing products. \n \nId. at 78.  The EPDM at issue here is sim ilar to the rubber processing chemicals in Crouch.  As \nnoted previously, EPDM is a component of many  consumer products.  The use of EPDM varies \nwith the type of product being made.  Some pr oducts, such as roofing material or pond liners, \ncontain a high percentage of EPDM.  Others, such  as automobiles, have only a small amount of \nEPDM.  As such, the role of EPDM varies with the nature of product being used.   \n{31} However, this case differs from Crouch in the number of consum er products at issue.  \nThe only products at issue in Crouch were tires, and the Court was able to determine at the \nmotion to dismiss stage that “the recovery per tire sold in North Carolina will be in the range of \n$0.01 to $0.11.”  Id.  ¶ 79.  The Court concluded that this  “would not represent a meaningful \nrecovery for consumers” and that “the costs asso ciated with litigation and administration of any \nsettlement would far outweigh th e benefits to consumers.”  Id.  Here, there are multiple \nconsumer products at issue.  Plaintiff allege s he purchased EPDM roofing material, pond liner, \n 11\nand at least one vehicle containing EPDM.  (2 d Am. Compl. ¶ 35.)  The EPDM components in \nan automobile include “tires, window molding, hoses, and other rubber products.”  (Id. ¶ 36.)  It \nis clear to the Court that EPDM may well be present in hundreds of consumer products, resulting \nin an enormous class of plaintiffs and many subclasses.  Plaintiff does not seek to limit his claims \nto pond liners or products which might have a s ubstantial component of EPDM.  Perhaps the \nmarket and damages would be too small to make the case attractive.  The Second Amended \nComplaint seeks to recover for every product which was made using EPDM.  The Court’s ruling \nis based upon the Second Amended Complaint before it.  The costs of litigation and \nadministration of such a settlement far outwei gh the benefits to consumers.  Indeed, the \nsettlements reached with the Bayer, Dow, and Du Pont defendants in this matter demonstrate that \nrecovery on behalf of individual consumers of  EPDM would be miniscule and distribution \nadministratively impossible.  The funds from th ese settlements are destined to end up in the \nhands of the lawyers, a handful of  named plaintiffs, and a small nu mber of charities selected by \nthe approving court pursuant to  the cy pres doctrine.  In no way do these settlement funds \ncompensate North Carolina consumers who pur chased products that contained overpriced \nEPDM.  See infra Part II.C.   As a preliminary matter, the Cour t thus notes that the challenges \nhere appear to be even greater than those in Crouch.         \n{32} Preliminary considerations aside, the C ourt must determine whether Plaintiff has \nstanding to pursue this action, and therefore turns to the AGC factors as harmonized with North \nCarolina law in Crouch.     \na. \nTHE RELEVANT MARKET \n{33} Here the Court must consider “whether th e plaintiff claims injury in a market \ncollateral to the market in which the alleged restraint took place.”  Crouch, 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 73.  \nRecognizing that “[t]he an titrust laws are designed  to see that customers in the relevant market \nget the benefit of price competition,” the first step is to identify the “relevant market.”  In this \ncase, as in Crouch, there are two relevant markets.  The fi rst is the market for EPDM itself.  In \nthis first market, the sellers are EPDM manufacturers and the buyers are manufacturers of \nproducts that contain EPDM.  For example, an automobile manufacturer may purchase EPDM \nfor use in its cars.  Plaintiff is not part of th is first market.  Rather, Plaintiff is a buyer in a \nsecond, collateral market.  In this second market, the sellers are manufactur ers, distributors, or \n 12\nretailers of products that contain EPDM and the buyers are consumers who purchase these items.  \nIn the case of automobile parts or other small component parts of larger products, the consumer \nis even further removed from the primary sale.  As a purchaser at retail of a product that contains \nEPDM, Plaintiff is in a market at least second arily affected by the restraint in the original \nEPDM-only market.  The antitrust laws primarily seek to protect buyers in the first market, who \nare most directly affected by ar tificially high prices for EPDM.  Plaintiff purchased products the \nprice of which may or may not have been influenced by the illegal restraint.  Thus, this factor \nweighs against standing as to most products.  \n{34} The situation here is similar to that in Crouch, where the plainti ff purchased products \nthat contained the price-fixed r ubber additive, rather than the r ubber additive itself.  The Court \nfound that this weighed slightly against standing in Crouch.  Both Crouch and the case at bar are \ndistinguishable from Hyde, in which the plaintiff was a participant in the market for baby \nformula.  See Hyde, 123 N.C. App. at 574, 473 S.E.2d at 681–82.   Although the Hyde plaintiffs \ndid not purchase baby formula directly from the manufacturer, they purchased baby formula, not \na product comprised of baby formula and a number of  other ingredients.  For this reason, this \nfactor would have supported standing in Hyde.  If the product at issue in Hyde was an ingredient \nin baby formula, rather than the formula itsel f, this first factor would not have supported \nstanding.   Since Plaintiff in this case is a particip ant in a collateral market—the market for \nproducts that contain EPDM rather than the mark et for EPDM itself—this factor works against \nstanding.      \nb. \nDIRECTNESS OF IMPACT \n{35} As the Court of Appeals made clear in Hyde, being an indirect purchaser in North \nCarolina does not preclude standing.  See id. at 584, 473 S.E.2d at 688.  In Crouch, this Court \nfashioned a test to determine the scope of indirect purchaser standing and recognized that there is \na boundary beyond which clai ms are too remote.  See Crouch , 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 96.  This is \nsimilar to the concept of proximate  cause in the law of torts.  See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. \nCo., 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928).  The analysis cente rs on the length and complexity of the \ndistribution chain.  See Crouch, 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 73.  Furthermore, “[t]he nature of the item can \ninfluence the directness of the imp act on the price of the end product at retail . . . .  The smaller \nthe component, the less likely there will be impact on the final price.”  Id. ¶ 85.  In Crouch, \n 13\nhowever, the Court knew that “the  chemicals only comprise 1% of  the value of a tire, reducing \nthe likelihood that total final price was significantly affected.”  Id.   \n{36} The Court does not have the benefit of such knowledge here.  Plaintiff is not claiming \ndamage based on one product.  Rather, Plaintiff cl aims damage based on his purchase of roofing \nmaterial, pond liner, and “at least one vehicle.”  (2d Am. Compl. ¶ 35.)  The list of products at \nissue may grow even longer, for “[d]iscovery may reveal that Plain tiff purchased other goods \ncontaining Defendants’ EPDM, but which are not known to him at this time.”  ( Id. ¶ 36.)  The \nfact that there are multiple produc ts at issue makes analysis of the directness of impact rather \ndifficult.  Some products, such as roofing mate rial or pond liner, contain a high percentage of \nEPDM.  The price paid for these items is more likely to have been affected by price fixing \nbecause EPDM is a significant component.  But othe r products, such as the vehicle, may contain \nlittle EPDM, and their final prices are not as likely to have been influenced by price fixing in the \nEPDM market.  \n{37} The presence of multiple end products also presents the Court with distribution chains \nof varying length and complexity.  Some products may have relativ ely short distribution chains.  \nFor example, a chain might run from an EPDM manufacturer to a pond liner manufacturer to the \ncustomer.  There is also the potential for long distribution chains.  A longer chain might run from \nan EPDM manufacturer to a rubber hose manufac turer to a hose distributor to an automobile \nmanufacturer to a retailer, and finally to the customer.   \n{38} Given the great number of products, the va rying amount of EPDM in those products, \nand the varying length and comple xity of the distribution chains , the Court cannot determine the \ndirectness of impact on these facts.  This factor is inconclusive and weighs neither for nor against \nstanding.  But as the Court will discuss later, the complexity inherent in multiple distribution \nchains weighs against standing.  See infra Part I.B.6.d & e.     \nc. \nOTHER DIRECT PURCHASERS MORE DIRECTLY IMPACTED \n{39} Examination of this factor is meant to a void a double recovery.  “State courts should \nfocus this inquiry on whether or not the existen ce of other indirect purchasers in the chain of \ndistribution gives rise to other claims against the fund representing the amount by which the \nprice of the retail item has been artificially inflated.”  Crouch, 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 85.  The potential \nfor long distribution chains makes this inquiry easier.  In long distribution chains, there are likely \n 14\nto be distributors and retailers who may have a cl aim that they absorbed some or all of the price \nincrease, rather than passing it  along to Plaintiff.  For exam ple, a retailer who sold pond liners \ncontaining EPDM would also be an indirect purchaser (since it did not purchase raw EPDM), but \nwould have a more direct claim than Plaintiff by virtue of its  higher position on the distribution \nchain.  The antitrust laws favor recovery on behalf of these purchasers, and their existence \nincreases the likelihood of double recovery if Plaintiff is allowed to recover.  Even though no \nclaims have currently been file d on behalf of these distributo rs and retailers, this factor \nnevertheless weighs against standing.  Th e Court reached the same conclusion in Crouch on \nsimilar facts.   See id. ¶ 85.   \nd & e. \nSPECULATIVE NATURE OF DAMAGE CLAIMS AND COMPLEXITY \n{40} Earlier, the Court noted that  analysis of the modified AGC factors is a fact-intensive \nexercise and that “different factors might be important in different cases.”  Id. ¶ 74.  In this case, \nthe fourth and fifth factors are extremely important and weigh heavily against standing.  These \nfactors are interrelated and shar e an overarching concern for practic ality and wise use of judicial \nresources.   \n{41} Calculation of damages in this  case would be a daunting ta sk.  First, Plaintiff would \nhave to establish prices fo r products containing EPDM both before and after the alleged \nconspiracy period.  However, this process is complicated by the fact that EPDM is only a \ncomponent in these products.  Thus, “a regression analysis would be required to disaggregate any \neffect of other changes in the manufacturing process for each manufacturer for each product \ncategory.”  Id. ¶ 80.  It would not be enough to simply es tablish that cars, roofing material, pond \nliner, and other products cost mo re after the alleged conspiracy  than before.  There are many \nfactors which could cause a price increase in these products—in flation, prices of other inputs, \ntransport costs, product demand, and market conditions  just to name a few.  Such an analysis \nwould have to be carried out at each link in the distribution chai n in order to determine whether \nthe allegedly illegal price increase was borne in whol e or in part by consumers such as Plaintiff.  \nEconomists would require huge amounts of informa tion before they could embark on such an \nanalysis.  Nonparties will almost certainly consider some of this information to be confidential or \nsubject to trade secret protection, resulting in a pr otracted and contentious discovery process that \nwould burden the Court.  Even if the information were readily available, “the demand and supply \n 15\ncurves must then be calculated for this my riad of products and su ppliers and the prices \ndetermined by the intersections of those curves te sted against rigorous regression analysis to \ninsure that no external factors affected the pr icing and pass through at th e manufacturer level.”  \nId. ¶ 81.  This rigorous economic analysis is necessary to determine whether increased prices \nwere the result of the alleged price fixing, or were the result of some other factor.  If, at the end \nof this process, it is determined that none of the increased price was passed on to the Plaintiff, \nthen there are no damages and there can be no recovery.3   \n{42} The potentially large number of products co ntaining EPDM adds to the complexity.  \nThe analysis described above would have to be carried out for each product in order to accurately \ncalculate damages.  In Crouch, the Court found that carrying out this type of analysis for a single \nproduct, tires, “would be a Herculean task and one  which the Court believes would not be free \nfrom speculation given the enormous number of di saggregating factors to be considered in the \nprocess.”  Crouch, 2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 80.  The present ca se, with its multiple products, \nmanufacturers, markets, external ities, and disaggregating factors,  would cause even Hercules to \nquestion his legendary abilities.  Given these variables, the issues surrounding allocation of the \nalleged price fixing in this case would be enorm ously complex and would render the results of \nany economic analysis speculative.   \n{43} The Court notes again that each case must be analyzed separately.  It is not difficult to \nimagine “other examples where a component, such  as a computer chip, is price fixed, and its \ncosts passed through directly to purchasers of the product in which it is incorporated.”  Crouch, \n2004 NCBC 7 ¶ 84.  In the example, the requi red economic analysis would be relatively \nstraightforward.  But here, it is clear from the pleadings that the analysis would be unmanageably \ndifficult and unreliable.  Thus, it is to the benefit of all parties for the Court to rule on standing \nearly in the litigation process, before substant ial resources are expended gathering information \nfor an economic analysis that would prove unreliable in the end.   \n{44} Considering all factors, Plaintiff lacks standi ng to pursue indirect  purchaser claims.  \nDue to this lack of standing, th e law will not grant him relief.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claims \nagainst the moving Defendants are subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).   \n                                                 \n3 This is similar to the “loss causation” requirement found in the federal securities laws, which itself is rooted in the \ncommon law of torts.  See, e.g. , Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo , 544 U.S. 336, 346 (noting “Congress’ intent to \npermit private securities fraud actions for recovery where, but only where, plaintiffs adequately allege and prove the \ntraditional elements of causation and loss”).   \n 16\n \nII. \nPLAINTIFF’S MOTIONS FOR LEAVE TO DISMISS CERTAIN DEFENDANTS \n{45} Plaintiff moves for leave to  voluntarily dismiss the Bayer, Dow, and DuPont \ndefendants under Rule 41(a).  Thes e defendants are parties to EPDM  antitrust lawsuits in other \nstates and have entered into a multistate settlement agreement which Plaintiff contends includes \nresolution of all claims asserted in the litigation before this Court.  Settlements as to both the \nBayer and the Dow and DuPont Defendants we re approved by the H onorable John McAfee, \nCircuit Court Judge for Claiborne County, Tennessee.   \nA. \nPLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE DEFENDANTS \nBAYER CORPORATION, BAYER MATERIALSCIENCE, LLC, AND BAYER AG \n{46} Plaintiff moves to dismiss Defendants Bayer Corporation,  Bayer MaterialScience, \nLLC, and Bayer AG (collectively “Bayer defendant s”) pursuant to Rule  41(a) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure, subject to Ru le 23(c), which requires court approval of the \ndismissal or compromise of a class action.  Cl aims against the Bayer defendants have been \ncompromised and settled for $2,250,000 as part of a mu ltistate settlement agreement.  Plaintiffs \nand Bayer AG submitted the multistate settlement , along with three othe rs, to the Honorable \nJohn McAfee, Circuit Judge of Claiborne County, Tennessee.  On March 3, 2006, Judge McAfee \napproved the settlement, wh ich “provides for a fluid recovery or cy pres  distribution in lieu of a \nclaims-made process.”  (Order ¶ 11, Mar. 3, 200 6.)  The following amounts were deducted from \nthe gross settlement amount: \n$818,500 – Attorney fees and expenses for Plaintiffs’ counsel \n$55,303 – Notice costs \n$14,500 – Incentive payments to named plaintiffs  \nThis left $1,361,696.30 plus interest available for cy pres distribution.   \n{47} On May 15, 2006, Judge McAfee entere d a Corrected Supplemental Order \nconsolidating the settlement funds from the four settlements and approving the following cy pres \nawards:    \n$700,000 – East Tennessee Children’s Hospital of Knoxville, Tennessee \n$700,000 – Special Operations Warrior Foundation of Tampa, Florida \n 17\n$250,000 – Baker Cancer Center of Harrogate, Tennessee \n$1,400,000 – St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital of Memphis, Tennessee \nThese payments were to be made from the c onsolidated settlement funds, which included the \n$2,250,000 Bayer settlement. \nB. \nPLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO DISMISS DEFENDANTS DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY, E.I \nDUPONT DE NEMOURS & COMPANY and DUPONT DOW ELASTOMERS, LLC \n{48} Plaintiff also moves to dismiss Defendant s Dow Chemical Company, E.I. DuPont de \nNemours & Company, and DuPont Dow Elas tomers, LLC (collectively “Dow/DuPont \nDefendants”) under Rule 41(a) and subject to Rule  23(c).  These claims have been settled for \n$2,000,000 as part of a multistate settlement ag reement.  On June 21, 2005, Judge McAfee \napproved the settlement.  The following amounts were deducted from the gross settlement \namount: \n$746,771.26 – Attorney fees and expenses for Plaintiffs’ counsel  \n$101,000.00 – Notice Costs \n$6,000.00 – Incentive payments for named plaintiffs \nThis left $1,156,982.15 available for cy pres  distribution.  On July 1, 2005, Judge McAfee \nentered a Supplemental Order approving the following cy pres awards: \n$800,000.00 - Special Operations Warrior Foundation of Tampa, Florida \n$356,982.15 - East Tennessee Children’s Hospital of Knoxville, Tennessee \nC. \nANALYSIS \n{49} In considering these motions, the Court is mindful of the clear public policy of this \nstate regarding unpaid residuals in  class action litigation.  The Ge neral Assembly codified this \npolicy in section 1-267.10 of the General Statutes, which states as follows: \nIt is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that the unpaid residuals in class \naction litigation are distributed, to the extent possible, in a manner designed either \nto further the purposes of the underlying causes of action or to promote justice for \nall citizens of this State.  The General Assembly finds that the use of funds \ncollected by the State courts pursuant to this section for these purposes is in the \npublic interest, is a proper use of the funds, and is cons istent with essential public \nand governmental purposes.   \n \n 18\nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-267.10(a)(2005).  The statute goes on to require the pa rties to report to the \ncourt the total amount actually paid to class me mbers.  After receiving this report, the court \n“shall direct the defendant to pay the sum of the unpaid residue, to be divided and credited \nequally, to the Indigent Person’s Attorney F und and to the North Carolina State Bar for the \nprovision of civil legal se rvices for indigents.”  Id. § 1-267.10(b).  Although the statute does not \ndirectly address cy pres distributions in which there are no payments made to class members, the \nCourt believes the public polic y regarding unpaid residuals is also applicable to cy pres  \ndistributions which have no relati onship with the class vi ctimized by the viol ations.  Indeed, the \ncitizens of North Carolina are at even great er risk of injustice in nationwide cy pres  settlements \nthan they are when there is money left over afte r class members have been paid.  When cy pres  \ndistributions are approved by judges sitting in distant jurisdictions, there is an acute danger that \nthe settlement funds will not “further the purpo ses of the underlying causes of action or . . . \npromote justice for all citizens” of North Carolina.  See id. § 1-267.10(a).         \n{50} The term “cy pres” is most commonly associated with trust law.  It “appears to derive \nfrom the Norman-French term ‘cy pres comme possible ,’ meaning ‘as near as possible.’”  Susan \nBeth Farmer, More Lessons from the Laboratories:  Cy Pres Distributions in Parens Patriae \nAntitrist Actions Brought by State Attorneys General , 68 Fordham L. Rev. 361, 406 n.212 \n(1999).  In trust law, “[c]y pres is a rule of construction which courts employ to carry out the \nspirit of a trust’s terms when literal application of such terms is not feasible.”  Id.  An example of \nthe proper application of the cy pres concept in North Carolina can be found in Board of Trustees \nv. Heirs of Prince , 311 N.C. 644, 319 S.E.2d 239 (1984).  In that case, the testatrix bequeathed \nher residuary estate in trust to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the purpose of \nbuilding a theatre.  Id. at 649, 319 S.E.2d at 243.  When the University eventually built a new \ntheater, it used funds from the General Assembly instead of  the trust funds.  Id. at 654, 319 \nS.E.2d at 654.  The Supreme Court affirmed an or der of the trial court amending the trust to \nprovide for “activities that enhance the produc tion, development, maintenance, and student \nparticipation in theatrical productions” at the University, reasoning that this amendment carried \nout Mrs. Prince’s general charitable intent to promote dramatic art.  Id. at 656, 319 S.E.2d at 247.   \n{51} In the context of class actions, “[c]ourts have utilized cy pres distributions where class \nmembers are difficult to identify, or where they change constantly, or where there are unclaimed \nfunds.  In these cases, the court, guided by the parties’ original purpose, directs that the \n 19\nunclaimed funds be distributed for the indirect prospective benefit of the class.”  3 Alba Conte & \nHerbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 10:16, at 513 n.1 (4th ed. 2002).   \n{52} The cy pres distributions here are all going to respectable medical or charitable \norganizations.  However, the injured class in this case consists of consumers who were \novercharged for a variety of products as the result of an alleged conspiracy between \nmanufacturers of synthetic rubb er.  The funds distributed are in no way “for the indirect \nprospective benefit of the class.”  Such distribu tions are contrary to the very definition of “cy \npres.”  The National Associati on of Consumer Advocates suggest s that “[c]lass counsel should \nrecommend cy pres remedies which will provide indirect benefit to absent members of the class \nor which will further the purposes of the underl ying litigation.”  Nat’l Ass’n of Consumer \nAdvocates, Standards and Guidelines for Litigating and Settling Consumer Class Actions § 7.C., \nat 32 (rev. 2006), available at \nhttp://www.naca.net/_assets/media/RevisedGuidelines.pdf.  The \npurpose of this litigation was to protect cons umers from collusion among manufacturers.  The \norganizations receiving funds from these settlements engage in many pr aiseworthy activities for \nthe benefit of the sick and injured, but they do not work to protect cons umers.  The distribution \nof these settlement funds is clea rly not “as near as possible” to the purposes of the litigation or \nthe benefit of class members.             \n{53} In this case, the settlement s approved by Judge McAfee ar e prima facie evidence of \nthe fact that there can be no administratively eco nomical distribution to the class and that the cy \npres distribution will result in less than fifty percent of the settlement being distributed to anyone \nin need.  Of that amount, there is no demonstr able showing that any citizen of North Carolina \nwill benefit and a clear indication that citizens of  states which do not have indirect purchaser \nstatutes (a majority) will benefit as much as, if not more than, citizens of states that recognize \nsuch causes of action.  Approximately $150,000 will be  spent on “notices” to tell class members \nwho probably will never recognize that they are class members th at they will receive nothing \nfrom the settlement.   \n{54} The indirect purchaser cases present a real contradiction.  Usually the defendants have \nbeen charged with or pleaded guilty to a federal antitrust violation.  They are not entitled to any \nsympathy.  The nature of the cases makes proof and defense practically or economically \nimpossible.  The Court is not aware of any indi rect purchaser case ever being tried in North \nCarolina, or nationally for that matter.  Settlem ent is virtually certain.  Because the individual \n 20\nclass members’ damages are usually so small th at administration of distribution of a fund is \nimpossible or impractical, a cy pres settlement is the norm.  This case is a classic example.  Since \nthe states with indirect purchase r standing are limited, defendants wa nt them all settled at once.  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel are happy to agree as the se ttlement fund from which they claim a fee is \nlarger.  Simultaneous settlement ensures that multistate distributions to individuals are practically \nimpossible.  That leads to forum shopping to ge t a nationwide class actio n settlement approved.  \nThe parties have a common interest in making the selected judge happy. \n{55} These motions present the flip side of the co in if there is no st anding requirement for \nindirect purchaser cases in North Carolina.  In the event there is no standing requirement, most \ncases will involve individual clams for which it would be impossible to economically distribute \nsmall sums to consumers.  These cases will result  in cy pres distributions such as those proposed \nin this case.  The economics of litigation dictate that defendants resolve all the individual state \nlitigation at one time.  Hence, there has developed the practice of  counsel for plaintiffs and \ndefendants choosing a state where they can get c ourt approval of a nationwide settlement that \nencompasses claims from all states which recognize indirect purchaser status.  Such distributions \nhave the salutary benefit of not permitting the guilty price fixer to escape from paying state law \nclaims in addition to the direct claims for whic h they are liable under federal law.  The question \nraised in light of the realities of this kind of litigation is what responsibilities lawyers for the \nNorth Carolina class and North Carolina judges ha ve to see that these “nationwide” settlements \nare fair to North Carolinians. \n{56} Here the parties chose Tennessee. 4  The reason for that sele ction is not obvious from \nthe facts of the case.  It is obvious that  local institutions in Tennessee will benefit \ndisproportionately to other states.  It is arguable that some North Carolina residents may go to St. \nJude’s Children’s Hospital for treatment and th at some North Carolina residents may receive \nscholarships from the Special Operations Warrior  Fund.  All the recipients are worthy charities, \nand the Court is sure Judge McAfee was conscientious in his selection.   \n{57} The Court has reached two conclusions based upon its experience with these cases.  \nFirst, if a nationwide settlement is approved in another state, it is unlikely that North Carolina \nresidents will benefit in any si gnificant way and the public po licy embodied in section 1-267.10 \n                                                 \n4 In another case pending before this Court the parties selected New Mexico.  See Thai Holding of Charlotte, Inc. v. \nArcher Daniels Midland Co., No. 03 CVS 15096 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2003).  The use of nationwide class action \nsettlements presided over by state judges can be troublesome.  See infra ¶ 60.  \n 21\nwill be ignored.  Local judges selected by the lawyers get to decide where the cy pres money \ngoes.  \n{58} Second, no money goes to people who have allegedly been injured.  The lawyers \nbenefit directly, and the f ees and expenses often consume fifty pe rcent of the settle ment funds.    \nIndirect purchaser cases have  become a means of genera ting legal fees without any \ncorresponding value to the persons allegedly injured.  If we are to punish those who are guilty of \nantitrust violations, it seems appr opriate that the funds generated by such suits be distributed to \nvictims, a fund they have a connection to, or at least in a manner consistent with the established \npublic policy set by the Legislature.  This settlement distributes funds in a manner totally \nunrelated to the alleged victims and without regard to North Carolina public policy.   \n{59} This area of the law is in serious need of attention.  The appellate  courts may find that \nthere is no standing requirement.  If so, some gu idance to trial judges about  their obligations to \nprotect the public from settlement s that only benefit the lawyers and the citizens of other states \nwould be useful.  This Court has attempted to discern the public policy indicated by the \nLegislature in section 1-267.10 in a manner to make the settlement of North Carolina claims \ncomport with North Carolina public policy.  The Le gislature itself could cl arify the situation by \namending the statute to make clear that if inju red persons do not receive any distribution, cy pres  \nfunds, whether generated by state or nationwide settlement, should be disp ersed to a fund with \nsome beneficial relationship to th e victims or as a default as dire cted in the statute.  Judges \nshould not be making those decisions.  As the Financial Times noted in an article critical of cy \npres class action settlements, “[g]overnments, Legislatures and elected  representatives should \nlook after society as a whole; courts and lawy ers should stick to the task of compensating \nvictims.”  Patti Waldmeir, Charitable Giveaway That Cheats Justice:  Microsoft’s Offer to Settle \na Legal Case by Giving Computers to Poor Ch ildren Illustrates a Disturbing Tendency for US \nCourts to Assume the Role of Social Policy Arbiters, Fin. Times, Nov. 29, 2001, at 19.     \n{60} The dangers inherent in and problems created when the parties join in selection of one \nstate forum for settlement of nationwide claims underlie the rationale for the federal Class Action \nFairness Act.  See Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, 119 Stat. 4 (codified in \nscattered sections of 28 U.S.C.); see also  Anna Andreeva, Comment, Class Action Fairness Act \nof 2005:  The Eight-Year Saga Is Finally Over , 59 U. Miami L. Rev. 385, 393–94 (2005) \n(describing congressional concern with forum shopping in class action litigation).  One need only \n 22\nlook at the outcome for North Carolina residents of Moody v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. , 2007 \nNCBC 13 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 7, 2007), to see the impact locally.  Moody involved a \nnationwide class action settlement administered in Illinois in which North Carolina citizens \nreceived a total of $66 in cash and coupons a nd the entire nationwide class received cash and \ncoupons totaling only $2,402, while the lawyers got close to a million dollars in cash.  Id. ¶ 2.  \nNorth Carolina courts should not abdicate to judges in foreign ju risdictions the determination of \ncy pres distributions of settlement funds whic h belong in part to Nort h Carolina residents and \nshould ensure that North Carolina public policy is  followed.  The even more difficult question is \nwhether the North Carolina courts should permit dismissal of North Carolina class actions where, \nas here, no allocation of damages has been ma de among the states having indirect purchase \nstanding.  It can be done.  See Thai Holding of Charlotte, In c. v. Archer Daniels Midland Co. , \n2001 NCBC 11 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 7, 2007).   \n{61} The message from this decision should be cl ear.  If North Carolina lawyers and class \nrepresentatives undertake the representation of North Carolina citizens, they must ensure that the \nstate’s interests and the interests of its injured citizens come first.  North Carolina courts will and \nshould be reluctant to approve dismissal of any purported No rth Carolina class action where the \nNorth Carolina share of the settlement proceeds is not disbursed to its injured citizens or for their \nbenefit in a cy pres fund related to North Carolina victims or in conformity with the public policy \nestablished in section 1-267.10.  That is especially true where No rth Carolina is in the minority \nof states which recognize indirect purchaser standing.   \n{62} Class representatives and class counsel should see that (1) a fair share of damages is \nallocated to North Carolina, (2) victims receive da mages if possible, (3) cy pres funds bear some \nrelation to the class of victims, or (4) the North Carolina funds are distributed in accordance with \nsection 1-267.10.  At least in th e fallback position, the statute promotes access to the court \nsystem by North Carolina citizens.   \n{63} This Court reluctantly approves the dismissal of this action.  It do es so because it has \nheld that there is no standing and therefore no reason not to approve the payment of funds by the \nother defendants.  Neither Mr. Teague nor his c ounsel have adequately re presented the class in \nthis action.  Had they secured a settlement that distributed funds to North Carolina victims of the \nalleged violation or secu red a cy pres distribution in conform ity with the interests of the North \n 23\nCarolina class or North Carolina public policy as embodied in section 1-267.10 they would have \nfulfilled their obligation even if it was in the context of a multistate settlement.   \n{64} The Court hopes that in the future class c ounsel will become more attuned to the \ninterests of the class members and that either th e appellate courts or th e Legislature will bring \nsome rationality to a flawed process.   \n \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n{65} Based upon the foregoing, it  is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as \nfollows: \n1. Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED.  Plaintiff’s complaint against \nDefendants Crompton Corporation, Uniroyal Chemical Company, DSM \nCopolymer, Inc., DSM Elastomers Europe, B.V., and ExxonMobil Chemical \nCompany is hereby dismissed.     \n2.
