  "raw_text": " \n \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n19 CVS 21128 \n \nBUCKLEY LLP, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nSERIES 1 OF OXFORD \nINSURANCE COMPANY NC LLC, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON  \nMOTIONS TO COMPEL \n[Public]1 \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court on Plaintiff Buckley LLP’s (“Buckley”) \nMotion to Compel  (“Buckley’s Motion”), (ECF No. 75 ), and Defendant Series 1 of \nOxford Insurance Company NC LLC’s (“Oxford”) Motion to Compel Production of \nDocuments Withheld as Privileged (“ Oxford’s Motion”), (ECF No. 82 ), (together, the \n“Motions”).   \n2. The Motions put at issue whether certain email communications were \nproperly withheld from production by both parties on grounds of attorney -client \nprivilege and/or work product immunity.  Oxford’s Motion challenges whether \nBuckley, a law firm, may withhold certain email communications with the outside \nlaw firm Buckley retained  to investigate workplace misconduct allegations against \none of Buckley’s founders.  Buckley claims the outside firm was engaged in legal work \n \n1 Recognizing that this Order and Opinion cites and discusses communications that the \nparties contend are protected from disclosure due to the attorney-client privilege and/or work \nproduct doctrine, and out of an abundance of caution, the Court elected to file this Order and \nOpinion under seal on November 9 , 2019. The Court then permitted the parties an \nopportunity to propose redactions to the public version of this document. Neither Plaintiff \nnor Defendant proposed any redactions. \nBuckley LLP v. Series 1 of Oxford Ins. Co. NC LLC, 2020 NCBC 81. \nin connection with and separate from the investigation and thus that Buckley’s \nassertion of privilege is proper; Oxford disagrees , arguing that Buckley’s outside \ncounsel was not engaged in legal work  during or after the investigation .  Buckley’s \nMotion seeks production of certain email communications involving Oxford’s general \ncounsel.  Oxford argues that its general counsel’s communications were made in her \nlegal, not business, capacity, and thus are privileged; Buckley disagrees, contending \nthat these communications were made in the general counsel’s business role during  \nOxford’s claims review process and thus should be produced. \n3. After reviewing the Motions, the briefs in support of and in opposition to the \nMotions, the relevant materials associated with the Motions,  the arguments of \ncounsel at a hearing on the Motions, and the materials provided by the parties for the \nCourt’s in camera review , the Court, in the exercise of its discretion and for good \ncause shown, hereby rules on the Motions as set forth below.   \nWilliams & Connolly LLP, by William T. Burke, Elizabeth Wilson, and \nJohn K. Villa , McGuireWoods LLP , by Mark Kinghorn, and Buckley \nLLP, by Adam Miller, for Plaintiff Buckley LLP.  \n \nWomble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP, by James P. Cooney, Jonathan R. \nReich, Elizabeth J. Bondurant, James S. Derrick, and Marcey A. Selle, \nfor Defendant Series 1 of Oxford Insurance Company NC LLC. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n4. These findings of fact are made solely for the purpose of deciding the \nMotions.  Any findings of fact that are more appropriately considered conclusions of \nlaw are incorporated therein.  \n5. Buckley is a law firm located in Washington , D.C., and Oxford is an \ninsurance company.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1–2, ECF No. 56.)  This action concerns whether \ncoverage is available to Buckley under an insurance policy Oxford issued to Buckley \non December 29, 2017  that affords coverage to Buckley for certain  losses associated \nwith the departure of key revenue- generating partners (the “Policy”).  (Am. Compl. \nEx. A.)   \n6. Buckley filed its Complaint initiating this action on October 29, 2019, which \nit later amended on A ugust 4, 2020 , asserting claims against Oxford for breach of \ncontract, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of the duty of good faith and \nfair dealing, and tortious refusal to settle an insurance claim , all of which are based \non Oxford’s refusal to  provide coverage under the Policy  in connection with the \ndeparture from the firm of one of the firm’s founding partners, Andrew Sandler \n(“Sandler”), shortly after the Policy’s inception.  (Compl., ECF No. 3; Am. Compl.)     \n7. The facts concerning Buckley’s retention of an outside law firm and that \nfirm’s work for Buckley are relevant to the Court’s consideration of Oxford’s Motion.  \nLikewise, the facts concerning the work performed by Oxford’s general counsel are  \nsignificant to the resolution of Buckley’s Motion.  The Court discusses each below.   \n8. On December 15, 2017, three members of Buckley’s Executive Committee \nlearned of potential misconduct by Sandler.  (Ex. 1 – Excerpts Dep. John P. Kromer \n70:14–71:11, 73:23–74:6, ECF No. 86.1 ; see also Ex. 6 –  Buckley Notice Claim, at \nBUC015219, ECF No. 82.7.)  Both Buckley’s in-house general counsel and its outside \ncounsel were immediately contacted after the Executive  Committee met concerning \nthis information.  (Ex. 1 – Excerpts Dep. John P. Kromer 79:20–80:6.)   \n9. In response to the misconduct allegations against Sandler, the Executive \nCommittee engaged Latham & Watkins LLP (“Latham”) , a prominent national law \nfirm, on December 21, 2020 to investigate Sandler’s conduct.  (Ex. 1 – Excerpts Dep. \nJohn P. Kromer 82:2–4 (“[W]e decided that we should engage outside counsel to assist \nand conduct the investigation. ”); Ex. 3 – Buckley Engagement Letter Latham & \nWatkins, ECF No. 82.4; Ex. 6 – Buckley Notice Claim, at BUC015219 (“Latham was \nretained thereafter to conduct a confidential, independent investigation of  the \nallegation.”).)   \n10. An investigation into the alleged misconduct was required under Buckley’s \nfirm policies.  (Ex. 1 – Excerpts Dep. John P. Kromer  81:9–18 (“The policy required \nthat we investigate all allegations of harassment or other misconduct.  And so, you \nknow, we believed it was the right thing to do generally.  It also was consistent with \nwhat the firm handbook requires. ”); Ex. 13 –  Joint Decl. Benjamin  Klubes, John \nKromer, & Christopher Witeck ¶ 2 (“In the event of a complaint regarding potential \nharassment, the Harassment-Free Policy . . . requires [Buckley] to investigate: ‘All \nreported or reasonably suspected occurrences of harassment will be \ninvestigated . . . in a confidential manner and as promptly and thoroughly as is \npracticable and necessary.’ ”), ECF No. 92.5.)   \n11. The work Latham performed for Buckley is critical to the resolution of \nOxford’s Motion.  Latham’s engagement letter with Buckley  provided, “You have \nasked us to represent you in connection with an internal review of a personnel \nmatter.”  (Ex. 3 – Buckley Engagement Letter Latham & Watkins , at BUC015158.)  \nThe engagement letter further stated, “Our responsibilities under this agreement are \nto provide legal counsel and assistance to you in accordance with this letter[.]”  ( Ex. \n3 – Buckley Engagement Letter Latham & Watkins, at BUC015159.)   \n12. According to one of Latham ’s two principal partners  involved in the \ninvestigation, the engagement letter “was intended to cover a broad range of legal \nadvice and services that Latham might need to provide to Buckley in connection with \nthe allegations against Mr. Sandler.”  (Ex. 4 –  Decl. Jonathan C. Su ¶ 4, ECF No. \n86.4.)  This same Latham partner also avers that Latham was hired both to \ninvestigate the misconduct allegations and “to perform a number of legal functions in \nconnection with the investigation into the allegations against Mr. Sandler[.]”  ( Ex. 4 \n– Decl. Jonathan C. Su ¶ 3.)   In that regard, he asserts that “Latham continued to \nprovide legal advice to Buckley regarding some of these issues after the investigation \nof Mr. Sandler ended in February 2018.”  (Ex. 4 – Decl. Jonathan C. Su ¶ 3.)   \n13. For its part, Buckley has offered evidence that Latham was hired to “conduct \nan impartial investigation that was fair to all involved . . . while protecting the \nidentities of the women who had made allegations[.]”  (Ex. 13 – Joint Decl. Benjamin \nKlubes, John Kromer, & Christopher Witeck ¶ 3.)  Buckley agrees with Latham that \nthe scope of Latham’s representation included legal advice in addition to pure \ninvestigatory services.  ( See Ex. 1 –  Excerpts Dep. John P. Kromer 98:6 –14 (“In \naddition to conducting the investigation, we received legal advice . . . regarding \nwhether or not to continue the investigation following Mr. Sandler’s departure, or his \nannouncement of his departure.  We received advice regarding our policies and \nprocedures related to sexual harassment and personal misconduct.”).)   \n14. Latham’s partner also declares that  “Latham reasonably anticipated from \nthe outset of the investigation that there might be potential litigation against \n[Buckley] as a result of the alleg ations, and therefore, investigated the facts and \nconducted legal research and analysis regarding potential claims to prepare for any \nsuch litigation[,]” (Ex. 4 – Decl. Jonathan C. Su ¶ 5), although it does not appear that \nBuckley had a view whether litigation was likely at the time of the investigation, (see \nEx. 6 – Excerpts Dep. Christopher Witeck 268:15–16 (“[W]e still didn’t have a sense \nof what [the] potential exposure to the firm was.”), ECF No. 86.6.)      \n15. Rather than participate in the investigation, Sandler decided to depart from \nBuckley.\n2  He executed a Retirement Agreement with Buckley which became effective \non February 26, 2018.  ( Ex. 6  – Buckley Notice Claim, at BUC015220 .)  The  \ninvestigation was subsequently closed at the end of February 2018.  Latham did not \nprepare and deliver factual findings in connection with the investigation  but \ncontinued to provide services to Buckley through May 2018 .  (Ex. 6 – Excerpts Dep. \n \n2 Whether Sandler’s departure from Buckley was voluntary or involuntary is a hotly disputed \nissue in this case. \nChris Witeck 267:1 –6, 267:15–20, 268:7–22 (“Q.  A ll right.  Well, after Mr. Sandler \nsigned the document labeled retirement agreement on February 25, 2018, was there \nanything further for Latham to investigate? . . .  A.  Look there were lots of different \nthings. . . .  [W]e took some time and evaluated al l these different scenarios, risks, \ncomponents, however you want to characterize it, before the investigation was \nclosed.”).)   \n16. On March 7, 2018, Buckley notified Oxford of its claim under the Policy  “due \nto the . . . impending retirement of . . . Sandler[.]”  (Ex. 9 – Buckley Notice Anticipated \nClaim, at OXF0020593,  ECF No. 82.10.)  Some months later, on October 19, 2018 , \nBuckley submitted a Claim Submission (the “Claim”), indicating that Sandler’s \ndeparture from Buckley was voluntary as stated in the Retirement Agreement.  (Ex. \n6 – Buckley Notice Claim, at BUC015220.)    \n17. Afterwards, a team at Oxford that included Oxford’s in-house general  \ncounsel, Susan Euteneuer (“Euteneuer”) , reviewed whether the Claim was covered \nby the Policy.  ( Ex. 6 – Aff. Susan M. Euteneuer ¶ 7 (“I am a member of the Claim \nReview Committee with Mary Claire Goff, President of the Taft Companies, and \nOxford’s Managing Member, Michael DiMayo.”), ECF No. 84.7; Ex. 2 – Excerpt Dep. \nSusan Euteneuer 184:2–185:3 (“So, at this point in time, the pivotal question was, \ncould this be a covered claim?  And that was the question that we then reviewed in \norder to do that gatekeeping role[.]”), 185:4– 11 (“Q.  And who was involved in that \nprocess?  A.  Mike DiMayo, me, Mary Claire Goff, I believe Paul Francisco.  And this \nwas not a coverage determination, per se, but really just a gatekeeping role. ”), ECF \nNo. 84.3.)  \n18. Euteneuer’s role in this review—whether legal or business—is critical to the \ndetermination of Buckley’s Motion.  At the time Buckley submitted the Claim, Oxford \ndid not have a formal claims department, and Euteneuer never formally acted solely \nas a claims adjuster, investigator, or manager .  (Ex. 6 –  Aff. Susan M. Euteneuer ¶ \n6.)3  During the pendency of the Claim, however, Euteneuer wore two “hats,” a legal \nrole as Oxford’s general counsel  and a business role with  authority to approve \ncoverage and resolve claims.  (Exs. Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel  Ex. 7, at 26:9– 17, \n116:3–10, 118:8–19; see also Ex. 2 – Excerpts Dep. Susan Euteneuer 187:18–21 (“So \nI . . . do have two roles.”); Ex. 4 – Oxford Claims Manual, at OXF00000211, ECF No. \n84.5.)   \n19. Oxford’s Chief Financial Officer  testified that Euteneuer’s claims review \nrole is not considered a legal function within the company.  (Exs. Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nCompel Ex. 7, at 141:9–11.)  For her part, Euteneuer testified that she “give[s] advice \nto the company[,]” never taking off her “lawyer hat,” even in th e initial evaluation \nstage regarding claims.  (Ex. 2 – Excerpt Dep. Susan Euteneuer 185:6–188:4; see also \nEx. 6 –  Aff. Susan M. Euteneuer ¶  5 (“My responsibilities include providing legal \nadvice and analysis in all aspects of the operations of these companies.”).)   \n20. In the fall of 2018, Buckley pressed Oxford to conduct an initial review and \ndetermination of its Claim so it could receive payment by year-end.  (Ex. 6 –  Aff. \n \n3 Oxford subsequently created a claims department consisting of Euteneuer and one other \nperson.  (Exs. Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel Ex. 7, at 21:3–5, ECF No. 76.1.) \nSusan M. Euteneuer ¶ 9; see also  Ex. 2 – Excerpt Dep. Susan Euteneuer 188:9 –21.)  \nOxford’s review team conclude d then that the  Claim should be covered .  (Ex. 5 – \nExcerpts Dep. Michael DiMayo 212:4 –213:1, ECF No. 84.6.)  Soon thereafter, \nhowever, on October 22, 2018, Oxford received a letter from Sandler stating that it \n“would be inappropriate” to pay Buckley’s Claim because his departure was not a \n“ ‘voluntary retirement’ as set forth in the [P]olicy.”  (Ex. 7 – London Letter Oct. 22, \n2018, ECF No. 84.8.)  This new information, together with Oxford’s ongoing inability \nto determine the specific amount of Buckley’s net loss, caused Oxford to seek and \nobtain a third-party review of the Claim.  (Ex. 6 – Aff. Susan M. Euteneuer ¶ 10; see \nalso Ex. 5 – Excerpts Dep. Michael DiMayo 269:4–21.)   \n21. Oxford never paid Buckley’s Claim, and Buckley eventually filed suit.  \n(Compl.)  Soon after filing, on November 12, 2019 , Buckley served its First Set of \nRequests for Production of Documents to Defendant Oxford.  Buckley’s request sought \ndocuments related to Oxford’s review of Buckley’s  Claim, including Oxford’s file on \nthe Claim  and all documents and communications reflecting Oxford’s inte rnal \ndeliberations concerning the Claim.  (Exs. Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel Ex. 1.)   \n22. On May 1, 2020, Oxford produced two privilege logs , which were later \nrevised on July 17, 2020, listing responsive documents that Oxford had withheld from \nproduction or redacted.  The logs identified several communications about the Claim \ninvolving Euteneuer which Oxford withheld as privileged.  (Exs. Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nCompel Exs. 9 –10.)  Buckley challenged Oxford’s position as to these specific \ncommunications, (Exs. P l.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel  Ex. 2), and although Oxford \nsubsequently produced some additional communications after further review , (Exs. \nPl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel Exs. 4–6), the parties reached an impasse concerning the \nproduction of additional documents from among those Oxford has withheld as \nprivileged, (Exs. Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel Exs. 12–13).   \n23. On December 18, 2019, Oxford served its First Set of Requests for \nProduction of Documents to Buckley .  Oxford’s requests  sought, in part, documents \nand communication s between Buckley and Latham concerning the Sandler \ninvestigation and reflecting whether Buckley believed Sandler would eventually have \nto leave the firm.  (Ex. 10 – Oxford’s First Set Reqs. Produc. Docs., ECF No. 82.11.)   \n24. Buckley objected to producing any communications between Buckley and \nLatham on both attorney-client privilege  and work product grounds .  (Ex. 11  – \nBuckley’s Objection Resp. Oxford’s First Set Reqs . Produc. Docs., ECF No. 82.12 .)  \nBuckley later produced  a privilege log on May 7, 2020 listing these withheld  \ncommunications.  (Ex. 1 – Buckley Latham Privilege Log Dated 05.07.2020, ECF No. \n82.2; see also Ex. 2 – Docs. Oxford Moves Compel, ECF No. 82.3.)  The parties’ further \nnegotiations did not lead to the production of any of these documents.   \n25. Having exhausted their efforts at compromise, the parties submitted \ndiscovery dispute summaries pursuant to Business Court Rule 10.9 —Buckley’s on \nAugust 21, 2020 and Oxford’s on August 28, 2020.  The Court thereafter permitted \neach party to file the Motions with supporting briefs and materials. \n26. Buckley has identified the withheld documents it seeks at Exhibits 12 and \n13 of its Exhibits to Plaintiff’s Brief in Supp ort of Motion to Compel  (the “Oxford \nCommunications”).  (ECF No. 76.1 .)  Oxford has identified the documents it claims \nBuckley has improperly withheld at Exhibit 2 – Documents Oxford Moves to Compel \n(the “Buckley Communications” ; together with the Oxford Communications, the \n“Communications”).  (ECF No. 82.3.) \n27. After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motions via \nvideoconference on October 6, 2020  (the “Hearing”) , at which all parties were \nrepresented by counsel.   \n28. After the Hearing, the Court concluded, in the exercise of its discretion and \nfor good cause shown, that an in camera review of the Communications was \nwarranted and issued an order to that effect on October 12, 2020.  (ECF No. 89.)  The \nparties thereafter submitted the Communications to the Court for in camera review \non October 15 (Oxford) and October 17 (Buckley) .  The Court has now completed its \nreview,4 and the Motions are therefore ripe for resolution.   \nII. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n29. Any conclusions of law that are more appropriately considered findings of \nfact are incorporated therein.   \n30. Each party contends  that the other party has improperly withheld from \nproduction documents on grounds of attorney-client privilege and/or work -product \nimmunity.  (Pl.’s Mot. Compel, ECF No. 75; Def. Series 1 Oxford Insurance Company \nNC, LLC Mot. Compel Produc. Docs. Withheld Privileged, ECF No. 73.)   \n \n4 The in camera review materials have not been filed on the Court's docket but have been \nretained and can be made a part of the court record in the event of an appeal. \nA. Attorney-Client Privilege  \n31. Buckley argues that Oxford has improperly withheld communications as \nprivileged in which Euteneuer was acting in a business role as part of Oxford’s \nprocessing of Buckley’s Claim  rather than in her role as the company’s general \ncounsel providing legal advice .  (Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Compel 7 –12, ECF No. 76.)  \nBuckley contends that the “central feature of Oxford’s ordinary business as an \ninsurance company is claims processing, and by its very nature, claims processing \ninvolves fact -finding, reviewing the terms of the insurance policy to determine \nwhether there is coverage f or a given set of facts, and assessing business factors \nassociated with processing claims[,]” which “is far from a solely legal inquiry.”  (Pl.’s \nBr. Supp. Mot. Compel 9.)   \n32. Seeking a similar result, Oxford contends that Latham’s investigation of \nSandler involved “a single interview of a person with direct knowledge, and ended \nwhen Sandler withdrew from [Buckley,]” and that “the primary purpose of the \ninvestigation was [related to] the day-to-day operations of [the] business[.]”  (Mem. \nSeries 1 Oxford Insurance Company NC, LLC Supp. Mot. Compel Produc.  Docs. \nWithheld Privileged 8 , ECF No. 83 .)  As such, Oxford argues that Latham was not \ninvolved in providing legal advice and that the communications between Buckley and \nLatham therefore are not privileged.  (Mem. Series 1 Oxford Insurance Company NC, \nLLC Supp. Mot. Compel Produc. Docs. Withheld Privileged 7–9.)   \n33. The Supreme Court of North Carolina has recognized a five -part test to \ndetermine when the attorney-client privilege applies to a communication: \n(1) the relation of attorney and client existed at the time the \ncommunication was made, (2) the communication was made in \nconfidence, (3) the communication relates to a matter about which the \nattorney is being professionally  consulted, (4) the communication was \nmade in the course of giving or seeking legal advice for a proper purpose \nalthough litigation need not be contemplated and (5) the client has not \nwaived the privilege. \n \nIn re Miller, 357 N.C. 316, 335, 584 S.E.2d 772, 786 (2003) (quoting State v. McIntosh, \n336 N.C. 517, 523–24, 444 S.E.2d 438, 442 (1994)).  “If any one of these five elements \nis not present in any portion of an attorney-client communication, that portion of the \ncommunication is not privileged.”  Id.  “The burden is always on the party asserting \nthe privilege to demonstrate each of its essential elements.”  Id. at 336, 584 S.E.2d at \n787 (citation omitted).   \n34. Importantly, a  client and its counsel “ may not avail themselves of the \nprotection afforded by the attorney -client privilege if the attorney was not acting as \na legal advisor when the communication was made. ”  Evans v. United Servs. Auto. \nAss’n, 142 N.C. App. 18, 32, 541 S.E.2d 782, 791 (2001); see also United States ex rel. \nThomas v. Duke Univ. , No. 1:17 -CV-276, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150001, at *18 \n(M.D.N.C. Sep t. 4, 2018)  (“[W]hen an attorney does non -legal work for a client, \ncommunications in connection with that non-legal work are not privileged.”); Henson \nv. Wyeth Labs., Inc., 118 F.R.D. 584, 587 (W.D. Va. 1987) (“[I]n order for the privilege \nto apply, the attorney receiving the communication must be acting as an attorney and \nnot simply as a business advisor.”).5   \n35. Accordingly, “[b]usiness advice, such as financial advice or discussion \nconcerning business negotiations, is not privileged.”  Window World of Baton Rouge, \n2019 NCBC LEXIS 54, at *65 (quoting N.C. Elec. Membership Corp. v. Carolina \nPower & Light Co. , 110 F.R.D. 511, 517 (M.D.N.C.  1986)).  “When communications \ncontain intertwined business and legal advice, courts consider whether the ‘primary \npurpose’ of the communication was to seek or provide legal advice[,]” id. at *66, and \ntherefore, “[c]orporate documents prepared for simultan eous review by legal and \nnonlegal personnel are often held to be not privileged because they are not shown to \nbe communications made for the primary purpose of seeking legal advice[,]” N.C. Elec. \nMembership Corp., 110 F.R.D. at 514.   \n36. In addition, “simply copying an attorney on a communication does not cloak \nthat communication with the attorney-client privilege.”  McAirlaids, Inc. v. Kimberly-\nClark Corp., No. 7:13-CV-193, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 201138, at *12 (W.D. Va. Sept. \n26, 2014).  In general, “courts are obligated to strictly construe the privilege and limit \nit to the purpose for which it exists.”  Evans, 142 N.C. App. at 31, 541 S.E.2d at 790. \n37. Based on its in camera review, t he Court concludes that many of the \nCommunications have been improperly withheld as privileged because the “primary \n \n5 “In defining the contours . . . to the attorney -client privilege, the Supreme Court of North \nCarolina has recognized that it is appropriate to look to federal case law for guidance.”  \nWindow World of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc. , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 54, at *42 \nn.29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 16, 2019) (citing Miller, 357 N.C. at 330, 584 S.E.2d at 783).   \npurpose” of these communications was not “to seek or provide legal advice.”  The \nCourt will address each set of Communications in turn.   \n1. Oxford Communications  \n38. The North Carolina courts have made clea r that, “although the protection \ngiven to communications between attorney and client apply equally to in -house \ncounsel, an insurance company and its counsel may not avail themselves of the \nprotection afforded by the attorney -client privilege if the attorne y was not acting as \na legal advisor when the communication was made.”  Id.  at 32, 541 S.E.2d at 791 \n(citations omitted); see also, e.g., Morris v. Scenera Research, LLC, 2011 NCBC LEXIS \n34, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 26, 2011) (“When the in-house counsel’s legal advice \nis merely incidental to business advice, the privilege does not apply.”); MSF Holding, \nLtd. v. Fiduciary Tr. Co. Int’l , No. 03 Civ. 1818 (PKL) (JCF) , 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n34171, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2005) (“ In-house counsel often  fulfill the dual role of \nlegal advisor and business consultant.   Accordingly, to determine whether counsel’s \nadvice is privileged, we look to whether the attorney’s performance depends \nprincipally on her knowledge of or application of legal requirements or principles, \nrather than her expertise in matters of commercial practice.” (citations, internal \nquotation marks, and brackets omitted)).   \n39. In particular, the privilege will not cloak communications involving an \ninsurance company’s counsel when that counsel is acting in a business role, including \nin the insurer’s routine processing of insurance claims.  See, e.g., Harper v. Auto -\nOwners Ins. Co. , 138 F.R.D. 655, 671 (S.D. Ind. 1991) (“To the extent that this \nattorney acted as a claims adjuster, claims process supervisor, or claim investigation \nmonitor, and not as a legal adviser, the attorney -client privilege would not apply .”); \nsee also, e.g., Menapace v. Alaska Nat ’l Ins. Co. , Civil Action No. 20 -cv-00053-REB-\nSTV, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191695, at *32 n.11 (D. Colo. Oct. 15, 2020) (“[W]here an \nattorney is acting as a  claims adjuster, he is performing a business function rather \nthan providing legal advice and thus his communications related to those activities \nare not privileged. ”); Mission Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Lilly , 112 F.R.D. 160, 163 (D. Minn. \n1986) (“To the extent that [lawyers]  acted as claims adjusters, then, their work -\nproduct, communications to client, and impressions about the facts will be treated \nherein as the ordinary business of plaintiff, outside the scope of the asserted \nprivileges.”).   \n40. The evidence before the Court shows that Euteneuer ha d a substantial \nbusiness role at Oxford in reviewing and processing claims for payment and engaged \nin that business role in connection with the Buckley Claim.  While certain Oxford \nCommunications involving Euteneuer reflect the  primary purpose of giving and \nreceiving legal advice, most show that Euteneuer’s sole or primary role in connection \nwith the communication was in her business role of reviewing Buckley’s Claim in the \nordinary course of Oxford’s business .  The Court conclu des that all such ordinary - \ncourse-of-business Oxford Communications are not protected by the attorney -client \nprivilege. \n41. The Court has set forth at Appendix A its conclusions concerning the specific \nOxford Communications at issue on Buckley’s Motion  and shall order Oxford to \nproduce those communications the Court has concluded are not privileged.   \n2. Buckley Communications \n42. Generally, when materials are created “in the  ordinary course of business” \nand “pursuant to [company] policy,” they are available f or discovery .  Fulmore v. \nHowell, 189 N.C. App. 93, 104, 657 S.E.2d 437, 444 (2008) (citations omitted); see also, \ne.g., Shaffer v. Nw. Mut. Life Ins. Co., Civil Action No. 5:05CV1 (STAMP), 2006 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 59294, at *13 (N.D.W. Va. Aug. 21, 2006)  (“This Court finds that this \ndocument was prepared in the ordinary course of business . . . .  Thus, this document \nis not protected by the attorney -client privilege because it was not prepared for the \npurposes of seeking, obtaining[,] or providing legal assistance.”).   \n43. This principle applies in the context of corporate investigations, so an \ninvestigating attorney’s communications in the course of an investigation are not \nnecessarily cloaked with privilege.  See, e.g., Thomas, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150001, \nat *19 (“[T]he participation of counsel in an internal investigation does not \n‘automatically cloak the investigation with legal garb. ’ ” (quoting In re Grand Jury \nSubpoena, 599 F.2d 504, 511 (2d Cir. 1979))); see also, e.g., In re Allen, 106 F.3d 582, \n602 (4th Cir. 1997) (“[N]ot all communications between an attorney and client during \nattorney-conducted investigations constitute  legal work entitled to attorney-client \nprivilege.”); Koumoulis v. Indep. Fin. Mktg. Grp. , 29 F. Supp. 3d 142, 146 (E.D.N.Y. \n2014) (“[T]he mere fact that a communication is made directly to an attorney . . . does \nnot mean that the communication is necessarily privileged, and  . . . [i]nvestigatory \nreports and materials are not protected by the attorney -client privilege . . . merely \nbecause they are provided to, or prepared by, counsel. ” (citations and internal \nquotation marks omitted)). \n44. Nevertheless, “[t]he relevant question is not  whether [an attorney]  was \nretained to conduct an investigation, but rath er, whether this investigation was \n‘related to the rendition of legal  services.’ ” Allen, 106 F.3d at  603 (quoting Dunn v. \nState Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 927 F.2d 869, 875 (5th Cir. 1991)); see also In re Kellogg \nBrown & Root, Inc., 756 F.3d 754, 758–59 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“So long as obtaining or \nproviding legal advice was one of the significant purposes of the internal \ninvestigation, the attorney-client privilege applies[.]”); cf. United States v. Rowe, 96 \nF.3d 1294, 1297 (9th Cir. 1996) (“Where the attorney [conducting an investigation] \nwas asked for business (as opposed to  legal) counsel, no privilege attached.”); Moore \nv. Dan Holdings, Inc., No. 1:12CV503, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61378, at *16 (M.D.N.C. \nApr. 30, 2013) (holding attorney-client privilege applies when the defendant “retained \ncounsel not to conduct an investigation as part of the normal course of business, but \nrather that he retained counsel to provide legal advice.”).     \n45. The evidence before the Court shows , as Buckley argues,  that the Sandler \ninvestigation was an unprecedented event in the life of the Buckley firm.  The \nevidence also makes clear, however, that the investigation Buckley retained Latham \nto perform was one required under Buckley’s firm policies  as part of Buckley’s \ninternal complaint procedure, (Ex. 13 – Joint Decl. Benjamin Klubes, John Kromer, \n& Christopher Witeck ¶ 2 (“All reported or reasonably suspected occurrences of \nharassment will be investigated [by Buckley] . . . in a confidential manner a nd as \npromptly and thoroughly as is practicable and necessary.”) ), and consistent with \nBuckley’s business practice, ( Ex. 1 –  Excerpts Dep. John P. Kromer 81:9– 18 (“[W]e \nbelieved [an investigation] was the right thing to do generally.  It also was consistent \nwith what the firm handbook requires.”)).    \n46. As such, the evidence shows that the investigation was initiated and \npursued in the ordinary course of Buckley’s business, and , contrary to Buckley’s \ncontentions, the fact that Buckley hired a prominent outside law firm to conduct the \ninvestigation does not change this fact .  While a Latham partner involved in the \ninvestigation offers affidavit testimony  that Latham performed legal functions  in \nconnection with the investigation of Sandler, that testimony on its own does not serve \nto cloak all of Latham’s investigatory work with attorney -client privilege.  See, e.g ., \nAllen v. TV One, LLC, Civil Action No. DKC 15-1960, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169641, \nat *11 –12 (D. Md. D ec. 8, 2016) (attorney ’s statement that her “work sometimes \ninvolved conducting and overseeing Company investigations based on [her]  legal \nexpertise and solely in [her]  capacity as in-house counsel” insufficient for privilege); \ncf. Allen, 106 F.3d at 604–05 (highlighting evidence beyond an attorney’s statement \nin finding attorney-client privilege during an investigation).   \n47. And while the engagement letter also suggests Latham was to provide legal \ncounsel in connection with the investigation, “an engagement letter cannot reclassify \nnonprivileged communications as ‘legal services’ in order to invoke the attorney-client \nprivilege[.]”  Sandra T.E. v. S. Berwyn Sch. Dist. 100 , 600 F.3d 612, 620 (7th Cir. \n2009).   \n48. The Court’s in camera review of the Buckley Communications shows that \nmany were made to or by Latham  solely or primarily in furtherance of its  \ninvestigation into Sandler’s alleged misconduct  in accordance with Buckley’s firm \npolicies and were unrelated to the rendition of lega l services.  The Court concludes \nthat these Buckley Communications are not privileged and should be produced.  That \nsaid, it is also clear from the evidence presented that Buckley retained Latham to \nprovide legal services apart from its investigative effor ts.  Many of the Buckley \nCommunications reflect a primary purpose of  giving or receiving legal advice.  The \nCourt concludes these Buckley C ommunications are privileged and have been \nproperly withheld. \n49. Of special note are three specific sets of documents that Buckley has \nwithheld as privileged.   \n50. First, Buckley has withheld a number of communications involving Buckley, \nLatham, and SKDKnickerbocker, a public relations firm retained by Buckley to \nadvise in connection with Sandler’s  departure.  The Court concludes that these \nBuckley Communications are properly withheld as privileged to the extent they were \nmade to facilitate or assist in the rendering of legal advice to Buckley.  See, e.g., MLC \nAuto., LLC v. Town of S. Pines , No. 1:05cv1078, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2841, at * 13 \n(M.D.N.C. Jan. 11, 2007) (“[F]or the same reasons that communications of corporate \nofficers and employees are protected by the  attorney-client privilege, so are \ncommunications of a corporation’s third-party consultants where the communications \nare made to facilitate or assist in the rendition of legal services, or to provide the \nconsultants legal advice and strategies formulated by counsel so that the consultant \ncan carry out related tasks on behalf of the client.”).  \n51. Next, Buckley has withheld as privileged several communications \ncontaining Latham’s invoices for its services between December 2017 and May 2018.  \n“Typically, the attorney-client privilege does not extend to billing records and expense \nreports.”  Chaudhry v. Gallerizzo, 174 F.3d 394, 402 (4th Cir. 1999).  It is only when \nan invoice “reveal[s] the motive of the client in seeking representation, litigation \nstrategy, or the specific nature of the services provided, such as researching \nparticular areas of law” that makes it privileged.   Id. (quoting Clarke v. Am . Com. \nNat’l Bank, 974 F.2d 127, 129 (9th Cir. 1992)).  The Court therefore will find privilege \nonly to the extent these Buckley Communications reflect such information.   \n52. Finally, Buckley has withheld as privileged a large number of emails that \nconcern the scheduling of various calls and meetings  and similar non -substantive \nmatters.  Such communications are not privileged unless they reflect the seek ing or \nrendering of legal advice.  See, e.g., Rossman v. EN Eng’g, LLC, No. 19 C 5768, 2020 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 186429, at *13 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 8 , 2020) (holding that “defendant ’s \nclaims of privilege  that cover emails  scheduling phone conferences, asking for a \ndocument, and excha nging pleasantries are somehow confidential or examples of \nhaving sought legal advice are meritless”); Kleeberg  v. Eber, No. 16-CV-9517 (LAK) \n(KHP), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80428, at *60 (S.D.N.Y May 13, 2019) ( holding that \n“email communications that merely seek to schedule  a call regarding a legal matter \nare not privileged so long as they do not convey or seek legal advice”) ; In re MI \nWindows & Doors, Inc., Case No. 2:12-mn-00001, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63392, at *9 \n(D. S.C. May 3, 2013) (holding that an “email indicating a meeting request . . . is not \nprivileged”).  Few of the withheld emails of this sort reflect the seeking or providing \nof legal advice, and except as to those that do, the Court will order that these Buckley \nCommunications must be produced.   \n53. The Court has set forth at Appendix B its conclusions concerning the specific \nBuckley Communications at issue on Oxford’s Motion and shall order Buckley  to \nproduce those communications the Court has concluded are not privileged.   \nB. Work Product Doctrine \n54. Buckley seeks to protect a number of the Buckley Communications due to  \nwork-product immunity.6  Unlike the attorney-client privilege, “[t]he protection given \nto matters prepared in anticipation of trial, or ‘work product,’ is not a privilege, but a \n‘qualified immunity.’ ”  Evans, 142 N.C. App. at 28, 541 S.E.2d at 788 (quoting Willis \nv. Power Co., 291 N.C. 19, 35, 229 S.E.2d 191, 201 (1976)).  “The work product doctrine \nprotects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation from discovery.”  Sessions v.  \nSloane, 248 N.C. App. 370, 383, 789 S.E.2d 844, 855 (2016).  As is the case with \nattorney-client privilege, “[t]he party asserting work product protection bears the \nburden of proof of establishing entitlement to it.”  Suggs v. Whitaker, 152 F.R.D. 501, \n \n6 Oxford does not withhold any of the Oxford Communications on this ground. \n \n505 (M.D.N.C. 1993). 7  “[I]t is incumbent  upon the party to come forward with a \nspecific demonstration of facts supporting the requested protection.”  Id.   “ ‘Because \nwork product protection by its nature may hinder an investigation into the true facts, \nit should be narrowly construed consistent with its purpose[,]’ which is to ‘safeguard \nthe lawyer’s work in developing his client’s case.’ ”  Evans, 142 N.C. App. at 29, 541 \nS.E.2d at 789 (quoting Suggs, 152 F.R.D. at 505).   \n55. For the work product doctrine to apply, “[materials] must be prepared  \nbecause of the prospect of  litigation when the preparer faces an actual claim or a \npotential claim following an actual event or series of events that reasonably could \nresult in litigation.”  Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co. , 967 F.2d \n980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992).  Where, as in this case, employee misconduct is alleged,  “it \ncan be expected that designated personnel will conduct investigations, not only out of \na concern for future litigation, but also to prevent reoccurrences, to improve \nsafety . . . , and to respond to regulatory obligations.”  Id.   \n56. Indeed, the work product doctrine does not apply to materials that “would \nhave been created in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.”  United \nStates v. Adlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1202 (2d Cir. 1998); see also, e.g., Cook v. Wake Cty. \nHosp. S ys., 125 N.C. App. 618, 625 , 482 S.E.2d 546, 551–52 (1997) (finding an \ninvestigatory report not protectable work product where the “report would have been \ncompiled, pursuant to [its] policy, regardless of whether . . . litigation was ever \n \n7 “Decisions under the  federal rules are . . . pertinent for  guidance and enlightenment in \ndeveloping the philosophy of the North Carolina rules[,]” including Rule 26(b)(3) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure, which defines the work product doctrine.  Turner v. Duke \nUniv., 325 N.C. 152, 164, 381 S.E.2d 706, 713 (1989).   \nanticipated”); RLI Ins. Co. v. Conseco, Inc., 477 F. Supp. 2d 741, 750 (E.D. Va. 2007) \n(“While RLI did hire outside counsel to interface with Conseco, hiring outside counsel \ndoes not excuse RLI from its duty to investigate insurance claims.  RLI submitted no \nspecific evidence that it would have conducted the . . . investigation differently had \nno litigation been anticipated.”) ; cf. In re Capital One Consumer Data Sec. Breach \nLitig., No. 1:19md2915 (AJT/JFA), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112177, at *7 (E.D. Va. \nJune 25, 2020) (“[W]here . . . the relevant document may be used for both litigation \nand business purposes, the court must determine the driving force behind the \npreparation of the requested document.” (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted)).   \n57. The evidence of record does not suggest that the Buckley Communications \nwere made because of anticipated litigation arising from Sandler’s misconduct.  None \nof the Buckley Communications mentions or discusses the prospect of litigation.  \nLatham’s engagemen t letter does not mention anticipated litigation.  No Buckley \nattorney has testified that litigation was feared or contemplated.  The only evidence \nsuggesting that litigation was anticipated from the Sandler investigation is Latham’s \nOctober 2020 affidavit to this effect.  ( See Ex. 4 – Decl. Jonathan C. Su ¶ 5 (“ Based \non past experience with sexual harassment investigations, Latham reasonably \nanticipated from the outset of the investigation that there might be potential \nlitigation[.]”).)  And that affidavit does not show that the investigation would have \nproceeded, or the Buckley Communications would have been made, differently in any \nrespect had litigation not been anticipated.  This is insufficient to carry Buckley’s \nburden. \n58. The Court therefore concludes that none of the Buckley Communications is \nproperly withheld based on the work product doctrine. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n59. The Court has applied its findings of fact and conclusions of law to each of \nthe Communications, and, as noted above, has set forth its conclusions concerning its \ndetermination of privilege as to each document on the attached Appendices A and B.8   \n60. WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, and in the exercise of its \ndiscretion, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: \na. Buckley’s Motion is  GRANTED in part  and DENIED in part .  \nOxford shall produce those Oxford Communications the Court has \nidentified in Appendix A as non -privileged within thirty-five (35) \ndays of the entry of this Order.   \nb. Oxford’s Motion is  GRANTED in part and  DENIED in part .  \nBuckley shall produce those Buckley Communications the Court has \nidentified in Appendix B as non-privileged within thirty -five (35) \ndays of the entry of this Order.   \n \n8 The Court has written this Order and Opinion, including Appendices A and B, to avoid \ndisclosure of the substantive content of any of the Communications.  All  of the \nCommunications, however, are identified by Bates number and are availabl e for review in \nthe event of an appeal. \nc. Oxford and Buckley shall serve revised and updated privilege logs in \nlight of the Court’s ruling s herein within thirty-five (35) days of the \nentry of this Order.9 \n SO ORDERED, this the 9th day of November, 2020 \n   \n      /s/ Louis A.

While a motion to reconsider will \nlikely result in a swifter resolution than an appeal, the Court reminds the parties that this \nCourt, relying on federal law, has concluded that the permitted grounds for reconsideration \nare “fairly narrow[,]”  In re Se.
