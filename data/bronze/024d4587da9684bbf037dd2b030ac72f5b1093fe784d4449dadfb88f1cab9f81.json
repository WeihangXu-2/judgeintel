Lincoln and Kevin L. Pratt, for Plaintiff \nVizant Technologies, LLC. \n \n \n \nStrauch Green & Mistretta, P.C., by Jack M. Strauch and Jessie Charles \nFontenot, for Defendant YRC Worldwide Inc. \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \n \nI. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n3. This action arises out of a n alleged breach of a  Professional Services \nAgreement (“PSA”) between Vizant and YRC.   Under the PSA, Vizant contracted to \n“perform an evaluation, assessment and customized analytical review” of the \n“Financial Payments” YRC receives and to “identify, indicate and quantify specific \nand actionable strategies and solutions” that would reduce YRC’s costs associated \nwith those payments.   (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J.  Ex. 2 § 2 [hereinafter \n“PSA”], ECF No. 84.3.)   The PSA contemplated that YRC would provide certain \nspecified information to Vizant and that Vizant would present its recommendations \nto YRC in a written  report.  (PSA §§ 2, 13.)  In exchange for Vizant’s services, YRC \nwas to pay Vizant a percentage of YRC’s savings associated with the strategies and \nsolutions identified by Vizant .  (PSA § 10.)  Vizant alleges that YRC breached the \nPSA.  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 84.) \n4. When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the Court does not make \nfindings of fact, but “it is helpful to the parties and the courts for the trial judge to \narticulate a summary of the material facts which he con siders are not at issue [.]”  \nHyde Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142, 215 S.E.2d 162, \n165 (1975).  The following factual summary is uncontested.  \n \n \nA. Factual Summary \n5. YRC is the parent company of several freight enterprises that operate \nthroughout North America.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3, ECF No. 88.)  These \nsubsidiaries include YRC Freight, USF Holland, USF Reddaway, and New Penn \nMotor Express.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3.)  A significant percentage of YRC’s \ncustomers pay for shipping services by credit card.   (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. \n3.)  With an annual operating revenue in the billions , (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. \nSumm. J. 1), YRC incurs millions of dollars in credit card processing costs each year, \n(Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3) .  At all times relevant to this lawsuit , YRC has \nbeen looking for ways to reduce these costs.  (Whitsel Dep. 29:8–23, ECF No. 96.) \n6. Vizant alleges that it is an out -of-state LLC with its principal place of \nbusiness in Mecklen burg County, North Carolina.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 23.)   \nVizant provides consulting services to help clients lower their payment processing \ncosts.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 1.)   \n7. On July 7, 2014, Bob Hughes  (“Hughes”), a salesperson for Vizant, cold-\ncalled Todd Wilson (“Wilson”), director of revenue management for YRC, to discuss a \npossible services agreement between Vizant and YRC.   (Wilson Dep. 83:5 –16, ECF \nNo. 95 ; Hughes Dep. 37:6 –20, ECF No. 114 .)  Wilson recalls that, o n their initial \nphone call, Hughes pitched the services agreement as  a “pay-for-performance” deal.  \n(Wilson Dep. 323 –24.)  Following the call, Hughes sent Wilson a follow -up email \ninforming Wilson that Vizant had “patented technology” that would help YRC reduce \nits credit card costs.  (July 7, 2014 Correspondence, ECF No. 133.)   \n \n \n8. Two days later, Hughes and another Vizant employee, Keith Gallagher, met \nwith Wilson and another YRC employee, Scott Lopez.  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. 4, at 2, ECF No. 84.5.)  At this meeting, Wilson told Hughes about the \nmethods YRC already had in place to encourage its customers to switch from credit \ncard payments to Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) batch payments—a lower cost \nform of payment .  (Lopez Aff. ¶5, ECF No. 101.)  These methods included, among \nother things , charging customers a fee for credit card payments and offering \nincentives to switch from credit card to ACH .  (Lopez Aff. ¶5 .)  As the meeting \nconcluded, Vizant gave a draft of the PSA to YRC.  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. \nJ. Ex. 4, at 3.)   \n9. On August 13, 2014, Wilson emailed Hughes requesting an electronic \nversion of the draft PSA so that YRC could more easily evaluate the PSA’s terms .  \n(Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4, at 2.)  Hughes promptly sent Wilson a copy \nof the PSA in “redline form” for editing.  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4, at \n1.)  Two months later , YRC gave its initial PSA revisions to Vizant, requesting \nchanges to client data terms as well as modifications to provisions concerning \n“information obligations, payment terms, billing term adjustments, confidentiality, \nchoice of law, and warranties.”  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3.)  Vizant agreed \nto these changes.  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 6, at 1, ECF No. 84.7.)   \n10. YRC also sought to broaden its ability to terminate the PSA , but Vizant \nrejected YRC’s proposed changes to the PSA’s termination clause.  ( Pl.’s Mem. L. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J.  Ex. 6 , at 1 .)  Vizant explained that the language of the  \n \n \ntermination clause was meant to protect against a  client who might take Vizant’s \nreport, “terminate the [PSA] and implement the recommendations ” without paying.  \n(Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 6.)  YRC agreed to keep the termination clause \nas drafted.  (PSA § 24; Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 6.) \n11. The parties executed the PSA on December 12, 2014.  (PSA 5.)  On February \n18, 2015, YRC delivered to Vizant the financial data required by the PSA.  (Campbell-\nOlson Email, ECF No. 125.) \n12. On July 9, 2015, Hughes and Cindy Christiansen (“Christiansen”), another \nVizant employee, delivered Vizant’s report to YRC’s offices in Overland Park, Kansas.  \n(Lopez Aff. ¶ 7 .)  There, Christiansen presented an in -person summary of Vizant’s \nrecommendations to YRC personnel, includ ing Wilson and Vice President of Cash \nManagement Joe Whitsel.  (Wilson Dep. 262:3–6, ECF No. 84.38; Christiansen Dep. \n29:5–8, ECF No. 122; Hughes Dep. 113:23 –114:7, ECF No. 84.36.)  Vizant proposed \nfive strategies for reducing YRC’s payment costs:  \n(1) Apply cost recovery fees to all customer invoices and orders;  \n(2) Accelerate collection of YRC’s accounts receivable;  \n(3) Promote payment cards to reduce bad debts;  \n(4) Shift commercial and purchasing card payments to Automated Clearing \nHouse (ACH) Network payments; and  \n(5) Negotiate more favorable card brand fees, interchange rates, and other \nfinancial incentives.   \n \n(Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 12.)   \n \n13. After less than fifteen minutes, Wilson stopped the presentation and \nreminded Christiansen that YRC already knew  that it could charge a fee to recoup \ncredit card costs.  (Lopez Aff. ¶7.)  When Wilson asked Christiansen if Vizant \n \n \nintended to claim that it was entitled to a percentage of cost savings stemming from \nmethods that YRC already knew about and had implemented, C hristiansen replied, \n“Yes.”  ( Wilson Dep. 264:15 –21; Lopez Aff. ¶7.)  Wilson then told Christiansen and \nHughes to “pack up all of [their] stuff and get out.”  (Wilson Dep. 271:11–16.)  Before \nleaving Overland Park, Hughes and Christiansen stopped at a FedEx store and \nmailed a hard copy of the report to YRC .  (Christiansen Dep. 30–31.)  The two also \nsent YRC an electronic copy of the report by email.  (Christiansen Dep. 30–31.) \n14. On September 22, 2015, YRC sent Vizant a written notice of termi nation.  \n(Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 28, at 1, ECF No. 84.29.)   \nB. Procedural History \n15. On November 10, 2015, Vizant filed a breach of contract claim against YRC, \nrequesting declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for breach of the PSA. \n16. On February 15, 2016, the case was designated a Complex Business Case \nunder Rules 2.1 and 2.2 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District \nCourts and assigned to the undersigned.   \n17. After the close of discovery, on January 18, 2018, Vizant filed its Motion for \nSummary Judgment .  The next day, YRC filed its Cross Motion for Summary \nJudgment and Motion to Strike. \n18. On May 23, 2018, this Court held a hearing on the Motions, at which Vizant \nand YRC were represented by counsel.  The Motions are ripe for resolution. \n \n \nII. \nCROSS MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nA. Legal Standard \n19. Under Rule 56 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary \njudgment is only appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto . . . judgment as a matter of law.”   Craig v. New Hanover Cty. Bd. of Educ ., 363 \nN.C. 334, 337, 678 S.E.2d 351, 353 (2009)  (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  A genuine \nissue is “one that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 \nN.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, 835 (2000).  A material fact is one that “would constitute \nor would irrevocably establish any ma terial element of a claim or defense .”  Abner \nCorp. v. City Roofing & Sheetmetal Co. , 73 N.C. App. 470, 472 , 326 S.E.2d 632, 633  \n(1985).   \n20. “The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002).   “[O]nce the party \nseeking summary judgment makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the \nnonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as \nopposed to allegations, showing that he can at least establish a prima facie case at \ntrial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784–85, 534 S.E.2d 660, 664 (2000).  All \n \n \nof the “[e]vidence presented by the parties is viewed in the light most favorable to the \nnon-movant.”  Summey v. Barker, 357 N.C. 492, 496, 586 S.E.2d 247, 249 (2003). \nB. Analysis \n21. Vizant moves for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim.  Vizant \nargues that (1) the PSA indicates the parties’ intent, (2) Vizant performed, and (3) \nYRC breached when it did not pay Vizant  and withheld data from Vizant.  Vizant \ncontends that the PSA constitutes a complete and unambiguous manifestation of the \nparties’ agreement because it was  crafted after several months of negotiations  and \ncontains a merger clause and clear terms.  According to Vizant, these unambiguous \nterms require YRC to pay Vizant for cost “reductions even if YRC terminates the \ncontract and even if YRC previously considered implementing the identified cost \nreduction[s].”  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J.  19.)  YRC has not paid these fees \nand has stopped providing data to Vizant; thus, Vizant insists YRC has breached the \nPSA. \n22. YRC asserts an opposite, “unambiguous” reading of the PSA.  Specifically, \nYRC counters that the PSA requires a causal relationship between Vizant ’s \nrecommended strategies and the cost reductions YRC experienced during the PSA ’s \nterm.  Vizant is only owed a fee, YRC argues, if Vizant’s suggestions actually caused \nYRC to change business practices and realize savings.  YRC asserts that this did not \noccur, that therefore no fee is owed, and that, consequently, YRC has not breached \nthe PSA. \n \n \n23. “[W]here parties to a contract have agreed that a given jurisdiction’s \nsubstantive law shall govern the interpretation of the contract, such a contractual \nprovision will be given effect.”  Tanglewood Land Co. v. Byrd, 299 N.C. 260, 262, 261 \nS.E.2d 655, 656 (1980).   Here, the parties have expressly agreed that Kansas law \ncontrols “any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or relating to” the PSA.  \n(PSA § 19.)  Therefore, Kansas law controls the parties’ agreement. \n24. Under Kansas law , the interpretation of a contract is a question of law.   \nCarrothers Constr. Co. v. City of South Hutchinson , 207 P.3d 231, 239 ( Kan. 2009).  \n“The primary rule for interpreting written contracts is to ascertain the parties’ intent.  \nIf the terms of the contract are clear, the intent of the parties is to be determined \nfrom the contract language without applying rules of construction.”  Id.  A contract \nshould not be interpreted by “isolating one particular sentence or provision , but by \nconstruing and considering the entire instrument from its four corners.”  City of Ark. \nCity v. Bruton , 166 P.3d 992 , 1003  (Kan. 2007).  The law favors reasonable \ninterpretations of contractual provisions.  Waste Connections of Kan., Inc. v. Ritchie \nCorp., 298 P.3d 250, 265 ( Kan. 2013).  “[R]esults which vitiate the purpose of the \nterms of the agreement to an absurdity should be avoided.”  Id.  “[E]xtrinsic evidence \nis only admissible if the four corners of the contract establish an ambiguity.”  \nThoroughbred Assocs., L.L.C. v. Kan. City Royalty Co., L.L.C. , 308 P.3d 1238, 1248 \n(Kan. 2013).  “Ambiguity exists if the contract contains provisions or language of  \ndoubtful or conflicting meaning.”  Liggatt v. Emp’rs Mut. Cas. Co., 46 P.3d 1120, 1125 \n \n \n(Kan. 2002).  Such ambiguity “does not appear until two or more meanings can be \nconstrued from the contract provisions.”  Carrothers Constr. Co., 207 P.3d at 239. \n25. Under the PSA, Vizant’s fee was to be a percentage of the “Financial \nPayment Cost Reductions” YRC realized.  (PSA § 10.)  These “Financial Payment Cost \nReductions” were calculated by comparing “Pre-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” \nto “Post-Agreement Financial Payment Costs.”  ( PSA § 8.)  If the “Pre -Agreement \nFinancial Payment Costs” were greater than the “Post-Agreement Financial Payment \nCosts”—i.e., if YRC  experienced a decrease in costs as sociated with financial \npayments—YRC was obligated to pay Vizant a percentage of the difference .  ( PSA \n§ 8.)  The PSA’s definitions of “Pre-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” and “Post-\nAgreement Financial Payment Costs” are thus critically important to the  \ndetermination of whether a payment obligation  was triggered and whether YRC \nbreached the PSA by failing to pay Vizant.   \n26. The PSA defined “Pre-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” as the financial \npayment costs that YRC incurred before entering the PSA.  ( PSA § 5.)  “Post -\nAgreement Financial Payment Costs” were defined as the financial payment costs \nYRC incurred “as a result of the strategies and solutions that [were] identified and \nrecommended by Vizant in performance of its professional services[.]”  (PSA § 6.)  The \nparties’ arguments have largely centered on the interpretation of this second \ndefinition.  According to Vizant, the Court should read the definition of Post -\nAgreement Financial Payment Costs to include costs saved as a result of strategies \nand solutions Vizant identified—i.e., those listed in Vizant’s report or presentation—\n \n \nregardless of whether Vizant actually caused YRC to implement the listed strategies \nand solutions.  According to YRC, the Court should read the definition the opposite \nway, defining Post-Agreement Financial Payment Costs to include only those savings \nachieved “as a result of” Vizant recommending a strategy or solution.   \n27. Upon reviewing these definitions, the Court concludes that t he meaning of \nPost-Agreement Financial Payment Costs largely depends on the meaning of the \nword “identified” within section 6 of the PSA .  Costs deemed Post -Agreement \nFinancial Payment Costs are those resulting from strategies and solutions “identified \nand recommended” by Vizant.  (PSA § 6.)  The meaning of “recommended” within the \nPSA is plain, but the meaning of “identified” is unclear. \n28. The PSA does not contain a definition of “identify” or “identified.”  When a \nterm is not defined within the four corners of a contract, Kansas courts will give the \nterm its “plain, general, and common meaning in order to ensure the intentions of the \nparties are enforced.”  Vanum Constr. Co. v. Magnum Block, L.L.C. , 245 P.3d 1069, \n1073 (Kan. Ct. App. 2010).  Kansas courts may ascertain the common meaning of an \nundefined term by consulting  secondary sources, including dictionaries .  See id. at \n1073–74.  The Court now does the same. \n29. When dealing with something as nebulous and conceptual as a business \nstrategy, the word “identify” can take on multiple meanings.  On one hand, the word \ncould support Vizant’s proposed interpretation of the PSA.  To “identify” something \ncan mean to “specify” that thing.  See Identify, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).  \nUnder such a definition, Vizant’s obligations under the PSA would merely amount to \n \n \nthe simple act of “recognizing” or “naming” a strategy or solution.  See Identify, The \nNew American Roget’s College Thesaurus (rev. ed. 1985).  Reading the PSA this way, \nif Vizant specified, recognized, or named a given strategy in its report that caused a \nreduction in YRC’s credit card processing costs, Vizant would be entitled to its fee , \nregardless of whether YRC or Vizant caused the strategy to be implemented.   This \nreading of the PSA  is not absurd —businesses often hire  consultants to pinpoint \nongoing strategies that should be continued. \n30. Alternately, “identify” could mean to “establish the . . . separate or distinct \nexistence of.”  Identify, Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law (rev. ed. 2011).  Under \nthis definition,  the meaning of “identify” could entail something  beyond mere \n“naming”; it  could require the  more complex act of establishing something \n“independent” or “ different.”  See Separate, Webster’s Third New International \nDictionary (1971).  Under this reading of the PSA, Vizant would only be entitled to a \nfee if post -agreement costs 1 were lower than pre -agreement costs as the result of  \nindependent and different strategies identified by Vizant.  This reading of the PSA is \nalso reasonable. \n31. Because the Court can construe two possible meanings  to the term \n“identify,” the Court concludes that the definition of  Post-Agreement Financial \nPayment Costs contained within the PSA is ambiguous.  See Carrothers Constr. Co., \n207 P.3d at 239.  Consequently, the Court next turns to the question of whether the \nextrinsic evidence submitted by the parties presents a genuine issue of material fact \n                                                 \n1  The Court uses the term “post-agreement costs” to refer to those costs YRC incurred after \nexecuting the PSA. \n \n \nas to the meaning of the disputed provisions of the PSA.  See Thoroughbred Assocs., \nL.L.C., 308 P.3d at 1248; Ark. La. Gas Co., Div. of Arkla, Inc. v. Kansas, 675 P.2d 369, \n372 (Kan. 1984) (“A court may, in construing an ambiguous or indefinite contract, \ntake into consideration the conduct of the parties as evidence of their interpretation \nof the document, provided that interpretation is not inconsistent with the language \nof the contract.” (citing First Nat’l Bank of Olathe v. Clark, 602 P.2d 1299, 1304 (Kan. \n1979))). \n32. Vizant points to the parties’ negotiations concerning  the PSA ’s terms  as \nevidence of  the parties’  mutual agreement to a non -causal relationship between \nVizant’s recommendations and YRC’s savings.  As one example, t he PSA’s \ntermination clause reads that, upon termination, YRC remains “obligated to pay the \nServices Fee to Vizant . . . if such Financial Payment Cost Reductions were identified \nby Vizant as part of its professional services and were realized by Client.”  (PSA § 24.)  \nDuring negotiations, Vizant explained that the language in this  clause, as worded, \nwas important and protected Vizant from clients who would take Vizant’s report, \nterminate the agreement, and implement Vizant’s recommendations without paying \nVizant.  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 6.)  Vizant notes that YRC agreed to \nthe unaltered version of this provision and  contends that this conduct during \nnegotiations demonstrates an understanding between the parties that Vizant would \nnot be required to prove that its services caused YRC to implement savings-achieving \nstrategies.  Vizant also notes that  YRC and Vizant incl uded references to certain, \nalready-implemented credit card fee pricing structures under the definition of Pre -\n \n \nAgreement Financial Payment Costs.   (PSA § 5.)   Had the parties meant for all \nsavings achieved from existing YRC strategies to be exempt from the calculation of \nVizant’s fee, Vizant contends  that they would have contracted for such in a similar \nmanner.2   \n33. Conversely, YRC points to Vizant’s marketing materials and in -person \nrepresentations as conduct that evidences a mutual understanding of a causal  \nrelationship between Vizant’s recommendations and YRC’s savings.   Vizant’s \nmarketing materials represent Vizant as a “results based,” “pay -for-performance” \ncompany that “only generate[s] revenue” if it actually reduces a client’s financial \npayment costs.  (Vizant Marketing Materials  11, ECF No. 118.)   The testimony of \nVizant’s and YRC’s employees also supports YRC’s understanding of the PSA’s fee \nprovisions.  Vizant’s David Askinas, the in-house lawyer that executed the PSA on \nVizant’s behalf, stated that he understood the compensation model within the PSA to \nbe consistent with the Vizant’s “pay-for-performance” marketing materials.  (Askinas \nDep. 47:19–24, ECF No. 121.)  Hughes, the Vizant salesperson who initially pitched \nVizant to YRC, testified that he represented to YRC that Vizant had to “actually do \nsomething . . . that caused YRC to save on incoming revenue costs.”   (Hughes Dep. \n84:5–12.)  Wilson, the YRC executive who received Vizant’s sales pitch, testified that \n                                                 \n2  YRC asserts that it did not negotiate to include pre-existing credit card pricing in the terms \nof the PSA and that Vizant “unilaterally added this language to the contract on December \n11, 2014.”  (Def.’s Br. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 14, ECF No. 171.)  Und er Kansas law, \nhowever, YRC had a duty to learn the contents of the PSA before signing, Albers v. Nelson, \n809 P.2d 1194, 1197 (Kan. 1991), and YRC signed the final version of the PSA containing the \nprovision pointed to by Vizant.  Determining which party added references to extant credit \ncard pricing strategies into the contract does not allow the Court to conclusively infer the \nintent behind the disputed provisions of the PSA and is thus not dispositive. \n \n \nhe understood that YRC would only pay Vizant if Vizant delivered a strategy YRC \n“hadn’t already thought of.”  (Wilson Dep. 324:6–10.)   \n34. Reviewing this extrinsic evidence, the Court concludes that a genuine issue \nof material fact remains.  The evidence cited in the preceding paragraph is certainly \nevidence upon which a jury could reasonably find that YRC’s interpretation of the \nPSA is correct.  Nevertheless, the Court cannot conclude as much as a matter of law.  \nIndeed, during negotiations of the PSA, Vizant was clear that language in the PSA’s \ntermination clause—which is similar to the “identified and recommended” language \nthroughout the PS A—was necessary to avoid a situation in which a client took \nVizant’s ideas while contendi ng that Vizant was owed nothing , i.e., the scenario \nVizant alleges occurred here.  The difficulty of proving that Vizant was the origin of \nthe implemented, cost-saving strategy could plausibly cause Vizant to negotiate for, \nand the parties to adopt, a contract that required Vizant to be compensated for post-\nagreement savings that Vizant addressed in its recommendations , even if Vizant’s \nrecommendations simply confirmed the viability of strategies that YRC already had \nin place.  Therefore, because the presented facts are “conflicting or admit [] of more \nthan one inference,” the Court concludes this issue cannot be resolved as a matter of \nlaw on summary judgment.   Dutta v. St. Francis Reg’l Med. Ctr. , 850 P.2d 928, 937 \n(Kan. Ct. App. 1993).   \n35. Furthermore, even if YRC’s reading of the PSA is correct and the contract \nrequires a causal connection between Vizant’s identified strategies and YRC’s \nsavings, an issue of fact remains as to whether YRC actually implemented the \n \n \nstrategies in Vizant’s report.  YRC submitted assurances that it has not viewed \nVizant’s report and thus could not have knowingly implemented any strategies \nrecommended by Vizant. 3  (Turner Aff. ¶4, ECF No. 129; Wilson Dep. 335:13 –21.)  \nVizant presents circumstantial evidence to dispute this.  Particularly, Vizant notes  \nthat “in th e year pre ceding the PSA’s execution, there was little month -to-month \nchange in customers using payment cards versus those using ACH,” (Pl.’s Reply Def.’s \nOpp’n Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 9, ECF No. 177.) , but that credit card payments declined \nby nearly 25% the year after Vizant delivered its report to YRC.  (Pl.’s Reply Def.’s \nOpp’n Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2.)   The suggested inference is that YRC used the \nstrategies recommended in Vizant’s report to achieve this increase in savings.  While \ncircumstantial, the Court concludes that this evidence creates an additional issue of \nfact that precludes the Court from entering summary judgment.  \n36. The Court draws similar conclusions as to Vizant’s argument that YRC has \nbreached the PSA by refusing to provide any further financial information to Vizant \nfollowing the termination of the PSA.  Section 24 of the PSA required YRC to continue \nto provide Vizant with “the data and information required under Section 13” of the \nPSA following any termination by YRC.  (PSA § 24.)  At oral argument, YRC conceded \nthat, following its termination of the PSA, YRC did not provide Vizant with f urther \nfinancial data until discovery in this lawsuit.  Though this would appear to answer \n                                                 \n3  Pursuant to an order of this Court, Todd Wilson viewed an electronic copy of Vizant’s report \nin early 2017 for purposes of assisting the parties with discovery.  YRC contends that this is \nthe only instance in which any person associated with YRC has viewed Vizant’s report.  \n \n \nthis issue in Vizant’s favor, the specific language of the PSA does not permit such an \neasy resolution. \n37. Section 24 of the PSA states that in the event of termination by YRC, YRC \nwas to “continue to be obligated to provide all of the data and information required \nunder Section 13[.]”  ( PSA § 24.)  Section 24 does not, however, impose a time limit \nfor this obligation.  The section references only the time period for which YRC will be \nrequired to pay service fees to Vizant —thirty-six months  or the remainder of the \n“Billing Term.”  (PSA § 24.)  The only limit on the scope of YRC’s obligation to provide \ndata comes from section 13, which begins by stating that YRC shall “provide all of the \ndata and information necessary for Vizant to perform its professional services under \n[the PSA]” and lists the kinds of data YRC is required to provide.  (PSA § 13.)  \n38. Reading section 24 and the first sentence of section 13 together produces a \nconfusing result.  Section 24 provides that in the event YRC elected to terminate the \nPSA, YRC would be obligated to continue providing the data required by section 13.  \nThe data required by section 13, however, was that information necessary for Vizant \nto perform Vizant’s professional services.  But if YRC terminated the PSA, Vizant \nwould no longer be performing its professional services, and thus Vizant would \nseemingly have no further need for YRC’s data.  Thus, section 24’s requirement that \nYRC continue producing data post-termination appears to impose no actual \nobligation on YRC. \n39. Focusing on the second paragraph of section 13 compels a different \nconclusion.  The second sentence of this paragraph reads, “For Vizan t to perform its \n \n \nongoing monthly services, the data and information listed herein shall be provided to \nVizant within 7 days, or as soon as available of its [sic] request by Vizant,” and a list \nof data follows.  ( PSA § 13.)  Treating this provision of secti on 13 as the prominent \nthrust of YRC’s obligations following termination, sec tion 24 c ould be read as \nrequiring YRC to continue to provide  Vizant with the kinds of data and information \nlisted in section 13.  This reading produces a more coherent result, but it does not \nprovide a duration for which YRC’s data-related obligations would continue.4   \n40. Thus, under either reading of the PSA’s termination clause, it is unclear \nwhat data -related obligations the parties intended to impose on YRC post -\ntermination.  The extrinsic evidence contained in the record does not resolve the \nambiguity.  Thus, here to o, questions concerning the PSA’s meaning and  YRC’s \nalleged breach cannot be decided as a matter of law on summary judgment .  See \nDutta, 850 P.2d at 937 (affirming trial court’s decision to put factual issues concerning \nthe meaning of an ambiguous contract clause and whether a party breached that \nclause to the jury). \n41. This dispute is rife with uncertainty.  Key provisions of the PSA between \nVizant and YRC are ambiguous, and the presented e xtrinsic evidence does not \ndefinitively resolve questions concerning the parties’ intent.   Therefore, because \n                                                 \n4  Section 12 of the PSA does provide that the “Agreement Term” of the PSA would commence \non the “Effective Date” and end “with the conclusion of the Billing Term.”  (PSA § 12.)  Section \n12 does not, however, mention the effect termination has on the Agreement Term or the \nparties’ obligations.  Further, neither sections 13 nor 24 tie YRC’s data -related obligations \nupon termination to the “Agreement Term,” with the latter section only stating that YRC’s \nobligation to continue paying the “Services Fee” would continue for the less er of thi rty-six \nmonths “or the remaining Billing Term of the Agreement.”  (PSA § 24.) \n \n \n \nneither party can show that no genuine issue of material fact exists with regar d to \nYRC’s obligations under the PSA , the ext rinsic evidence used to interpret the \nagreement’s ambiguity, and the actual effects of Vizant’s recommendations, the Court \ndenies both Motions for Summary Judgment.5  \nIII. \nMOTION TO STRIKE \n42. YRC’s Motion to Strike asks the Court to exclude certain opinions and \ncalculations offered by  Vizant’s damages expert, Scott Emmanuel  (“Emmanuel”).  \nEmmanuel’s report calculates fees Vizant is allegedly owed from two of Vizant’s \nrecommendations to YRC.   \n43. The first recommendation Emmanuel evaluated involved charging an \naccount management fee for credit card transactions.  YRC notes that it believes \nEmmanuel performed his calculations on this recommendation for more months than \nproper under the PSA but “does not object to the simple arithmetic of adding up the  \n[credit card fee] charges and annualizing them.”  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Strike 3, ECF \nNo. 90.)   \n                                                 \n5  YRC also argues that, even if Vizant’s interpretation of the contract is correct, or in the \nevent the language is held to be ambiguous, the Court should hold that Vizant is e quitably \nestopped from seeking fees due to Vizant’s misrepresentations about its services prior to the \nexecution of the PSA.  Under Kansas law, “equitable estoppel generally involves questions of \nfact and when the  facts are disputed or when necessary facts  come from ambiguous \ndocuments, summary judgment is inappropriate and the factual dispute must await \nresolution at trial.”  Dunn v. Dunn, 281 P.3d 540, 554 (Kan. Ct. App. 2012).  Due to the Court’s \ninability to decide the above issues at summary judgment, the Court cannot conclude that \nYRC’s equitable estoppel defense defeats Vizant’s breach of contract claim as a matter of law.  \nThe same is true of YRC’s contention that the PSA is void for unconscionability as a matter \nof law. \n \n \n44. YRC’s Motion to Strike instead focuses on the second recommendation on \nwhich Emmanuel purports to calculate damages —Vizant’s recommendation that \nYRC convince its clients to switch to ACH  payments.  YRC objects to Emmanuel’s \ndamages calculation for this recommendation by arguing that Emmanuel failed to \ndistinguish specific causes of cost reductions from overall trends and that his opinions \nrest on broad, speculative assumptions.  \nA. Legal Standard \n45. Expert testimony is governed by North Carolina Rule of Evidence 702, which \n“incorporates the standard from the Daubert line of [federal] cases” concerning the \nadmissibility of expert testimony.  State v. McGrady, 368 N.C. 880, 888, 787 S.E.2d \n1, 8 (2016).  For expert testimony to be admissible, (1) the expert testimony must be \nbased on specialized knowledge that will “assist the trier of fact,” (2) the expert must \nbe qualified by “knowledge, skill, experience, training, or educa tion,” and (3) the \ntestimony must be reliable.  N.C. R. Evid. 702(a); McGrady, 368 N.C. at 889–90, 787 \nS.E.2d at 8–9. \n46. An expert’s testimony is reliable if “(1) the testimony is based on sufficient \nfacts or data [,] (2) the testimony is the product of reliab le principles and methods, ” \nand “(3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of \nthe case. ”  N.C. R. Evid. 702(a).  The focus must be on the “principles and \nmethodology” the expert employs, “not on the conclusions that [the expert] \ngenerate[s].”  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms. , 509 U.S. 579, 5 95 (1993).  The trial \ncourt makes the initial assessment of the admissibility of the expert opinion and has \n \n \ndiscretion over how to consider the three prongs of the reliability test.  McGrady, 368 \nN.C. at 89 0, 787 S.E.2d at 9 .  In assessing an expert’s reliability, North Carolina \ncourts may consult federal case law.  Id. at 888, 787 S.E.2d at 8.   A trial court’s \ndecision as to whether an expert’s testimony meets Rule 702(a)’s requiremen ts “will \nnot be reversed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion. ”  Id. at 893, 787 \nS.E.2d at 11 (quoting Howerton v. Arai Helmet, Ltd. , 358 N.C. 440, 458, 597 S.E.2d \n674, 686 (2004)). \nB. Analysis \n47. YRC argues that Emmanuel’s damages calculation  on Vizant’s ACH  \nrecommendation is “highly problematic ,” (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Strike 4) , because, \namong other things, Emmanuel did not (1) attempt to distinguish between cost \nreductions resulting from YRC convincing customers to switch to ACH and reductions \nresulting from numerous other reasons YRC’s credit card costs might decline or (2) \naccount for the costs of financial incentives YRC implemented to convince customers \nto switch to ACH payments, such as rebates, when attempting to calculate the post -\nagreement savings YRC enjoyed due to Vizant’s identified strategies.  As a result, \nYRC characterizes Emmanuel’s damages ca lculation regarding Vizant’s \nrecommendation that YRC convince its clients to switch to ACH payments as founded \non nothing but speculation and  argues that the Court should exclude Emmanuel’s \nopinion under Rule 702(a). \n48. Vizant responds to YRC’s Motion to Strike by arguing that Emmanuel’s \nmethodology is valid because he applied the “agreed -to formula” found within the \n \n \nPSA.  Vizant notes that the contract requires a comparison of YRC’s “Pre-Agreement \nFinancial Payment Costs” to YRC’s “Post-Agreement Financial Payment Costs,” and \nif the “Post-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” are lower , Vizant is “entitled to a \nspecified percentage of those reductions.”  (Pl.’s Resp. Opp’n Def.’s Mot. Strike 9, ECF \nNo. 182.)  Vizant believes Emmanuel’s opinion tracks the required calculations under \nthe PSA and argues that the opinion is thus proper.  This argument, however, does \nnot deal with the issue YRC raises. \n49. Vizant’s fee was to be a percentage of “Financial Payment Cost Reductions.”  \n(PSA § 10.)  These “Financial Payment Cost Reductions” result from a comparison of \n“Pre-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” t o “Post-Agreement Financial Payment \nCosts.”  (PSA § 8.)  As noted above, “Post-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” are \nnot defined as broad, kitchen-sink savings realized after the execution of the PSA, as \nVizant contends in this context.  Instead, “Post-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” \nare expressly defined as those savings that specifically resulted from the strategies \nand solutions identified by Vizant.  (PSA § 6.)   \n50. Thus, in order to determine this difference in savings, one has to know which \nreductions in post-agreement costs occurred “as a result of” the strategies identified \nby Vizant.  YRC’s objection is not that Emmanuel failed to follow the formula for \ndamages set out in the PSA , but rather that Emmanuel plugged incorrect and \nspeculative variables into the formula because he did not attempt to determine which \ncost reductions were attributable to the strategies Vizant identified.  After reviewing \n \n \nEmmanuel’s deposition testimony and the other evidence enumerated by both parties \nin briefing and at oral argument, the Court concludes that YRC is correct. \n51. The problematic assumptions Emmanuel made when calculating Vizant’s \ndamages are best summarized by his own deposition testimony.  When Emmanuel \nwas questioned by YRC’s counsel about  whether Emmanuel’s calculation of YRC’s \nACH-related savings took into account the costs of incentives YRC had to offer \ncustomers to switch to ACH, Emmanuel confirmed his calculation did not while \nacknowledging that it should have: \nQ: In order to calculate how much YRC saved by customers moving from \ncredit card to ACH, you certainly ought to account for the amount that YRC \npaid its customers in incentives to make that move from credit card to ACH, \nright? \n \nA: Correct. \n \nQ: And you have not done that, have you? \n \nA: Correct.  \n \n(Emmanuel Dep. 123:24–124:6, ECF No. 90.10.)   \n \n52. Even more troubling, however, are the assumptions Emmanuel admits he \nmade when he attempted to discern what reductions in YRC’s post-agreement credit \ncard costs were attributable to YRC’s customers  switching from credit card to ACH \npayments—a step that would have been vital in determining which costs constituted \nPost-Agreement Financial Payment Costs for purposes of calculating Vizant’s fee  \nunder Vizant’s theory of the case .  By his own admission, Emmanuel assumed that \nall reductions in YRC’s credit -card-associated costs following the PSA ’s execution  \n \n \nwere attributable to YRC’s custome rs switch ing to ACH payments , despite \nacknowledging that he had no basis to make such an assumption: \n Q: And you have no idea w hether or not what you say was a  drop in Visa, \nMasterCard or Discover payments had anything to do with YRC encouraging \na customer to pay by ACH instead of using one of those credit cards, right? \n \nA: Correct. \n \nQ: You have no idea whether those were  the simple result of market forces \nwhere customers change their own  . . . payment type or leave and go to a \ndifferent trucking company, right? \n \n. . . . \n \nA: Correct. \n \n. . . .  \n \nQ: You don’t know whether that reduction . . . was caused by things you and \nI can’t even understand, right? \n \nA: Correct. \n \nQ: And you don’t know whether that reduction was caused by YRC \nimplementing some recommendation that Vizant put in its report, right? \n \nA: Correct. \n \nQ: All you know is that your math tells you that there was some reduction, \nand who in the world knows why it happened, right? \n \nA: Correct. \n \n(Emmanuel Dep. 111:14–112:1, 137:1–11.)   \n53. Under Emmanuel’s calculation, as described by his own testimony, true \nsavings caused by YRC’s customers switching to ACH payments and other factors \nleading to a reduction in customers paying with credit cards —for example, a \nreduction in credit card payments due to lost business—would all have been counted \n \n \nas savings for which YRC owed Vizant a fee.   As YRC states, Emmanuel assumed \n“every single dollar of [post-agreement cost reductions] was due solely and completely \nto YRC having convinced customers to pay by ACH[.]”  ( Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Strike \n5.)  This calculation (i) does not abide by the formula in the PSA, w hich requires a \ncomparison of pre-agreement costs to post-agreement costs resulting from strategies \nidentified by Vizant, (ii) rests on unjustifiable assumptions, and (iii) could mislead a \njury into awarding Vizant damages for what was in reality a loss in YRC’s business. \n54. “A conclusion that an expert opinion rests on a faulty premise is essentially \na finding that the opinion is unreliable under Rule 702(a),” Safety Test & Equip. Co. \nv. Am. Safety Util. Corp. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 100, at * 9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec.  16, \n2016), and an expert’s  failure to “adequately account [] for obvious alternative \nexplanations” may provide a trial court with grounds for excluding opinion testimony,  \nMcGrady, 368 N.C. at 891, 787 S.E.2d at 10; see also MyGallons LLC v. U.S. Bancorp, \n521 F. App’x 297, 307 (4th Cir. 2013) (holding an expert opinion that “ignored \nbusiness realities and relied on sheer speculation” inadmissible under Federal Rule \nof Evidence 702); Tyger Constr. Co. v. Pensacola Constr. Co., 29 F.3d 137, 143–44 (4th \nCir. 1994) (holding it was an abuse of discretion to admit an expert’s damages opinion \nthat was based on unsupported assumptions).   \n55. The Court concludes that Emmanuel’s opinion on damages related to YRC’s \ncustomers switching to ACH payments  is unreliable.  The proffered opinion fails to \nconsider or account for alternative causes for cost reductions, contains analytical \ngaps, ignores key direct costs, and eschews the formula agreed upon in the PSA.  The \n \n \nCourt thus concludes that Emmanuel’s opinion on this topic is based on insufficient \ndata, employs an unreliable method, and does not reliably apply Emmanuel’s chosen \nmethod to the facts of this case.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that YRC’s Motion \nto Strike should be granted.6  \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n56. For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: \na. The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment with \nregard to Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.   \nb. The Court DENIES Defendant’s Cross Motion for Summary \nJudgment with regard to Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim.   \nc. The Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion to Strike.  Emmanuel will \nnot be permitted to offer testimony or opinions relating to his \ndamages calculations concerning Vizant’s recommendation that YRC \nconvince its clients to switch to ACH payments.  Similarly, no expert \nwitness shall be permitted to give testimony that is dependent upon \n                                                 \n6  Vizant also argues that the Court should deny YRC’s Motion to Strike because YRC failed \nto comply with Rule 7.3 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure for the North Carolina \nBusiness Court (“BCRs”) by filing the Motion to Strike without consulting Vizant for Vizant’s \nposition on the motion.  Given the particular circumstances presented by the cross -motions \nfor summary judgment and the Motion to Strike, and the certainty that Vizant would not \nhave consented to the Motion to Strike, the Court will, in the exercise of its discretion, excuse \nYRC’s technical violation of BCR 7.3.  The Court notes, however, that it expects the parties’ \nstrict compliance with the rules of this Court hereafter  and does not intend the Court’s \ndecision in this instance to offer sanc tuary to future litigants who fail to comply with the \nconsultation requirement of BCR 7.3. \n \n \nEmmanuel’s calculations concerning Vizant’s recommendation that \nYRC convince its clients to switch to ACH payments. \nd. The Court will notice a status conference by separate order for the \npurpose of setting a pretrial and trial calendar.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 26th day of June, 2018. \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A.
