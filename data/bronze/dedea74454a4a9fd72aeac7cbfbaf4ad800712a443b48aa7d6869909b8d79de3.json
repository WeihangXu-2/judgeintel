Gen. Stat. § 7A-45.4(b) (herein, \nfurther references to the General Statutes will be to \"G.S.\"), and assigned to the \nundersigned Chief Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases, now \ncomes before the court upon Defendant David R. Dixon’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment (the \"Motion\"), pursuant to Rule 56 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil \nProcedure (\"Rule(s)\").   \nTHE COURT, after considering the Complaint, the Motion and briefs in support of \nand in opposition to the Motion, CONCLUDES that the Motion should be GRANTED in \npart and DENIED in part, as discussed herein. \nBradford J. Lingg, Esq., for Plaintiffs.  \n \nRonald G. Baker, Esq. for David R. Dixon. \n \nJolly, Judge. \nI. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n[1] This matter involves a dispute arisi ng from a partition sale and purchase of \na Beach Club Association, Inc., timeshare condominium building (the \"Timeshare\") \nlocated in Dare County, North Carolina.  The Timeshare was a complex of multiple \nbuildings located in Nags Head.  The complex contained both timeshare units and \nwholly-owned condominiums. \n[2] Bodie Island Beach Club Association, Inc. (\"Beach Club Association\") is a \nnon-profit corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of North \nCarolina, at all relevant times having its principal place of business in Nags Head, Dare \nCounty, North Carolina. \n[3] The individual Plaintiffs were owner s of timeshare interval weeks, which \nare real property interests, in the Timeshare. \n[4] Defendant David R. Dixon (\"Dixon\" ) is a citizen and resident of Dare \nCounty, and is an attorney licensed to practice in North Carolina. \n[5] Defendant Stephen R. Smith is a ci tizen and resident of Baltimore, \nMaryland. \n[6] Defendant CROC, LLC (\"CROC\") is a limited liability company formed and \norganized under the laws of the State of North Carolina, with its principal place of \nbusiness in Dare County.  It was formed for the purpose of purchasing the facility \nbelonging to the Timeshare through one or more partition sales.  Summary judgment \ndismissal has been entered in favor of CROC.1 \n                                                 \n1 Opinion Order Mot. Summ. J. Def. CROC, July 22, 2011. \n[7] Several other Defendants against whom this action initially was filed, Don \nWray, Penny Wray, Jessica Smith, Sea Wray, LLC and Tom Feist, have been \ndismissed voluntarily by Plaintiffs.2  Additionally, summary judgment has been entered \nagainst Defendant SRS North Carolina Property, LLC (\"SRS\").3 \n[8] On September 18, 2003, Hurricane Is abel struck the North Carolina coast \nand caused damage to the Timeshare complex.  Plaintiffs allege that in a previous \naction, Sea Wray, LLC v. Bodie Island Beach Club Ass'n, Dare County 04 CVS 433 \n(\"Prior Action\"), Defendant Dixon misrepresented the extent of the damage that the \nTimeshare facilities suffered as a result of Hurricane Isabel.  In the Prior Action, the \ncourt ordered the Beach Club Association to conduct a vote whereby all its members \nwould vote on whether to reconstruct the Timeshare solely as a wholly-owned complex \nor whether to remain a timeshare and wholly-owned mix.4 \n[9] The Beach Club Association members voted to reconstruct as a wholly-\nowned complex only, and Defendant Dixon thereafter filed a Petition to Partition in Dare \nCounty Special Proceeding 06 SP 133 on April 11, 2006 (\"Petition to Partition\").  The \npartition sale was confirmed by the court on July 10, 2007 and the resulting deed (\"the \nDeed\") transferred ownership of the complex to CROC.  CROC subsequently \ntransferred deeds for four units to SRS.5 \n \n                                                 \n2 Vol. Dis. Prej., Oct. 15, 2009, and Dec. 3, 2009. \n3 Order Opinion Mot. Summ. J. Def. SRS North Carolina Prop., July 30, 2010. \n4 Pursuant to G.S. 47A-25, if a complex such as the Timeshare is at any point two-thirds destroyed and \nthree-fourths of the members so vote, the Timeshare could choose not to reconstruct in the same format \nand could be rebuilt with only wholly-owned units. \n5 These four deeds were set aside by the court and ordered to be held in constructive trust for the benefit \nof the Plaintiffs pending resolution of this litigation.  Order Opinion Mot. Summ. J. Def. SRS North \nCarolina Prop., July 30, 2010.  This constructive trust was dissolved when the court entered summary \njudgment in favor of CROC.  Opinion Order Mot. Summ. J. Def. CROC, July 22, 2011. \n[10] On July 10, 2009, Plai ntiffs filed their Complaint against the Defendants.  \nThe Complaint alleges six claims for relief (\"Claims\"): First Claim – legal malpractice, \nSecond Claim –  conversion, Third Claim – constructive fraud, Fourth Claim – civil \nconspiracy, Fifth Claim – breach of fiduciary duty and Sixth Claim – action to set aside \ndeed due to fraud and undue influence. \n[11] On November 15, 2010, Dixon filed the Motion. \n[12] On December 15, 2010, Plaintiffs re sponded to the Motion.  The Motion is \nfully briefed and ripe for determination. \n[13] Unless otherwise indi cated herein, the material facts reflected in \nparagraphs 1 through 9 of this Opinion and Order are undisputed6 and are pertinent to \nthe issues raised by the Motion.  The court will discuss the Claims as they relate to \nDefendant Dixon. \nII. \nDISCUSSION \n[14] Under Rule 56(c), su mmary judgment is to be rendered “forthwith” if the \npleadings, depositions, answer to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with \nthe affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \nany party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Grayson v. High Point Dev. Ltd. \nP’ship, 175 N.C. App. 786, 788 (2006).  In considering a Rule 56 motion, the court \nviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Bruce-Terminix \nCo. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 130 N.C. App. 729, 733 (1998). \n                                                 \n6 It is not proper for a trial court to make findings of fact in determining a motion for summary judgment \nunder Rule 56.  However, it is appropriate for a Rule 56 Order to reflect material facts that the court \nconcludes exist and are not disputed, and which support the legal conclusions with regard to summary \njudgment.  Hyde Ins. Agency v. Dixie Leasing, 26 N.C. App. 138 (1975). \n[15] The grounds for the Mo tion are that Plaintiffs’ respective Claims against \nDixon should fail as a matter of law because they (a) are barred by the applicable \nstatute of limitations, (b) res judicata and collateral estoppel and (c) constitute an \nimpermissible collateral attack on a previous judgment. \nFirst Claim \n[16] This Claim is for alleged l egal malpractice by Defendant Dixon. \n[17] The statute of limitations for legal negligence is three years.  G.S. 1-15(c).  \nSince the Complaint was filed on July 10, 2009, for the First Claim to be timely and not \nbe barred by the statute of limitations the Claim must have accrued no earlier than July \n10, 2006.  A claim for legal negligence accrues at the time of the last affirmative act by \nthe attorney that could constitute negligence.  Title Ins. Co. v. Smith, Debnam, Hibbert & \nPahl, 119 N.C. App. 608, 620 (1995) (Martin, J. concurring) (citing Wilcox v. Plummer’s \nEx'rs, 29 U.S. 172, 182 (1830)). \n[18] The substance of the First Claim is that Defendant Dixon allegedly was \nnegligent in mishandling several different lawsuits involving the Beach Club Association.  \nThe Plaintiffs have attempted to combine the various allegations of malpractice into a \nsingle cause of action.  However, because North Carolina does not recognize the \ncontinuous representation doctrine, see e.g. Hargett v. Holland, 337 N.C. 651 (1994), \nthe respective claims for alleged mishandling of different lawsuits would give rise to \nseveral disparate malpractice claims that properly should not be brought as one claim, \nas Plaintiffs have attempted.  Moreover, even if combining disparate negligence claims \ninto one claim for relief was acceptable, a statute of limitations defense as to any of the \nunderlying negligence claims would require an examination of the facts and \ncircumstances of each individual claim.  Dixon argues that even the most recent of the \nvarious claims alleged by Plaintiffs in this First Claim was not filed before expiration of \nthe relevant statute of limitations.  The court is forced to agree. \n[19] In the instant action, Dixon contends  that the \"last act\" of alleged legal \nnegligence complained of by Plaintiffs was the filing by Dixon of the Petition to Partition \nrelative to the Timeshare, which took place on April 11, 2006 (the \"Petition\").  Dixon \ncontends that at best for the Plaintiffs' First Claim, the Claim accrued and the statute of \nlimitations began running on that date.  In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the last act \nwas when, during the partition proceeding in July 2007 (the \"Partition Sale\"), Dixon \nfailed to correct alleged previous misrepresentations7 as to the Petition and resulting \npartition sale of the Timeshare building. \n[20] The last act of the attorney is the last affirmative action of the attorney, not \nwhen the attorney fails to act or when the client suffers damages.  Title Ins. Co., 119 \nN.C. App. at 620.  Here, the court CONCLUDES that Dixon’s last affirmative act was \nfiling the Petition, which occurred on April 11, 2006.  The Plaintiffs' most recent claim for \nlegal negligence by Dixon accrued on that date, and the statute of limitations expired on \nApril 11, 2009, more than three months before this action was filed.  The First Claim \ntherefore is barred by the statute of limitations.  Defendant Dixon's Motion should be \nGRANTED as to the First Claim and it should be DISMISSED. \n[21] As the statute of limitations bars the First Claim, the court need not \ndetermine whether any of the alternative grounds argued in the Motion bar the Claim. \n \n \n                                                 \n7 The misrepresentations ostensibly were made to the court in September, 2004. \nSecond through Fifth Claims \n[22] As to Plaintiffs' Second through Fifth Claims, for conversion, civil \nconspiracy, fraud and breach of fiduciary duties, the Court CONCLUDES that there \nexist one or more genuine issues of material fact as to each Claim.  Therefore, as to \nsaid Claims, summary judgment should not be granted and Defendant Dixon's Motion \nshould be DENIED. \nSixth Claim \n[23] The Sixth Claim is an action to se t aside the Partition Sale deeds due to \nalleged fraud and undue influence.  The deeds involved were those obtained by CROC \nthrough the Partition Sale, in which the Timeshare condominium building was sold \nfollowing a vote to reconstruct the Timeshare building as a condominium complex \ninstead of the timeshare-condominium complex that was in place.   \n[24] Defendant Dixon argues that the statute of limitations for this Claim is \nthree years, while Plaintiffs contend it is ten years.  Plaintiffs’ incorrectly rely upon Muse \nv. Muse, 236 N.C. 182, 184 (1952).  Contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, Muse notes that \nthe statute of limitations to set aside a deed is three years according to G.S. 1-52(9). \n[25] A cause of action generally accrue s when the plaintiff can first bring the \nclaim against the defendant.  Shearin v. Lloyd, 246 N.C. 363, 367 (1957).  The Plaintiffs \nin the present action could not bring the action to set aside the deeds until the deeds \nwere finalized and confirmed by the court which occurred on July 7, 2007.  Since this \nwas within three years of the Complaint being filed, the cause of action would be timely.  \nThe statute of limitations therefore does not bar this Claim. \n[26] In the alternative, Dixon contends t hat the Claim to set aside the Partition \nSale deed constitutes an impermissible collateral attack on a preexisting judgment.  In \nresponse, Plaintiffs argue that the deeds were obtained as a result of false testimony in \nthe Prior Action, and therefore the deeds are fraudulent and must be set aside.  The \nbasic allegation underlying this Claim is that in the Prior Action Defendant Dixon made \nseveral misrepresentations to the presiding judge in open court concerning the condition \nof the Timeshare buildings and how much storm damage they had suffered during \nHurricane Isabel, thereby committing fraud upon the court and obtaining the authority to \nvote on reconstruction of the timeshare-condominium complex as a condominium-only \ncomplex.\n8  This vote then led to the Partition Sale, where the Timeshare complex was \nsold to CROC.   \n[27] Intrinsic fraud is fraud that  occurs in an original action.9  False testimony \nbefore the court is intrinsic fraud.  Textile Fabricators, Inc. v. C.R.C. Indus., Inc., 43 N.C. \nApp. 530 (1979).  Intrinsic fraud cannot be collaterally attacked by an independent \naction and can only be corrected by motion in the cause or a motion before the court \nupon which the fraud was perpetrated, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3).  Id. at 532 (citing \nStokley v. Stokley, 30 N.C. App. 351, 354-55 (1976)). \n[28] By way of this Sixth Claim, Plai ntiffs attempt to attack the deeds in \nquestion collaterally through this independent action.  Such a procedure is not proper \nfor challenging a deed obtained by alleged intrinsic fraud.  As such, this Claim \nconstitutes an impermissible collateral attack on the judgment in the Prior Action.\n10  The \nproper avenue for Plaintiffs to pursue would have been to attack the Partition Sale \n                                                 \n8 Dare Co. Special Proceeding No. 06 SP 133; May 3, 2007 Order of Conf.; May 10, 2007 Order. \n9 BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (9th ed. 2009). \n10 See n. 8, supra. \nthrough a Rule 60(b)(3) motion or to attack the original order allowing the vote that \nauthorized the partition to occur. \n[29] The Sixth Claim ther efore is barred.  The Motion should be GRANTED as \nto the Sixth Claim and it should be DISMISSED. \nIII. \nORDER\nNOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing, it is ORDERED that: \n[30] There exists no genuine issue of materi al fact with regard to Plaintiffs' First \nand Sixth Claims, and Defendant Dixon is entitled to summary judgment in his favor as \nto each of said Claims.  Accordingly, as to the Plaintiffs' First and Sixth Claims, \nDefendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED and Plaintiffs' First Claim and \nSixth Claim hereby are DISMISSED as to Defendant Dixon. \n[31] With regard to Plaintiffs' Second through Fifth Claims, there exist one or \nmore genuine issues of material fact, and Defendant Dixon is not entitled to summary \njudgment in his favor as to said Claims.  Accordingly, as to Plaintiffs' Second through \nFifth Claims, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED. \nSO ORDERED, this the 29th day of July, 2011. \n     "
