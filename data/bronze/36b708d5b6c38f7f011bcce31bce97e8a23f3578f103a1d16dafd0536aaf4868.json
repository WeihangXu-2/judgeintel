Myers Park Country Club, Inc., 2021 NCBC 45. \n \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n21 CVS 4936 \n \nMARK ERWIN, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nMYERS PARK COUNTRY CLUB, \nINC., \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION \nON PLAINTIFF’S \nINSPECTION REQUEST \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court on  plaintiff Mark Erwin’s (“Erwin”) \nrequest for an order compelling defendant Myers Park Country Club, Inc.  (“Myers \nPark”) to allow Erwin to inspect  certain records of Myers Park  (the “Inspection \nRequest”).  Erwin contends that he is entitled to inspect these records under the \nNorth Carolina Business Corporation Act (the “Corporation Act”), N.C.G.S. § 55-1-01, \net seq. and that Myers Park has refused, notwithstanding a proper request, to allow \nErwin to inspect them.  For the reasons set forth in this Order and Opinion, the Court \nGRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Inspection Request. \nNelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP, by David N. Allen, Benjamin \nS. Chesson, and Anna C. Majestro, for Plaintiff Mark Erwin.  \n \nJames, McElroy & Diehl, P.A. , by John R. Buric and John R. Brickley, \nand Cranfill Sumner LLP, by Melody J. Jolly, for Defendant Myers Park \nCountry Club, Inc.  \n \nRobinson, Judge. \n \nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n2. Erwin filed his Complaint on 29 March 2021, which sets forth the \nInspection Request as the sole claim for relief.  (Compl. 8–10, ECF No. 3.)  Erwin also \n \n \nseeks to recover the costs and expenses  of this action from Myers Park, including \nErwin’s attorneys’ fees.  (Compl. 11.) \n3. On 30 March 2021, this  action was designated as a mandatory complex \nbusiness case by Order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina \nand assigned to the undersigned by Order of the Chief Business Court Judge .  (ECF \nNos. 1–2.) \n4. Promptly after the designation and assign ment of this case, the Court \ndirected the parties to file a joint status report setting forth their joint or respective \npositions on a briefing schedule for the Inspection Request and whether any discovery \nwas needed in this action.  The parties filed the requested joint status report  on 9 \nApril 2021.  (ECF No. 9.) \n5. Myers Park filed its Answer on 28 April 2021, (Answer, ECF No. 18), and \nlater filed, with leave of Court, an Amended Answer on 15 July 2021, (Am. Answer , \nECF No. 38). \n6. After the Court conducted multiple status conferences and twice extended \na briefing schedule in this matter upon the request of the parties, the Court entered \nits final Scheduling Order on 11 June 2021.  (ECF No. 28.) \n7. The Inspection Request has been fully briefed, and each side has submitted \nseveral supporting documents for the Court’s consideration.   The Court held an in-\nperson hearing on the Inspection Request on 7 July 2021, at which all parties were \nrepresented by counsel (the “July 7 Hearing”). \n \n \n8. The Inspection Request is  now ripe for resolution.  Having considered all \nrelevant matters, the Court issues the following findings of fact  and conclusions of \nlaw for the limited purpose of ruling on the Inspection Request.1 \nII. FINDINGS OF FACT \n9. Myers Park is a corporation organized and existing pursuant to the laws of \nNorth Carolina .  (Compl. ¶ 2.) 2  Its principal place of business  is in  Mecklenburg \nCounty, North Carolina, where it operates as a country club.  (Compl. ¶ 3.) \n10. Erwin has been a club member and shareholder of Myers Park since 2008.  \n(Compl. ¶ 7.) \n11. In 2020, Myers Park’s board of directors  (the “Board”)  approved a \nrenovation and remodeling plan for the country club, which the Board called the \nConnecting the Centuries Project (the “Project”).  (Compl. ¶ 10.)  The Project is \nexpected to cost approximately $27 million in total  and will be partially funded \nthrough a combination of assessments, monthly fees, and member fees.   (Compl. \n¶¶ 13–14.) \n12. On 12 March 2021, Erwin’s counsel sent a letter on Erwin’s behalf to Myers \nPark, demanding that it permit Erwin to inspect and copy certain records  (the \n“Inspection Demand ”).  (Compl. ¶ 30.)  Erwin’s counsel delivered the Inspection \n \n1  To the extent that any findings of fact are more properly considered conclusions of law, the \nCourt intends for them to be considered as such, and vice versa.  See Sheffer v. Rardin, 208 \nN.C. App. 620, 624 (2010). \n \n2  Factual findings set forth herein that are derived from the Complaint are allegations that \nMyers Park admitted in its Amended Answer. \n \n \nDemand to Myers Park’s registered address and also by email to its president, \nregistered agent, and general manager.  (Compl. ¶ 31.)   \n13. A copy of the Inspection Demand , dated 12 March 2021,  is attached to \nErwin’s Complaint as Exhibit A.  (Compl. ¶ 30; Compl. Ex. A [“Demand”].) \n14. According to the Inspection Demand, Erwin seeks to “obtain information \nfrom Myers Park about the proposed ‘Connecting the Centuries’ project and a delay \nof the project so the membership can fully consider the new information.”   (Demand \n1.)  The Inspection Demand further asserted that “[t]he Project raises many concerns \nranging from the Board ’s process to push it through to the financial feasibility a nd \nimplication on Myers Park’s financial health.”  (Demand 2.)   \n15. In the Inspection Demand, Erwin requested to inspect the following eleven \nnumbered categories of records:3 \n1.  A list of the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses \nof all current Myers Park shareholders in alphabetical order, by class of \nshares showing the number and class of shares held by each. \n \n2.  A list of the names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses \nof all current Myers Park members in alphabetical order b y category of \nmembership. \n \n3.  The minutes of all Myers Park shareholders meetings and Board \nmeetings, and the records of all final actions taken by Myers Park \nshareholders, the Board, or committees of the Board in place of the \nBoard without a meeting that  address or discuss: (a) the Project; (b) \nMyers Park revenue shortfalls; or (c) plans or proposals to address \nrevenue shortfalls. \n \n \n3  When referring to one of these categories, the Court will use the applicable number \nassociated with the category  in the Inspection Demand, i.e., “request number 1,” “request \nnumber 2,” etc.  \n \n \n4.  All written communications to shareholders generally that address \nor discuss: (a) the Project; (b) Myers Park revenue shortfalls; or (c) plans \nor proposals to address revenue shortfalls. \n \n5.  The capital and operating budgets that: (a) the Financial Committee \nin coordination with the General Manager recommended to the Board \nfor adoption for 2020 and 2021, as required in Article IX, Section 2(a) of \nthe Bylaws; and (b) and [sic] the Board approved for 2020 and 2021, \nalong with all amendments to those budgets, as required in Article IX, \nSection 2(b) of the Bylaws. \n \n6.  All capital expenditures in excess of $5,000, which are required to be \napproved by the Board in Article IX, Section 2(c) of the Bylaws, related \nto: (a) the Project; or (b) any plans or proposals to address revenue \nshortfalls. \n \n7.  All Myers Park accounting records and financial statements, \nincluding but not limited to: balance sheets, general ledgers, \nincome/profit and loss statements, and cash flow statements.  Please \nproduce all unaudited and audited copies of these records. \n \n8.  Myers Park ’s annual financial statement for 2020 that meets th e \nrequirements of N.C.G.S. § 55-16-20. \n \n9.  All reports prepared by and communications with the planning \nconsultants, the building contractors and subcontractors, and any other \nconsultants or advisors that Myers Park retained in connection with the \nProject. \n \n10.  All invoices, correspondence, contracts, reports, projections, plans, \nor budgets from any consultants or other third parties Myers Park has \nretained or has considered retaining in connection with the Project. \n \n11.  All communications between  any member of the Board and any \nother person that discuss: (a) the Project; (b) Myers Park revenue \nshortfalls; or (c) plans or proposals to address revenue shortfalls. \n \n(Demand 3–4.)  The relevant time period for the requested records is 1 January 2019 \nthrough 12 March 2021 ,4 unless other wise indicated within a specific  request. \n \n4  The Inspection Demand set the end date as “through the present,” which the Court \ninterprets to mean 12 March 2021—the date of the Inspection Demand.  (Demand 3.) \n \n \n(Demand 3.) \n16. The Inspection Demand also stated as follows: \n[Erwin] is making this demand for inspection in good faith and for a \nproper purpose, specifically to investigate: (1) whether the Project is in \nthe best interest of Myers Park; (2) whether the Board’s approval of the \nProject complies with Myers Park’s Bylaws; (3) whether any improper \ntransactions have occurred in connection  with the Board’s approval of \nthe Project; (4) any potential mismanagement,  misappropriation, \nmisapplication, conflict of interest, or improper use of Myers Park funds \nrelated to the Project; and (5) the Project ’s financial feasibility and \nimplications on costs, debt, fees, and income. \n \n(Demand 5.)  The Inspection Demand further disclosed that Erwin “intends to \ncommunicate” with other club members and shareholders of Myers Park about his \ninvestigation into these matters.5  (Demand 3.)   \n17. The Inspection Demand requested that Myers Park send Erwin and his \ncounsel electronic copies  of the requested records  or otherwise make  the records \navailable for inspection no later than 22 March 2021.  (Demand 3.)   \n18. Myers Park did not produce any of the records requested in the Inspection \nDemand by 22 March 2021.  (Compl. ¶ 38.) \n19. On 29 March 2021, Erwin filed his Complaint and asserted his Inspection \nRequest, which asks the Court to “summarily order the inspection and copying of the \nrecords [Erwin] demanded in the March 12, 2021 Inspection Demand at Myers Park’s \nexpense” pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 55-16-04.  (Compl. ¶ 62.) \n \n5  The Inspection Demand alleged that “approximately 200 other Myers Parks shareholders \nand members” also have concerns about the Project.  (Demand 1.)  Erwin, however, has not \nidentified any of these other shareholders and members.  Moreover, in the Inspection \nDemand, Erwin was the only member and shareholder who claimed a statutory right to \ninspect Myers Park’s records.  (Demand 3.) \n \n \n20. Also on 29 March 2021, Myers Park “began making a rolling production of \ndocuments” responsive to the Inspection Demand.6  (Def.’s Resp. Br. 5, ECF No. 33.)  \nSince that date, Myers Park has produced additional records responsive to the \nInspection Demand, as addressed more fully below.  (See generally Pl.’s Opening Br., \nECF No. 32.2; Def.’s Resp. Br.) \n21. On 10 May 2021, Erwin’s counsel deposed Myers Park’s Rule 30(b)(6) \ndesignee, Jean Zoutewelle (“Zoutewelle”).  (Pl.’s Opening Br. Ex. F, ECF No. 32.3 \n[“Zoutewelle Dep.”].)  Zoutewelle’s deposition was limited to certain topics, as set forth \nin an Order entered by the Court on 20 April 2021.  (ECF No. 16.)  Erwin has filed \nexcerpts of Zoutewelle’s deposition testimony for the Court’s consideration.7   \n22. On 16 June 2021, Myers Park’s counsel deposed Erwin.  Erwin’s deposition \nwas also limited to certain topics, as set forth in the Court’s 11 June 2021 Scheduling \nOrder.  Myers Park,  however, has not filed any excerpts of Erwin’s deposition  \ntestimony for the Court’s consideration. \nIII. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n23. The Court first addresses request numbers 1, 2, 7, 8, and 11 from the \nInspection Demand. \n \n6  Erwin represented in his Complaint and supporting brief that Myers Park began producing \ndocuments responsive to the Inspection Demand on 25 March 2021, and not 29 March 2021, \nas it represented in its opposition brief.  As a result, the Court asked counsel for the parties \nduring the July 7 Hearing to confirm the date when Myers Park began its document \nproduction, and counsel confirmed that the production began on 29 March 2021. \n \n7  The Court has carefully considered Zoutewelle’s deposition testimony, and t he Court will \nreference any specific testimony relevant to its analysis of the Inspection Demand in the \nConclusions of Law section. \n \n \n24. The record before the Court, including the representations of counsel for \nthe parties during the July 7 Hearing , establishes that, after the filing of Erwin’s \nComplaint, Myers Park produced all records responsive to request numbers 1, 2, and \n8 and also produced its 2019 and 2020 financial statements, as demanded in request \nnumber 7.  As a result, the Court denies as moot request numbers 1, 2, and 8 in their \nentirety and further denies as moot request number 7 to the extent that this request \ndemanded Myers Park’s “financial statements, including but not limited to: balance \nsheets, . . . income/profit and loss statements, and cash flow statements ” from 1 \nJanuary 2019 through 12 March 2021.  (Demand 4.)8  To be clear, though, the Court’s \ndenial in this regard does not prejudice Erwin’s right to pursue recovery of the costs \nand expenses of this action due to the fact that many of the documents requested by \nErwin were only produced by Myers Park after the deadline set forth in the Inspection \nDemand had passed and Erwin had filed his Complaint. \n25. Request number 11 demanded “[a]ll communications between any member \nof the Board and any other person that discuss: (a) the Project; (b) Myers Park \nrevenue shortfalls; or (c) plans or proposals to address revenue shortfalls ” from 1 \nJanuary 2019 through 12 March 2021.  (Demand 4.)  The breadth of this request is \nquestionable.  Additionally, Erwin’s briefing is completely devoid of any legal \nargument supporting this request, and at the July 7 Hearing, Erwin’s counsel failed \nto articulate a sound legal basis for the request.  Consequently, the Court is unable \n \n8  Based on the Court’s review of the record, including Zoutewelle’s deposition testimony, (see, \ne.g., Zoutewelle Dep. 63), it appears that Myers Park’s “balance sheets,” “income/profit and \nloss statements,” and “cash flow statements” were included among the financial statements \nthat Myers Park provided to Erwin. \n \n \nto conclude that Erwin is entitled to inspect the records demanded in request number \n11 under any provision of the Corporation Act and therefore denies request number \n11 in its entirety. \n26. The Court now turns to request numbers 3 through 6, the remainder of \nrequest number 7, and request numbers 9 and 10.  The Court begins its analysis of \nthese requests with a discussion of the relevant law. \n27. As this Court explained in Sharman v. Fortran Corporation,  \n[t]he [Corporation] Act provides certain inspection rights to qualified \nshareholders.  A qualified shareholder is a “person who shall have been \na shareholder in the corporation for at least six months immediately \npreceding his demand or who shall be the holder of at least five percent \n(5%) of the corporation ’s outstanding shares of any class.”   N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 55 -16-02(g). . . . The Act grants qualified shareholders rights of \ninspection in two “separate and distinct categories. ”  Russell M. \nRobinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law § 10.01 (7th \ned. 2017).   N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55 -16-02(a) grants what are generally \nreferred to as “absolute rights ” of inspection, and section 55 -16-02(b) \ngrants what are generally described as “qualified rights ” of \ninspection.  Id.  \n \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *7–8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 2, 2018).  The Corporation Act \nalso permits a qualified shareholder to file an action seeking to enforce his statutory \nright of inspection.  See N.C.G.S. § 55-16-04(a)–(b).9 \n28. Here, it is undisputed that Myers Park  is a North Carolina corporation \ngoverned by the Corporation Act.  It is also undisputed that Erwin has been a Myers \nPark shareholder since 2008, thus making Erwin a qualified shareholder, as defined \nunder section 55-16-02(g) of the Corporation Act.  Therefore, the Court is tasked with \n \n9  A qualified shareholder who proceeds under section 55 -16-04(b) is entitled to “expedited” \nconsideration of his action. \n \n \ndetermining whether Erwin, as a qualified shareholder , has a right to inspect the \nrecords he seeks from Myers Park that have not already been produced (excluding \nthe documents described in request number 11, which the Court has denied). \nA. Absolute Right of Inspection Under Section 55-16-02(a) \n29. Section 55-16-01(e) of the Corporation Act requires a corporation to keep at \nits principal office a copy of the following records: \n(1) [The corporation’s] articles or restated articles of incorporation and \nall amendments to them currently in effect; \n \n(2) [The corporation’s] bylaws or restated bylaws and all amendments to \nthem currently in effect; \n \n(3) Resolutions adopted by [the corporation’s] board of directors creating \none or more classes or series of shares, and fixing their relative rights, \npreferences, and limitations, if shares issued pursuant to those \nresolutions are outstanding; \n \n(4) The minutes of all shareholders’ meetings, and records of all action \ntaken by shareholders without a meeting, for the past three years; \n \n(5) All written communicati ons to shareholders generally within the \npast three years and the financial statements required to be made \navailable to the shareholders for the past three years under G.S. 55-16-\n20; \n \n(6) A list of the names and business addresses of [the corporation’s] \ncurrent directors and officers; and \n \n(7) [The corporation’s] most recent annual report delivered as required \nby G.S. 55-16-22. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 55-16-01(e).  In turn, section 55-16-02(a) grants qualified shareholders an \nabsolute right to inspect and copy these records as follows:  \nA qualified shareholder of a corporation is entitled to inspect and copy, \nduring regular business hours at the corporation’s principal office, any \nof the records of the corporation described in G.S. 55-16-01(e) if he gives \n \n \nthe corporation written notice of his demand at least five business days \nbefore the date on which he wishes to inspect and copy. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 55-16-02(a).   \n30. As noted, Erwin is a qualified shareholder.  Further, Erwin’s Inspection \nDemand, delivered on 12 March 2021 to Myers Park , requested that Myers Park \nprovide Erwin with the records identified in the Inspection Demand by 22 March \n2021, thereby giving Myers Park written notice of Erwin’s demand for inspection at \nleast five business days before the date on which Erwin demanded to inspect and copy \nthe records.   \n31. Accordingly, Erwin has shown that he satisfied the requirements of section \n55-16-02(a), and the Court must now determine whether any records requested by \nErwin in the Inspection Demand fall within the categories of records described in \nsection 55 -16-01(e).  Based on the Court’s review of the Demand Letter, r equest \nnumbers 3 and 4 demanded such records. \ni. Request Number 3 \n32. Request number 3 demanded, in part,  “[t]he minutes of all Myers Pa rk \nshareholders meetings  . . . that address or discuss: (a) the Project; (b) Myers Park \nrevenue shortfalls; or (c)  plans or proposals to address revenue shortfalls ” from 1 \nJanuary 2019 through 12 March 2021.  (Demand 4.)  Erwin has an absolute right to \ninspect these records.  See N.C.G.S. § 55-16-01(e)(4) (establishing that “[t]he minutes \nof all shareholders’ meetings  . . . for the past three years ” are records subject to a \nqualified shareholder’s absolute right of inspection). \n \n \n33. However, Zoutewelle’s deposition testimony reflects that Myers Park \napparently did not create and thus does not have in its possession minutes of any \nshareholder meetings from 1 January 2 019 through 12 March 2021, even though \nthere may have been at least one shareholder meeting that took place during that \nperiod (the 2020 annual shareholder meeting).  (Zoutewelle Dep. 29.) \n34. Erwin has not challenged or rebutted  Zoutewelle’s testimony on this \nmatter.  Consequently, based on this undisputed evidence showing that Myers Park \ndoes not have in its possession any shareholder meeting minutes responsive to \nrequest number 3 —and notwithstanding Erwin’s absolute right to ins pect such \nminutes—the Court has no choice but to deny request number 3 to the extent that it \ndemanded shareholder meeting minutes from 1 January 2019 through 12 March \n2021.10 \n35. Request number 3 also demanded “the records of all final actions taken by \nMyers P ark shareholders  . . . without a meeting that address or discuss: (a) the \nProject; (b) Myers Park revenue shortfalls; or (c) plans or proposals to address \nrevenue shortfalls” from 1 January 2019 through 12 March 2021.   (Demand 4.)  The \nparties’ briefs and other supporting materials are unclear as to whether this demand \nremains in dispute, and counsel for the parties did not provide clarity on this matter \nduring the July 7 Hearing. \n \n10  The Court finds troubling Myers Park’s apparent failure to comply with its statutory \nobligation to “keep as permanent records minutes of all meetings of its  . . . shareholders.”  \nN.C.G.S. § 55-16-01(a).   \n \n \n36. In any event,  the Corporation Act grants a qualified shareholder the \nabsolute right to inspect the “records of all  action taken by shareholders without a \nmeeting” from the past three years.  N.C.G.S. § 55-16-01(e)(4).  Therefore, the Court \ndetermines that, based on the statute and the Inspection Demand, Erwin is entitled \nto inspect the records of all final actions taken by Myers Park’s shareholders without \na meeting from 1 January 2019 through 12 March 2021 that address or discuss (1) \nthe Project, (2) revenue shortfalls, or (3) plans or proposals to address revenue \nshortfalls, and the Court thus orders that Myers Park produce these documents to \nthe extent that Erwin demanded them and to the extent that these records are in  \nMyers Park’s possession and have not already been produced. \nii. Request Number 4 \n37. Because a  qualified shareholder has an  absolute right to inspect “[a]ll \nwritten communications to shareholders generally within the past three years [,]” \nN.C.G.S. § 55-16-01(e)(5), the Court concludes that Erwin is entitled to inspect “[a]ll \nwritten communications to shareholders generally [from 1 January 2019 through 12 \nMarch 2021]  that address or discuss: (a) the Project; (b) Myers Park revenue \nshortfalls; or (c) plans or proposals to address revenue shortfalls [,]” as demanded in \nrequest number 4.   (Demand 4.) \n38. According to Erwin, Myers Park has produced some, but not all, records \nresponsive to request number 4.  The specific records that Erwin contends have not \nbeen produced are (1) “renderings, narratives, presentations, and brochures” related \nto the Project, which Erwin asserts were shared with shareholders at a shareholder \n \n \nmeeting, and (2) “[w]ritten communications to shareholders generally that address or \ndiscuss Myers Park  revenue shortfalls or plans or proposals to address revenue \nshortfalls.”  (Pl.’s Opening Br. 10 (citing Zoutewelle Dep. 43 –44); Pl.’s Reply Br . 12, \nECF No. 34.) \n39. With respect to the renderings, narratives, presentations, and brochures \nrelated to the Project, Myers Park’s opposition brief represented that it had already \nprovided these records  to Erwin.  (Def.’s Resp. Br. 15.)  Then, in response to the \nCourt’s questioning during the July 7 Hearing, Myers Park’s counsel clarified that it \nhad not, in fact,  produced those records because Myers Park did not believe these \nrecords constituted  written communications to shareholders.   After additional \nquestioning by the Court, Myers Park’s counsel appeared to concede that the records \ncould properly be construed as written communications to shareholders.  Also, Myers \nPark’s counsel emailed the Court, with a copy to opposing counsel, following the July \n7 Hearing  and represented that Erwin’s counsel had been provided a “brochure \n(including schematics).” \n40. The Court concludes  that the statutory term “written communications to \nshareholders[,]” N.C.G.S. § 55 -16-01(e)(5), includes renderings, narratives, \npresentations, and brochures  presented to shareholders at a shareholder meeting .  \nTherefore, to the extent  that Myers Park has not already done so,  it shall produce \nany renderings, narratives, presentations, and brochures related to the Project that  \nit shared with its shareholders at any shareholder meeting that took place between \n1 January 2019 and 12 March 2021. \n \n \n41. As to written communications to shareholders generally that address or \ndiscuss Myers Park’s revenue shortfalls or plans or proposals to address revenue \nshortfalls, Myers Park states that “in 2020, there were no  revenue shortfalls in the \nsense that revenues exceeded expenses, and —as reflected in  the financial \ndocuments—[Myers Park] ended the year with a record high of $2.87MM [sic] in cash, \nabout twice the cash position of year end 2019. ”  (Def.’s Resp. Br. 5 n.2.)   Erwin, on \nthe other hand,  asserts that “revenue shortfalls measure actual revenue  against \nprojected revenue—projections that Myers Park refuses to produce.”  (Pl.’s Reply Br. \n3.) \n42. Myers Park must produce  any written communications to shareholders \ngenerally from 1 January 2019 through 12 March 2021 that address or discuss (1) its \nactual revenue falling short of its projected revenue  or (2) plans or proposals to \naddress its actual revenue falling short of its projected revenue.  That Erwin chose to \ntailor request number 4 to certain topics does not take away his absolute right to \ninspect “[a]ll written communications to shareholders generally within the past three \nyears[,]” N.C.G.S. § 55-16-01(e)(5) (emphasis added), a right that necessarily extends \nto written communications to shareholders generally regarding Myers Park’s actual \nrevenue falling short of its projected revenue. \n43. In sum, the Court grants request number 4 in its entirety. \nB. Qualified Right of Inspection Under Section 55-16-02(b) \n44. Pursuant to section 55-16-02(b) of the Corporation Act,  \n[a] qualified shareholder of a corporation is entitled to inspect and copy, \nduring regular business hours at a reasonable locatio n specified by the \n \n \ncorporation, any of the following records of the corporation if the \nshareholder meets the requirements of subsection (c) and gives the \ncorporation written notice of his demand at least five business days \nbefore the date on which he wishes to inspect and copy: \n \n(1) Records of any final action taken with or without a meeting by \nthe board of directors, or by a committee of the board of directors \nwhile acting in place of the board of directors on behalf of the \ncorporation, minutes of any meeting of the shareholders and records \nof action taken by the shareholders without a meeting, to the extent \nnot subject to inspection under G.S. 55-16-02(a); \n \n(2) Accounting records of the corporation; and \n \n(3) The record of shareholders[.] \n \nN.C.G.S. § 55-16-02(b). \n45. Unlike the absolute right of inspection under section 55-16-02(a), the right \nof inspection under section 55 -16-02(b) is considered a qualified one because a \nqualified shareholder may inspect and copy the records listed in section 55-16-02(b) \nonly if “(1) [h]is demand is made in good faith and for a proper purpose; (2) [h]e \ndescribes with reasonable particularity his purpose and the records he desires  to \ninspect; and (3) [t]he records are directly connected with his purpose.”  N.C.G.S. § 55-\n16-02(c).   \n46. As noted, Erwin has demonstrated that he is a qualified shareholder and \nthat he gave written notice of his demand for inspection at least five business days \nbefore the date on which he demanded to inspect and copy the records.  Accordingly, \nthe Court must now assess whether Erwin has met the three requirements of section \n55-16-02(c).   \n \n \n47. Myers Park argues that Erwin’s Inspection Demand was not made for a \nproper purpose.  According to Myers Park, the records sought by Erwin “are directed \nto a re-assessment of the Board’s business judgment as to whether the Project should \nor should not be undertaken and what contractors should or should not be hired to \ncomplete the Project,” which  represents an improper “[s]econd -guessing [of] a \ncorporate board’s business judgment.”  (Def.’s Resp. Br. 14 .)  In other words, Myers \nPark believes that a corporation can use the business judgment rule to shield itself \nfrom a shareholder’s statutory right to inspect certain records of the corporation. \n48. The Court disagrees.  As Erwin correctly points out, Myers Park has not \ncited to any controlling North Carolina law supporting Myers Park’s theory, and the \nCourt’s own research also has not revealed such law.11   \n49. More importantly, the Court concludes that Erwin asserted a proper \npurpose in the Inspection Demand.  See Parsons v. Jefferson -Pilot Corp., 106 N.C. \nApp. 307, 323  (1992) (“To determine whether a shareholder’s demand meets the \nrequirements of N.C.G.S. § 55 -16-02(c), the trial court must focus upon the demand \nitself[.]”), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds , 333 N.C. 420  (1993).  Indeed, \nthe Inspection Demand stated that Erwin  \nis making this demand for inspection in good faith and for a proper \npurpose, specifically to investigate: (1) whether the Project is in the best \n \n11  Cf. Seraph Garrison, LLC v. Garrison , 247 N.C. App. 115 , 122  (2016) (“The business \njudgment rule operates primarily as a rule of evidence or judicial review and creates, first, \nan initial evidentiary presumption that in making a decision the di rectors acted with due \ncare (i.e., on an informed basis) and in good faith in the honest belief that their action was in \nthe best interest of the corporation, and second, absent rebuttal of the initial presumption, a \npowerful substantive presumption that a decision by a loyal and informed board will not be \noverturned by a court unless it cannot be attributed to any rational business purpose.” \n(cleaned up)). \n \n \ninterest of Myers Park; (2) whether the Board’s approval of the Project \ncomplies with Myers Park’s Bylaws; (3) whether any improper \ntransactions have occurred in connection with the Board’s approval of \nthe Project; (4) any potential mismanagement, misappropriation, \nmisapplication, conflict of interest, or improper use of Myers Park funds \nrelated to the Project; and (5) the Project’s financial feasibility and \nimplications on costs, debt, fees, and income. \n \n(Demand 5.)   The Inspection Demand further stated that Erwin “intends to \ncommunicate” with other club members and shareholders of Myers Park about his \ninvestigation into these matters.  (Demand 3.) \n50. This stated purpose by Erwin is the type generally recognized as satisfying \nthe proper purpose requirement  necessary to support a share holder inspection \ndemand.  See, e.g., Cooke v. Outland, 265 N.C. 601, 615 (1965) (holding that “a proper \npurpose” existed where a shareholder’s written demand for inspection “indicate[d] on \n[its] face” that the shareholder was “ investigating the conduct of [the corporation’s] \nmanagement to determine the [corporation’s] financial condition” and also “whether \nit [was] efficiently managed”); Carter v. Wilson Constr. Co., 83 N.C. App. 61, 65 (1986) \n(noting that “[p] urposes which previously have been deemed proper ” include  “the \nshareholder’s good faith desire” to “investigate the conduct of the management” and \n“determine the financial condition of the corporation”); Sharman, 2018 NCBC LEXIS \n27, at *14–15 (concluding that a written demand for inspection reflected “a proper \npurpose” where the demand stated that the shareholders needed to “determine \nwhether ‘any improper transactions have occurred and to determine any possible \nmismanagement of [the corporation]  or any possible misappropriation, \nmisapplication, or improper use of any property or asset of [the corporation ]’ ”); \n \n \nN.C.G.S. § 55-16-02 Official Comment 3  (“As a practical matter, a shareholder who \nalleges a purpose in general terms, such as a desire  . . . to communicate with fellow \nshareholders, or to determine whether improper transactions have occurred, has been \nheld to allege a ‘proper purpose.’ ”).12 \n51. In addition, where, as here, a qualified shareholder has stated a proper \npurpose in his inspection demand, the shareholder is entitled to a “presumption of \ngood faith,” which the corporation can only overcome “by carrying its burden to show \nthat [the shareholder’s] purpose is improper.”  Sharman, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 27, at \n*15 (citing Carter, 83 N.C. App. at 65).   Myers Park has failed to meet that burden \nhere.13 \n52. Myers Park has not offered sufficient evidence or law upon which the Court \ncan conclude that Erwin’s Inspection Demand was not made in good faith and for a \nproper purpose.   \n53. Myers Park  appears to also question whether  Erwin has satisfied the \ndirectly connected requirement.  (Def.’s Resp. Br. 13 –14.)  On this issue, the Court \nconcludes that Erwin has sufficiently demonstrated that the records he requested \nfrom Myers Park are directly connected with his stated purpose for requesting those \n \n12  Although the Official Comment to section 55 -16-02 is not binding because it was not \nenacted into law, it was “included with the printing of the statute,” and thus, it is “relevant \nin construing the intent of the statute.”  Miller v. First Bank, 206 N.C. App. 166, 171 (2010). \n \n13  In its opposition brief, Myers Park questions Erwin’s motive for bringing this action by \nreferencing Erwin’s deposition testimony regarding an email account entitled \n“mpccwomen1@gmail.com,” which Myers Park alleges Erwin used to communicate with other \nmembers of Myers Park.  (Def.’s Resp. Br. 2.)  However, Myers Park did not sub mit to the \nCourt for its consideration the referenced deposition testimony.  \n \n \nrecords, as required under section 55-16-02(c).  The Court bases its conclusion on its \nreview of the record before it, including Erwin’s Inspection Demand  and all  the \nrecords demanded therein. \n54. For the first time, at the July 7 Hearing, Myers Park’s counsel argued that \nthe Inspection Demand did not describe  with reasonable particularity Erwin’s \nrequest for records relating to Myers Park’s “revenue shortfalls” (though counsel did \nconcede that  Erwin described with reasonable particularity all other requested \nrecords, as well as Erwin’s stated purpose for requesting records from Myers Park).  \nAs noted, Erwin asserts that the term “revenue shortfalls ,” as used by Erwin in the \nInspection Demand, means situations where Myers Park’s actual revenue fell short \nof its projected revenue.   \n55. “Whether a shareholder has described  . . . the desired records with \nreasonable particularity necessarily depends upon the facts and circumstances of \neach case.”  Parsons v. Jefferson-Pilot Corp., 333 N.C. 420, 429  (1993).  The Official \nComment to section 55-16-02 “provides that under the ‘reasonable particularity’ \nrequirement, a shareholder should make more meaningful statements of purpose and \nthe desired records when ‘feasible.’  ”  Id. (quoting N.C.G.S. § 55 -16-02 Official \nComment 3).  Put differently, the test for the reasonable particularity requirement is \na “relative one” such that in some cases, “[e]ven a generalized designation should be \nsufficient” when the shareholder cannot “give a more particular description” and the \ncorporation “will have no difficulty in understanding what is wanted.”  Id. (quoting 8 \n \n \nCharles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2211, at 628–\n31 (1970)). \n56. Applying these principle s to the facts and circumstances of this case, the \nCourt concludes that Myers Park should not have had any trouble understanding \nthat when Erwin used the term “revenue shortfalls,”  he meant a situation where \nMyers Park’s actual revenue fell short of its projected revenue.  Indeed, the Inspection \nDemand referenced “concerns” that Erwin had about the Project’s “ financial \nfeasibility and implication on Myers Park’s financial health .”  (Demand 2.)  The \nInspection Demand  also stated that “[t]here is no evidence that the Project will \nincrease revenues or provide  any real benefit to Myers Park ” and that  “[i]t will \ninstead make a bad financial situation worse.”  (Demand 2.)  Moreover, Myers Park’s \nagent, Zoutewelle, demonstrated a strong understanding of financial concepts during \nher deposition, and the Court is confident that at the time Erwin made his Inspection \nDemand, Myers Park  had other capable agents like Zoutewelle  who could have \nexplained to Myers Park what records Erwin was seeking.   \n57. For these reasons , the Court concludes that Erwin’s Inspection Demand \ndescribed with reasonable particularity his request for records relating to Myers \nPark’s “revenue shortfalls.”14 \n \n14  Plaintiff’s counsel seemingly suggested during the July 7 Hearing that Plaintiff is also \nseeking records related to “revenue shortfalls” of certain departments of Myers Park, such as \nthe food and beverage department.  The Court, however, concludes that the Inspection \nDemand does not describe with reasonable particularity such a request, and thus, to the \nextent that the Court requires production of records related to Myers Park’s  “revenue \nshortfalls,” Defendant shall only be required to produce records relating to Myers Park as a \nwhole, and not to any specific departments of Myers Park. \n \n \n58. In sum, the Court determines that Erwin has met the three requirements \nof section 55-16-02(c).  The Court next considers whether any of the remaining records \ndemanded in request numbers 3, 5 , 6, 7, 9, and 10 from the Inspection Demand fall \nwithin the categories of records that Erwin is entitled to inspect under section 55-16-\n02(b). \ni. Request Number 3 \n59. The remainder of request  number 3 demanded “[t]he minutes of \nall . . . Board meetings, and the records of all final actions taken by . . . the Board, or \ncommittees of the Board in place of the Board  . . . that address or discuss: (a) the \nProject; (b) Myers Park revenue shortfalls; or (c) plans or proposals to address \nrevenue shortfalls” from 1 January 2019 through 12 March 2021.  (Demand 4.) \n60. The Court first addresses  the requested records pertaining to the Board.  \nTo begin, the Court concludes that Erwin’s request to inspect the minutes of all Board \nmeetings that address or discuss the above three subjects  is overbroad.  Section 55-\n16-02(b) grants Erwin a qualified right to inspect “[r]ecords of any final action taken \nwith or without a meeting by” the Board.  N.C.G.S. § 55-16-02(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \nThe statute, however, does  not grant Erwin the right to inspect Board meeting \nminutes that do not reflect final action taken by the Board .  See Sharman, 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 27,  at *19 (“The drafters of the [Corporation Act ] substituted this \nreference to ‘final action taken ’ in lieu of the Model Act ’s reference to ‘excerpt from \nminutes’ with the intent of excluding discussions and preliminary actions by the \nboard and its committees.” (quoting Robinson, supra, § 10.03[2]))). \n \n \n61. Thus, the Court grants request number 3 to the extent that it demanded to \ninspect records of all final action taken by the Board from 1 January 2019 through 12 \nMarch 2021 that address or discuss: (1) the Project, (2) Myers Park revenue shortfalls, \nor (3) plans or proposals to address revenue shortfalls, and the Court denies request \nnumber 3 to the extent that it demanded minutes of Board meetings that do not \nreflect any final action taken by the Board.   \n62. Accordingly, to the extent that Myers Park has in its possession additional \nBoard meeting minutes  that reflect final action taken by the Board and that are \nresponsive to request number 3, as granted by the Court, Myers Park must produce \nthose minutes.15 \n63. In addition, to the extent that it has not already done so, Myers Park must \nproduce the following records that Erwin claims have not yet been produced by Myers \nPark: (1) record(s) of the Board’s approval of the 2019 membership survey  that was \nthe origin of the Project; (2) record(s) of the Board’s approval of loans relating to the \nProject; (3) record(s) of the Board’s approval of a “negative pledge agreement” relating \nto the Project ; (4) record(s) of the Board’s approval of the grant of collateral in \nconnection with the Project; and (5) record(s) of the Board’s approval of the  budgets \nfor the Project .  (See Pl.’s Reply Br. 12.)  The Court determines that these records  \n \n15  The record shows that Myers Park has provided Erwin with several documents containing \nredacted Board meeting minutes.  (See, e.g., Pl.’s Opening Br. Ex. A, ECF No. 30.1.)  Myers \nPark should review all unredacted Board meeting minutes in its possession to ensure \ncompliance with the Court’s ruling on request number 3.  The Court reserves the right to \nreview minutes of Board meetings in camera if necessary. \n \n \nreflect final action taken by the Board (i.e., approval) and are responsive to request \nnumber 3, as granted by the Court. \n64. As to Erwin’s request for the records of all final actions taken by committees \nof the Board in place of the Board from 1 January 2019 through 12 March 2021 that \naddress or discuss  (1) the Project, (2) Myers Park revenue shortfalls, (3) plans or \nproposals to address revenue shortfalls, Erwin has a qualified right to inspect these \nrecords.  See N.C.G.S. § 55-16-02(b)(1) (permitting a qualified shareholder to inspect \n“[r]ecords of any final action taken with or without a meeting by  . . . a committee of \nthe board of directors . . . on behalf of the corporation”).   \n65. However, Myers Park represents in its opposition brief that “because there \nhave not been any final actions taken by a committee in place of the Board, there are \nno such records to produce.”  (Def.’s Resp. Br. 18.)  Zoutewelle also testified during \nher deposition that she “had not seen” a committee of the Board take final action in \nplace of the Board and that “[t]here are no actions that any committee has taken \nrelated to this project that aren’t final actions of the board.”  (Zoutewelle Dep. 33, 80.)  \nAs a result, and based on the same considerations discussed above regarding Erwin’s \nrequest for shareholder meeting minutes, t he Court determines that there are no \nrecords of final committee action , as described in request number 3 , and therefore \ndenies request number 3 to the extent that it demanded such records. \n66. In sum, the Court grants in part and denies in part request number 3, as \nset forth in section III.A.i. and section III.B.i. of this Order and Opinion. \n \n \n \nii. Request Number 5  \n67. Request number 5 seeks “[t]he capital and operating budgets that: (a) the \nFinancial Committee in coordination with the General Manager recommended to the \nBoard for adoption for 2020 and 2021, as required in Article IX, Section 2(a) of the \nBylaws; and (b) and [sic] the Board approved for 2020 and 2021, along with all \namendments to those budgets, as required in Article IX, Section 2(b) of the Bylaw s.”  \n(Demand 4.) \n68. Erwin argues he is entitled to inspect these documents because they \nconstitute both records of final action  taken by the Board and accounting records of \nMyers Park.  (See Pl.’s Opening Br. 18 n.8.)  Myers Park disagrees, contending in its \nbrief that Sharman makes clear that the capital and operating budgets and \namendments to the budgets are not records of final action by the Board, (Def.’s Resp. \nBr. 16–17), and arguing at the July 7 Hearing  that these documents are not \naccounting records of Myers Park. \n69. Based on a straightforward application of section  55-16-02(b), the Court \nconcludes that, to the extent that the 2020 and 2021 capital and operating budgets  \nand any amendments to these budgets were approved by the Board, these budgets \nand amendments can properly be considered “[r]ecords of any final action \ntaken . . . by the board of directors[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 55-16-02(b)(1).  In the Court’s view, \nthis statutory language is broad enough to cover a budget approved by a corporation’s \nboard of directors, since the board’s approval in this context is a final action taken by \nthe board, and the budget, as approved by the board, is logically a record of that final \n \n \naction taken by the board.  Nothing in section 55-16-02(b) or the Official Comment to \nthis section suggests that the Court’s application of this broad statutory language is \nimproper. \n70. Furthermore, Myers Park ’s reliance on Sharman is misguided.  In \nSharman, this Court observed that “[t]he drafters of [section 55-16-02(b)] substituted \nthis reference to ‘final action taken’ in lieu of the Model Act’s reference to ‘excerpt \nfrom minutes’ with the intent of excluding discussions and preliminary actions by the \nboard and its committees.”  2018 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *19 (quoting Robinson, supra, \n§ 10.03[2]).  Here, the Board’s approval of the capital and operating budgets and any \namendments to these budgets  cannot reasonably be likened to “discussions and \npreliminary actions” by the Board. \n71. In short, the Court grants request number 5 in its entirety on the basis that \nthe records demanded in this request constitute records of final action taken by the \nBoard.  As a result, the Court need not consider whether  budgets approved by a \ncorporation’s board of directors can also be properly considered accounting records of \nthe corporation.  \niii. Request Number 6  \n72. Request number 6 demanded production of “[a]ll capital expenditures in \nexcess of $5,000, which are required to be approved by the Board in Article IX, Section \n2(c) of the Bylaws, related to: (a) the Project; or (b) any plans or proposals to address \nrevenue shortfalls” from 1 January 2019 through 12 March 2021.  (Demand 4.) \n \n \n73. Based on the same considerations discussed above regarding request \nnumber 5, the Court concludes that, to the extent that the capi tal expenditures \ndemanded in request number 6 were approved by the Board, these expenditures can \nproperly be considered “[r]ecords of any final action taken  . . . by the board of \ndirectors[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 55-16-02(b)(1).   \n74. Accordingly, the Court will require Myers Park  to produce records \nevidencing the capital expenditures described in request number 5, but only to the \nextent that such expenditures were, in fact, approved by the Board.   \n75. In sum, the Court grants request number 6, subject to the above parameters \nset forth by the Court. \niv. Request Numbers 7, 9, and 10 \n76. The Court next considers request numbers 7 , 9, and 10 together, as Erwin \ncontends that the records demanded in these requests all constitute accounting \nrecords of Myers Park. \n77. Pursuant to section 55 -16-02(b), a qualified shareholder has the qualified \nright to inspect  the “[a]ccounting records of the corporation [.]” N.C.G.S. § 55 -16-\n02(b)(2).  “Although the term is left undefined in the [Corporation] Act, the Official \nComments describe ‘accounting records’ as ‘records that permit financial statements \nto be prepared which fairly present the financial position and transactions of the \ncorporation.’ ”  Sharman, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *23 (quoting N.C.G.S. § 55-16-01 \nOfficial Comment 2).  In addition, the North Carolina Court of Appeals has noted that \naccounting records “are generally defined as ‘[t]he formal journals and ledgers, and \n \n \nthe vouchers, invoices, correspondence, contracts, and other sources or support for \nsuch records . . . .’ ”  Parsons, 106 N.C. App. at 318–19 (quoting Kohler’s Dictionary \nfor Accountants 13–14 (W.W. Cooper & Y. Ijiri eds., 6th ed. 1983)). \n78. Request number 7 demanded, in relevant part, “[a]ll Myers Park accounting \nrecords . . . including but not limited to  . . . general ledgers ” from 1 January 2019 \nthrough 12 March 2021.  (Demand 4.)  Consistent with the case law discussed above \nsurrounding the term “accounting records,” the Court concludes that the remaining \nrecords demanded in request number 7 can properly be considered accounting records \nof Myers Park.  Notably, Zoutewelle’s deposition testimony establishes that Myers \nPark maintains a general ledger, though it is unclear from the record whether Myers \nPark has produced this general ledger.  (Zoutewelle Dep. 54.)  As a result, to the \nextent that it has not already done so, Myers Park must produce its general ledger  \nfrom 1 January 2019 through 12 March 2021. \n79. Erwin also asserts that he is entitled to “[a]ll documents provided to [Myers \nPark’s] accountants to compile [Myers Park ’s] financial statements in 2019 and \n2020[,]” as part of his request for Myers Park’s accounting records.  (Pl.’s Reply Br. \n13.)  The Court agrees.  Since a corporation’s accounting records include “records that \npermit financial statements to be prepared,” Sharman, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 27, at *23 \n(citation omitted) , the Court concludes that Erwin is entitled to inspect the same \ndocuments that Myers Park provided to its accountants to prepare Myers Park’s 2019 \nand 2020 financial statements. \n \n \n80. At the July 7 Hearing, Myers Park’s counsel represented that all documents \nsent to Myers Park’s accountants to prepare its 2020 financial statements had, by \nthat date , been produced while only some of the documents sent to Myers Park ’s \naccountants to prepare its 2019 financial statements had been produced.  Counsel \nfurther represented that Myers Park has no record of the documents it sent to its \naccountants for the 2019 financial statements, since the online ShareFile account \nused by Myers Park to electronically transmit these documents to the corporation’s \naccountants is no longer active.  The Court concludes, however, that Myers Park has \nnot presented to the Court sufficient evidence to corroborate its counsel’s \nrepresentations.  Thus, having determined that Erwin is entitled to inspect the same \ndocuments that Myers Park sent to its accountants to prepare Myers Park’s 2019 and \n2020 financial statements, the Court will require Myers Park to conduct a thorough \nsearch of all its records for all documents that Myers Park provided to its accountants \nto prepare Myers Park’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements.16  If the records search \ndoes not reveal any new responsive documents, Myers Park must file an affidavit \nattesting to that fact, and the affidavit must also describe the method(s) Myers Park \nused to conduct its records search.  But if the records search does reveal additional \nresponsive documents, Myers Park must produce those documents. \n81. In sum, the Court grants request number 7 to the extent that it demanded \nMyers Park “accounting records,” including “general ledgers .”  Further, the records \n \n16  To be clear, Myers Park must search for the documents that it sent to its accountants for \nthe preparation of its financial statements, and not simply the documents that the \naccountants ultimately relied on to prepare the statements. \n \n \ncovered by this request include the same documents that Myers Park  sent to its \naccountants to prepare Myers Park’s 2019 and 2020 financial statements. \n82. As to r equest number 9, the records demanded in this request are “[a]ll \nreports prepared by and communications with the planning consultants, the building \ncontractors and subcontractors, and any other consultants or advisors that Myers \nPark retained in connection with the Project” from 1 January 2019 through 12 March \n2021.  (Demand 4.)  Meanwhile, request number 10 demanded “[a]ll invoices, \ncorrespondence, contracts, reports, projections, plans, or budgets from any \nconsultants or other third parties Myers Park has retained or has considered \nretaining in connection with the Project” from 1 January 2019 through 12 March \n2021.  (Demand 4.) \n83. Erwin contends that these records constitute accounting records of Myers \nPark.  (See Pl.’s Reply Br. 11.)  The Court agrees in part. \n84. On their face, the records demanded in request numbers  9 and 10 do not \nappear to be accounting records, as interpreted by North Carolina courts.  However, \nto the extent that any of the “reports,” “communications,” “invoices,” \n“correspondence,” “contracts,” “reports,” “projections,” “plans,” or “budgets” described \nin these requests were sources of information used by Myers  Park to prepare or \nmaintain it s general ledger or the “full accounting system” (Jonas) identified by \nZoutewelle in her deposition testimony , (Zoutewelle Dep. 67), these records can \nproperly be considered accounting records of Myers Park.  See Parsons, 106 N.C. App. \nat 318–19 (describing accounting records as “the formal journals and ledgers, and the \n \n \nvouchers, invoices, correspondence, contracts, and other sources or  support for such \nrecords” (citation omitted)) .  And to the extent  that any of the records described in \nrequest numbers 9 and 10 were provided by Myers Park to its accountants for the \npurpose of preparing either the 2019 or 2020 financial statements, Erwin is entitled \nto inspect them based on the same considerations discussed above in paragraph s 79 \nand 80.  \n85. As such, the Court grants request number s 9 and 10, subject to the above \nparameters set forth by the Court .  To the extent that the records demanded in \nrequest numbers 9 and 10 do not fit within these parameters, the Court denies these \nrequests. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n86. For the foregoing reasons, and pursuant to section 55 -16-04 of the \nCorporation Act, the Court GRANTS in part  and DENIES in part  Erwin’s \nInspection Request and hereby ORDERS as follows: \na.
