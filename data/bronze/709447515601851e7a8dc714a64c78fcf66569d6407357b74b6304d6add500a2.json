Packer, 2020 NCBC 70. \n2 \n \nMorris Law Firm, PLLC, by Bradley C. Morris, for Plaintiff Morris \nInternational, Inc. \n \nJames, McElroy & Diehl, P.A., by Fred B. Monroe, for Defendants Sherri \nKennington Fag an, Kristi Kennington Hall, Kathy Kennington Davis, \nand Kennington Investment Company, Inc. \n \nVann Law Firm, P.A., by Christopher M. Vann, for Defendants Anthony \nWilliam Packer, Packer Investment Company, Inc., PA&K, LLC, Olde \nBeau General Partnership, and KPP, LLC. \n \nJerry Meek, Attorney at Law, PLLC, by Gerald F. Meek, for Defendants \nBarry Poole and Laura Poole. \n \nMcGuire, Judge. \n \n1. On January 30, 2020, Plaintiff  filed the Complaint in this matter ,   \n(ECF No. 3), and on March 2, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Amended Complaint.  (ECF No. \n4.)  On March 3, 2020, this case was designated a mandatory complex business case \nand assigned to the undersigned.  (Designation Order, ECF No. 1; Assignment Order, \nECF No. 2.)   The Amended Complaint alleged certain causes of action against \nKennington Defendants and against Packer Defendants. \n2. Kennington Defendants filed their Answers on March 30, 20 20.  (ECF \nNos. 24, 25.)  Kennington Defendants filed Kennington Defendants ’ Motion one day \nlater, on April 1, 2020. (ECF No. 26.)  Kennington  Defendants moved for dismissal \nunder both Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(c).  (Id.) \n3. Packer Defendants filed their Answer on April 8, 2020 at 1:06:50 p.m..   \n(ECF No. 28.)  Packer Defendants immediately thereafter filed the Packer \nDefendants’ Motion.  (ECF No. 29.) \n3 \n \n4. On March 30, 2020, Defendants Barry Poole and Laura Poole filed their \nrespective motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), (“Poole Motions,” ECF Nos. \n19 and 21), but neither has yet filed an answer to the Amended Complaint. The Poole \nMotions remain pending before the Court for decision. \n5. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) “shall be made before pleading \nif a further pleading is permitted.”   N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule 12(b) (emphasis added).   \nAccordingly, this Court has held that under the plain language of Rule 12(b), “a \nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim must be . . . filed prior to an answer .”  \nJohnston v. Johnston Props., Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 119, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nNov. 15, 2018); see also New Friendship Used Clothing Collection, LLC v. Katz, 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 72, at *24 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 18, 2017).   If a party fails to make \na Rule 12(b)(6) motion before filing a responsive pleading, however, the defense is not \nwaived; rather, pursuant to Rule 12(h)(2), the party may raise the defense: (1) in any \npleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a); (2) by motion for judgment on the \npleadings; or (3) at trial.  Id. § 1A -1, Rules 12(b),  12(h)(2).  In addition, a post -\nanswer Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may, if appropriate, \nbe considered as a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings.  New Friendship, \n2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *24 (emphasis added).  \n6. A Rule 12(c) motion is appropriately filed “[a] fter the pleadings are \nclosed but within such time as not to delay the trial. ”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule 12(c).  \nHowever, “‘[t]he pleadings are not closed until all defendants have filed an answer, \neven when one defendant has filed a motion to dismiss instead of answering. ’”  New \n4 \n \nFriendship, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *25 –26 (quoting Garvey v. Seterus, Inc. , No. \n5:16-cv-00209-RLV, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97373, at *35 (W.D.N.C. June 23, 2017)  \nand other authority) (emphasis added). \n7. Here, Packer Defendants filed the Motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), but \ndid so after they had filed their answer.  Therefore, Packer Defendants’ Motion is not \ntimely filed and cannot be properly considered by the Court.  Johnston v. Johnston \nProps., Inc., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 119, *13-15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 15, 2018) (finding \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), filed two minutes after its answer, \nuntimely).  Accordingly, the Packer Defendants’ Motion should be DENIED, without \nprejudice. \n8. Similarly, Kennington Defendants moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) \nafter filing their answer,  so the Court  cannot consider Kennington Defendants’ \nMotion under Rule  12(b)(6).  Kennington Defendants additionally moved , in the \nalternative, for dismissal under Rule 12(c).   However, the pleadings are not closed \nbecause Barry Poole and Laura Poole have not yet filed answers (or otherwise \nreceived a determination on the Poole Motions).  Therefore, the Court cannot consider \nthe Kennington Defendants’ Motion under Rule 12(c).  New Friendship, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 72, at *26 (court denied without prejudice defendant’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss and held that it could not exercise its discretion to convert it into a Rule 12(c) \nmotion because, although moving defendant had filed an answer prior to its motion, \nthe other defendants in the lawsuit had not yet filed answers).1 \n \n1 For the same reason, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to treat Packer Defendants’ \nMotion as a motion under Rule 12(c). \n5 \n \nTHEREFORE, IT IS  ORDERED that Packer Defendants’ Motion and \nKennington Defendants’ Motion are DENIED , without prejudice to their respective \nrights to file motions under Rule 12(c) at such time as the pleadings have been closed \nby the filing of answers by all Defendants, or determination of the Poole Motions have \notherwise rendered the pleadings closed.  \nSO ORDERED, this the 8th day of October, 2020. \n \n \n/s/ Gregory P. McGuire    \nGregory P. McGuire \nSpecial Superior Court Judge for \nComplex Business Cases \n \n "
