THIS MATTER  is before the Court on the  Motions to Strike Smith \nDefendants’ Affirmative Defenses (the “Motions to Strike” or the “Motions”) filed by \nthe plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”) in Merrell, et al. v. Smith, et al. , (ECF No. 43 [19 CVS \n21650]); Strack, et al. v. Smith, et al., (ECF No. 58 [19 CVS 22027]); and Cochrane, et \nal. v. Smith, et al. , (ECF No. 44 [19 CVS 23665] ) (together, the “CBB \nActions”).1  Because the Motions to Strike raise the same legal issues and arguments, \nthe Court herein considers the Motions together in this Order and Opinion.   For the \nreasons stated below, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part the Motions \nto Strike. \n \n1  The CBB Actions were originally comprised of four cases, but on September 28, 2020, the \nsole Plaintiff in Short v. Smith, et al.  voluntarily dismissed without prejudice his claims \nagainst all Defendants in that case, (ECF No. 86 [19 CVS 23856]), leaving the Merrell, Strack, \nand Cochrane cases as the three remaining CBB Actions.    \nMerrell v. Smith, 2020 NCBC 77. \n \n \nHemmings & Stevens, by Aaron C. Hemmings, for Plaintiffs. \n \nParker Poe Adams & Bernstein LLP, by Michael G. Adams, Morgan H. \nRogers, Nicholas H. Lee, and Alexandra S. Davidson, and Bell, Davis & \nPitt, PA, by Edward B. Davis and Adam R. deNobriga, for Defendants \nJames M. Smith and Jennifer Smith. \n \nRobinson, Judge. \nI. BACKGROUND \n2. The parties vary across the CBB Actions,  but each lawsuit involves  the \nsame core allegations .  Plaintiffs allege that they invested in Carolina  Beer & \nBeverage Group, LLC, f/k/a Carolina Beer & Beverage, LLC (“CB&B”) based on the \nfinancial advice of the late Richard C. Siskey (“Mr. Siskey”).  They further allege that \nJames M. Smith (“Mr. Smith”) , Jennifer Smith (“Mrs. Smith”) (together, the \n“Smiths”), and Mr. Siskey together engaged in a fraudulent insider trading scheme, \nwhich induced Plaintiffs to transfer their respective ownership interests in CB&B to \nMr. Siskey prior to the company being sold, thereby causing Plaintiffs to miss out on \nthe substantial profits resulting from the sale.  Plaintiffs have asserted breach of \nfiduciary duty,  constructive fraud, fraud, and civil conspiracy claims against the \nSmiths.  Mr. Smith is the  former manager and majority shareholder of CB&B , and \nMrs. Smith is a former employee of the company and Mr. Smith’s wife. \n3. Plaintiffs initiated the CBB Actions upon filing their respective Complaints \nin November 2019 (Merrell and Strack) and December 2019 (Cochrane).  (ECF Nos. 2 \n[19 CVS 21650]; 3 [19 CVS 22027]; 3 [19 CVS 23665].)  Each of the CBB Actions was \ndesignated to the Business Court and was assigned to the undersigned in December \n \n \n2019 ( Merrell and Strack) and January 2020 ( Cochrane).  (ECF Nos. 1 [19 CVS \n21650]; 1, 2 [19 CVS 22027]; 1, 2 [19 CVS 23665].)  \n4. On January 28, 2020, Plaintiffs in Merrell, Strack, and Cochrane filed their \nrespective Amended Complaints, (ECF Nos. 19 [19 CVS 21650] ; 28 [19 CVS 22027] ; \n7 [19 CVS 23665], and on March 10, 2020, Plaintiffs in Merrell and Strack filed their \nrespective Second Amended Complaints, (ECF Nos. 24 [19 CVS 21650] ; 28 [19 CVS \n22027].  (The last filed complaints  in the three remaining CBB Actions  are \nrespectively referred to as the “Cochrane Complaint ,” the “Merrell Complaint ,” and \nthe “Strack Complaint,” and collectively as “Plaintiffs’ Complaints.”) \n5.  On February 6, 2020, the Court held a status conference with counsel for \nthe parties in the CBB Actions and other related litigation .  (See ECF Nos. 20 [19 \nCVS 21650]; 29 [19 CVS 22027]; 11 [19 CVS 23665].)  Thereafter , the parties in the \nCBB Actions filed their respective Case Management Plans, in which they agreed to \ncoordinate these cases for discovery and motions practice purposes. (See ECF Nos. 25 \n[19 CVS 21650]; 34 [19 CVS 22027]; 18 [19 CVS 23665].) \n6. The Smiths filed their Answers to Plaintiffs’ Complaints  (the “Smiths’ \nAnswers” or the “Answers” ) in each of the CBB Actions  on April 23, 2020, raising \nseveral defenses to Plaintiffs’ claims against them.  (ECF Nos. 39 [19 CVS 21650] [the \n“Merrell Answer”]; 54 [19 CVS 22027] [the “Strack Answer”]; 38 [19 CVS 23665] [the \n“Cochrane Answer”].)  The Smiths’ Answers mirror each other for the most part. \n \n \n7. On June 1, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the Motions to Strike.2  On that same day, \nthey filed Memorandums in Support of the Motions to Strike.  (ECF Nos. 44 [19 CVS \n21650] [the “Merrell Mem. in Supp. ”]; 59 [19 CVS 22027]  [the “Strack Mem. in \nSupp.”]; 45 [19 CVS 23665]  [the “Cochrane Mem. in Supp. ”].)  Each of the Motions \nrequests, pursuant to Nort h Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f), that the Court \nstrike several defenses from the Smiths’ Answers.    \n8. The Smiths filed Briefs in Opposition to the Motions to Strike in each of the \nCBB Actions  on June 8, 2020. ( ECF Nos. 47 [19 CVS 21650] [the “Merrell Br. in \nOpp’n”]; 65 [19 CVS 22027] [ the “Strack Br. in Opp’n” ]; 51 [19 CVS 23665] [ the \n“Cochrane Br. in Opp’n”].)  Plaintiffs did not file a reply brief. \n9. On October 5, 2020, the Court held a hearing  by video conference on the \nMotions to Strike (the “October 5 Hearing”).  The Motions are now ripe for resolution. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n10. Under Rule 12(f), a trial court “may order stricken from any pleading any \ninsufficient defense  or any redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, impertinent, or \nscandalous matter.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 12(f).  “Rule 12(f) motions are viewed with \ndisfavor and are infrequently granted.”  Daily v. Mann Media, Inc., 95 N.C. App. 746, \n748–49, 384 S.E.2d 54, 56 (1989)  (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  Nevertheless, whether to grant or deny a Rule 12(f) motion to strike is \n \n2  Plaintiffs in Short also filed a Motion to Strike Smith Defendants’ Affirmative Defenses, \n(ECF No. 41 [19 CVS 23856]), but as noted, this case has been voluntarily dismissed without \nprejudice, and therefore, this Order and Opinion does not address this motion.  \n \n \nwithin the trial court’s sound discretion.   Reese v. City of Charlotte , 196 N.C. App. \n557, 567, 676 S.E.2d 493, 499 (2009).    \n11. “A motion under Rule 12(f) is a device to test the legal sufficiency of an \naffirmative defense.”  Faulconer v. Wysong and Miles Co. , 155 N.C. App. 598, 601, \n574 S.E.2d 688, 691 (2002) (citing First-Citizens Bank & Tr. Co. v. Akelaitis, 25 N.C. \nApp. 522, 525, 214 S.E.2d 281, 284 (1975)).  “The requirements for pleading a defense \nare no more stringent than the requirements for pleading a claim for relief.”  Vernon \nv. Crist , 291 N.C. 646, 653, 231 S.E.2d 591, 595 (1977)  (citing Bell v.  Traders & \nMechanics Ins. Co. , 16 N.C. App. 591,  593, 192 S.E.2d 711, 712  (1972)); see also  \nMozingo v. N.C. Nat’l Bank, 31 N.C. App. 157, 163, 229 S.E.2d 57, 62 (1976) (noting \nthat Rule 12(f) is an “ analogue to” Rule 12(b)(6)  and that “ the same tests apply” to \nboth rules (citing Akelaitis, 25 N.C. App. at 525, 214 S.E.2d at 284)).  Rule 8 sets forth \nthe general pleading r equirements for both claims for relief and defenses.   See \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 8(a)–(c); Smith v. N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 84 N.C. App. \n120, 123, 351 S.E.2d 774, 776 (1987).   “Rule 8 was intended to liberalize pleading \nrequirements by adopting the concept of ‘notice pleading, ’ thereby abolishing the \nmore strict requirements of ‘fact pleading.’”  Smith, 84 N.C. App. at 123, 351 S.E.2d \nat 776 (citing Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 100, 176 S.E.2d 161, 164 (1970)). \n12. Notwithstanding Rule 8’s liberal pleading standards  and the infrequent \ngranting of Rule 12(f) motions, “defenses may be stricken from pleadings, if they are \ninsufficient as a matter of law.” Nat’l Fin. Partners Corp. v. Ray, 2014 NCBC LEXIS \n50, at * 18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 13, 2014)  (quoting Palmer v. Oakland Farms, Inc. , \n \n \n2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63265, at *4 (W.D. Va. June 24, 2010)).  In National Financial \nPartners, for example , this Court struck  several defenses that were not “well -\ngrounded in fact” and “speculative” in nature.   Id. at *18–23.  There, the Court \nexplained that: \n“[T]o survive a motion to strike, a defendant must offer more than a \n‘bare-bones conclusory allegation which simply names a legal theory but \ndoes not indicate how the theory is connected to the case at hand.’”  Villa \nv. Ally Fin., Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25624, at *6 (M.D.N.C. Feb. 28, \n2014) (citation omitted); see also  Johnson v. Clark , 2013 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 95492, at *4 –6 (E.D.N.C. July 9, 2013) (striking “conclusory \ndefenses” that failed to allege sufficient facts to provide the plaintiff with \nsufficient notice of the affirmative defenses in question);  Koehler v. \nUnited States, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163816, at *3– 4 (E.D.N.C. Nov. \n15, 2012) (providing that “conclusory defenses, presented without any \nfactual su pport, should be stricken”);   Odyssey Imaging, LLC v. \nCardiology Assocs. of Johnston, LLC, 752 F. Supp. 2d 721, 726 (W.D. Va. \n2010) (explaining that “dismissal under Rule 12(f) is appropriate where \nthe defendant has not articulated its defenses so that the y are \ncontextually comprehensible”).   “When a court strikes a defense, the \ngeneral practice is to grant the defendant leave to amend.”  Banks v. \nRealty Mgmt. Serv. , 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7501, at *3 (E.D. Va. Jan. \n29, 2010).  \n \nId. at *18–19;\n3 see also Staton v. N. State Acceptance, LLC , No. 1:13 -CV-277, 2013 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 105599, at *7 (M.D.N.C. July 29, 2013) (“At a minimum, therefore, \na statement of an affirmative defense must give notice to an opponent of its basis and \ngo beyond conclusions.”). \n \n3  The Court’s reference to analogous federal cases addressing the similarly worded Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(f) for guidance is appropriate.  See Turner v. Duke Univ., 325 N.C. \n152, 164, 381 S.E.2d 706, 713 (1989) (“The North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure are, for \nthe most part, verbatim recitations of the federal rules. . . .  Decisions under the federal rules \nare thus pertinent for guidance and enlightenment in developing the philosophy of the North \nCarolina rules.” (citation omitted)); see also Mecklenburg Cty. Buckley LLP v. Series 1 of \nOxford Ins. Co. NC LLC, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 36, at *9 n.2 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 23, 2020). \n \n \n13. Thus, a defense that is “conclusory,” “contextually [in]comprehensible,” “not \nwell-grounded in fact,” “speculative,” or otherwise devoid of any factual support may \nbe stricken pursuant to Rule 12(f),  since such a defense will ordinarily  fail to give a \nparty sufficient notice of the nature of the defense as required by Rule 8.  See Nat’l \nFin. Partners, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 50, at *18 –23; Staton, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n105599, at *7–9. \n14. In addition, the North Carolina Court of Appeals has sometimes evaluated \nwhether a defense could have a “possible bearing upon the litigation” when reviewing \na Rule 12(f) ruling.  See, e.g. Carpenter v. Carpenter, 189 N.C. App. 755, 761, 659 \nS.E.2d 762, 767 (2008) (hold ing that the trial court erred in striking a defendant’s \nanswer because the pleading contained, among other things, several defenses that \ncould have “a possible bearing on the litigation”) ; Daily, 95 N.C. App. at 749, 384 \nS.E.2d at 56 (upholding the granting of a Rule 12(f) motion to strike a defense when \nthe defense had “no possible bearing upon the litigation,” in addition to the defense \nbeing legally insufficient ( quoting Shellhorn v. Brad Ragan, Inc. , 38 N.C. App. 310, \n316, 248 S.E.2d 103, 108 (1978)); see also Reese v. Brooklyn Vill., LLC, 209 N.C. App. \n636, 653, 707 S.E.2d 249, 260 (2011) (incorporating this standard into its review of a \ntrial court’s denial of a motion to strike two affirmative defenses).\n4 \n \n4  Notwithstanding these Court  of Appeals decisions, it appears that the  “possible bearing \nupon the litigation” standard may be more appropriate for evaluating whether “matter” (i.e., \nnon-defenses) are “redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous” pursuant \nto Rule 12(f), rather than evaluating the sufficiency of a defense.   Indeed, in Shellhorn, the \nCourt of Appeals  first adopted the “possible bearing upon the litigation” standard in \nreviewing a trial court’s order on a “ motion to strike certain allegations from the complaint \non the grounds they were redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, and impertinent.”  38 N.C. App. \nat 313, 316, 248 S.E.2d at 106, 108 (emphasis added).   In the Court’s view, applying this \n \n \n15. With these principles in mind, the Court now turns to its analysis of the \nMotions to Strike. \nIII. ANALYSIS \n16. Before evaluating whether any of  the defenses subject to the Motions to \nStrike should be stricken from the Smiths’ Answers pursuant to Rule 12(f), the Court \nwill address two threshold matters. \n17. First, the Court notes that there is some inconsistency amongst the Motions \nto Strike, the Memorandums in Support of the Motions, and the Smiths’ Answers.  All \nof the Motions request  that the Court strike the “First, Second, Third, Sixth, \nTwentieth, Thirty-Second and Thirty-Third Affirmative Defenses” from the Smiths’ \nAnswers.  In turn, all of Plaintiffs’ Memorandums in Support of the Motions identify \nthese defenses as follows:  \na. Smith Defendants’ First Affirmat ive Defense, “Statute of \nLimitations”; \nb. Smith Defendants’ Second Affirmative Defense, “Failure to State \na Claim”; \nc. Smith Defendants’ Third Affirmative Defense, “Ded [sic] Man’s \nStatute”; \nd. Smith Defendants’ Sixth Affirmative Defense, “Laches”; \ne. Smith Defendants ’ Twentieth Affirmative Defense “No \nConstructive Trust”; \nf. Smith Defendants’ Thirty -Second Affirmative Defense – \n“Nonexistance [sic]”; and \ng. Smith Defendants’ Thirty -Third Affirmative Defense –  “No \nDomination or control at the time of alledged [sic] misconduct.” \n \n \nstandard to defenses seems inconsistent with Rule 8, and Rule 11 for that matter, since this \nstandard opens the door for litigants to plead any bare-bones conclusory defense that \n“possibly” may have some bearing on the litigation later on.  \n \n \n(Merrell Mem. in Supp. 3, 6–8; Strack Mem. in Supp. 3, 6–8; Cochrane Mem. in Supp. \n3, 6–8.)  However, these defenses, as identified and numbered by Plaintiffs in their \nMotions to Strike and supporting briefing, do not  all match up with the defenses \nasserted in the Smiths’ Answers.  The Cochrane Answer, for example, does not plead \na thirty-third defense nor does it plead a defense titled “Nonexistence.”  (See generally \nCochrane Answer.) \n18. Notwithstanding this inconsistency, it is the Court’s understanding, based \non the briefs in support of and in opposition to the Motions to Strike,  as well as the \narguments made by counsel for the parties during  the October 5 Hearing, that the \nfollowing sev en defenses, to the extent they are asserted by the Smiths in the \napplicable Answers, are subject to the Motions to Strike: (1) “Statute of Limitations”; \n(2) “Failure to State a Claim”;  (3) “ Dead Man’s Statute —Rule 601 of the North \nCarolina Rules of Evidence”; (4) “Laches”; (5) “No Constructive Trust and Adequate \nremedy at law” ; (6) “Nonexistence”; and (7) “No domination and control at time of \nalleged misconduct.”  (See Merrell Answer 1, 9, 12, 52, 67, 72; Strack Answer 1, 9, 12, \n87, 102, 107; Cochrane Answer 1, 10, 13, 59, 72, 76.) \n19. Next, Counsel for the Smith s took the position at the October 5 H earing \nthat, pursuant to Rule 8,  distinguishing an affirmative defense from  a non-\naffirmative defense is relevant to the Court’s determination of the Motions to \n \n \nStrike.5  The Court will thus examine whether the  Rule 12(f) standard of review \nshould differ based on this distinction.   \n20. Plaintiffs, in the Motions to Strike and Memor andums in Support of the \nMotions, characterize all of the defenses subject to the Motions as “affirmative” \ndefenses.  “An affirmative defense is a defense that introduces a new matter in an \nattempt to avoid a claim, regardless of whether the allegations of the claim are \ntrue.”  Williams v. Pee Dee Elec. Membership Corp. , 130 N.C. App. 298, 301– 02, 502 \nS.E.2d 645, 647 –48 (1998) (citation omitted).   Rule 8(c) identifies  several \n“affirmative” defenses, including the statute of limitations and lac hes, two of the  \ndefenses subject to the Motions to Strike.   See N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 8(c).  As to the \nother five defenses subject to the Motions, the parties have not identified, and the \nCourt is not aware of,  any authorities treating these defenses  as “affirmative” \ndefenses, so the Court will not treat them  as “affirmative” in nature for purposes of \nthis Order and Opinion, notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ assertion to the contrary.  \n21. In any event, it does not appear that the distinction between an affirmative \ndefense and a non-affirmative defense is particularly relevant here.  It is true that, \nat first glance, Rule 8  appears to  set forth  different pleading requirements  for \ndefenses depending on whether they  are affirmative or not.  Indeed, Rule 8(b) only \nstates that “[a] party shall state in short and plain terms his defenses to each claim \nasserted[,]” while Rule 8(c) states  that “a pleadi ng shall contain a short and plain \n \n5  The Smiths’ Briefs in Opposition to the Motions to Strike also allude this issue.  (See, e.g., \nMerrell Br. in Opp’n 15 (emphasizing that the Smiths’ Failure to State a Claim defense is not \nan “affirmative” defense).)  \n \n \nstatement of any matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense sufficiently \nparticular to give the court and the parties notice of the transactions, occurrences, or \nseries of transactions or occurrences, intende d to be proved.”   N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule \n8(b)–(c) (emphasis added).  This variation between subsections (b) and (c) seemingly \nsuggests that the pleading requirements for non -affirmative defenses may be  even \nmore liberal (i.e., less demanding) than those for true affirmative defenses. \n22. The Court, however, has not located any controlling North Carolina law \nestablishing that this is the proper reading of Rule 8. 6  And more importantly , \nregardless of the textual difference between subsections (b) and (c), it does not appear \nthat North Carolina courts have applied a different Rule 12(f) standard of review \nbased on whether a particular defense is governed by subsection (b) or (c).   See, e.g., \nNat’l Fin. Part ners, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 50, at *15– 24 (applying Rule 12(f) and \nstriking several “affirmative” defenses, without discussing any  distinctions between \nRule 8(b) and Rule 8(c) or affirmative defenses and non -affirmative defenses, even \nthough some of the stricken defenses, like “another action pending ,” may not have \nbeen true affirmative defenses).  In contrast, our courts have time after time stressed \nthe liberal notice pleading standard embodied by Rule 8 as a whole.  See, e.g., Smith, \n84 N.C. App. at 123, 351 S.E.2d at 776; see also Vernon, 291 N.C. at 653, 231 S.E.2d \nat 595 (discussing “Rule 8(b) ” and stating that “[t]he requirements for pleading a \ndefense are no more stringent than the requirements for pleading a claim for relief ” \n(citation omitted)). \n \n6  The official comments to Rule 8(b) and Rule 8(c) also do not support such a reading. \n \n \n23. Accordingly, the Court here will not apply a different Rule 12(f) standard of \nreview based on whe ther some of the  defenses subject to the Motions to Strike are \ntrue affirmative defenses or not.  Instead, the Court’s analysis of the Motions to Strike \nwill be guided by the Rule 12(f) standards adopted by North Carolina courts in \nreviewing motions to strike defenses, as set forth above in Section II. \n24. The Court now turns to the defenses subject to the Motions to Strike. \n   A. Statute of Limitations  \n25. The Smiths’ Answers first assert that Plaintiffs’ claims against the Smiths \n“are barred in whole or in pa rt by the relevant statute of  limitations.”  (Merrell \nAnswer 5; Strack Answer 5; Cochrane Answer 7.) \n26. At bottom, Plaintiffs argue that the Smiths’ statute of limitations  defense \nfails to satisfy Rule 8’s notice pleading standard.   They contend that  the Smiths did \nnot provide them with sufficient information to understand the essence of the defense \nbecause the Smiths did not  “identify the applicable statute of limitation, fail[ed] to \nidentify when the limitation period began, or when it may have ended, and fail[ed] to \nprovide sufficient facts as to when and how  . . . Plaintiffs could have been placed on \nnotice of their claims.”  (Merrell Mem. in Supp. 5.) \n27. The Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs’ arguments.   To begin with , the \nCourt notes that North Carolina law does not appear to require litigants to plead the \nstatute of limitations defense by referencing a specific statute, contrary to Plaintiffs’ \napparent belief.  (Merrell Mem. in Supp. 5. )  In fact, on one occasion , th e North \nCarolina Court of Appeals held that a defendant’s  “failure to plead” the applicable \n \n \nstatute of limitations “by precise number and subsection [was] not fatal under \nN.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule 8(c).”   Bonestell v. N. Topsail Shores Condos., Inc. , 103 N.C. \nApp. 219, 223, 405 S.E.2d 222, 225 (1991).  As such, even though the Smiths’ Answers \nfail to  cite to a specific statute of limitations , this failure alone does not warrant \nstriking their defense.  \n28. More importantly, t he Smiths’ defense here is comprised of at least  eight \npages, in which they plead extensive factual support for their assertions that  \nPlaintiffs’ respective ownership interests in CB&B were transferred to Mr. Siskey \nmore than eleven years prior to the filing of the CBB Actions and that Plaintiffs knew \nor reasonably should have discovered the facts underlying their claims more than ten \nyears prior to the filing of the CBB Actions.   (E.g., Merrell Answer 1–9.)  Therefore, \nalthough the Smiths’ Answers do not expressly state that a specific limitations period \nhas been exceeded (e.g., a three-year period), the Smiths’ detailed pleading does put \nPlaintiffs on notice that the Smiths intend to show  that all or some of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are barred by the “longest conceivably applicable non-real property statute of \nlimitations in North Carolina” (ten years) and that this limitations period cannot be \ntolled by the discovery rule to the extent that this rule applies to any of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  (Merrell Br. in Opp’n. 4). \n29. Thus, the Smiths’ statute of limitations defense meets Rule 8’s liberal notice \npleading standard, and the Court, in its discretion, declines to strike this defense. \n \n \n \n \nB. Failure to State a Claim  \n30. The Smiths’ Answers also assert that Plaintiffs’ Complaints “fail[] to state \na claim upon which relief can be  granted against” the Smiths .  (Merrell Answer 9; \nStrack Answer 9; Cochrane Answer 10.) \n31. Plaintiffs take issue with the  fact that the  Smiths, in part,  assert this \ndefense on behalf of CB&B and non-party Home Run Holdings, LLC (“HRH”).7  (See \ne.g., Merrell Answer 9 (“[T]he Second Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted against Defendants, HRH, or [CB&B]”).)”  Plaintiffs argue \nthat this tactic by the Smiths renders their failure to state a claim defense \n“contextually [in]comprehensible” as well as  “redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, \n[and] impertinent.”  (Merrell Mem. in Supp. 6.)  The Court disagrees. \n32. First, the Court notes  that Rule 12(h) expressly permits a party to assert \nthe “defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted  . . . in any \npleading permitted or ordered under Rule 7(a) .”  N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule 12( h)(2) \n(emphasis added).  An answer to a complaint is one of the pleadings permitted under \nRule 7(a).  See id. § 1A -1, Rule 7(a).   Therefore, the Smiths’ failure to state a claim \ndefense, as pleaded in their Answers, is subject to Rule 8’s notice pleading standard, \nand the Court will accordingly evaluate whether this defense gives  Plaintiffs \nsufficient notice of its nature. \n \n7  At the time that the Smiths filed the Answers, HRH was a named Defendant in the CBB \nActions, but thereafter, Plaintiffs v oluntarily dismissed without prejudice their claims \nagainst HRH.  (ECF Nos. 40 [19 CVS 21650]; 56 [19 CVS 22027]; 40 [19 CVS 23665].)   \n \n \n33. Here, when the Smiths’ failure to state a claim defense is read together with \nPlaintiffs’ Complaints, this defense is contextually comprehensib le and gives \nPlaintiffs adequate notice of the nature of the defense.   As the Smiths point out in \ntheir Briefs in Opposition to the Motions to Strike, Plaintiffs’ Complaints allege that \nCB&B, HRH, and Mr. Smith are or acted as alter egos of each other and also ask the \nCourt to enter judgments against Mr. Smith  as the alter ego of CB&B and to hold \nhim individually responsible for any judgment s against CB&B.  (See Merrell Br. in \nOpp’n 14–15 (citing Plaintiffs’ Complaints).)  Therefore, if the Court were to make a \nfuture determination that CB&B, HRH, and Mr. Smith were each other’s al ter egos \nduring the time periods relevant to the CBB Actions, then Mr. Smith might, in theory, \nbe entitled to assert whatever defenses are available to CB&B/HRH.   See Window \nWorld of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc. , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 11, at *19 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 11, 2019) (“Indeed, under the instrumentality rule, the alter ego \nand the shareholder [are] treated  as one and the same person.” (internal quotation \nmarks and citations omitted)).   \n34. It was therefore appropriate for the Smiths to plead that Plaintiffs’ \nComplaints fail to state a claim not only against the Smiths, but also against CB&B \nand HRH.  And based on Plaintiffs’ own alter ego allegations against Mr. Smith and \nCB&B/HRH, Plaintiffs should be on notice as to what the Smiths intend to show by \npursuing this defense on behalf of the two entities.  Moreover, the Smiths explain, in \nmore than two pages of their  Answers, why each of Plaintiffs’  claims against the \nSmiths fails to state  a claim, and they cite  to Aldridge v. Metro. Life Ins. Co. , 2019 \n \n \nNCBC LEXIS 116 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 31, 2019), where this Court dismissed claims \nsimilar to the ones raised by Plaintiffs here.  (E.g., Merrell Answer 9–11.)   \n35. In sum, the Smiths’ failure to state a claim defense satisfies Rule 8’s liberal \npleading requirements, and the Court does not find this defense to be redundant, \nirrelevant, immaterial, or impertinent.  For these reasons, the Court, in its discretion, \ndeclines to strike this defense. \nC. The Dead Man’s Statute  \n36. The Smiths’ Answers assert—pursuant to North Carolina Rule of Evidence \n601(c), N.C.G.S. § 8C-1, Rule 601(c)—a “standing objection” to Plaintiffs referencing \nor introducing any oral communications with Mr. Siskey.  (Merrell Answer 12; Strack \nAnswer 12; Cochrane Answer 13–14.)   \n37. Plaintiffs argue that the Court should strike this “defense” from the Smiths’ \nAnswers on the basis that it is not the type of “defense” contemplated or governed by \nNorth Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 8.   (Merrell Mem. in Supp. 6.)   The Smiths, \nmeanwhile, counter that “under North Carolina law, [they] are entitled to object to \nthe introduction of [certain] communications, and there is no reason that such an \nobjection cannot appear in an answer.”  (Merrell Br. in Opp’n 16.)   \n38. Rule 601(c), commonly known as the Dead Man’s Statute, is an evidentiary \nrule governed by our Rules of Evidence that is designed to exclude evidence of certain \ntypes of statements made by deceased persons.  See Crosland v. Patrick, No. COA19-\n713, 2020 N.C. App. LEXIS 663, at *4 –7 (Ct. App. Sep. 15, 2020) .  The Dead Man’s \nStatute could very well end up being relevant later on in this litigation, perhaps in \n \n \nthe summary judgment or trial setting.  However, the Court finds it unusual, and \nindeed impertinent, that the Smiths have pleaded this evidentiary “objection” as a \ndefense in their Answers to Plaintiffs’ Complaints, since the Court is certainly not \nconsidering the admissibility of evidence at this stage of the litigation. \n39. As a result, the Court, in its discretion, will strike the Smiths’ Dead Man’s \nStatute “defense” from the Answers without prejudice to them raising this \nevidentiary objection at an appropriate time. \nD. Laches  \n40. The Smiths’ Answers further assert that “Plaintiffs ’ claims are barred in \nwhole or in part by [l]aches.”  (Merrell Answer 5 3; Strack Answer 87; Cochrane \nAnswer 59.) \n41. As to this defense, Plaintiffs contend that the Smiths did not provide \nPlaintiffs with sufficient  information for them to under stand the natur e of the \ndefense.  (Mem. in Supp. 7.)   Plaintiffs also argue that the Smiths’ Answers fail to \nallege how they were prejudiced by any delay in bringing suit  (a requirement of the \nlaches defense).  (Mem. in Supp. 7.)  That is not so. \n42. Within four pages of the  Answers, the Smiths allege that Plaintiffs could \nhave discovered their claims between late 2007 or early 2008, when they transferred \ntheir ownership interests in CB&B to Mr. Siskey, and that in the years following this \ntime period, a number of transactions involving CB&B have occurred and cannot be \nundone, including releases that the Smiths received from CB&B shareholders as part \nof the 2010 sale of the company.  (E.g., Merrell Answer 53–57.)  The Smiths’ extensive \n \n \npleading in support of their laches defen se sufficiently puts Plaintiffs on notice that \nthe Smiths intend to argue that Plaintiffs ’ delay in  filing the CBB Actions has \nresulted in prejudice to the Smiths. \n43. The Smiths’ laches defense thus satisfies Rule 8’s liberal pleading \nrequirements.  As a result, the Court, in its discretion, declines to strike this defense. \nE. No Constructive Trust and Adequate remedy at law, Nonexistence, \nand No Domination and Control at time of the alleged misconduct  \n \n44. Finally, the Smiths’ Answers plead the following defenses:   \na. “No Constructive Trust and Adequate remedy at law .”  (Merrell \nAnswer 67; Strack Answer 102; Cochrane Answer 72.) \nb. “Nonexistence.”  (Merrell Answer 72; Strack Answer 107.) \nc. “No domination and control at time of alleged \nmisconduct.”  (Merrell Answer 72; Strack Answer 107; Cochrane \nAnswer 77.) \n \nThe crux of these three defenses is that HRH did not exist at the time of the alleged \nfraudulent scheme implicating the Smiths. \n45.  Plaintiffs believe that these defenses are “redundant, irrelevant, \nimmaterial, [and] impertinent” because they “confusingly” seek to assert defenses \nbelonging to HRH.  (Merrell Mem. in Supp. 7–8.)  As explained above in the Court’s \nanalysis of the Smiths’ failure to state a claim defense, because Plaintiffs have alleged \nthat CB&B, HRH, and Mr. Smith are or acted as alter egos of each other during the \ntime periods relevant to the CBB Actions, it makes sense that Mr. Smith is seeking  \nto avail himself of whatever defenses are available to CB&B, or as r elevant here, \nHRH.  And as noted by the Smiths in their Briefs in Opposition to the Motions to \n \n \nStrike, pleading that HRH did not exist during the pertinent time periods is relevant \nto the alter ego issue raised by Plaintiffs’ Complaints. (Merrell Br. in Opp’n 20.)   \n46. Accordingly, these three defenses related to HRH meet Rule 8’s notice \npleading standard, and the Court cannot conclude at this stage of the litigation that \nthese defenses are redundant, irrelevant, immaterial, or impertinent. \n47. Thus, the Court, in its discretion, declines to strike these defenses. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n48. For the foregoing reasons, the Court, in its discretion, GRANTS in part and \nDENIES in part the Motions to Strike as follows.  The “Dead Man’s Statute—Rule \n601 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence” defense shall be STRICKEN  from the \nSmiths’ Answers without prejudice .  Furthermore, the Court DECLINES  to strike \nthe “Statute of Limitations”; “Failure to State a Claim”; “Laches”;  “No Constructive \nTrust and Adequate remedy at law”; “Nonexistence”; and “No domination and control \nat time of alleged misconduct” defenses from the Smiths’ Answers. \nSO ORDERED, this the 22nd day of October, 2020. \n \n \n/s/ Michael L. Robinson \n Michael L. Robinson \n Special Superior Court Judge \n    for Complex Business Cases \n "
