After hearing from the parties on October 11, \n2011, and having considered the matters of record and contentions of counsel, the \nCourt, GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS in part, and DENIES DENIES DENIES DENIES in part, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n {2} Plaintiff first filed this action on January 31, 2011. (Defs.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Dismiss 2.) The case was subsequently removed by Defendants to federal court \non February 2, 2011, to have the federal court determine what relief, if any, might \nbe available to Plaintiff  under COBRA, 29 U.S.C. § 1161.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss 2.)  After removal, the action was transferred to the United States \nBankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina and voluntarily \ndismissed by Plaintiff on March 1, 2011.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 2–3.)  The \npresent action was filed on March 3, 2011, designated to the Business Court on \nApril 6, 2011, and assigned to this Court on March 7, 2011.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss 3; Assignment Order 1.) \n {3} Defendants’ filed their Motion to Dismiss on June 10, 2011, Plaintiff \nfiled his Response to Defendants’ Motion on June 30, 2011, and Defendants replied \nto Plaintiff’s Response on July 13, 2011. (Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 4; Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ \nMot. Dismiss 24; Defs.’ Reply Supp. Mot. Dismiss 12.) \n {4} This Court heard Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on October 11, 2011. \nII. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS  \n {5} While ordinarily the Court does not make findings of fact in connection \nwith motions to dismiss, as such motions do “not present the merits, but only \n[determine] whether the merits may be reached,” Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Investors \nGroup, Inc. , 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986), for purposes of this \nOrder and Opinion’s 12(b)(6) analysis, the Court recites those facts from the \npleadings that are relevant to the Court’s legal determinations. \n {6} Plaintiff is a resident of North Carolina and was employed by FIC as \nPresident and Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) of its Charlotte based operations.  \nPlaintiff is also the owner of Rascal Holdings, LLC, (“Rascal”) which owned Fitness \nManagement Group, Inc. (“FMG”).  (Am. Compl. ¶ 1.)   \n{7} In late December 2009, FMG entered into Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and \nsold its assets to Defendant FIC.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 3–4.)  Expecting \nthat the Bankruptcy Court would approve the sale, Plaintiff and FIC entered into \nthe Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (“Employment Agreement”).  \n(Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 4.)  The Employment Agreement named Plaintiff \nPresident and COO of FIC, served as the employment and operating agreement for \nFIC, detailed Plaintiff’s employment benefits and responsibilities, and imposed \nrestrictions on Defendants FC and Sampson Trust’s ability to incur debt on behalf \nof the company or transfer equity.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 4–5.)  On \nSeptember 23, 2010, Plaintiff was suspended with pay from his position as \nPresident and COO of FIC, and on December 8, 2010, Defendant FIC officially \nterminated Plaintiff’s employment.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 5.) \n {8} Before being terminated, Plaintiff personally filed for Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy on August 11, 2010.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 6.)  On February \n11, 2011, Plaintiff listed his Employment Agreement as an executory contract on \nthe Schedule G of his Bankruptcy petition.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 6.)  The \nBankruptcy Trustee did not assume the Employment Agreement on or before April \n12, 2011.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. A.) \n{9} Plaintiff’s claims arise from alleged breaches of the Employment \nAgreement, the Membership Unit Transfer Agreement (“Transfer Agreement”), and \nthe Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement (“Asset Purchase \nAgreement”).  The Employment Agreement was entered into by Plaintiff and FIC on \nDecember 29, 2009, and subsequently ratified by FIC affiliates Defendants FC, \nSampson Trust, FCH, Fahey, and BF.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 28; Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss 4.)  The Transfer Agreement was entered into by Plaintiff and FCH and \ntransferred Plaintiff’s real property interests to FCH.  The Asset Purchase \nAgreement was entered into by FMG and FIC and dealt with the sale of FMG’s \nassets to FIC while FMG was in bankruptcy.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 32.) \n{10} Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the Employment Agreement \nby: terminating his employment prior to the end of the agreement; entering into \nother agreements prohibited by the Employment Agreement without his consent; \nfailing to provide financing as required under the Employment Agreement; hiring \nanother President; entering into a financing agreement with Defendant Allstate; \nviolating the compensation benefits owed to Plaintiff under the Employment \nAgreement; and eliminating Plaintiff’s opportunity to earn equity in the company. \n(Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 5–6.)  Plaintiff has asserted claims for: (1) breach of \ncontract, (2) tortious interference with contract, (3) intentional interference with \nbusiness relations, (4) unfair and deceptive trade practices (“UDTP”), (5) usurpation \nof corporate opportunities, (6) violations of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act \n(“Wage Act”), (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), (8) breach of \nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (“breach of good faith”), (9) fraud,  \nand (10) punitive damages.  (Am. Compl. pg. 23, 27–31, 33–37.) \n {11} Plaintiff’s breach of contract and tortious interference with contract \nclaims arise from Defendants’ actions with regard to the Employment Agreement. \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 128, 140.)  Plaintiff’s claim for intentional interference with \nbusiness relations stems from allegations that particular Defendants induced other \nDefendants to breach the Employment Agreement, Transfer Agreement, and Asset \nPurchase Agreement.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 146–47.)  Plaintiff’s claim for UDTP alleges \nthat Defendants “conspired to prevent the performance of [Plaintiff’s] Employment \nAgreement.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 156.)  Plaintiff’s claim for usurpation of corporate \nopportunities stems from allegations that Defendant Simpson allowed or caused \nFIC to breach the Employment Agreement with Plaintiff.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 164.)  \nPlaintiff’s claim for violation of the Wage Act is for both earned and unearned \nsalary payments that would have been payable to him under the Employment \nAgreement if he had not been terminated.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 175.)  Plaintiff’s claim for \nIIED and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are based on \nallegations that Defendants coerced Plaintiff into signing away his rights under the \nEmployment Agreement.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 180, 190.)  Lastly, Plaintiff’s claim for \nfraud is based on Defendants’ alleged misrepresentations to Plaintiff that \nDefendants would perform their obligations under the Employment Agreement and \nAsset Purchase Agreement.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 194.) \nIII. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n{12} The question for the court on a motion to dismiss is “whether, as a \nmatter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as true, are sufficient to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal theory, whether \nproperly labeled or not.”  Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. 669, 670, 355 \nS.E.2d 838, 840 (1987) (citing Stanback v. Stanback , 297 N.C. 181, 254 S.E.2d 611 \n(1979)).  “[T]he pleadings, when taken as true, [must be] legally sufficient to satisfy \nthe elements of at least some . . . recognized claim.”  Arroyo v. Scottie’s Prof’l \nWindow Cleaning, Inc. , 120 N.C. App. 154, 158, 461 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1995) (citing \nHarris , 85 N.C. App. 669, 355 S.E.2d 838).   \n{13} “‘Dismissal of a complaint is proper under the provisions of Rule \n12(b)(6) . . . when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the \nplaintiff’s claim.’”  Carlisle v. Keith , 169 N.C. App. 674, 681, 614 S.E.2d 542, 547 \n(2005) (quoting Hooper v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. , 84 N.C. App. 549, 551, 353 S.E.2d \n248, 250 (1987)).   \n{14} When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted, “the well-pleaded material allegations of the complaint \nare taken as admitted; but conclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact are \nnot admitted.”  Pinewood Homes, Inc. v. Harris , 184 N.C. App. 597, 613, 646 S.E.2d \n826, 837 (2007) (quoting Sutton v. Duke , 277 N.C. 94, 98, 176 S.E.2d 161, 163 \n(1970)). \nIV. \nANALYSIS \nA.  \nSTANDING \n{15} Defendants argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring his claims \nbecause they arise from contracts that were entered into by the parties prior to \nPlaintiff’s personal bankruptcy petition and thus the claims and contracts are \nassets that belong to the bankruptcy estate to be enforced by the bankruptcy \ntrustee.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 6–7.)   \n{16} “Standing concerns the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction and is \ntherefore properly challenged by a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.”  Fuller v. \nEasley , 145 N.C. App. 391, 395, 553 S.E.2d 43, 46 (2001) (citing Energy Investors \nFund, L.P. v. Metric Constructors, Inc. , 351 N.C. 331, 525 S.E.2d 441 (2000)).  When \n“‘considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it is \nappropriate for the court to consider and weigh matters outside of the pleadings.’”  \nTubiolo v. Abundant Life Church, Inc. , 167 N.C. App. 324, 327, 605 S.E.2d 161, 163 \n(2004) (quoting Tart v. Walker , 38 N.C. App. 500, 502, 248 S.E.2d 736, 737 (1978)). \n1. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n{17} A bankruptcy estate is created at the time that a bankruptcy action is \nfiled and is composed of “all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as \nof the commencement of the case.”  11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1) (2006).  The legal interests \nheld by the estate trustee include “all causes of action held by the debtor at the time \nthe bankruptcy petition is filed,” and the trustee succeeds to those causes of action, \nleaving the debtor without standing to bring an action.  Jones v. Harrell , 858 F.2d \n667, 669 (11th Cir. 1988) (citing Miller v. Shallowford Community Hosp. Inc. , 767 \nF.2d 1556, 1559 (11th Cir. 1985)).  As representative of the bankrupt estate, the \ntrustee “has the capacity to sue or be sued.”  Detrick v. Panalpina, Inc. , 108 F.3d \n529, 535 (4th Cir. 1997) (quoting In re Richman , 104 F.3d 654 (4th Cir. 1997)); see \nalso 11 U.S.C. § 323(b) (2006).  In this capacity, “the decision whether to pursue a \nclaim or not is vested within the trustee’s discretion.”  Id . \n{18} A cause of action is generally held by the debtor if it has accrued before \nthe debtor files his bankruptcy petition.  For most tort claims, a “cause of action \naccrues when the wrong is complete, even though the injured party did not then \nknow the wrong had been committed.”  Housecalls Home Health Care, Inc., v. State , \n200 N.C. App. 66, 71, 682 S.E.2d 741, 744 (2009).  However, for the torts of IIED \nand fraud, accrual “occurs at the time the fraud [or injury] is discovered or should \nhave been discovered with the exercise of reasonable diligence.”  S.B. Simmons \nLandscaping & Excavating, Inc. v. Boggs , 192 N.C. App. 155, 162, 665 S.E.2d 147, \n151 (2008); accord Russell v. Adams , 125 N.C. App. 637, 641, 482 S.E.2d 30, 33 \n(1997) (stating that an action for emotional distress does “not accrue until the \nplaintiff ‘becomes aware or should reasonably have become aware of the existence of \nthe injury.’” (quoting Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co. , 313 N.C. 488, \n493, 329 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1985))).   \n{19} In addition to claims that accrue prior to the debtor filing for \nbankruptcy, the bankruptcy estate also includes “post-petition assets that are \n‘sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past.’”  Plumlee v. Plumlee , 236 B.R. 606, \n611 (E.D. Va. 1999).  Courts have held that post-petition assets can include legal \nclaims connected to a debtor’s termination from employment when the claims were \n“‘sufficiently rooted’ in [the debtor’s] pre-petition activities.” Id . at 612. \n2. \nEXECUTORY CONTRACTS \n{20} The Bankruptcy Code also directs how executory contracts are to be \nhandled in bankruptcy.  An executory contract is “‘a contract under which the \nobligation of both the    bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far \nunperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a \nmaterial breach excusing performance of the other.’”  Meiburger v. Endeka Enters., \nLLC. , 383 B.R. 616, 619 (E.D. Va. 2007) (quoting Vern Countryman, Executory \nContracts in Bankruptcy: Part I,  57 Minn. L. Rev. 439, 460 (1973)); see generally  \nGloria Mfg. Corp. v. Int’l Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union , 734 F.2d 1020, 1022 (4th \nCir. 1984) (adopting Professor Countryman’s definition of executory contract).    \n{21} After the bankruptcy petition is filed, “the trustee, . . . may assume or \nreject any executory contract . . . of the debtor.”  11 U.S.C. § 365(a) (2006).   In \nChapter 7 bankruptcy, “if the trustee does not assume or reject an executory \ncontract . . . within 60 days after the order for relief, . . . then such contract or lease \nis deemed rejected.”  Id . at § 365(d)(1).   However, “‘rejection does not change the \nsubstantive rights of the parties to the contract, but merely means the bankruptcy \nestate itself will not become a party to it.’”  In re Alongi , 272 B.R. 148, 153 (Bankr. \nD. Md. 2001) (quoting Michael T. Andrew, Executory Contracts in Bankruptcy: \nUnderstanding Rejection , 59 U. Colo. L. Rev. 845, 848–49 (1988)).   \n3. \nANALYSIS OF STANDING \n{22} In order to determine if Plaintiff’s claims or contracts belong to the \nestate, the Court must determine: (1) whether the contracts are executory contracts \nassumed by the bankruptcy trustee, and (2) when Plaintiff’s causes of action \naccrued.   \n{23} The Employment Agreement in this case is a six-year employment \ncontract that required Plaintiff to perform services for Defendants, and in return, \ninter alia , required Defendants pay Plaintiff for the services rendered.  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 28–43.)  Thus the Agreement was, at the time Plaintiff filed for bankruptcy, a \ncontract that placed unperformed obligations on both parties that if unmet, would \nresult in a material breach.  As defined in Meiburger , this is an executory contract.  \nMeiburger , 383 B.R. 616, 619 (2007).  As to the Transfer Agreement and the Asset \nPurchase Agreement, it is unclear from the record whether, at the time Plaintiff \nfiled for bankruptcy, there were any continuing obligations owed by any of the \nparties under those contracts.  Accordingly, the Court can not find them to be \nexecutory.   \n {24} Turning next to whether the Employment Agreement was assumed by \nthe bankruptcy trustee, the Court finds that the Employment Agreement was listed \non the Schedule G that Plaintiff filed with the bankruptcy court, and that there is \nno evidence before the court that the trustee ever assumed the contract.  (Pl.’s Resp. \nDefs.’ Mot. Dismiss Ex. A. 7.)    Because the bankruptcy trustee did not assume the \nEmployment Agreement within sixty (60) days of Plaintiff filing for bankruptcy, \npursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 365(d)(1), the Employment Agreement is deemed rejected, \nand thus, not the property of the bankruptcy estate. \n{25} As to when Plaintiff’s causes of action accrued, the Court finds that all \nof Plaintiff’s claims except fraud arise from alleged actions taken by the Defendants \non or after September 1, 2010.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 71, 131(b), 139–40, 145–47, 156, \n164, 169, 190, 194–95.)  Accordingly, these actions accrued after Plaintiff had filed \nfor bankruptcy on August 11, 2010.  As for Plaintiff’s claim of fraud, Plaintiff alleges \nthat Defendants’ misrepresentations began around the time the above-referenced \nagreements were signed in 2009.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 194–95.)  However, claims for \nfraud do not accrue until the fraud is discovered, or could have reasonably been \ndiscovered, which in this case was not until after Plaintiff was suspended from his \nemployment on September 23, 2010.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim for fraud did not \naccrue until after September 23, 2010.   \n{26} Despite the fact that none of Plaintiff’s claims accrued prior to the \nfiling of his bankruptcy action, a bankruptcy estate can include “post-petition assets \nthat are ‘sufficiently rooted in the pre-bankruptcy past.’” Plumlee , 236 B.R. at 611.  \nAs previously noted, all of Plaintiff’s claims except fraud arise from alleged actions \ntaken by the Defendants from September 1, 2010 through the present.  (Am. Compl. \n¶¶ 71, 131(b), 139–40, 145–47, 156, 164, 169, 190, 194–95.)  Accordingly, none of \nthese claims are sufficiently rooted in the estate’s pre-bankruptcy past and thus are \nnot property of the estate.  See Housecalls Home Health Care, Inc. , 200 N.C. App. at \n70, 682 S.E.2d at 744 (discussing generally when claims in contract and tort \naccrue); S.B. Simmons Landscaping & Excavating, Inc. , 192 N.C. App. at 162, 665 \nS.E.2d at 151 (discussing when a claim for fraud accrues); Russell , 125 N.C. App. at \n641, 482 S.E.2d at 33 (discussing when a claim for IIED accrues).   \n{27} As to whether Plaintiff’s claim for fraud is sufficiently rooted in the \npre-bankruptcy past, this Court finds the Plumlee case persuasive.  In Plumlee , \nafter the debtor’s discharge from personal bankruptcy, the debtor brought an action \nagainst his prior employer for alleged violations of a pre-petition merger agreement \nthat was entered into and negotiated by the parties prior to debtor’s filing for \nbankruptcy.  Plumlee , 236 B.R. at 612.  At trial, the debtor claimed that the \ndefendants had misled him about their intention to go through with the pre-petition \nmerger agreement, and that his former employer was liable for breach of contract \nand fraud. The jury agreed.  Id .  The court in Plumlee  found that because the acts \nsupporting the debtor’s claim of fraud had occurred prior to the debtor filing for \nbankruptcy, the award that he recovered was the property of the estate.  Id .  Here, \nthe facts are almost identical.  While no award has been given to Plaintiff, his claim \nis based on acts he alleges occurred at the time he signed the Employment and \nAsset Purchase Agreements, which in this case was prior to the filing of his petition \nfor bankruptcy.  Accordingly, the acts supporting Plaintiff’s claim for fraud are \nsufficiently rooted in Plaintiff’s pre-petition activities and the property of the \nbankruptcy estate.  Therefore, this Court finds that Plaintiff has standing to bring \nall of his claims except the claim of fraud which, because of its connection with \nPlaintiff’s pre-petition activities, is the property of the bankruptcy estate.  For this \nreason, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim of fraud is GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED.   \nB. \nBREACH OF CONTRACT AND BREACH OF THE IMPLIED COVENA NT OF GOOD \nFAITH AND FAIR DEALING \n {28} On a motion to dismiss, the Court must determine “whether, as a \nmatter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as true, are sufficient to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal theory, whether \nproperly labeled or not.”  Harris , 85 N.C. App. at 670, 355 S.E.2d at 840.  “In a \nbreach of contract action, a complainant must show that there is ‘(1) existence of a \nvalid contract, and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.’”  Sanders v. State \nPersonnel Comm’n , 197 N.C. App. 314, 321, 677 S.E.2d 182, 187 (2009) (quoting \nToomer v. Garrett , 155 N.C. App. 462, 481, 574 S.E.2d 76, 91 (2002)).  In addition, \n“‘[i]n every contract there is an implied covenant of good faith    and fair dealing that \nneither party will do anything which injures the right of the other to receive the \nbenefits of the agreement.’”  Governor’s Club Inc. v. Governors Club Ltd. P’ship , 152 \nN.C. App. 240, 251, 567 S.E.2d 781, 789 (2002) (quoting Bicycle Transit Authority v. \nBell , 314 N.C. 219, 228, 333 S.E.2d 299, 305 (1985)). \n{29} Looking to Plaintiff’s Compliant, this Court cannot take into \nconsideration Plaintiff’s ability to prove the claims, only whether they have been \nadequately pled.  Here the Court finds that Plaintiff has alleged the existence of a \nvalid Employment Agreement entered into between Plaintiff and Defendants FIC, \nFC, FCH, Sampson, Sampson Trust, BF, Fahey, and Lumous.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 28.)  \nThe court also finds that Plaintiff has alleged a breach of the Employment \nAgreement, and that “[b]y attempting to force Plaintiff Stec to surrender his \ncontract rights, Defendants breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing.” (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 131 a-g, 190.)   \n{30} Defendants argue that Plaintiff will not be able to prove his claims for \nbreach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nagainst Defendants Lumous and Sampson because their names do not appear on \nthe agreement.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 8–9.)  However, this argument is \nunpersuasive.  Plaintiff has alleged that while Defendants Lumous and Sampson \ndid not initially sign the agreements, they became parties through subsequent \nratification.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 28.)  After reviewing the Amended Complaint in toto  \nthis Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that Defendants entered into, \nand breached, the Employment Agreement in a way that violated the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Accordingly, Plaintiff has sufficiently pled \nhis claim to withstand the Motion to Dismiss.  Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss as to Plaintiff’s claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing is DENIED DENIED DENIED DENIED. \nC. \nTORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT AND INTENTIONAL  INTERFERENCE \nWITH BUSINESS RELATIONS \n {31} The elements of a tortious interference with a contract claim are:  \n(1) a valid contract existed between the plaintiff and a third person, \nconferring upon the plaintiff some contractual right against the third \nperson; (2) the defendant knows of the contract; (3) the defendant \nintentionally induces the third person not to perform the contract; (4) \nthe defendant acts without justification; and (5) the defendant’s \nconduct causes actual pecuniary harm to the plaintiffs.  \nPinewood Homes, Inc. v. Harris , 184 N.C. App. 597, 604, 646 S.E.2d 826, 832 (2007).  \n“An action for tortious interference with [business relations] is based on conduct by \nthe defendants which prevents the plaintiffs from entering into a contract with a \nthird party.”  Walker v. Sloan , 137 N.C. App. 387, 393, 529 S.E.2d 236, 242 (2000) \n(citing Owens v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. , 330 N.C. 666, 680, 412 S.E.2d 636, 644 \n(1992)). \n {32} “A motion to dismiss . . . claim[s] of tortious interference [and \nintentional interference with business relations] is properly granted where the \ncomplaint shows the interference was justified or privileged.”  \nId .

App. at 393, 529 S.E.2d at \n242 (intentional interference with prospective advantage).  “[I]nterference is \n[justified] if the defendants’ motives . . . were . . . ‘reasonably related to the \nprotection of a legitimate business interest’ of the defendant.”  Pinewood Homes, \nInc. , 184 N.C. App. at 605, 646 S.E.2d at 832 (omissions in original) (quoting \nPrivette v. University of North Carolina , 96 N.C. App. 124, 134, 385 S.E.2d 185, 190 \n(1989)).  Because conduct can be privileged, North Carolina’s courts have held that \n“the complaint must admit of no motive for interference other than malice.”  Id. at \n605, 646 S.E.2d at 832–33 (citing Privette , 96 N.C. App. at 134–35, 385 S.E.2d at \n191 (tortious interference with contract)); Cline v. McCullen , 148 N.C. App. 147, \n152, 557 S.E.2d 508, 592 (2001) (interference with business relations).  Malice, in \nthe context of a tortious interference with contract claim, can be sufficiently shown \nby alleging that non-outsiders “act for their own benefit.”  Embree Constr. Group, \nInc. v. Rafcor, Inc. , 330 N.C. 487, 499, 411 S.E.2d 916, 924 (1992).  This isn’t to say \nthat a complaint can generally plead malice.  Pinewood Homes, Inc. , 184 N.C. App. \nat 605, 646 S.E.2d at 833 (“general allegations of malice are insufficient as a matter \nof pleading.” (citing Equipment Co. v. Equipment Co. , 263 N.C. 549, 559, 140 S.E.2d \n3, 11 (1965))).   \n{33} Additionally, non-outsiders “enjoy qualified immunity from liability for \ninducing their corporation or other entity to breach its contract with an employee.”  \nLenzer v. Flaherty , 106 N.C. App. 496, 513, 418 S.E.2d 276, 286 (1992).  Such non-\noutsiders include “[o]fficers, directors, shareholders, and other corporate \nfiduciaries.”  Embree , 330 N.C. at 498, 411 S.E.2d at 924.  Individuals who hold \nthose positions “have ‘a qualified privilege to interfere with contractual relations \nbetween the corporation and a third party.’”  Id . (quoting Wilson v. McClenny , 262 \nN.C. 121, 133, 136 S.E.2d 569, 578 (1964)).  “‘The acts of a corporate officer in \ninducing his company to sever contractual relations with a third party are \npresumed to have been done in the interest of the corporation.’”  Id.  (quoting  Wilson , \n262 N.C. at 133–34, 136 S.E.2d at 578).  However, the privilege is not absolute, and \n“is overcome when the means or the officer’s motives are improper.”  Id. \n {34} Plaintiff’s claim for tortious interference with the Employment \nAgreement is against Defendants Allstate, Sampson Trust, Sampson, Policeno, and \nJ. Michael.  Plaintiff’s claim for intentional interference with business relations is \nagainst all of the above-referenced Defendants except Sampson Trust.  After \nreviewing the pleadings, this Court finds that its determination comes down to \nwhether Plaintiff sufficiently alleged that Defendants acted without justification.    \n {35} Defendants Sampson Trust and Sampson are ratifying parties to the \nEmployment Agreement. (Am. Compl. ¶ 28.)  Sampson Trust is also a member and \nmanager of FIC, the alleged breaching third-party, and Sampson is a trustee of \nSampson Trust.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20, 23–24, 29.)  Under Embree, Defendants \nSampson and Sampson Trust’s status as owners and or managers of the breaching \nparty would make them non-outsiders.  Embree , 330 N.C. at 498, 411 S.E.2d at 924.  \nNon-outsider Defendants Sampson and Sampson Trust are entitled to the \npresumption that they acted in the best interests of the company, but, this \npresumption can be rebutted by a showing that they acted for their own personal \ninterest.  Id . 330 N.C. at 498, 411 S.E.2d at 924.  Here, Plaintiff only alleges that \nDefendants acted to get Plaintiff to give up pay and rights negotiated in the \nEmployment Agreement and to get payment for outstanding legal fees.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 63, 92.)  The Amended Complaint does not allege that Defendants \ninterfered for their own personal gain.  To the contrary, Exhibit E to the Amended \nComplaint suggests that Plaintiff was terminated because of allegations concerning \nviolations of the North Carolina Prepaid Entertainment Contracts Statute, which \nwould suggest that Defendants acted for the benefit of the company.  (Am. Compl. \nEx. E ¶¶ 78–80.)  While the intent of the parties is a question for the jury, Plaintiff \nmust plead more than general allegations of malice.  Embree , 330 N.C. at 499, 411 \nS.E.2d at 925; Pinewood Homes , 184 N.C. App. at 605, 646 S.E.2d at 832.  Other \nthan the above-referenced allegations, Plaintiff only makes general conclusions of \nmalice and fails to allege that Defendants acted for their own personal interest.  As \na result, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead that \nDefendants Sampson Trust and Sampson, acted without justification and \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claims for tortious interference with \ncontract and intentional interference with business relations against Defendants \nSampson and Sampson Trust is GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED, , , , but without prejudice to Plaintiff to \nseek appropriate amendment of his Complaint.  \n{36} As to Defendants Allstate, Policeno, and J. Michael, none of these \nparties were managers or owners of FIC or any entity owning an interest in the \nbreaching party.  While Defendants argue that they should be entitled to non-\noutsider status because Allstate had been involved in the purchase of FIC assets, \nthere is nothing in the record that shows that Allstate was a shareholder or other \nqualifying non-outsider.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 10.)  As such, Defendants \nAllstate, Policeno, and J. Michael are not entitled to the non-outsider presumption.  \nUnder these facts, the Court concludes that Plaintiff’s allegations that Defendants \n“schemed to replace Plaintiff Stec with Allstate Financial Group, J. Michael and \nPoliceno, as operating management and have further schemed to transfer equity to \nAllstate Financial Group,” (Am. Compl. ¶ 64)  are sufficient to allege unjustifiable \naction on the part of Defendants Allstate, Policeno, and J. Michael.  Accordingly, \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss as to these Defendants is DENIED. DENIED. DENIED. DENIED.    \nD. \nUNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES \n {37} “To establish a claim [under the] unfair and deceptive trade practices \n[act (“UDTPA”)],, ,, [plaintiff] must show: (1) that [defendant] committed an unfair or \ndeceptive act or practice, (2) the action in question was in or affecting commerce, \nand (3) the act proximately caused injury to defendant.”  Bob Timberlake Collection, \nInc. v. Edwards , 176 N.C. App. 33, 41, 626 S.E.2d 315, 322 (2006).  “‘It is well \nrecognized . . . that actions for unfair or deceptive trade practices are distinct from \nactions for breach of contract . . . and that a mere breach of contract, even if \nintentional, is not sufficiently unfair or deceptive to sustain an action under \nN.C.G.S. § 75–1.1.’”  Id . at 42, 626 S.E.2d at 323 (quoting Branch Bank & Trust Co. \nv. Thompson , 107 N.C. App. 53, 62, 418 S.E.2d 694, 700 (1992)).  “[F]ailure to allege \na necessary element defeats [a] claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices.”  Id. , \nat 42, 626 S.E.2d at 323 (citation omitted). \n{38} To recover under the UDTPA, substantial aggravating circumstances \nmust be shown to accompany the breach of contract, which is why “[i]t is ‘unlikely \nthat an independent tort could arise in the course of contractual performance, since \nthose sorts of claims are most appropriately addressed by asking simply whether a \nparty adequately fulfilled its contractual obligations.’”  Id . at 42, 626 S.E.2d at 323 \n(quoting Southeastern Shelter Corp. v. BTU, Inc. , 154 N.C. App. 321, 330, 572 \nS.E.2d 200, 206 (2002)). \n {39} In addition, North Carolina’s appellate courts have consistently held \nthat “employer-employee relationships do not fall within the intended scope of \nUDTPA.”  \nMaurer v. SlickEdit, Inc. , 2005 NCBC 1 ¶ 36 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 16, \n2005), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2006%20NCBC%201.htm (citing \nBuie v. Daniel Int’l, 56 N.C. App. 445, 448, 289 S.E.2d 118, 119–20 (1982)).  \nSpecifically, claims based on an employee’s termination relate to a company’s \ninternal corporate affairs rather than being “‘in or affecting commerce’ as set forth \nunder the UDTPA.”  Id . at ¶ 39.  While our courts have created exceptions to this \nrule, these cases are intensely fact specific.  Id . at ¶ 36.  \n {40} Plaintiff’s claim is based on both an alleged breach of contract and an \nemployer/employee relationship.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 156.)  While Plaintiff has \nsummarily recited the elements for a claim under the UDTPA in his Response to \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss, he provides no factual or legal support for his \ncontention that Defendants’ alleged breach of the Employment Agreement was \nattended by aggravating circumstances or should be excused from our appellate \ncourts’ general policy of exempting employer employee relationships from UDTPA \nclaims.  The allegations in the Amended Complaint show that this claim is based on \nDefendants’ alleged breach of Plaintiff’s employment contract.  This Court does not \nfind any facts which would support the creation of another exception to the general \nrule that employer employee relationships fall outside the scope of the UDTPA.  \nTherefore, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Defendants’ actions are “in or \naffecting commerce.”  Consequently, Plaintiff has failed to plead all the elements of \na UDTPA claim and, therefore, this Court GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nas to this claim. \nE. \nUSURPATION OF CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES \n {41} Plaintiff’s claim for usurpation of corporate opportunities alleges that \nDefendant Sampson individually owed fiduciary duties to Plaintiff because of their \nrelationship as co-managers of FIC.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 162–63; Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. \nDismiss 16.)  The parties agree that any duties which Defendant Sampson would \nowe Plaintiff individually as a co-manager would be determined by Nevada Law, as \nFIC is a Nevada LLC.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 14–15; Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. \nDismiss 16–17.)  accord  Bluebird Corp. v. Aubin , 188 N.C. App. 671, 680–81, 657 \nS.E.2d 55, 63 (2008) (stating that the internal affairs doctrine suggests that the \nlaws of the state of incorporation control the standard of care required of managers.)    \n {42} A claim for usurpation of corporate opportunities is really a claim for \nbreach of fiduciary duties.  “The doctrine of corporate opportunity is ‘a species of the \nduty of a fiduciary to act with undivided loyalty . . . .’”  Meiselman v. Meiselman , \n309 N.C. 279, 307, 307 S.E.2d 551, 568 (1983).  Implicit in a claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty is that there is a fiduciary relationship.  Dalton v. Camp , 353 N.C. \n647, 651, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001).  A fiduciary relationship has been defined by \nthe North Carolina Supreme Court as: \none in which “there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in \nequity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due \nregard to the interests of the one reposing confidence, . . . [and] it \nextends to any possible case in which a fiduciary relationship exists in \nfact, and in which there is confidence reposed on one side, and \nresulting domination and influence on the other .”   \nId . at 652–53, 548 S.E.2d at 707–08 (quoting Abbitt v. Gregory , 201 N.C. 577, 598, \n160 S.E. 896, 906 (1931)) (omission and alteration in original). \n {43} Under Nevada law, there is no support for the proposition that a \nmanager of a corporation owes fiduciary duties to employees or holders of options \nfor membership interests.  While Plaintiff cites Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 86.286 to \nsupport his contention that a fiduciary relationship exists, the cited statute begins \nwith the following language: “to the extent that a . . . manager . . . has duties to a \nlimited-liability company [or] to another . . . manager . . . .”  NEV . R EV . STAT . A NN . § \n86.286(5) (2011).  This language would indicate that it is far from established that \nsuch duties exist.  While Nevada law provides a derivative right of action for \nmembers of an LLC, it only imposes fiduciary duties upon member-managers of \ncorporate entities or managers who are employed by corporate entities, and \nviolations of those duties can be enforced derivatively by equity owners.  Leavitt v. \nLeisure Sports Inc. , 734 P.2d 1221, 1224 (Nev. 1987). \n {44} This Court finds no authority under Nevada law that supports the \nimposition of an individual duty of good faith from Defendant Sampson to Plaintiff.  \nAbsent a fiduciary relationship between the parties, Defendant Sampson owes no \nfiduciary duties to Plaintiff.  Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for \nwhich relief can be granted and, therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss with \nregard to the claim for usurpation of corporate opportunities is GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED. \nF. \nNORTH CAROLINA WAGE & HOUR ACT  \n    {45} Under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (“Act”), “[e]mployees \nwhose employment is discontinued for any reason shall be paid all wages due on or \nbefore the next regular payday either through the regular pay channels or by mail if \nrequested by the employee.”  N.C.  G EN . STAT . § 95–25.7 (2011).  The Act requires an \n“employer to notify the employee in advance of the wages and benefits which he will \nearn and the conditions which must be met to earn them, and to pay those wages \nand benefits due when the employee has actually performed the work required to \nearn them.”  Narron v. Hardee’s Food Sys. , 75 N.C. App. 579, 583, 331 S.E.2d 205, \n208 (1985).  \n {46} Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant FIC suspended him with pay on \nSeptember 23, 2010.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 169.)  Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant FIC \nfailed to pay him the agreed-upon wages from September 23, 2010, until November \n30, 2010, and from the date of his termination through the end of his contract.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 175.)  The Act allows for employees to collect wages that were due to them \nprior to their termination, but does not allow for the collection of wages that had not \nbeen earned.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim for wages after his termination are not \nallowed under the Act and, as a result, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for which \nrelief can be granted as to those wages.  The Court therefore GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss to the extent that Plaintiff’s claim is for wages allegedly owed \nafter his termination; and DENIES DENIES DENIES DENIES Defendants’ Motion as to Plaintiff’s claim for \nwages that were owed to him prior to his termination.  \n \n \n \nG. \nINTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS \n {47} The essential elements of IIED are “‘(1) extreme and outrageous \nconduct, (2) which is intended to cause and does cause (3) severe emotional \ndistress[.]’” Burgess v. Busby , 142 N.C. App. 393, 399, 544 S.E.2d 4, 7 (2001) \n(alteration in original) (quoting  Dickens v. Puryear , 302 N.C. 437, 452, 276 S.E.2d \n325, 335 (1981)).  On a motion to dismiss a claim for IIED “[t]he determination of \nwhether the alleged conduct is considered extreme and outrageous is a question of \nlaw for the trial judge, however, the jury must determine whether the conduct is \n‘sufficiently extreme and outrageous to result in liability.’”  Smith-Price v. Charter \nBehavioral Health Sys. , 164 N.C. App. 349, 354–55, 595 S.E.2d 778, 783 (2004) \n(quoting Hogan v. Forsyth Country Club Co. , 79 N.C. App. 483, 490–91, 340 S.E.2d \n116, 121 (1986)); Burgess v. Busby , 142 N.C. App. 393, 399, 544 S.E.2d 4, 7 (2001) \n(reviewing a trial court’s determination of whether the conduct described in \nplaintiff’s complaint was sufficiently extreme and outrageous in a motion to \ndismiss).  When evaluating alleged conduct, the court must find that the conduct \n“exceeds all bounds of decency tolerated by society . . . .”  West v. King’s Dept. Store \nInc. , 321 N.C. 698, 704, 365 S.E.2d 621, 625 (1988).  \n {48} Here, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants abused their positions of \nauthority in hopes of getting Plaintiff to sign away his rights under the \nEmployment Agreement, and attempted to “starve out” Plaintiff so that he would \nhave no other option but to agree to the terms of his termination.  (Compl. ¶¶ 180–\n81.)  Despite these factual allegations, Plaintiff has been unable to cite any legal \nauthority to support his contention that an employer’s method of termination can \nrise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct.  While Defendants’ actions may \nhave been insulting and caused Plaintiff to suffer indignities, the conduct, as \nalleged, does not exceed all bounds of decency tolerated by society.  Briggs v. \nRosenthal , 73 N.C. App. 672, 677, 327 S.E.2d 308, 311 (2008) (“[L]iability clearly \ndoes not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, \nor other trivialities. . . . [P]laintiff[] must . . . be expected and required to be \nhardened to a certain amount of rough language, and to occasional acts that are \ndefinitely inconsiderate and unkind.” (quoting RESTATEMENT (S ECOND ) OF T ORTS  § \n46 cmt. d)).  This Court finds that Defendants’ actions as pled do not constitute \nextreme and outrageous conduct.  Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim \nfor which relief can be granted and Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim \nfor IIED is GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED. \nH. \nFRAUD \n    {49} The Court dismissed Plaintiff’s claim for fraud, supra , because Plaintiff \nlacked standing to bring the claim.  Nonetheless, the Court analyzes the fraud claim \nunder Rule 9(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and concludes that \nthe claim also fails because it was not pled with sufficient particularity.   \n{50} “‘The elements of fraud are: (1) False representation or concealment of \na material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to deceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, \n(4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting in damage to the injured party.’”  S.N.R. \nMgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC , 189 N.C. App. 601, 609, 659 S.E.2d 442, \n449 (2008) (quoting McGahren v. Saenger , 118 N.C. App. 649, 654, 456 S.E.2d 852, \n855 (1995)). \n {51} “In all averments of fraud, duress or mistake, the circumstances \nconstituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. \n9(b); \nTerry v. Terry , 302 N.C. 77, 84, 273 S.E.2d 674, 678 (1981).  Under the \nparticularity requirement of Rule 9(b), “[m]ere generalities and conclusory \nallegations of fraud will not suffice.”  Allran v. Branch Bank & Trust Corp. , 2011 \nNCBC 21 ¶ 31 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 6, 2011), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/ \nopinions/2011_NCBC _21.pdf (quoting  Sharp v. Teague , 113 N.C. App. 589, 597, 439 \nS.E.2d 792, 797 (1994)). \n {52} When pleading actual    fraud, “the particularity requirement is met by \nalleging time, place and content of the fraudulent representation, identity of the \nperson making the representation and what was obtained as a result of the \nfraudulent acts or representations.”  Terry v. Terry , 302 N.C. at 85, 273 S.E.2d at \n678. \n {53} In his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that:  \nDefendants falsely represented to Plaintiff that they would perform \ntheir obligations under the Employment Agreement, Asset Purchase \nAgreement and loan documents and that the performance of such \nobligations was in consideration for Plaintiff’s agreeing to enter into an \nAsset Purchase Agreement and transfer real property to Defendants \nFIC and FCH.  \n(Compl. ¶ 194.)  The Complaint also alleges that “Defendants represented to \nPlaintiff . . . that he would be paid as agreed under his contract, that a new \nsubstantially similarly contract would be negotiated and that his family would be \ntaken care of.”  (Compl. ¶ 194.)  Lastly, Plaintiff argues that paragraphs 21, 28, 30, \n32, 33, 68, 78, 80, 81, 112, 120, and 121 of the Amended Complaint contain specific \nallegations sufficiently identifying the time, place, and identity requirements under \nRule 9(b). \n {54} The Court’s inspection of these allegations only reveals generalizations \nthat fail to meet the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b).  The allegations are \nthat Plaintiff “entered into a contract of employment with FIC” that was \nsubsequently ratified by certain Defendants (Compl. ¶ 21); that “[o]n December 29, \n2009, Plaintiff and Defendant FIC entered into the Amended and Restated \nEmployment Agreement,” which was ratified by certain Defendants (Compl. ¶ 28); \nthat at the time Plaintiff entered into the Employment Agreement he was the sole \nowner of Rascal Holdings (Compl. ¶ 32); that Plaintiff entered into a [Transfer \nAgreement] on July 10, 2009, (Compl. ¶ 30); that “Defendants . . . represented to the \nBankruptcy Court that the [A]sset [P]urchase [Agreement] was in the best interests \nof [FMG’s] creditors” (Compl. ¶ 112); that the Asset Purchase Agreement and \nEmployment Agreement were reviewed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for \nthe Western District of North Carolina (Compl. ¶ 33); that Defendant Wilson \n“sought to suspend [Plaintiff] on behalf of FIC, in violation of the agreement” on \nSeptember 23, 2010 (Compl. ¶ 68); that Plaintiff was to be suspended with pay until \nhis termination date in December 2010 (Compl. ¶ 68); that Wilson sent a letter to \nPlaintiff Stec confirming the suspension (Compl. ¶ 78); that Plaintiff was \nterminated in violation of the Employment Agreement (Compl ¶ 81); that FIC’s \nconduct evidences that the Employment Agreement was only entered into in order \nto induce Plaintiff to complete the Asset Purchase Agreement (Compl. ¶ 120); and \nthat Defendants violated different provisions of the various agreements entered into \nby the parties.  (Compl. ¶ 121.) \n {55} The Court finds the above-referenced allegations to be nothing more \nthan general allegations that Defendants made false representations to Plaintiff in \norder to induce him to enter into the Employment Agreement and Asset Purchase \nAgreement, and made such representations again when Plaintiff was suspended.  \nNone of the allegations in the Complaint: (a) identify a specific individual who made \nthe alleged representations, (b) reflect when the representations occurred, or (c) \nspecify where the alleged conversations took place.  From Plaintiff’s allegations, the \nCourt can not determine which Defendant made the alleged false representations, \nor whether the representations were made in a corporate or individual capacity.\n   \n{56} Plaintiff’s allegations that the representations in the Employment \nAgreement induced him to enter into the Employment Agreement and the Asset \nPurchase Agreement fail to specifically identify who signed the Employment \nAgreement and only state that it was subsequently ratified at some unknown time.  \nExhibit A of Plaintiff’s Complaint is an unexecuted, unsigned copy of the alleged \nAmended and Restated Employment Agreement referred to in the Complaint.  \nWhile Plaintiff identifies Defendants Wilson and FIC in his Response Brief as the \n“persons” who promised Plaintiff that he would be paid under his then-current \ncontract and that a new contract would be negotiated, the Court takes notice that \nFIC is a corporation, not a person, and Wilson is no longer a defendant in this \naction.  Regarding the alleged conversation between Defendant Wilson and \nPlaintiff, while Plaintiff states in his Brief that the place where the alleged promise \nwas made is reflected in a letter sent by Defendant Wilson, there is nothing in the \nComplaint that supports this contention.   Accordingly, Plaintiff has failed to plead \nhis claim for fraud with particularity and the Court GRANT GRANT GRANT GRANTS S SS Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss as to this claim. \nI. \nPERSONAL JURISDICTION OF MICHELLE MICHAEL \n1. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n {57} In order to exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, this \nCourt must engage in a two-part analysis to determine whether: (1) “‘North \nCarolina’s long-arm statute . . . authorize[s] jurisdiction over the defendant[; and] \n[i]f so, . . . [(2)] whether the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with due process.’” \nBell v. Mozley , 716 S.E.2d 868, 871 (N.C. App. 2011) (quoting Bauer v. Douglas \nAquatics, Inc. , 698 S.E.2d 757, 760 (N.C. App. 2010)). \n{58} Here, it is unclear whether Defendant M. Michael is challenging the \napplicability of North Carolina’s long-arm statute.  In her motion to dismiss \nDefendant simply argues that “she has absolutely no contacts with North Carolina \nand has had no personal involvement in any of the business transactions with \nwhich the Complaint is concerned.”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 19.)  Out of an \nabundance of caution, this Court evaluates her argument as a challenge to personal \njurisdiction for failure to meet both the requirements of the North Carolina long-\narm statute and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \na. \nPROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS \n{59} When a court is presented with a personal jurisdiction \nchallenge: \nTypically, the parties will present personal jurisdiction issues in one of \nthree procedural postures: (1) the defendant makes a motion to dismiss \nwithout submitting any opposing evidence; (2) the defendant supports \nits motion to dismiss with affidavits, but the plaintiff does not file any \nopposing evidence; or (3) both the defendant and the plaintiff submit \naffidavits addressing the personal jurisdiction issues.  \nBauer , 698 S.E.2d at 761 (quoting Banc of Am. Secs. LLC v. Evergreen Int’l \nAviation, Inc.,  169 N.C. App. 690, 693, 611 S.E.2d 179, 182 (2005)).  “When the \nparties submit ‘dueling affidavits’ under the third category, the trial court may \ndecide the matter from review of the affidavits, or ‘the court may direct that the \nmatter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or depositions.’”  Id . (quoting \nBanc of Am. Secs. LLC,  at 694, 611 S.E.2d at 183).  \n{60} “[P]laintiff bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the \nevidence, grounds for exercising personal jurisdiction over a defendant.” Id . (citing \nAdams, Kleemeier, Hagan, Hannah & Fouts, PLLC v. Jacobs,  158 N.C. App. 376, \n378, 581 S.E.2d 798, 801, rev’d on other grounds,  357 N.C. 651, 588 S.E.2d 465 \n(2003)).   In a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the facts alleged in \nthe complaint are taken as true unless defendants supplement their motion to \ndismiss with affidavits.  Eluhu v. Rosenhaus , 159 N.C. App. 355, 359, 583 S.E.2d \n707, 711 (2003) (citation omitted).  When affidavits or other evidence are offered \n“the plaintiff must respond ‘by affidavit or otherwise . . . set[] forth specific facts \nshowing that the court has jurisdiction.’”  Id . (quoting Bruggeman v. Meditrust \nAcquisition Co. , 138 N.C. App. 612, 615–16, 532 S.E.2d 215, 218, disc. review \ndenied , 353 N.C. 261, 546 S.E.2d 90 (2000)).  “A ‘verified complaint may be treated \nas an affidavit if it (1) is made on personal knowledge, (2) sets forth such facts as \nwould be admissible in evidence, and (3) shows affirmatively that the affiant is \ncompetent to testify to the matters stated therein.’”  Id . (quoting Adams, Kleemeier, \nHagan, Hannah & Fouts, PLLC , 158 N.C. App. at 383, 581 S.E.2d at 803). \nb. \nLONG-ARM STATUTE \n{61} North Carolina’s long-arm statute provides for jurisdiction:  \nIn any action for wrongful death occurring within this State or in any \naction claiming injury to person or property within this State arising \nout of an act or omission outside this State by the defendant, provided \nin addition that at or about the time of the injury either: . . . \na. [s]olicitation or services activities were carried on within this State \nby or on behalf of the defendant . . . .   \n \nN.C. \n G EN . STAT . § 1–75.4(4)(a) (2011).  Grounds for jurisdiction are also present “[i]n \nany action which . . . [a]rises out of a promise, made anywhere to the plaintiff or to \nsome third party for the plaintiff’s benefit, by the defendant to perform services \nwithin this State or to pay for services to be performed in this State by the \nplaintiff[.]”  N.C.  G EN . STAT . § 1–75.4(5)(a).   \nc. \nDUE PROCESS  \n{62} Even when a defendant’s actions appear to fall within the reach of \nNorth Carolina’s long-arm statute, a court must still determine whether those \ncontacts meet the requirements imposed by the Due Process Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment.  The United States Supreme Court has recognized two \nforms of personal jurisdiction: “‘specific jurisdiction,’ where the controversy arises \nout of the defendant’s contacts with the forum state, and ‘general jurisdiction,’ \nwhere the controversy is unrelated to the defendant’s activities within the forum, \nbut there are ‘sufficient contacts’ between the forum and the defendant.”  Bauer , \n698 S.E.2d at 763 (quoting Replacements, Ltd. v. Midwesterling, 133 N.C. App. 139, \n143, 515 S.E.2d 46, 49–50 (1999)). \n{63} Our courts have held that:  \nSpecific jurisdiction exists if the defendant has purposely directed its \nactivities toward the resident of the forum and the cause of action \nrelates to such activities. This inquiry focuses on whether the \ndefendant ‘purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting \nactivities in-state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections of the \nforum state’s laws,’ and jurisdiction may be proper even if the \ndefendant has never set foot in the forum state. General jurisdiction \nexists where the defendant has continuous and systematic contacts \nwith the forum state, even though those contacts do not relate to the \ncause of action.  \nWyatt v. Walt Disney World, Co. , 151 N.C. App. 158, 165, 565 S.E.2d 705, 710 \n(2002) (quoting Frisella v. Transoceanic Cable Ship Co. , 181 F. Supp. 2d 644, 647 \n(E.D.La. 2002)); Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 131 S. Ct. 2846, \n2854 (2011) (stating that when a court attempts to exercise specific jurisdiction \n“this Court has inquired whether there was ‘some act by which the defendant \npurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum \nState . . . .’” (quoting Hanson  v. Denckla , 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. \n2d 1283 (1958)) (alteration in original)). \n{64} To satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause, there must be \nsufficient minimum contacts between the nonresident defendant and the forum \nstate “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice.’”  Bauer , 698 S.E.2d at 762 (quoting Int’l Shoe Co. \nv. Washington,  326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95, 102 (1945)).  “‘The \nrelationship between the defendant and the forum state must be such that the \ndefendant should ‘reasonably anticipate being haled into’ a North Carolina court.”  \nBell , 716 S.E.2d at 872 (quoting Tejal Vyas, LLC v. Carriage Park Ltd. P’ship , 166 \nN.C. App. 34, 39, 600 S.E.2d 881, 885–86 (2004)).  “The facts of each case determine \nwhether the defendant’s activities in the forum state satisfy due process.”  Id . \n(citation omitted). \n{65} In determining whether sufficient minimum contacts exist between the \nnonresident defendant and the state attempting to exercise jurisdiction, a court \nmust consider:  \n(1) the quantity of the contacts between defendant and North Carolina; \n(2) the nature and quality of such contacts; (3) the source and \nconnection of plaintiff’s cause of action to those contacts; (4) the \ninterest of North Carolina in having plaintiff’s case tried here; and (5) \nthe convenience to the parties.  \nBell , 716 S.E.2d at 872 (citing First Union Nat’l Bank of Del. v. Bankers Wholesale \nMortgage, LLC , 153 N.C. App. 248, 253, 570 S.E.2d 217, 221 (2002)).  “‘No single \nfactor controls, but they all must be weighed in light of fundamental fairness and \nthe circumstances of the case.’”  Id . (quoting B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Tire King , 80 N.C. \nApp. 129, 132, 341 S.E.2d 65, 67 (1986)). \n {66} Where a defendant is an officer or significant shareholder of a \ncorporation, “‘then h[er] corporate acts may be attributed to h[er] for the purpose of \ndetermining whether the courts of this State may assert personal jurisdiction over \nh[er].’”  Saft Am., Inc. v. Plainview Batteries, Inc. , 189 N.C. App. 579, 598, 659 \nS.E.2d 39, 51 (2008) (Arrowwood, J., dissenting) reversed for reasons stated in \ndissent , 363 N.C. 5, 673 S.E.2d 864 (2009).  However, “personal jurisdiction over an \nindividual officer or employee of a corporation may not be predicated merely upon \nthe corporate contacts with the forum.”  Robbins v. Ingham , 179 N.C. App. 764, 771, \n635 S.E.2d 610, 615 (2006) (citing Godwin v. Walls , 118 N.C. App. 341, 348, 455 \nS.E.2d 473, 479 (1995) (“[P]laintiffs may not assert jurisdiction over a corporate \nagent without some affirmative act committed in his individual official capacity.”)); \naccord Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783, 790, 79 L. Ed. 2d 804, 813 (1984) (“Petitioners \nare correct that their contacts with California are not to be judged according to their \nemployer’s activities there. On the other hand, their status as employees does not \nsomehow insulate them from jurisdiction.”).   \n2. \nANALYSIS \n {67} Defendant M. Michael supported her motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction with an affidavit regarding her contacts with North Carolina.  \nUnder the holding in Eluhu , Plaintiff was required to respond by affidavit and \nprovide sufficient facts for this Court to find that it has jurisdiction.  Eluhu , at 359, \n583 S.E.2d at 711.  Plaintiff’s Verified Amended Complaint can only serve as an \naffidavit if it was based on personal knowledge, set forth facts that would be \nadmissible into evidence, and demonstrates that the affiant is competent to testify.  \nId .     \na. \nPROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS \n{68} Plaintiff directs the Court to paragraphs 21, 35, 37, 49, 63, 66–67, 72, \n82–83, 88, 90, 107, 110, 112, 114, and 121 of his Verified Amended Complaint as \nevidence of Defendant M. Michael’s contacts with North Carolina and compliance \nwith the Eluhu  requirements.  After reviewing Plaintiff’s Verified Amended \nComplaint, the Court finds that none of the paragraphs cited by Plaintiff indicate \nthat any of the allegations contained therein were based on Plaintiff’s personal \nconduct.  In fact, most of the cited allegations make generalized legal conclusions \nabout Defendant Allstate’s knowledge or intent, and others are only based on \n“information and belief.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 35, 66–67, 72, 88, 107, 110.)  In addition, \nthose allegations that discuss Defendant Allstate’s knowledge or intent are likely to \nbe inadmissible for lack of personal knowledge under Rule 602, or determined to be \nhearsay under Rule 802.  See N.C. R. Evid. 602, 802.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s \nComplaint fails to meet prongs one and two of the Eluhu test, and thus, cannot be \nused as an affidavit to show that Defendant M. Michael has sufficient contacts with \nNorth Carolina. \nb. \nLONG-ARM STATUTE \n{69} While it is unclear which section of North Carolina’s long-arm statute \nPlaintiff would argue provides this Court with jurisdiction over Defendant M. \nMichael, the facts of the case suggest that it would be either under Section 1–\n75.4(4)(a) and/or Section 1–75.4(5)(a).  In his Response to Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss, Plaintiff argues that Defendant Allstate’s contacts with North Carolina \ncan be imputed to Defendant M. Michael under theories of piercing the corporate \nveil and alter ego.  (Pl.’s Resp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss 21.)  However, this Court’s \nreview of Plaintiff’s Complaint finds no allegations of either legal theory.  Under an \nalter ego theory Plaintiff would have needed to allege that Allstate was a mere \ninstrumentality of its stockholders.  In North Carolina this requires Plaintiff to \nshow: \n(1) stockholders’ control of the corporation amounting to “complete \ndomination” with respect to the transaction at issue; (2) \nstockholders’ use of this control to commit a wrong, or to violate a \nstatutory or other duty in contravention of the other party’s rights; and \n(3) this wrong or breach of duty must be the proximate cause of the \ninjury to the other party.  \nState ex. rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC , 362 N.C. 431, 441, 666 S.E.2d \n107, 114 (2008).  Plaintiff’s failure to properly allege an alter ego theory in his \nComplaint deprives Plaintiff of the argument that this Court has personal \njurisdiction over Defendant M. Michael under such a theory.   \n{70} Turning to Plaintiff’s allegations about M. Michael’s contacts with \nNorth Carolina, the Court finds that nothing within Plaintiff’s Complaint provides \nany information about Defendant M. Michael’s personal contacts with North \nCarolina.  Instead Plaintiff’s allegations focus on Defendant Allstate’s contacts with \nthe state.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 21, 35, 37, 49, 63, 66–67, 72, 82–83, 88, 90, 107, 110, 112, \n114, 121.)  Left with a Complaint that fails to meet the requirements to serve as an \naffidavit, or to detail Defendant M. Michael’s contacts with North Carolina, the \nCourt turns to Defendant M. Michael’s affidavit in support of her motion to dismiss.   \n{71} In her affidavit, Defendant M. Michael states that she has been a \nresident of Snohomish County, Washington since 1995; does not own any real or \npersonal property in North Carolina; does not maintain any bank accounts in North \nCarolina; has never visited North Carolina; has not been a party to any litigation in \nNorth Carolina; did not play a role in any of the transactions described in the \nComplaint; did not play a role in any of Defendant Allstate’s transactions or \nbusiness activities within the state; and has had no communication with anyone \ninside the state, with the exception of her husband when he was present in North \nCarolina.  (Aff. Michelle Michael Supp. Mot. Dismiss ¶¶ 2–9.)   \n{72} Section 1–75.4(4)(a) and Section 1–75.4(5)(a) of the North Carolina \nlong-arm statute require that some action or solicitation be done by or on behalf of \nthe defendant over whom the court seeks to exercise jurisdiction.  N.C.  G EN . STAT § \n1–75.4(4–5).  After reviewing the Complaint and Defendant M. Michael’s affidavit, \nthe Court finds that the Defendant M. Michael’s contacts with North Carolina are \nvirtually nonexistent.  Despite Plaintiff’s claims to the contrary, he has failed to \nprovide an affidavit or any other evidence demonstrating that M. Michael has any \ncontacts with North Carolina.  Accordingly, the Court can not find that Defendant \nM. Michael has had any contacts with our state which would make her subject to \npersonal jurisdiction under North Carolina’s long-arm statute. \nc. \nDUE PROCESS \n{73} Even though the Court has determined that Defendant M. Michael’s \nactions do not satisfy the requirements of North Carolina’s long-arm statute, it is \nclear from our case law that “our long-arm statute was intended to make available \nto North Carolina courts the full jurisdictional powers permissible under due \nprocess.”  Robbins , 179 N.C. App. at 770, 635 S.E.2d at 615 (citing Dillon v. Funding \nCorp. , 291 N.C. 674, 676, 231 S.E.2d 629, 630 (1977)) (conducting a due process \nanalysis even after finding that defendant’s conduct did not satisfy the \nrequirements of North Carolina’s long-arm statute).  The Court now looks to \ndetermine if any of Defendant M. Michael’s contacts meet the requirements of Due \nProcess.   \n{74} The Due Process Clause requires that there be sufficient minimum \ncontacts between the nonresident defendant and the forum state “such that the \nmaintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.’”  Bauer , 698 S.E.2d at 762.  In evaluating the contacts in a case, \nthe court must look at the quantity of contacts, the quality of those contacts, the \nconnection between the action at bar and the contacts, the states interest in having \nplaintiff’s case tried here, and convenience to the parties as a whole.  Bell , 716 \nS.E.2d at 872.   \n{75} With the exception of some phone calls that may have been made \nbetween Defendant M. Michael and her husband when he was in North Carolina, \nDefendant M. Michael’s affidavit shows that she has had no contact with the state.  \nEven assuming that the phone calls occurred, the quality of those contacts were \npoor, the contacts were unrelated to the facts of this case, and because Defendant \nM. Michael lives in Washington, the Court determines that it would be highly \ninconvenient for her to participate in litigation here in North Carolina.  While \nNorth Carolina does have a strong interest in having its citizens’ claims heard in \nNorth Carolina, other factors weigh heavily against finding that Defendant M. \nMichael’s contacts are sufficient to meet the requirements of due process in this \ncase.  Therefore, this Court concludes as a matter of law that Defendant M. Michael \ndid not direct sufficient activities towards North Carolina to confer personal \njurisdiction over her upon the Court.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS GRANTS Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss all claims against Defendant M. Michael for lack of personal \njurisdiction.  \n \n \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n{76} For the above stated reasons, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \nGRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED in part and DENIED DENIED DENIED DENIED in part.  Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ \nclaims for: unfair and deceptive trade practices; usurpation of corporate \nopportunities, violation of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act as to wages owed \nafter Plaintiff’s termination; intentional infliction of emotional distress; and fraud is \nGRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED and all of these claims are hereby DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED, with prejudice.  \nPlaintiff’s claims for tortuous interference with contract and intentional \ninterference with business relations against Defendants Sampson and Sampson \nTrust are hereby DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED, but without prejudice to Plaintiff to seek appropriate \namendment of his Complaint. \n {77} Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is \nGRANTED GRANTED GRANTED GRANTED and, therefore, Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant M. Michael are \nDISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED DISMISSED, with prejudice.   \n{78} Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claims for: breach of contract \nand breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; tortuous interference \nwith contract and intentional interference with business relations against \nDefendants Allstate, Policeno, and J. Michael; and violation of the North Carolina \nWage & Hour Act as to wages owed before Plaintiff’s termination, is DENIED DENIED DENIED DENIED.   \nSO ORDERED SO ORDERED SO ORDERED SO ORDERED, this the 30 th  day of April, 2012.  \n "
