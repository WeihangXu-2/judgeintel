THIS MATTER is before the Court following the 14 June 2024 filings of \n \n(1) Plaintiffs and Counterclaim Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment \n(“Plaintiffs’ Motion”), filed by Plaintiffs and Counterclaim Defendants BioGas Corp.; \nNC BioGas, LLC; Lakeside BioGas, LLC; and S. Anwar Shareef (collectively, \n \n \n \n \n1 Recognizing that this Opinion cites to and discusses the subject matter of documents that \nthe Court has allowed to remain under seal in this action, the Court filed this Order and \nOpinion under seal on 7 November 2024.  (See ECF No. 69.)  On 21 November 2024, the \nparties notified the Court that all parties conferred and agreed to the limited redactions found \nwithin this Order and Opinion. Accordingly, the Court now files this public version of the \nOrder and Opinion. \nBIOGAS CORP.; NC BIOGAS, LLC; \nand LAKESIDE BIOGAS, LLC, \nPlaintiffs and \nCounterclaim Defendants, \nv. \nNC BIOGAS DEVELOPMENT, \nLLC; ERIK M.

This case arises from a lending relationship where Defendants provided \nfunding through various promissory notes and subsequent extensions to Plaintiffs \nrelated to multiple biogas projects.  The funds provided by Defendants, and the \n \n \n2 For purposes of this Order and Opinion, the Court refers to BioGas Corp., NC BioGas, LLC, \nLakeside BioGas, LLC, and S. Anwar Shareef as “Plaintiffs”, even though S. Anwar Shareef \nis a counterclaim defendant, as these parties are aligned in interest with regard to the \nMotions at issue and are represented by the same counsel of record. \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nconduct related thereto, initiated a chain of other agreements, many of which \nPlaintiffs contend Defendants breached by failing to satisfy numerous duties and \nobligations owed to Plaintiffs.  Defendants, in turn, argue that Plaintiffs’ failure to \nremit payment related to the promissory notes, all of which relate to the biogas \nprojects at issue, is the conduct which instigated this litigation. \n5. Following fulsome discovery, the filing and briefing of the Motions, and oral \nargument conducted by the Court, the Court must now consider the undisputed \nevidence of record to determine what claims, if any, should proceed to trial. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \n6. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion for \nsummary judgment. “[T]o provide context for its ruling,  the court may state either \nthose facts that it believes are not in material dispute or those facts on which a \nmaterial dispute forecloses summary adjudication.”  Ehmann v. Medflow, Inc., 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 88, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017); see also Hyde Ins. Agency, \nInc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142 (1975) (encouraging the trial court \nto articulate a summary of the relevant evidence of record to provide context for the \nclaims and motion(s)). \nA. The Parties \n \n1. Plaintiffs \n7. BioGas Corp. is a corporation organized under the laws of North  Carolina, \nwith its principal place of business in Wake County, North Carolina. (Joint Appendix \n1 at ¶ 2, ECF No. 63 [“J.A”]; J.A. 23 at ¶ 2.) \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n8. S. Anwar Shareef (“Shareef”) is a resident of Wake County, North Carolina, \nand is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of BioGas Corp.  (J.A. 41 at ¶¶  1, 3; \nJ.A. 230–31 at ¶¶ 1, 3.) \n9. NC BioGas, LLC (“NC BioGas”) is a limited liability company organized \nunder the laws of North Carolina, with its principal place of business in Wake County, \nNorth Carolina. (J.A. 1–2 at ¶ 3; J.A. 23 at ¶ 3.) BioGas Corp. is the owner of \nNC BioGas, and Shareef is the manager of NC BioGas. (J.A. 280 at 219:5–10.) \n10. Lakeside BioGas, LLC (“Lakeside BioGas”) is a limited liability company \norganized under the laws of California. (J.A. 2 at ¶ 4; J.A. 24 at ¶ 4.) \n2. Defendants \n11. NC BioGas Development LLC (“BioGas Development”); Leyline Renewable \nCapital, LLC (“Leyline”); Windstar Biogas I Master, LLC (“Windstar”); San Diego AD \nPlant LLC (“San Diego I”); San Diego AD Plant II LLC (“San Diego II”); Vicomte \nSolar, LLC (“Vicomte”); and New York AD, LLC (“New York AD”) are limited liability \ncompanies organized under the laws of North Carolina, with their principal places of \nbusiness in Durham County, North Carolina. (J.A. 2 at ¶¶ 5–12; J.A. 24 at ¶¶ 5–12.) \n12. Erik M. Lensch (“Lensch”) is a citizen and resident of Orange County, North \nCarolina. (J.A. 2 at ¶ 6; J.A. 23 at ¶ 6.)  Lensch is the Chief Executive Officer of \nLeyline, and he also manages Biogas Development; San Diego I; San Diego II; \nWindstar; Vicomte; and New York AD. (J.A. 338–39 at ¶ 3.) \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nB. The Promissory Notes \n13. Between January 2017 and November 2019, Defendants entered into a \nseries of promissory notes, and subsequent extensions thereto, with Plaintiffs for use \nin financing renewable energy projects.  (See J.A. 54–229; J.A. 339 at  ¶ 5.) Shareef \npersonally guaranteed several of the promissory notes at issue. (J.A. 74–79; 103–08.) \n14. It is undisputed that Plaintiffs did not and have not paid the loans as they \nbecame due. (J.A. 231–34 at ¶¶ 9, 15, 21, 24, 28, 32, 36; J.A. 339 at ¶ 6.) \n15. On 8 June 2021, Defendants and BioGas Corp. “stipulated that the total \namount due from BioGas Corp. under the promissory notes as of [8 June 2021] was \n$3,152,496.54.” (J.A. 340 at ¶  7; see J.A. 81–82.) Additionally, “[n]o payments have \nbeen made by BioGas Corp. or [ ] Shareef since the June 2021 stipulation.” (J.A. 340 \nat ¶ 8; see also J.A. 428 at ¶ 9.) \nC. The Tillamook Project \n \n16. The first of three projects in which Defendants provided financing to BioGas \nCorp. was an anaerobic digestor project in Tillamook Bay, Oregon (the “Tillamook \nProject”). (J.A. 340 at ¶ 11.) \n17. By November 2019, Tillamook BioGas, LLC, which was a “special project \nentity that owned the assets comprising the Tillamook Project[,]” was in “default on \nits promissory note to [ ] Oregon AD, LLC[,]” an affiliate of Defendants. (J.A. 340 \nat ¶ 12.) Additionally, “BioGas Corp. was also delinquent on payments for property \ntaxes, insurance, rent, and utilities for the Tillamook Project.” (J.A. 341 at ¶ 13; J.A. \n351.)  For example, Regenis, which was a “company that [BioGas Corp.] had \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nengaged to operate[  ] and maintain the Tillamook Project[,]” later terminated their \ncontract with BioGas Corp. because BioGas Corp. failed to make timely payments. \n(J.A. 341 at ¶ 13; see also J.A. 457–58.) \n18. As a result, Defendants had “serious concerns that BioGas Corp. was not \nmanaging the Tillamook Project effectively[.]” (J.A. 341 at ¶ 13.) \n19. Instead of having Oregon AD, LLC exercise its step-in rights or foreclose on \nTillamook BioGas, LLC, Defendants “negotiated with BioGas Corp. to buy the \nTillamook Project.” (J.A. 341 at ¶ 14; J.A. 353–92.) As a result, on 26 November 2019, \nLeyline, as the buyer, and BioGas Corp., as the seller, entered into the Membership  \nInterest Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “MIPA”). (See J.A. 353–92.) \n20. The Purchase Price of the MIPA, to be paid by Leyline to BioGas Corp., was \nas follows: \na. Ten Thousand US Dollars (US $10,000) (the “Closing Payment”), \nplus \nb. an amount not to exceed Two Million and 00/100 Dollars \n(“Contingent Purchase Payment”), provided such Contingent \nPurchase Payment shall only be payable from Net Cash available \nfollowing any payments that must first be paid from Net Cash \npursuant to the D[eveloper ]S[ervices ]A[greement], plus \nc. 30% of any remaining Net Cash, if and only if, all amounts payable \nunder the DSA and full amount of the Contingent Purchase Payment \nhave been paid (“Excess Contingent Payment”). \n \n(J.A. 360 at § 2.1(a).) \n21. Additionally, the MIPA provided that \nSeller shall, and shall cause the Project Company to, regularly \ncommunicate and consult with the Buyer and keep Buyer informed with \nrespect to continued development of the System, including arranging for \nBuyer's participation in meetings or calls related to the development of \nthe System, and Seller shall reasonably incorporate Buyer's input and \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \ncomments with respect to any matters in connection with such \ncontinued development. \n \n(J.A. 373 at § 5.4(c).) The MIPA also stated that “[u]ntil such time as Buyer has paid \nSeller the entire Purchase Price, Buyer agrees to keep Seller reasonably informed of \nthe status of the development and construction of the System[.]” (J.A. 373 at § 5.6.) \n22. The lasting impact of the MIPA was that Defendants “purchased BioGas \nCorp.’s 82% stake in Tillamook BioGas, LLC[,]” with the “remaining 18% belong[ing] \nto Oregon AD, LLC.” (J.A. 341 at ¶ 15; see also J.A. 360 at § 2.1; J.A. 447 at ¶ 7; J.A. \n464–67.) \n23. After the MIPA was executed, Leyline took over control and operation of \nthe Tillamook Project.  (J.A. 324 at 52:20 –22.) At that time, the Tillamook Project \n“was not operational, and was in a severe state of disrepair.” (J.A. 342 at ¶ 19.) \n24. On 11 December 2019, Leyline sent a document titled “Developer Services \nAgreement, which was a “non -binding indicative proposal” to engage BioGas Corp. \n“in the development of [Leyline’s] majority -owned subsidiary, Tillamook BioGas, \nLLC[,]” (the “DSA”). (J.A. 394.) \n25. The DSA provided insight into what Leyline was seeking to achieve for the \nTillamook Project. (J.A. 394–95.) However, the DSA expressly stated that \n[t]his Proposal is an extension of interest and does not constitute a \ncommitment by the Investor to enter into the DSA or with respect to any \nother matter and does not create in favor of any person or entity, \nincluding the Sponsor or Investor, a right to seek any remedy against \nthe other for failure to consummate the DSA. \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n(J.A. 395.) Additionally, the DSA provided that “[e]xcept with respect to obligations \nof confidentiality, this Proposal is not intended to constitute or create any binding \nobligation on the part of the Investor or the Sponsor.” (J.A. 395.) \n26. Thereafter, the DSA was modified on 8 June 2021, providing, in relevant \npart, that the total amount owed to Defendants related to the promissory notes was \nequal to $3,152,496.54. (J.A. 81–82.) \n27. In July 2021, Defendants “sought to find a third -party purchaser for the \n[Tillamook P]roject.”  (J.A. 342 at ¶  21.) BioGas Corp. “was interested in re - \npurchasing the project, arranged for financing of the re-purchase and provided a bid \nto Leyline.” (J.A. 449 at ¶ 12; see J.A. 443 at ¶¶ 5–8.) BioGas Corp. represented that \nit was prepared to offer $15,000,000.00 to secure the purchase of the Tillamook \nProject. (J.A. 464–69 (providing numerous communications between BioGas Corp. \nand various funding institutions related to obtaining financing in the amount \nof $15,000,000.00.)) \n28. However, given the debt that BioGas Corp. still owed to Defendants for the \nTillamook Project, Defendants did not accept BioGas Corp.’s offer. (J.A. 331–32 \nat 73:2–74:21.) \n29. Thereafter, Defendants were “unable to reach agreement with any of the \nentities that [expressed possible interest in purchasing the property]; they either \nwalked away from the deal or made offers dramatically lower than their initial \nindications of interest.” (J.A. 343 at ¶ 23.) Presently, Defendants “remain[ ] open to \noffers to purchase the Tillamook Project[,]” (J.A. 344 at ¶ 24), and “continue to invest \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nresources into the Tillamook Project, including working toward converting it to a \nrenewable natural gas project[,]” (J.A. 344 at ¶ 25; see also J.A. 435 at ¶¶ 3 –4). \nHowever, “[t]o date the Tillamook Project has not generated any profit[,]” and not \nenough “to repay the BioGas [Corp.] loans or satisfy the other obligations that are a \nprerequisite to BioGas Corp. receiving any payments” pursuant to the MIPA. (J.A. \n344 at ¶ 26.) \nD. The Lakeside Project \n30. Another project in which Defendants provided financing to BioGas Corp. \nwas located in Lakeside, California (the “Lakeside Project”). (J.A. 344 at ¶ 27.) \n31. An Investment Agreement was initially entered into between BioGas Corp. \nand Windstar, in which Windstar represented its intent to loan up to $725,000.00 to \nBioGas Corp. “in exchange for (i) the issuance by [BioGas Corp.] to [Windstar] of a \npromissory note . . . and (ii) the issuance to [Windstar] of a Guaranty Agreement of \n[BioGas Corp.][.]” (J.A. 211.) Thereafter, San Diego I entered into promissory notes \nwith Lakeside Biogas to provide financing for the Lakeside Project. (See J.A. 110–62; \nJ.A. 169–88.) \n32. As a result of San Diego I providing funds to BioGas Corp. for the Lakeside \nProject, San Diego I was granted Step-In Rights related to the Lakeside Project. (J.A. \n157 at ¶ 9.) Specifically, on 23 October 2019, the promissory note was amended, \nproviding as follows: \nIf the [BioGas Corp.] fails to make the payments required pursuant to \nSection 2 of this Note and fails to bring its account current within fifteen \n(15) calendar days after written notice thereof from the Payee, then the \nPayee shall have the right, at its sole election, and without limitation to \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nany other right or remedy available to the Payee, to assume and \ncomplete some or all of the [BioGas Corp.’s] development activities \nrelated to the Lakeside Project (the “Project”) at any point prior to the full \nrepayment or cancellation of this Note. Such rights shall include, but \nare not limited to: (i) serving as the developer and/or manager of the \nProject, (ii) receiving market-based compensation for its Project-related \nservices, and (iii) retaining the right to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or \notherwise dispose of the Project in its discretion. If the Payee so elects \nto assume and complete any of the development activities originally, to \nthe extent requested by the Payee in writing, [BioGas Corp.] shall assign \nto the Payee any or all third -party agreements relating to such \ndevelopment activities. In such event, with respect to all such activities, \nat the Payee’s option, [BioGas Corp.] shall cooperate with the Payee to \nensure a smooth and orderly transition thereof that will not involve any \ndisruption. \n \n(J.A. 157 at ¶ 9 (emphasis added).) \n33. Thereafter, BioGas Corp. “failed to pay its loans associated with the \nLakeside Project when due[,]” and BioGas Corp. was “in default on its lease for the \nproperty where the Lakeside Project was to be constructed, owing more than \n$600,000 to the landlord.” (J.A. 344 at ¶ 28; J.A. 402–03.) \n \n34. In March 2020, as a result of BioGas Corp.’s inability to pay its debts, “San \nDiego [I] exercised [its] rights to step-in to the Lakeside Project and took over control \nof the Lakeside Project.” (J.A. 15 at ¶ 114; J.A. 34 at ¶ 114; J.A. 258; J.A. 344 at ¶ 29.) \n35. Following the exercise of San Diego I’s Step-In Rights, Defendants “looked \nfor a third party to purchase the Lakeside Project[.]”  (J.A. 345 at ¶  30.) Similar to \nthe Tillamook Project, Plaintiffs sought to purchase the Lakeside Project for \n$2,500,000.00. (J.A. 443 at ¶ 9; J.A. 326 at 57:13–24.) These funds would purportedly \nbe provided by Rehan Khan, who “agreed to provide BioGas Corp. \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nw[ith] $2,500,000.00[.]” (J.A. 443 at ¶  10; see also J.A. 495 –500.) However, \nDefendants did not accept this proposal. (J.A. 326 at 57:2–24; J.A. 443 at ¶ 12.) \n36. Ultimately, Defendants “entered into a Term Sheet with a company called \nBioenergy Devco[,]” which is “an experienced developer of anaerobic digestion \nprojects[.]” (J.A. 345 at ¶ 30; J.A. 289–91.) \n37.  \n \n. (J.A. 345 at ¶ 31.) Upon execution of the Term Sheet, Defendants “no longer \nhad any involvement in the management or operation of the Lakeside Project.” (J.A. \n345 at ¶ 31; see also J.A. 283 at ¶ 9.) \n38. Thereafter, an Indemnification Agreement was signed by BioGas Corp., \nLakeside Biogas, Tillamook Biogas, LLC, Leyline, and Windstar on 8 June 2021. (J.A. \n405–12; J.A. 345 at ¶  32.) The Indemnification Agreement provided a release \nprovision, which stated, in relevant part, that \n[i]n further consideration for Leyline’s conditional agreement to the \nsharing provisions above, and its conditional agreement not to exercise \nits rights or its remedies, with respect to the [Windstar] Investment \nAgreement and the [Windstar] Note, each Biog as Party, on behalf of \nitself and its affiliates, hereby releases, acquits, and forever discharges \neach Leyline Party, and each and every past and present subsidiary, \naffiliate . . . from any and all claims, causes of action, suits, debts, liens, \nobligations . . . of any kind, character, or nature whatsoever, known or \nunknown, fixed or contingent, which it or  any of its affiliates may have \nor claim to have now or which may hereafter arise with respect to any \nact of commission or omission of any Leyline Party with respect to the \n[Windstar] Investment Agreement, the [Windstar] Note, or any other \nagreement, matter, or action relating to the [Lakeside] Project, which \nsuch act of commission or omission existed or occurred prior to the date \nof this letter. \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n(J.A. 408 at § 5 (emphasis added).) \n39. In April 2022, “after devoting considerable time, money, and effort to the \nLakeside Project, Bioenergy [Devco] concluded that [the Lakeside Project] was not a \nviable project.” (J.A. 283 at ¶ 10.) \n40. However, “[n]o payments (other than reimbursement of lease payments) \nwere made to [Defendants] by Bioenergy Devco,” and in turn, “no payments were \nmade to BioGas Corp. under the Indemnification Agreement.”  (J.A. 346 at ¶ 34; see \nalso J.A. 325 at 56:6–9.) \nE. The Monroe Project \n41. The third project in which Defendants provided financing to BioGas Corp. \nwas located in Monroe, North Carolina (the “Monroe Project”).  (J.A. 346 at ¶  35.) \nSpecifically, Biogas Development entered into promissory notes with BioGas Corp. to \nprovide financing for the Monroe Project. (See J.A. 54–79, 84–108.) \n42. The loans related to the Monroe Project came due on 31 October 2019. (J.A. \n346 at ¶ 38; J.A. 413–20.) \n43. The promissory note was extended by agreement by Biogas Development \non 23 October 2019, which contained a Step -In Rights provision.  (J.A. 347 at ¶  40; \nJ.A. 67–68.) That provision provided: \nIf the Maker fails to make the payments required pursuant to Section 2 \nof this Note and fails to bring its account current within fifteen (15) \ncalendar days after written notice thereof from the Payee, then the \nPayee shall have the right, at its sole election, and without limitation to \nany other right or remedy available to the Payee, to assume and \ncomplete some or all of the Maker’s development activities related to the \nMonroe Project (the “Project”) at any point prior to the full repayment \nor cancellation of this Note. Such rights shall include, but are not limited \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nto: (i) serving as the developer and/or manager of the Project, (ii) \nreceiving market -based compensation for its Project -related services, \nand (iii) retaining the right to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise \ndispose of the Project in its discretion. If the Payee so elects to assume \nand complete any of the development activities originally, to the extent \nrequested by the Payee in writing, the Maker shall assign to the Payee \nany or all third -party agreements relating to such development \nactivities. In such event, with respect to all such activities, at the Payee’s \noption, the Maker shall cooperate with the Payee to ensure a smooth and \norderly transition thereof that will not involve any disruption. \n(J.A. 68 at § 9.) \n \n44. The promissory notes related to the Monroe Project were not, and have not, \nbeen paid. (J.A. 42 at ¶ 9; J.A. 231 at ¶ 9.) \n45. In February 2020, Defendants “sent formal notices of default on the \nloans[.]” (J.A. 347 at ¶  39; J.A. 414.)  Thereafter, on 20 February 2023, Biogas \nDevelopment “invoked its Step -In Rights on the Monroe Project by sending written \nnotice [to] BioGas Corp. and Shareef.”  (J.A. 347 at ¶  41; see J.A. 208.)  However, \nBioGas Corp. has not acknowledged Biogas Development’s Step -In Rights, (J.A. 347 \nat ¶ 42), contending the “Monroe Project is owned and managed by NC BioGas[,]” \n(J.A. 5 at ¶ 36). There is a dispute amongst the parties as to who holds a legal interest \nin the Monroe Project. (See J.A. 7 at ¶ 57; J.A. 29 at ¶ 57.) \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \n46. The Court sets forth here only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motions. \n47. Plaintiffs initiated this action on 1 March 2023 with the filing of their \nVerified Complaint, (ECF No. 3), which asserted the following claims against \nDefendants: (1) Declaratory Judgment (“Count One”), (J.A. 16–17 at ¶¶ 127–29); \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n(2) Permanent Injunction (“Count Two”), (J.A. 17 –18 at ¶¶  130–36); (3) Breach of \nContract as to all Defendants except New York AD (“Count Three”), (J.A. 18–19 \nat ¶¶ 137–49); (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty as to all Defendants except New York AD \n(“Count Four”), (J.A. 19 –20 at ¶¶ 150–54); and (5) Negligence as to all Defendants \nexcept New York AD (“Count Five”), (J.A. 20–21 at ¶¶ 155–59). \n48. On 27 July 2023, Defendants filed their Answer and Counterclaim, adding \nShareef to this action as a counterclaim defendant, ( see J.A. 41 at ¶¶  1–4), and \nasserting the following claims against Plaintiffs: (1) Breach of Contract – Promissory \nNotes as to BioGas Corp. and Shareef (“Counterclaim One”), (J.A. 41–46 at ¶¶ 5–36); \n(2) Breach of Contract – Step-In Rights as to BioGas Corp. (“Counterclaim Two”), \n(J.A. 46–47 at ¶¶ 37–42); (3) Breach of Contract – Information Rights as to BioGas \nCorp. and Shareef (“Counterclaim Three”), (J.A. 47 –49 at ¶¶ 43–55); and (4) Breach \nof Fiduciary Duty as to BioGas Corp. (“Counterclaim Four”), (J.A. 49 –50 at ¶¶ 56– \n61). \n49. On 12 June 2024, the Court entered its Consent Order on Counterclaim \nPlaintiff NC BioGas Development, LLC’s Motion for Temporary Restraining Order \nand Preliminary Injunction, (ECF No. 44 [“12 June Order”]), which enjoined BioGas \nCorp. and NC BioGas from “e ntering into any contract, agreement, or other binding \nobligation or commitment concerning the Monroe Project without consulting [  ] \nBiogas Development[.]” (12 June Order at 3.) \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n50. Thereafter, the Motions were filed.  (See Pls.’ Mot.; Defs.’ Mot.)  Following \nfull briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motions on 8 October 2024 (the \n“Hearing”) at which all parties were represented through counsel. (See ECF No. 67.) \n51. The Motions are ripe for resolution. \n \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n52. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c). “A ‘genuine issue’ is \none that can be maintained by substantial evidence.” Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, \n83 (2000) (citation omitted).  “ ‘Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion’ and means ‘more \nthan a scintilla or a permissible inference.’  ” Head v. Gould Killian CPA Grp., P.A ., \n371 N.C. 2, 8 (2018) (quoting Ussery v. Branch Banking & Tr. Co., 368 N.C. 325, 335 \n(2015)). \n \n53. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact, and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nHensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc. , 193 N.C. App. 561, 563 (2008).  The movant \nmay make the required showing by proving that “an essential element of the opposing \nparty’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an \naffirmative defense, or by showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nproduce evidence to support an essential element of her claim.” Dobson, 352 N.C. at \n83 (citations omitted). \n54. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.” Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784−85 \n(2000) (citation omitted).  The Court must view the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmovant. Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83 (citation omitted). However, the \nnonmovant(s) \nmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of [their] pleading, but \n[their] response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must \nset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If \n[the nonmovant] does not so respond, summary judgment, if \nappropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant]. \nN.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(e). \n \n55. “For affirmative summary judgment on a party’s own claim, the burden is \nheightened.” Futures Grp. v. Brosnan, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 7, at **4 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJan. 19, 2023); see Brooks v. Mt. Airy Rainbow Farms Ctr., Inc., 48 N.C. App. 726, 728 \n(1980). The movant “must show that there are no genuine issues of fact, that there  \nare no gaps in his proof, that no inferences inconsistent with his recovery arise from \nthe evidence, and that there is no standard that must be applied to the facts by the \njury.” Parks Chevrolet, Inc. v. Watkins, 74 N.C. App. 719, 721 (1985); accord Kidd v. \nEarly, 289 N.C. 343, 370 (1976). Consequently, “rarely is it proper to enter \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nsummary judgment in favor of the party having the burden of proof.” Blackwell v. \nMassey, 69 N.C. App. 240, 243 (1984). \nV. ANALYSIS \n56. There appear to be two distinct groups of issues related to the Motions: \n \n(1) the legal ownership interest of the Monroe Project; and (2) the various contracts \nand related conduct between the parties.  As such, the Court addresses these two \ngroups, and the related issues and claims raised in the Motions, in turn. \nA. The Legal Ownership Interest of the Monroe Project \n \n57. There is a dispute as to who holds a legal ownership interest in the Monroe \nProject, arising from various representations and agreements entered into, including \nthe relevant promissory notes. The claims and issues related to the legal ownership \ninterest of the Monroe Project include: (1) Plaintiffs’ request for a declaration \nregarding the Monroe Project’s ownership; (2) Defendants’ request for summary \njudgment as to Count One; (3) Defendants’ request for summary judgment as  to \nCount Two; and (4) Defendants’ request for affirmative summary judgment as to \nCounterclaim Two. \n1. Plaintiffs’ Motion \n58. Plaintiffs seek a Court determination that Defendants have no legal \ninterest in the Monroe Project. (Pls.’ Memo. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. at 8–9, ECF No. 46 [“Pls.’ \nBr. Supp.”].) \n59. Plaintiffs contend the Monroe Project is owned by Plaintiff NC Biogas. (Pls.’ \nBr. Supp. 8.)  It is undisputed that the promissory note, and subsequent \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nextension thereof, regarding the Monroe Project were entered into between \nDefendant Biogas Development, on the one hand, and BioGas Corp. —not NC \nBiogas—on the other hand. (J.A. 55–73.) As a result, Plaintiffs argue “the Defendants \ncannot have any legal interest in the Monroe Project, except as to their ‘Step -In \nRights’ which would only apply to [  ] BioGas [Corp.] and its development activities \nrelated to the Monroe Project[.]” (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 9.) \n60. Defendants disagree, contending BioGas Corp. has been identified by \nPlaintiffs as “the sole owner and developer of the [Monroe] [P]roject.”  (Resp. Opp’n \nPls.’ Mot. at 8 (citing J.A. 422–24), ECF No. 60 [“Defs.’ Br. Opp.”].) \n61. Upon review of the record, there has been no evidence presented which \ndefinitively states who holds the legal title or other ownership interest in the Monroe \nProject, whether that be the land on which the Monroe Project sits, the assets utilized \nin the development of the Monroe Project, or otherwise.  Based on the record at this \nstage, it appears to the Court that the question of who has a legal ownership interest \nin the Monroe Project is an issue that the trier of fact needs to determine, based on \nevidence presented at trial. \n62. As such, Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Plaintiffs’ request for \nsummary judgment in the form of a Court declaration that Defendants have no legal \ninterest in the Monroe Project. \n2. Defendants’ Motion \n \n63. Defendants’ seek summary judgment as to three claims related to the \nMonroe Project—Counts One and Two asserted by Plaintiffs—as well as affirmative \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nsummary judgment as to Counterclaim Two. The Court will address each claim in \nturn. \na. Count One: Declaratory Judgment \n64. Plaintiffs initially asserted eleven topics on which they sought declaratory \njudgment. (See J.A. 16–17 at ¶¶ 128.a.–k.) Plaintiffs now concede that many of the \ntopics are “duplicative of issues raised by the claims and counterclaims in this case.” \n(Pls.’ Memo. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. at 23, ECF No. 58 [“Pls.’ Br. Opp.”].)  However, \nPlaintiffs contend that one topic is unique: “whether [  ] BioGas Dev[elopment] can \nexercise their step-in rights regarding the Monroe Project.” (Pls.’ Br. Opp. 23.) \n65. Under the North Carolina Declaratory Judgment Act (the “Act”), “[a]ny \nperson .  . . whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a statute, \nmunicipal ordinance, contract or franchise, may have determined any question of \nconstruction or validity arising under the . . . statute, ordinance, contract or franchise, \nand obtai n a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.”  \nN.C.G.S. § 1-254. “The purpose of the [Act] is to settle and afford relief from   \nuncertainty  concerning  rights,  status  and  other  legal  relations[.]” \nN.C. Consumers Power, Inc. v. Duke Power Co., 285 N.C. 434, 446 (1974). A court may \nrender judgment declaring the rights and liabilities of the respective parties, and \naffording relief to which the parties are entitled under the judgment, when: (1) “a real \ncontroversy exists between or among the parties”; (2) “such controversy arises out of \n[the parties’] opposing contentions”; and (3) the parties “have or may have legal \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nrights, or are or may be under legal liabilities [that] are  involved in the controversy, \nand may be determined by a judgment or decree in the action[.]” Id. at 449. \n66. The Court has already addressed this issue.  (See supra § V.A.1.) Because \na genuine issue of material fact exists as to who has a legal ownership interest in the \nMonroe Project, the Court DENIES in part Defendants’ Motion as to Count One for \ndeclaratory judgment on the same issue. However, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED \nin part as to the remaining ten topics upon which Plaintiffs sought a declaratory \njudgment, as Plaintiffs concede that those topics seek relief duplicative to that \nrequested in other claims raised in this case and are therefore unnecessary. \nb. Count Two: Permanent Injunction \n67. Plaintiffs assert a claim for permanent injunction that would “prohibit[ ] \nDefendants from exercising [their] step -in rights with the Monroe Project; [and] \nprohibit[ ] Defendants from contacting any third parties regarding the Monroe Project \nwhich could reduce the value of the Project.” (J.A. 17 at ¶ 131.) \n68. “A permanent injunction is an extraordinary equitable remedy and may \nonly properly issue after a full consideration of the merits of a case.” \nCB&I Constructors, Inc. v. Town of Wake Forest , 157 N.C. App. 545, 548 (2003) \n(citation and quotation marks omitted). \n69. Defendants seek summary judgment as to Count Two for permanent \ninjunction, arguing that Plaintiffs have not properly pursued the relief requested \nthrough a motion “in accordance with the Business Court Rules.”  (Br. Supp. Defs.’ \nMot. at 20 (citing BCRs 7.2, 7.13), ECF No. 61 [“Defs.’ Br. Supp.”].) \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n70. However, as previously noted, ( see supra § V.A.1), a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact exists as to who has legal ownership interest in the Monroe Project, and, \nas such, the Court cannot determine the merits of this claim without making that \ndetermination. As the merits of this issue have not yet been fully determined, it \nwould be premature to issue a permanent injunction or to determine that under no \ncircumstances might such relief be warranted.  See Levin v. Jacobsen , 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 111, at **32 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 7, 2015) (denying motion for permanent \ninjunction as premature). \n71. Therefore, the Court hereby DENIES Defendants’ Motion in part as to \nDefendants’ request for a summary judgment that Plaintiffs are not, as a matter of \nlaw, entitled to relief under Count Two in the form of a permanent injunction. \nc. Counterclaim Two: Breach of Contract as to Step-In Rights \n72. Defendants bring Counterclaim Two against BioGas Corp., alleging that \npursuant to a promissory note extension dated 23 October 2019, Biogas Development \nwas granted Step -In Rights to the Monroe Project upon the occurrence of specific \ncircumstances. (J.A. 46 at ¶  38.) Defendants allege that BioGas Corp. has failed to \ncomply with its obligations under the note, (J.A. 46 at ¶ 39), and as a result, \non 20 February 2023, “Biogas Development [  ] exercised its Step -In Rights for the \nMonroe Project[,]” (J.A. 47 at ¶ 40); but “BioGas Corp. has refused to cooperate with \n[ ] Biogas Development [  ] in the management transition for the Monroe Project,” \nresulting in a breach of that contract, (J.A. 47 at ¶ 42). \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n73. Defendants contend they are entitled to summary judgment on \nCounterclaim Two, as Plaintiffs have admitted that the Biogas Development note is \nin default, and BioGas Corp. has “refused to relinquish management of the Monroe \nProject.” (Defs.’ Br. Supp. 22.) \n74. However, Plaintiffs contend that “the Monroe Project is owned  by Plaintiff \nNC Biogas” and argue that since “[t]here are no contracts between [  ] NC Biogas [  ] \nand the Defendants, nor do the Defendants assert any claims against NC Biogas,” \nDefendants cannot have a legal ownership interest in the Monroe Project.  (Pls.’ Br. \nOpp. 23.) \n75. Once again, the Court has addressed this legal issue previously, (see supra \n§ V.A.1), and has found that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to who has  a \nlegal ownership interest in the Monroe Project, and as such, Defendants’ Motion is \nDENIED in part as to Counterclaim Two for breach of contract based on the Monroe \nProject Step-In Rights. \nB. Contracts at Issue and Related Conduct \n76. Next, there is a dispute amongst the parties as to what duties and \nobligations were owed by Defendants in relation to the agreements entered into \nbetween them, including the promissory notes, the MIPA, and other related \ntransactions. As such, the Court will address the claims and issues related to these \ncontracts and the conduct related thereto, including: (1) Plaintiffs’ request for a \ndeclaration  regarding  the  implied  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing; \n(2) Plaintiffs’ request for a declaration regarding the duty to mitigate; (3) Plaintiffs’ \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nrequest for a declaration regarding nominal damages; (4) Defendants’ request for \nsummary judgment as to Count One; (5) Defendants’ request for summary judgment \nas to Counterclaim One; and (6) Defendants’ request for summary judgment as to \nCounts Four and Five for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. \n1. Plaintiffs’ Motion \n77. Plaintiffs’ seek three legal declarations related to the contracts at issue and \nthe conduct related thereto. The Court will address each legal declaration sought in \nturn. \na. Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \n \n78. First, Plaintiffs seek under the guise of Rule 56 a declaration that \nDefendants owed them a duty of good faith and fair dealing as it pertains to several \ncontracts at issue in this case. (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 6–7.) \n79. “Under North Carolina law, every contract contains ‘an implied covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing  that neither party will do anything which injures the \nrights of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.’ ” Cordaro v. Harrington \nBank, FSB, 260 N.C. App. 26, 38 (2018) (quoting Bicycle Transit Auth. v. Bell, 314 \nN.C. 219, 228 (1985)). “A breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \n‘requires the wrongful intent of a party to deprive another party of its contractual \nrights.’ ” Herrera v. Charlotte Sch. of Law, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 35, at *30 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Apr. 20, 2018) (quoting RREF BB Acq. v. MAS Props., L.L.C., 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 61, at *47 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 9, 2015)). \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n80. Plaintiffs contend the following contracts contain the implied covenant of \ngood faith and fair dealing: (1) the promissory notes entered into between BioGas \nCorp., Defendants, and their affiliates, (2) the MIPA, (3) the DSA and any \nmodification thereof, (4) guaranty agreements related to the promissory notes, and \n(5) the investment agreements entered into between Lakeside, San Diego I and \nWindstar. (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 6 –7.) Plaintiffs argue that “[t]here should be no dispute \nthat pursuant to those various contracts the Defendants owed [  ] BioGas Corp. and \nLakeside Biogas[ ] a duty of good faith and fair dealing.” (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 7.) \n81. Defendants concede that “North Carolina law recognizes an implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts[.]” (Defs.’ Br. Opp. 5.) However, \nDefendants argue that “the motion does not seek any declaration applying the \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing to the events in this case, much less a \ndeclaration that any Defendant breached such a covenant.” (Defs.’ Br. Opp. 5.) \n82. As to the (1) MIPA; (2) DSA; and (3) Investment Agreements between both \n(a) Lakeside and San Diego I and (b) Lakeside and Windstar, it is clear based on the \nlaw of North Carolina that every contract has an implied duty of good faith and fair \ndealing, and as a result, summary judgment is appropriate on the issue of whether \nDefendants owed Plaintiffs an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing under these \ncontracts. See Cordaro, 260 N.C. App. at 38. \n83. As to the promissory notes and related guaranty agreements, once again \nthe Court notes that North Carolina law provides that every contract has an implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing.  However, upon review of the Verified \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nComplaint in this case, there is no claim for breach of contract based on the \npromissory notes or the guaranty agreements. (J.A. 18 at ¶¶ 138–42 (providing that \nPlaintiffs base their breach of contract claim on five agreements, none of which are \nthe promissory notes or guaranty agreements).)  As such, Plaintiffs’ contention that \nDefendants owed them a duty of good faith and fair dealing pursuant to the \npromissory notes and guaranty agreements, while correct under the law, provides no \nrelief for the Plaintiffs in this action, as no claim for breach of the implied duty of \ngood faith and fair dealing claim, and no related breach of contract claim, has been \nalleged. As a result, summary judgment would be inappropriate, as it is not \ndeterminative of any legal issue in this case. \n84. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ Motion is GRANTED in part, and the Court declares \nthat the (1) MIPA; (2) DSA; and (3) Investment Agreements between both \n(a) Lakeside and San Diego I and (b) Lakeside and Windstar, as a matter of law, \ncontain an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  However, Plaintiffs’ \nMotion is DENIED in part as to Count One to the extent it seeks a declaration that \nDefendants owed Plaintiffs an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing as to the \npromissory notes and guaranty agreements, given the fact that no relief can be given \nto Plaintiffs in this action based on these contracts. \nb. Duty to Mitigate Damages \n85. Second, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants had a duty to mitigate \ntheir damages as it relates to Counterclaim One for breach of contract as to the \npromissory notes. (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 8.) \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n86. A plaintiff has a duty to mitigate its damages when it “can do so with \nreasonable exertion or at trifling expense; and ordinarily, [it] will be allowed to \nrecover from the delinquent party only such damages as [it] could not, with \nreasonable effort, have avo ided.” Biemann and Rowell Co. v. Donohoe Companies, \nInc., 147 N.C. App. 239, 247 (2001). \n87. Defendants admit that “North Carolina law generally recognizes a duty to \nmitigate damages[.]” (Defs.’ Br. Opp. 7.) As such, it appears there is no genuine issue \nof material fact as to whether Defendants had a duty to mitigate their damages \nrelated to the promissory notes, and as a result, Plaintiffs’ Motion is GRANTED in \npart to that extent. \nc. Nominal Damages \n \n88. Finally, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that, if Defendants prevail on their \nbreach of contract claims, or if San Diego I prevails on its breach of fiduciary duty \nclaim, they should only be entitled to nominal damages. (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 9.) \n89. “Under North Carolina law, proof of damages is not an element of a claim \nfor breach of contract.” Crescent Univ. City Venture, LLC v. AP Atl., Inc., 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 46, at *127 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 8, 2019) (citation omitted). Rather, “in a suit \nfor damages for breach of contract, proof of the breach would entitle the plaintiff to \nnominal damages at least.” Delta Envtl. Consultants, Inc. v. Wysong & Miles Co., 132 \nN.C. App. 160, 172 (1999) (citation and quotation marks omitted). On that basis, our \nCourt of Appeals has stressed that it would be error to enter summary judgment \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nbased on a failure to offer evidence of damages. See Hodges v. Young, 2011 N.C. App. \nLEXIS 370, at *6 (2011) (unpublished). \n90. Plaintiffs contend that “Defendants cannot show that they have been \ndamaged in any respect by these purported breaches of contract or fiduciary duty[,]” \nand as a result, Plaintiffs are “entitled to an order prohibiting Defendants from \nrecovering actual damages for the purported breaches[.]” (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 9.) \n91. Defendants argue in response that “Plaintiffs offer no support whatsoever \nfor th[is] request–no citation to any materials in the record, and no legal argument or \nauthority.” (Defs.’ Br. Opp. 9.) Additionally, Defendants offer that they are “under no \nobligation to prove their damages at this juncture,” and even if they were, “the nature \nof Plaintiffs’ misconduct supports claims for substantive damages.” (Defs.’ Br. Opp. \n10.) \n92. The Court agrees with Defendants.  Without a citation to relevant legal \nauthority, and with many facts remaining in dispute as to damages allegedly \nsustained by Defendants, the Court is not inclined to declare that Defendants’ \ndamages be limited to nominal damages. \n93. Therefore, Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Plaintiffs’ request for \na declaration that Defendants’ damages related to their claims for breach of contract \nand breach of fiduciary duty are limited to only nominal damages. \n2. Defendants’ Motion \n \n94. Defendants seek summary judgment on four claims related to the contracts \nat issue and conduct related thereto: (1) Count Three for breach of contract; \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n(2) Counts Four and Five for breach of fiduciary duty and negligence; and \n(3) Counterclaim One for breach of contract related to the promissory notes. The \nCourt addresses each in turn. \na. Count Three: Breach of Contract \n \n95. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, apart from New York AD, have breached \nthe following contracts: (1) the MIPA between BioGas Corp. and Leyline; (2) the DSA \nbetween Plaintiffs and Leyline, Windstar, San Diego I, San Diego II, and Vicomte; \n(3) the Indemnification Agreement between Plaintiffs and Leyline, Windstar, San \nDiego I, San Diego II, and Vicomte; (4) the Investment Agreement between Lakeside \nand San Diego I; and (5) the Investment Agreement between Lakeside and Windstar. \n(J.A. 18–19 at ¶¶ 138–42, 146.) \n96. As an initial matter, there are several contracts that the Court finds are not \nsubject to any genuine issue of material fact as it relates to any alleged breaches \nthereof. \n97. First, as to (1) the DSA between BioGas Corp. and Leyline, 3 (2) the \nIndemnification Agreement, (3) the Investment Agreement between Lakeside and \nSan Diego I, 4 and (4) the Investment Agreement entered into by Lakeside and \nWindstar, there is no evidence offered by Plaintiffs, including any argument in their \n \n \n \n3 Although the DSA was alleged to have been between all Plaintiffs and Defendants Leyline, \nWindstar, San Diego I, San Diego II, and Vicotme, (J.A. 18 at ¶ 139), upon review of the DSA, \nthe only parties to the DSA are BioGas Corp. and Leyline. \n \n4 The Investment Agreement between Lakeside and San Diego  I was not made a part of the \nrecord in this case, such that the Court cannot review the terms and provisions therein. \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nbrief opposing Defendants’ Motion or oral argument at the Hearing, that any breach \nof these agreements by Defendants occurred. \n98. As a result, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to Count Three to \nthe extent Count Three is based on the following contracts: (1) the DSA; (2) the \nIndemnification Agreement; (3) the Investment Agreement between Lakeside and \nSan Diego I; and (4) the Investment Agreement between Lakeside and Windstar; and \nCount Three is DISMISSED as to those contracts. \n99. As the MIPA is the only contract left in dispute relating to Count Three, \nand the MIPA is an agreement between two parties —BioGas Corp. and Leyline — \nDefendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to Count Three to the extent Count \nThree was asserted against any Defendant other than Leyline. \n100. The Court’s analysis is thus narrowed to the alleged breaches by Leyline of \nthe MIPA. \n101. “The elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) existence of a valid \ncontract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.” Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, \n26 (2000) (citation omitted).  “Courts may enter summary judgment in contract \ndisputes because they have the power to interpret the terms of contracts.” McKinnon \nv. CV Indus., 213 N.C. App. 328, 333 (2011). If the terms to be interpreted “are plain \nand unambiguous, there is no room for construction [and] [t]he contract is to be \ninterpreted as written.” Jones v. Casstevens, 222 N.C. 411, 413 (1942); see e.g., Walton \nv. City of Raleigh , 342 N.C. 879, 881 (1996) (“If the plain language of a contract is \nclear, the intention of the parties is inferred from the words of the contract.”). \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n102. Plaintiffs allege that Leyline breached the MIPA by \na. Failing to mitigate its damages; \nb. Engaging in transactions that did not benefit Plaintiffs or \nDefendants; \nc. Refusing to engage in transactions that would have been for the \nbenefit of Plaintiffs and Defendants; \nd. Failing to maximize the value of the Tillamook and Lakeside \nProjects; \ne. Failing to inform Plaintiffs of any change in conditions of the \nTillamook and Lakeside Projects; and \nf. Breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. \n(J.A. 19 at ¶¶ 144–46.) The Court addresses each alleged breach in turn. \n103. As to the alleged breach of the MIPA by Leyline for “failing to mitigate \ndamages,” (J.A. 19 at ¶  146.a.), the failure to mitigate damages is not a breach of \ncontract, but rather an affirmative defense the breaching party may raise —and in \nthis case, has raised —after a breach has occurred.  As such, Defendants’ Motion is \nGRANTED in part as to Count Three to the extent it seeks summary judgment on \nthe alleged breach for failing to mitigate damages, and Count Three is DISMISSED \nto that extent. \n104. Next, as to the alleged breaches of the MIPA for engaging or refusing to \nengage in transactions that the breaching party believes would or would not benefit \nthe company, (see J.A. 19 at ¶¶ 146.b.–c.), the Court finds that these are not grounds \nfor a breach of contract in this case.  Upon review of the MIPA, there is no express \nobligation bestowed upon Leyline to engage, or disengage, in transactions based on \nany proposed benefit, or detriment, to any party.  Likewise, there was no express \nobligation of Leyline to “maximize the value” of either the Tillamook Project or the \nLakeside Project, (see J.A. 19 at ¶ 146.e.). As such, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nin part as to Count Three to the extent it seeks summary judgment as to the alleged \nbreaches of the MIPA for engaging or refusing to engage in transactions that the \nbreaching party believes would or would not benefit the company, or for failing to \nmaximize the value of the Tillamook and Lakeside Pr ojects, and Count Three is \nDISMISSED as to those alleged breaches. \n105. Next, Plaintiffs assert that Leyline “[f]ail[ed] to inform Plaintiffs of any \nchange in conditions of the Tillamook and Lakeside Projects.”  (J.A. 19 at ¶  146.b.) \nUpon review of the MIPA, it appears the only express provision relating to this \nalleged breach is that “[u]ntil such time as Buyer has paid Seller the entire Purchase \nPrice, Buyer agrees to keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of the \ndevelopment and construction of the System[,]” (J.A. 373 at § 5.6). \n106. However, upon review of the record before the Court, there has been no \nevidence presented which tends to show that Leyline has failed to comply with any \ninformation requests or obligations pursuant to the MIPA.  While Plaintiffs contend \nthey have “provided ample evidence regarding the unreasonableness of Leyline’s \nactions after it took over the Tillamook Project[,]” (Pls.’ Br. Opp. 18), there was no \nexpress provision within the MIPA that governed the reasonableness of how Leyline \nwould oversee the Tillamook Project. \n107. As such, Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to Count Three based \non Leyline’s alleged failure to inform Plaintiffs of any change in conditions of the \nTillamook and Lakeside Projects; and Count Three is DISMISSED as to that alleged \nbreach. \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n108. Finally, as the Court has previously stated, “[i]n every contract, there is an \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party will do anything \nwhich injures the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.” Bicycle \nTransit Auth., 314 N.C. at 228. \n109. On this point, Plaintiffs contend they have “provided ample evidence \nregarding the unreasonableness of Leyline’s actions after it took over the Tillamook \nProject[,]” as the MIPA “required [  ] Leyline to act in good faith in completing the \nrefurbishment, restart, and RNG conversion of the Tillamook Project.” (Pls.’ Br. Opp. \n18.) Additionally, Plaintiffs argue Defendants could have accepted Plaintiffs’ offer to \nbuy the Tillamook Project, which in turn would settle all outstanding amounts due \nunder the promissory notes, and Plaintiffs stood to receive a portion of proceeds from \nany sale of the Tillamook Project. (Pls.’ Br. Opp. 8.) Specifically, the MIPA provided \nthat the purchase price that Leyline owed to Plaintiffs included: \na. Ten Thousand US Dollars (US $10,000) (the “Closing Payment”), \nplus \nb. an amount not to exceed Two Million and 00/100 Dollars \n(“Contingent Purchase Payment”), provided such Contingent \nPurchase Payment shall only be payable from Net Cash available \nfollowing any payments that must first be paid from Net Cash \npursuant to the DSA, plus \nc. 30% of any remaining Net Cash, if and only if, all amounts \npayable under the DSA and full amount of the Contingent \nPurchase Payment have been paid (“Excess Contingent \nPayment”). \n(J.A. 360 at § 2.1(a).) Based on the evidence before the Court, a jury could conclude \nthat Leyline failed to meaningfully investigate Plaintiffs’ offer to purchase the \nTillamook Project for a seemingly sufficient sum of money. As a result, there is a \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether Leyline breached the implied covenant \nof good faith and fair dealing contained within the MIPA related to this conduct. As \nsuch, whether Defendants’ decision to not pursue Plaintiffs’ offer to purchase the \nTillamook Project for $15,000,000.00 was reasonable is a question of fact for a jury to \ndecide. \n110. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Count Three to the \nextent it relates to Plaintiffs’ allegations that Leyline breached the implied covenant \nof good faith and fair dealing related to the MIPA. \nb. Counts Four & Five: Breach of Fiduciary Duty and \nNegligence \n111. Lastly, Defendants seek summary judgment as to Counts Four and Five for \nbreach of fiduciary duty and negligence, arguing those claims are barred by the \neconomic loss rule. (Defs. Br. Supp. 15.) \n112. Plaintiffs allege that “[a]s a result of the partnership type relationship \nbetween the [p]arties, and the taking over of the Tillamook Project and the Lakeside \nProject by Defendants,” the Defendants, excluding New York AD, owed fiduciary \nduties to the Plaintiffs. (J.A. 19–20 at ¶ 151.) Plaintiffs assert that this duty requires \nthat Defendants “discharge their duties in good faith, with the care an ordinary \nprudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in \nthe manner Defendants reasonably believe to be in the best interests of both Plaintiffs \nand Defendants.” (J.A. 20 at ¶  152.) As a result, Plaintiffs allege Defendants have \n“breached their fiduciary duties[,]” (J.A. 20 at ¶ 154), or, in the alternative, “breached \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \ntheir duty of care to Plaintiffs” such that their claim for negligence should be tried by \na jury, (J.A. 21 at ¶ 159). \n113. A breach of fiduciary duty requires the existence of a fiduciary relationship. \nDalton v. Camp , 353 N.C. 647, 651 (2001).  “[A] fiduciary relationship is generally \ndescribed as arising when there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in \nequity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the \ninterests of the one reposing confidence.”  Dallaire, 367 N.C. 363, 367 (2014) \n(quotation marks omitted). Domination and influence are an essential component of \nany fiduciary relationship. Dalton, 353 N.C. at 652.  “The standard for finding a de \nfacto fiduciary relationship is a demanding one: ‘Only when one party figuratively \nholds all the cards —all the financial power or technical information, for example — \nhave North Carolina courts found that the special circumstance of a fiduciary \nrelationship has arisen.’ ” Lockerman v. S. River Elec. Membership Corp ., 250 N.C. \nApp. 631, 636 (2016) (quoting S.N.R. Mgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC, 189 \nN.C. App. 601, 613 (2008)). \n \n114. Similarly, a claim for negligence requires that Plaintiffs must show “the \nexistence of a legal duty or standard of care owed to the plaintiff by the defendant, \nbreach of that duty, and a causal relationship between the breach of duty and certain \nactual injury or loss sustained by the plaintiff.”  Sterner v. Penn, 159 N.C. App. 626, \n630 (2003) (quotation marks omitted). A party may bring a negligence claim based \non conduct that is also alleged to be a breach of contract where the plaintiff can \n“identify a duty owed by the defendant separate and distinct from any duty owed \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nunder a contract.” Forest2Market, Inc. v. Arcogent, Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 3, at **8 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 5, 2016) (quotation marks omitted); see also Rountree v. Chowan \nCnty., 252 N.C. App. 155, 160 (2017) (“[A] viable tort action must be grounded on a \nviolation of a duty imposed by operation of law, and the right invaded must be one \nthat the law provides without regard to the contractual relationship of the parties.” \n(emphasis omitted)). \n115. Defendants seek summary judgment as to Counts Four and Five, arguing \nthat the economic loss rule bars the claims at hand, as the “injury alleged by BioGas \nCorp., and damages it seeks to recover for [their] breach of fiduciary duty and \nnegligence claims, are created and available only under the earnout provisions of the \n[MIPA].” (Defs.’ Br. Supp. 15.) \n116. “The economic loss rule, as it has developed in North Carolina, generally \nbars recovery in tort for damages arising out of a breach of contract[.]” Rountree, 252 \nN.C. App. at 159 (2017). A claimant may not maintain a tort action “against a party \nto a contract who simply fails to properly perform the terms of the contract, even if \nthat failure to perform was due to the negligent or intentional conduct of that party, \nwhen the injury resulting from the breach is damage to the subject matter of the \ncontract.” Lord v. Customized Consulting Specialty, Inc. , 182  N.C. App. 635, 639 \n(2007). “To state a viable claim in tort for conduct that is also alleged to be a breach \nof contract, ‘a plaintiff must also allege a duty owed to him by the defendant separate \nand distinct from any duty owed under a contract.’ ”  Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc. v. \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nRogers, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 42, at **48 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 3, 2011) (quoting Kelly \nv. Georgia-Pacific LLC, 671 F. Supp. 2d 785, 791 (E.D.N.C. 2009)). \n \n117. Plaintiffs concede that “[t]o the extent it is determined that the terms of the \nMIPA, express or implied, required Leyline to complete the refurbishment, restart, \nand RNG conversion of the Tillamook Project[,]” then Plaintiffs “agree that BioGas \nCorp.’s tort claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against Leyline related \nto Tillamook would be barred by the economic loss rule.” (Pls.’ Br. Opp. 19 (emphasis \nadded).) \n118. As the Court has held that (1) Plaintiffs’ Count Three for breach of contract \nsurvives as to the alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nrelated to Leyline and its conduct pursuant to the MIPA, and (2) the alleged duty \nowed to Plaintiffs by Leyline arises from the MIPA, it appears that the tort claims \nbrought by Plaintiffs —Counts Four and Five —cannot survive. See, e.g., Wilkins v. \nWachovia Corp., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30896, at *6 (E.D.N.C. Mar. 24, 2011) \n(applying economic loss rule to bar breach of fiduciary duty claims that arose “out of \nthe duties in the .  . . agreement and relate to contract performance”); Haigh v. \nSuperior Ins. Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 100, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 24, 2017) (dismissing breach of fiduciary duty claim where alleged wrongdoing \nwas “a result of the parties’ contractual relationship, not as a result of a fiduciary \nrelationship” and would be “better resolved through contract principles, rather than \ngeneral principles of fiduciary relationships”). \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n119. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion is hereby GRANTED in part as to Count \nFour for breach of fiduciary duty and Count Five for negligence. \nc. Counterclaim One: Breach of Contract as to Promissory \nNotes \n120. Defendants allege valid promissory notes were entered into between \nDefendants, BioGas Corp., and their affiliates. (J.A. 41–46.) Further, Defendants \nallege that these notes have not been repaid, (J.A. 42–46 at ¶¶ 9, 15, 21, 24, 28, \n32, 36), and BioGas Corp. and Shareef “do not dispute that the promissory notes are \nin default[,]” (Pls.’ Br. Opp. 23). \n121. As a result, the Court GRANTS in part Defendants’ Motion as to \nCounterclaim One for breach of contract related to the promissory notes as it pertains \nto Plaintiffs’ liability.  This includes liability as to Shareef, as Shareef personally \nguaranteed certain of those promissory notes. \n122. However, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants’ collection of the promissory \nnotes should be denied “based on (i) a failure to mitigate affirmative defense, and \n(ii) a set off defense.” (Pls.’ Br. Opp. 23.) \n \n123. As to Defendants’ duty to mitigate, Plaintiffs contend that because \nDefendants are “seeking to collect from Plaintiff[s] related to promissory notes \nentered related to” the Tillamook and Lakeside Projects, when they “took over the \nproject[s], they had an obligation to mitigate their damages.” (Pls.’ Br. Opp. 24.) \n124. Under North Carolina law, “the burden is on the breaching party to prove \nthat the nonbreaching party failed to exercise reasonable diligence to minimize the \nloss.” Isbey v. Crews, 55 N.C. App. 47, 51 (1981). In addition, a nonbreaching party \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \n“need not pursue a particular corrective measure if a reasonable person would \nconclude the measure was imprudent, impractical, or would likely be unsuccessful.” \nSmith v. Childs, 112 N.C. App. 672, 683 (1993). \n125. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to identify “any specific \nevidence tending to show a breach of the duty to mitigate,” and further, the damages \nin this case, that is, the failure to remit payment to Defendants for the promissory \nnotes, “are not a downstream result of the breach–they are the breach.” (Defs.’ Reply \nBr. Supp. Defs.’ Mot. 11.) \n126. Given conflicting evidence as to the nature of the promissory notes, the \nnumerous extensions and amendments allowed by Leyline as to each promissory \nnote, and the contemplated set -off defense as to the proposed purchase of the \nTillamook Project—which Plaintiffs contend they were prepared to purchase for \n$15,000,000.00—the Court concludes that a genuine issue of material fact exists \nrequiring trial as to whether Defendants mitigated their damages and whether a set- \noff defense is available to Plaintiffs related to the promissory notes. \n127. As a result, Defendants’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Counterclaim One \nas to damages, as the trier of fact must determine whether Defendants sufficiently \nmitigated their damages, or if there is a set-off to be had under these circumstances. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n128. THEREFORE, the Plaintiffs’ Motion is hereby GRANTED in part and \n \nDENIED in part as follows: \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \na. Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Plaintiffs’ request for a \ndeclaration that Defendants have no legal interest in the Monroe Project. \nb. Plaintiffs’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to Plaintiffs’ request for a \ndeclaration that the (1) MIPA; (2) DSA; and (3) Investment Agreements \nbetween both (a) Lakeside and San Diego I and (b) Lakeside and Windstar, \nas a matter of law, contain an implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing. However, Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED in part to the extent it \nseeks a declaration that Defendants owed Plaintiffs an implied duty of good \nfaith and fair dealing as to the promissory notes and guaranty agreements, \ngiven that no relief can be given to Plaintiffs in this action based on these \ncontracts. \nc. Plaintiffs’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Plaintiffs’ request for a \ndeclaration that Defendants’ damages related to their claims for breach of \ncontract and breach of fiduciary duty are limited to only nominal damages. \nd. Plaintiffs’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to Plaintiffs’ request for a \ndeclaration that Defendants had a duty to mitigate their damages related \nto the promissory notes. \n129. Further, Defendants’ Motion is hereby GRANTED in part and DENIED \nin part as follows: \na. Defendants’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Count One for \ndeclaratory judgment that Defendants have no legal interest in the Monroe \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nProject. Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to the remaining ten \ntopics on which Plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment. \nb. Defendants’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Count Two for a \npermanent injunction. \nc. Defendants’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Counterclaim Two for \nbreach of contract based on Step-In Rights. \nd. Defendants’ Motion is DENIED in part as to Count Three to the \nextent it relates to Plaintiffs’ allegations that Leyline breached the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing related to the MIPA. \ne. Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to Counterclaim One as \nto Plaintiffs’ liability. However, Defendants’ Motion is DENIED in part as \nto Counterclaim One as to damages, as the trier of fact must determine \nwhether Defendants sufficiently mitigated their damages, or if there is a \nset-off to be had under these circumstances. \nf. Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED in part as to Count Four for \nbreach of fiduciary duty and Count Five for negligence. \n130. For the avoidance of doubt, the following claims will proceed to trial in this \n \nmatter:  \n \na. Plaintiffs’ Count One for declaratory judgment as to whether Biogas \nDevelopment has any legal interest in the Monroe Project; \nb. Plaintiffs’ Count Two for permanent injunction against all \nDefendants; \n \n   BioGas Corp. v. NC BioGas Dev., LLC, 2024 NCBC 75. \n \nc. Plaintiffs’ Count Three for breach of contract against Leyline related \nto the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing contained within the \nMIPA; \nd. Defendants’ Counterclaim One for breach of contract against BioGas \nCorp. and Shareef, as guarantor, as to the damages incurred through the \nbreach of the promissory notes; \ne. Defendants’ Counterclaim Two for breach of contract against BioGas \nCorp. as to the Step-In Rights for the Monroe Project; \nf. Defendants’ Counterclaim Three for breach of contract against \nBioGas Corp. and Shareef as to information rights; and \ng. Defendants’ Counterclaim Four for breach of fiduciary duty against \nBioGas Corp. \nSO ORDERED, this the 26th day of November, 2024. \n \n \n \n/s/ Michael L. Robinson \nMichael L.
