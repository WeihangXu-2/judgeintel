Both Plaintiff and Defendants brought claims for unfair or deceptive trade \npractices pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 75 -1.1, et. seq .  While all factual issues were \nsubmitted to the jury, “it is a question of law for the court as to whether [the] proven \nfacts constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice.”  United Lab s., Inc. v. \nKuykendall (Kuykendall I), 322 N.C. 643, 664, 370 S.E.2d 375, 389 (1988) (citation \nomitted).  Accordingly, whether the proven conduct of either Plaintiff or Defendants \nwas unfair or deceptive is an issue appropriate for the Court to determine in this \nFinal Judgment. \n5. The parties stipulated on the record that, during all relevant times, the \nparties’ conduct was “in or affecting commerce.”  Therefore, the sole question before \nthe Court is whether any party’s conduct was unfair or deceptive.  An act or practice \nis considered unfair when “it offends established public policy as well as when the \npractice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious \n \n \nto consumers.”  Marshall v. Miller, 302 N.C. 539, 548, 276 S.E.2d 397, 403  (1981).  \nAn act or practice is deceptive when it has the tendency to deceive.  Id.   \n6. Unfairness and deception, thus, are gauged by consideration of the effect \nof the conduct  on the marketplace.  Wilder v. Squires, 68 N.C. App. 310, 316, 315 \nS.E.2d 63, 66 (1984).  Therefore, “it follows that the intent of the actor is irrelevant; \ngood faith is equally irrelevant.  What is relevant is the effect of the actor’s conduct \non the consuming public.”  Id.; see also Edwards v. West, 128 N.C. App. 570, 575, 495 \nS.E.2d 920, 924 (1998) (“[D]eliberate acts of deceit or bad faith do not have to be \nshown.  Instead, [a] plaintiff[ ] must demonstrate the act possessed the tendency or \ncapacity to mislead,  or created the likelihood of deception.”  (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted)). \n7. If proven conduct  is determined to be unfair or  deceptive pursuant to \nsection 75 -1.1, “and if damages ar e assessed [,] in such case judgment shall be \nrendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for treble the amount \nfixed by the verdict.”  N.C.G.S. § 75-16.  Further, in the Court’s discretion, attorneys’ \nfees may be awarded to the prevailing party if “[t]he party charged with the violation \nhas willfully engaged in the act or practice, and there was an unwarranted refusal \nby such party to fully resolve the matter which constitutes the basis of such suit[.]”  \nId. § 75-16.1.   \n8. Following the jury’ s return of the verdict, the Court  entered a Briefing \nOrder Regarding Post -Trial Matters, (ECF No. 78),  giving both Plaintiff and \nDefendants an opportunity to file briefs in further support of their respective UTDP \nclaims and motions for award of attorneys’ fees and set a deadline of March 4, 2020 \n \n \nfor any submissions in this regard.    Thereafter, on March 4, 2020, Defendants filed \nDefendants’ Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Sixth Counterclaim for Unfair \nand Deceptive Trade Practices, (ECF No. 79), Defendants’ Motion for Attorney’s \nFees, (ECF No. 80), and Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of Motion for \nAttorney’s Fees, (ECF No. 81).  Defendants did not timely submit any affidavits or \nother evidence in support of their Motion for Attorney’s Fees.  Rather, nine days \nlater, on March 13, 2020, Defendants submitted two affidavits: one from Mr. \nChristopher P. Gelwicks, (ECF No. 84), and one from Mr. Kevin M. Sisson, (ECF No. \n84).   \n9. On March 4, 2020, Plaintiff filed Plaintiffs’  [sic] Motion to Tax Costs and \nAttorneys’ Fees, (ECF No. 82), and Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ \n[sic] Motion to Tax Costs and Attorney’s Fees, (ECF No. 83).  Plaintiff filed as Exhibit \nA to its Motion to Tax Costs and Attorney’s Fees the Affidavit of Michael K. Elliot.  \n(See ECF No. 83.)  Plaintiff did not file a brief in further support of its UDTP claim.  \n10. The Court first addresses whether the parties have demonstrated that the \nopposing side engaged in unfair or deceptive acts  consistent with section 75-1.1.  A \nnumber of the issues submitted to the jury regarding other substantive claims \npotentially implicate section 75 -1.1.  In addition, at the request of the respective \nparties, the Court submitted to the jury a number of issues requesting that the jury \ndetermine whether the opposing part y or part ies had engaged in specific conduct \nthat was claimed to be unfair or deceptive.  For purposes of determining whether \nany conduct found by the jury was unfair or deceptive, the Court has considered each \nof the issues where the jury found some misconduct resulting in damage. \n \n \n11.  First, as to Plaintiff’s UDTP claim against Sisson and LNSAR, in answer \nto Issue No. 35, the jury found that Sisson took advantage of a position of trust and \nconfidence3 with Plaintiff by taking hard copies or electronically stored version(s) of \nPlaintiff’s customer list, by operating Denver Defense (the business) under LNSAR’s \nbank account, and by commingling Plaintiff ’s operating finances with LNSAR’s \nfunds.  The Court concludes that these acts are “ unfair” for purposes of section 75 -\n1.1.  By commingling the funds of Plaintiff’s with that of a competing business, \nSisson was acting in an unethical manner, and confusing the public as to with whom \nPlaintiff’s customers were engaging in business—Plaintiff or LNSAR.  Accordingly, \nthe Court finds that Sisson’s conduct was unfair and that damages awarded in this \nregard should be trebled.  In answer to Issue No. 36, the jury found that the amount \nof damages Plaintiff was entitled to recover from Sisson was one dollar ($1.00).  \nAccordingly, the damages Plaintiff is entitled to recover from Sisson pursuant to \nsection 75-16 is three dollars ($3. 00).\n4  In answer to Issue No. 37, the jury did not \nfind that Sisson was acting as an agent of LNSAR at the time he engaged in the \nconduct in question.  Accordingly, Plaintiff has not proven its UDTP claim against \nLNSAR and is not entitled to recover from that defendant.    \n                                                           \n3 In answer to Issue No. 6, t he jury found that Sisson owed Plaintiff a fiduciary duty, but \nthat there was no breach of that duty.  Accordingly, based on the jury verdict, these findings \ndo not support Plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty or constructive fraud claims.   \n4 “Although certain [causes of action], standing alone, may evoke the action, a claim for \nunfair and deceptive trade practices pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1 is an independent claim \nthat stands alone as a distinct action[.]”  Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head & Engquist Equip.,  \nL.L.C., 2003 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *139 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 2, 2003) . Accordingly, Plaintiff \ncan succeed on its UDTP claim even if the jury returned a  verdict against it on all other \nclaims.    \n \n \n12. As to Sisson’s and LNSAR’s UDTP claims against Plaintiff, i n answer to \nIssue Nos. 21 and 22, the jury found that Plaintiff converted property belonging to \nLNSAR and that LNSAR was entitled to recover $18,500 for this conduct.  While the \nconversion of property can be an unfair or deceptive act, see, e.g., Faucette v. 6303 \nCarmel Rd., LLC, 242 N.C. App. 267, 276, 775 S.E.2d 316, 323 (2015) , it is not per \nse unfair or deceptive.5   \n13. The Court determines that Plaintiff’s conversion of LNSAR’s property was \nnot unfair or deceptive.  Upon the record as a whole, including the evidence \npresented by Defenda nts regarding the handling by Plaintiff of Defendant’s \nproperty, the Court concludes that Plaintiff did not act in any way that was immoral, \nunethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers, nor did \nPlaintiff’s acts in this rega rd have the tendency or capacity to mislead.  The jury’s \nfinding that Sisson operated Denver Defense (the business) under LNSAR’s bank \naccount and commingled Plaintiff’ operating finances with LNSAR’s funds indicates \nthat who owned what guns at relevant periods was subject to uncertainty, and does \n                                                           \n5 The Court notes that the jury, in answer to Issue No. 31, found that Plaintiff’s conversion \nof LNSAR’s property was “fraudulent, willful, or wanton” for purposes of punitive damages.  \nNotwithstanding this finding, the jury declined —in its discretion —to award punitive \ndamages regarding LNSAR’s conversion counterclaim.  While a plaintiff (or, in this case, a \ncounterclaimant) is permitted to recover punitive damages and damages stemming from a \nUDTP claim regarding the same conduct, the plaintiff is not entitled to both awards and \nmust choose between the two if both are awarded.  Compton v. Kirby , 157 N.C. App. 1, 21, \n577 S.E.2d 905, 918 (2003).  In this case, the jury elected not to award LNSAR any punitive \ndamages, and therefore, if the Court determines that Plaintiff’s conversion of LNSAR \nproperty was unfair or deceptive under section 75-1.1, then LNSAR would be entitled to an \naward pursuant to section 75 -16.  A finding by the jury that Plaintiff’s conduct was \n“fraudulent, willful, or wanton” to warrant the imposition, in its discretion, of punitive \ndamages bears no consideration on the Court’s decision to find (or not find) that same \nconduct unfair or de ceptive.  See Estate of Hurst v. Moorehead I, LLC , 228 N.C. A pp. 571, \n585, 748 S.E.2d 568, 578 (2013) (“[T]he issues of fraud and punitive damages are separate \nand distinct claims from the issue of unfair and deceptive trade practices.”). \n  \n \n \nnot, in the Court’s discretion, support the conclusion that Plaintiff acted unfairly or \ndeceptively by selling certain guns left in its store after the deterioration of the \nparties’ business relationship.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that LNSAR is not \nentitled to recover on its UDTP claim against Plaintiff in this regard.  \n14. In answer to Issue Nos. 25 and 26, the jury found that Plaintiff negligently \nmisrepresented information to Sisson regarding the sale of Denver Defense and that, \nfor this conduct, Sisson was entitled to recover $3,000 from Plaintiff.   Upon the \nrecord as a whole, the Court concludes that Plaintiff acted in a way that had the \ncapacity to mislead, or created the likelihood of deception, even if not intentional, by \nengaging in this conduct and Plaintiff’s conduct, thus, was “deceptive” for purposes \nof section 75-1.1.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Sisson is entitled to recover \non his UDTP claim against Plaintiff in this regard and is entitled to treble damages.  \nAccordingly, the damages Sisson is entitled to recover from  Plaintiff pursuant to \nsection 75-16 is $9,000.000.   \n15. In answer to Issue No. 38, the jury found that Plaintiff provided \nmisleading inventory numbers to Sisson in order to entic e him to enter into the \nManagement Agreement.  The jury also found that Plaintiff failed to notify Sisson \nprior to signing the Management Agreement that: (a) Plaintiff was in default on its \nbank loans  (Issue No. 40); (b) Plaintiff had not paid several vendors and these \nvendors would no longer ship to Plaintiff  (Issue No. 41); and that  (c) Plaintiff’s \nshareholders had contributed in excess of $207,000 into Plaintiff in 2017 to keep the \nbusiness alive (Issue No. 42).  As to the conduct proven in Issue Nos. 38, 40, 41, and \n42, the jury found that Sisson was entitled to recover $4.50 from Plaintiff.  Upon the \n \n \nrecord as a whole, the Court concludes that the jury’s finding in answer to Issue No. \n38 that Plaintiff provided misleading inventory numbers to Sisson in order to entice \nhim to enter into the Management Agreement had the capacity to deceive and \ntherefore was “deceptive” for purposes of section 75 -1.1.  The Court concludes, \nhowever, that Plaintiff’s failure to disclose all of Plaintiff’s business struggles, as set \nforth in Issue Nos. 40, 41, and 42, were neither unfair nor deceptive for purposes of \nsection 75-1.1.    In answer to Issue No. 43, the jury found Defendants were entitled \nto $4.50 for the conduct set forth in Iss ue No. 38.  Accordingly, the damages Sisson \nis entitled to recover from  Plaintiff pursuant to section 75 -16 is $13.50 for this \nconduct.   \n16. In sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has proven its UDTP claim \nagainst Sisson and is entitled to trebled damages of three dollars ($3.00) for Sisson’s \nunfair conduct.  Further, Sisson has proven his UDTP claim against Plaintiff and is \nentitled to trebled damages of $9,013.50.  LNSAR, however, has not proven its UDTP \nclaim against Plaintiff and therefore LNSAR is not  entitled to recover for its  \ncounterclaim in this regard, nor is LNSAR entitled to attorneys’ fees arising from \npursing its UDTP counterclaim.   \n17. The Court next addresses whether either Plaintiff or Sisson is entitled to \ntheir attorneys’ fees for their respective UDTP claims pursuant to section 75 -16.1.  \nUnder this statutory provision, a “plaintiff [or counterclaimant] must also show [in \naddition to a violation of section 75 -1.1] that there was an unwarranted refusal by \nthe defendant to fully resolve the matter which constitutes the basis of the suit .”  \nUnited Labs., Inc. v. Kuykendall (Kuykendall II), 335 N.C. 183, 190, 437 S.E.2d 374, \n \n \n378 (1993).  The Court does not believe either side was unwarranted in refusing to \nresolve this matter.  In fact, both si des presented evidence in support of their \npositions, and ultimately the parties’ underlying conduct required the jury to resolve \ndisputed issues of material fact that could have supported, or refuted, Plaintiff’s and \nSisson’s conduct that ultimately suppo rted the parties’ respective UDTP claim s.  \nAccordingly, the Court, in its discretion, declines to award attorneys’ fees to Plaintiff \nor Sisson pursuant to section 75-16.1.   \n18. Finally, the Court turns to Defendants’ argument that they are entitled to \nattorneys’ fees because Paragraph 18 of the Management Agreement  between \n“Denver Defense/ Bayport Holdings [,]” on the one hand, and Sisson, on the other \nhand, (Ex. B to Compl., ECF No. 3), contains a “reciprocal attorney’s fees provision” \nwhich states that if the Management Agreement “needs to be enforced[,] the winning \nparty is entitled to receive costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.”  In support of their \nposition, Defendants cite to N.C.G.S. § 6 -21.6(c), which provides that if “a business \ncontract governed by t he laws of this State contains a reciprocal attorneys’ fees \nprovision, the court or arbitrator in any suit, action, proceeding, or arbitration \ninvolving the business contract may award reasonable attorneys’ fees in accordance \nwith the terms of the business contract.”   \n19. In response to this argument, Plaintiff points to the definition of “business \ncontract” under section 6 -21.6(a)(1), which expressly excludes an “employment \ncontract.”  An “employment contract is defined in section 6-21.6(a)(3) as “[a] contract \nbetween an individual and another party to provide personal services by that \nindividual to the other party, whether the relationship is in the nature of employee-\n \n \nemployer or principal-independent contractor.”  Plaintiff also contends that, based \non the parties’ stipulations and the evidence submitted at trial, the Management \nAgreement was an agreement between  Plaintiff and Sisson whereby Sisson would \nmanage Plaintiff’s business.   \n20. The Court concludes that paragraph 18 of the Management Agreement \ndoes not entitle either Sisson or LNSAR to payment of any or all of their attorneys’ \nfees.  First, at best, the contract is ambiguous as to whether it is a business contract \nor an employment contract.  Where an ambiguity exists, “the court is to construe the \nambiguity against the drafter[.]”  Sears Roebuck & Co. v. Avery, 163 N.C. App. 207, \n221, 593 S.E.2d 424, 434 (2004).  In this case, the parties stipulated that Sisson was \nthe drafter of the Management Agreement.  The Court, therefore, concludes that the \nManagement Agreement is an employment contract expressly excluded from section \n6-21.6.   \n21. Moreover, the Court concludes that even if the Management Agreement \nwas a “business contract,” the language of Paragraph 18 is unenforceable as written.  \nSection 6-21(b)(4) provides that a reciprocal attorneys’ fees provision is a provision \nin a \nwritten business contract by which each party  to the contract agrees      \n. . . upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the contract \nthat are made applicable to all parties, to pay or reimburse the other \nparties for attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by reason of any suit, \naction, proceeding, or arbitration involving the business contract.      \n \nId. § 6-21.6(b) (emphasis added).   \n \n22. Paragraph 18 does not set forth any terms or conditions regarding the \npayment or reimbursement for attorneys’ fees and expenses, nor does the provision \n \n \nexpressly incorporate the factors  set forth in 6 -21.6(c) to guide the Court in its \nanalysis.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that it cannot enforce the reciprocal \nattorney’s fees provision as drafted and Defendants are not entitled to attorneys’ \nfees on that basis. \n23. Lastly, Defendants’ Memorandum in Support of Motion for Attorney’s Fees \nwas not properly supported by affidavits setting forth the costs and fees incurred by \nDefendants in pursing their counterclaims.  As note d above, the Court gave the \nparties a deadline of March 4, 2020 to file their motions for attorneys’ fees.  While \nDefendants timely filed their motion, that motion was not accompanied by any \naffidavits from counsel.  Instead, nine  days after the deadline, Defendants’ counsel \nuntimely submitted two affidavits for the Court’s consideration.  Not only were these \nfilings late pursuant to an express order of this Court, but Rule 6(d) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[w]hen a motion i s supported by \naffidavit, the affidavit shall be served with the motion[.]”  Id.  § 1A -1, Rule 6(d).   \nDefendants failed to comply with both the Rules of Civil Procedure and an order of \nthis Court.  Accordingly, the Court, in its discretion, declines to cons ider the \naffidavits submitted in support of Defendants’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees and, \ntherefore, has no basis upon which to determine an award of attorneys’ fees.\n6        \n                                                           \n6 Even if the Court was disposed to consider the affidavits, and even if Paragraph 18 of the \nManagement Agreement otherwise provided a proper basis for an award of attorneys’ fees, \nthe Court concludes that the affidavits submitted fail to explain what portion of the work  \nperformed by counsel for Defendants related to Sisson’s enforcement of the Management \nAgreement as opposed to other issues involved .  The Court also notes that Defendants’ \ncounsel performed services for both Sisson and LNSAR but, as between them, only Sis son \nwas a party to the Management Agreement and only he would have arguably been entitled \nto recover attorneys’ fees.  \n \n \n24. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, based on the verdict of the jury and the \nCourt’s conclusions of law as set forth herein:  \nA.
