(“JT Russell”) began this lawsuit by suing Atlas \nJames Russell (“Jim”) —a shareholder, former officer, and former director—for \nself-dealing and other misconduct .  Jim denies JT Russell’s  allegations and  has \ncounterclaimed to dissolve the company .  He has also asserted derivative \ncounterclaims on the company’s behalf  against Robert E. Russell (“Bob”), Raymond \nRussell, and Tony W. Russell, all of whom are current or former officers and, as their \nnames suggest, members of Jim’s family. \n \n \n2. This opinion addresses two motions to dismiss Jim’s counterclaims, one by \nJT Russell and another by Bob, Raymond, and Tony.  For the following reasons, the \nCourt GRANTS in part and DENIES in part JT Russell’s motion  and GRANTS \nBob, Raymond, and Tony’s motion.1 \nTroutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP, by William C. Mayberry, \nDaniel Prichard, William J. Farley, and Jacquelyn Arnold, for Plaintiff \nJT Russell and Sons, Inc. \nEllis & Winters LLP, by Pamela S. Duffy and Tyler Jameson, for \nDefendant Atlas James Russell. \nFox Rothschild LLP, by Ashley Barton Chandler and Neale T. Johnson, \nfor Defendants The Tillery Tradition , Inc. and Mid -Eastern Asphalt, \nLLC. \nBell, Davis & Pitt, P.A. , by Edward B. Davis , for Counterclaim \nDefendants Robert E. Russell, Raymond Russell, and Tony W. Russell. \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion to dis miss.  The \nfollowing background assumes that the allegations of the amended counterclaims are \ntrue. \n4. JT Russell’s shareholders hail from two branches of the Russell family.  One \nbranch comprises Jim and his four siblings; together, they own fifty percent of the \ncompany.  The other branch comprises Jim’s uncle Bob  and cousins Raymond and \n \n1 Jim and his fellow defendants have also moved to dismiss some of JT Russell’s claims.  A \nseparate opinion addresses those motions. \n \n \nTony; they own the remaining fifty percent.  (See Am. Countercls. ¶¶ 1, 17, 19, ECF \nNo. 53.) \n5. According to Jim, th is equal division of ownership carries with it a shared \nexpectation that both branches of the Russell family will have employment privileges \nand a say in management.  So, for example, Jim served as secretary, treasurer, and \ndirector, and nearly all his siblings worked for JT Russell at one time or another.  \nLikewise, Bob was JT Russell’s president until Raymond succeeded him.  (See Am. \nCountercls. ¶¶ 18, 20–23.) \n6. But t he balance of power  shifted in  2018.  That February, the  board of \ndirectors dismissed Jim from his positions  as secretary and treasurer  and replaced \nhim with Tony’s daughter.  Then,  at a special meeting  in March, the shareholders \n(excluding Jim) voted to amend the bylaws to  increase the size of the board and to \nallow nonshareholders to serve on it .  Later, at another shareholder meeting in \nDecember, Raymond successfully moved to  expel Jim from the board and to fill the \nopen seats with his own stepbrother and  Tony’s daughter , neither of whom are \nshareholders.  Jim challenges the validity of  these actions, citing inadequate notice \nand other procedural irregularities, and alleges that Raymond and Tony’s takeover \nof the board  has upset the family’s settled power-sharing arrangement.  (See Am. \nCountercls. ¶¶ 24, 25, 31–34, 40.) \n7. Jim also alleges that Raymond and Tony —and their father, Bob —do not \nhave JT Russell’s best interests in mind.  Raymond and Tony  have supposedly \nmismanaged the company: slashing revenues, driving up expenses, and cancelling \n \n \nlucrative deals that Jim had struck before his ouster.  And they have allegedly used \nJT Russell’s resources to build and heat their homes, to pave their driveways, and for \nother personal purposes, while Bob similarly used JT Russell’s fuel, equipment, and \nemployees to operate his personal farm.  JT Russell’s other shareholders and directors \nnever approved these activities and weren’t aware of their extent, partly because they \nwere “falsely booked  to customer jobs.”   By contrast, Jim alleges that he  and his \nbranch of the family fastidiously and transparently documented their own uses of JT \nRussell’s resources for other business ventures.   (Am. Countercls. ¶¶ 6, 41, 42, 45, \n48–53, 56, 67, 71.) \n8. These disputes came to a head i n 2022, and the parties agreed to mediate  \ntheir differences in the hopes of avoiding litigation.  The mediation was unsuccessful.  \nJT Russell then began this action by suing Jim (along with two companies in which \nhe holds an interes t) for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unjust \nenrichment, and more .  (See ECF No. 3.)  Jim has denied those allegations  and \nasserted counterclaims against JT Russell for judicial dissolution , to remove \nRaymond and Tony as directors, and for an accounting of corporate assets that Bob, \nRaymond, and Tony have diverted for personal use.  Jim has also asserted derivative \nclaims on JT Russell’s behalf against Bob, Raymond, and Tony for breach of fiduciary \nduty, constructive fraud, conversion, and unjust enrichment. \n9. JT Russell and Bob, Raymond, and Tony have separately moved to dismiss \nmost of these counterclaims.   (See ECF Nos. 64, 68.)  The motions have been fully \n \n \nbriefed, and the Court held a hearing on 17 January 2024.  The motions are ripe for \nresolution. \nII. \nANALYSIS \n10. Taken together, the motions to dismiss challenge every counterclaim other \nthan the one to remove Raymond and Tony as directors of JT Russell.  The Court \nbegins with the parties’ arguments regarding the  derivative counterclaims before \nturning to the direct counterclaims.   \nA. Derivative Counterclaims \n11. JT Russell and Bob, Raymond, and Tony  challenge Jim’s derivative \ncounterclaims on several independent grounds.  The Court need not address them all.  \nJim’s failure to comply with the presuit demand requirement of N.C.G.S. § 55-7-42 is \ndispositive and necessitates dismissal of his derivative counterclaims. \n12. “No shareholder may commence a derivative proceeding ” without having \nfirst made a “written demand .  . . upon the corporation to take suitable action .”  \nN.C.G.S. §  55-7-42.  This demand requirement  allows the corporation, as the real \nparty in interest, “a chance to investigate the claim and, if it chooses, to vindicate its \nown rights before freeing its members to seek relief on its behalf.”  Al-Hassan v. \nSalloum, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 22, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 20, 2022)  (discussing \nanalogous demand requirement for derivative actions on behalf of LLCs).  Compliance \nis “necessary to confer standing on shareholders in a derivative action.”  Anderson v. \nSeascape at Holden Plantation, LLC, 241 N.C. App. 191, 203 (2015).  Thus, failure to \nmake a proper presuit demand deprives the plaintiff of standing and the trial court \n \n \nof jurisdiction.   See Town of Midland v. Harrell , 385 N.C. 365 , 371  (2023) (“If a \nplaintiff does not have standing to assert a claim for relief, the trial court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction over the claim.”). \n13. Jim alleges that he made a written demand upon JT Russell in October 2022 \n“as part of an agreed process on excha nging claims” to facilitate  a voluntary \nmediation.  (Am. Countercls. ¶  73.)  But t hat document, which is attached to his \npleading,2 isn’t styled as a demand and doesn’t demand any action by JT Russell.  All \nit contains is a list of potential “Claims”—including both personal claims against JT \nRussell and “Derivative claims” on its behalf —that Jim might assert in a future \nlawsuit.  (Am. Countercls. Ex. A, ECF No. 55.) \n14. Our courts have held with crystal clarity that a list of claims, without more, \nis not a proper demand.  “[T]he statute contemplates a demand upon the company to \ntake appropriate and tangible action,” not a mere “list of legal claims for relief to be \nasserted by the [shareholder] in a forthcoming lawsuit.”  Cumberland Cnty. Hosp. \nSys. v. Woodcock , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 43, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 21, 2023) \n(discussing analogous LLC statute); see also Bourgeois v. LaPelusa , 2022 NCBC \nLEXIS 111, at *28 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 23, 2022) (“Despite listing these grievances, \nnowhere does the letter specify what action Bourgeois is seeking.”) ; Miller v. \nBurlington Chem. Co., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *30 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 27, 2017) \n(“Such complaints and allegations of injury, however, are not demands to take \n \n2 A trial “court may consider matters outside of the pleadings” when deciding whether subject \nmatter jurisdiction exists.  Keith v. Wallerich , 201 N.C. App. 550, 554 (2009).  There is no \nneed to do so here, however, because the document that Jim holds out as his written demand \nis attached to his pleading and deemed to be part of it.  See N.C. R. Civ. P. 10(c). \n \n \nsuitable action.”); Garlock v. Hilliard, 2000 NCBC LEXIS 6, at * 10 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nAug. 22, 2000) (“That letter made no specific demand and did not request that the \nBoard of Directors take any action or bring any lawsuit.”). \n15. Jim argues that a shareholder can satisfy the demand requirement without \nexpressly asking the corporation to  sue the purported wrongdoer.  That’s true: a \ndemand to take suitable action is not limited to a demand to commence a lawsuit.  \nBut the defect here is not that  Jim failed to demand that JT Russell sue Bob, \nRaymond, and Tony.  Rather, it is that he failed to demand that JT Russell take any \naction at all. \n16. He goes on to  argue that his list of claims put  JT Russell on notice of the \nmisconduct by Bob, Raymond, and Tony  and gave the company a chance to redress \nthat misconduct during their presuit mediation.  Again, though, the statute requires \na written demand for suitable action, not an implied demand.  See Cumberland Cnty. \nHosp. Sys. , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 43, at *1 7–18 ( concluding that sending a draft \ncomplaint was not “a valid substitute for making a proper demand for suitable \naction”).  And in any event, Jim’s threat to assert both personal and derivative claims \ndid not fairly put JT Russell on notice of the action that he wanted it to take.  The \nimplication, if any, is that Jim was looking out for  his own interests as much as or \nmore than JT Russell’s.  See id. at *16–17 (holding that a shareholder’s demand to \nprotect “ its own  financial interests” was “not a proper dema nd”); Bourgeois, 2022 \nNCBC LEXIS 111, at *28 (“Compounding the problem, the demand letter includes \n \n \npersonal claims that Bourgeois might have brought directly and that cannot be the \nbasis for a derivative action.”). \n17. Absent a clear and specific demand for suitable action to right wrongs to the \ncorporation, Jim has not satisfied section 55 -7-42 and lacks standing to pursue a \nderivative action on JT Russell’s behalf .  For this reason, the Court dismisses his \nderivative counterclaims without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \nB. Direct Counterclaims \n18. JT Russell moves to dismiss two of Jim’s direct counterclaims for failure to \nstate a claim .  See N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) .  Dismissal is proper when “(1) the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports the . . . claim; (2) the complaint on \nits face reveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the \ncomplaint discloses some fact that necessarily defeats the . . . claim.”  Corwin v. Brit. \nAm. Tobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 615 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \nIn deciding the motion, the Court must treat all well-pleaded allegations as true and \nview the facts and permissible inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \nparty.  See, e.g., Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, 332 (2019). \n19. Dissolution.  Jim alleges that  he reasonably expected to work for  and \nparticipate in the management of JT Russell’s  family business  and that  those \nexpectations have been frustrated .  He also alleges that Bob, Raymond, and Tony  \nhave mismanaged JT Russell and  misused its assets for personal gain.  Based on \nthese allegations, he seeks to dissolve JT Russell .  See N.C.G.S. §  55-14-30(2) \n(authorizing a court to dissolve a corporation when “ (ii) liquidation is reasonably \n \n \nnecessary for the protection of the rights or interests of the complaining shareholder” \nor “(iv) the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted”). \n20. At the hearing, JT Russell’s counsel conceded that Jim has adequately \nstated a claim for relief.  Even so, JT Russell moves for partial dismissal on the \nground that some of the actions that Jim cites to support his claim occurred  during \nhis tenure as an officer and director, that he failed to object to them at that time, and \nthat he cannot seek dissolution based on them now. \n21. At best, this appears to be an argument to dismiss a handful of paragraphs \nin Jim’s pleading, rather than to dismiss the claim for dissolution.  That is not how \nRule 12(b)(6) operates.  As federal courts have noted, “a court dismisses claims, not \nallegations.”  Surgical Instrument Serv. Co. v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. , 571 F. Supp. \n3d 1133, 1140 (N.D. Cal. 2021); see also United States ex rel. Cooley v. ERMI, LLC , \n2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 196605, at * 9 n.3 (N.D. Ga. Nov. 2, 2023)  (“If the allegations \nthat ERMI makes are sufficient to state a claim as a whole, the fact that some of its \nallegations may not contribute to a breach of fiduciary  duty does not doom an \notherwise sufficiently pled claim.” (cleaned up)); Mitchell v. Muncie Cmty. Schs., 2016 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 92043, at *14 (S.D. Ind. July 15, 2016) (“In ruling on a motion to \ndismiss, the Court dismisses parties or claims, but not allegations.”). \n22. Moreover, what Jim knew and did when he was JT Russell’s secretary and \ntreasurer are issues for discovery.  For now, the Court must take Jim’s allegations as \ntrue, including his allegation that “he was not aware of all instances or the full extent \n \n \nof” misconduct by Bob, Raymond, and Tony  while he was serving as an officer and \ndirector.  (Am. Countercls. ¶ 70; see also Am. Countercls. ¶¶ 52, 59.)  \n23. The Court therefore denies JT Russell’s motion to dismiss Jim’s dissolution \ncounterclaim. \n24. Accounting.  “[A]n equitable accounting may be available when a plaintiff \nhas asserted a valid claim for relief in equity and an accounting is necessary to compel \ndiscovery of information regarding accounts held exclusively by the defendant .”  \nGottfried v. Covington, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 26, at *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 25, 2014) \n(quoting Mkt. Choice, Inc. v. New Eng. Coffee Co. , 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73627, at \n*35–36 (W.D.N.C. Aug. 18, 2009)).   “It is a remedy, not an independent cause of \naction, and is available only if the plaintiff first shows that he lacks an adequate \nremedy at law and alleges facts in the complaint to that effect.”  Elhulu v. Alshalabi, \n2021 NCBC LEXIS 44, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 29, 2021).   The Court therefore \ngrants the motion to dismiss Jim’s accounting counterclaim to the extent it is pleaded \nas an independent cause of action but does so without prejudice to his right to seek \nan accounting as a remedy, if appropriate, at a later stage. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n25. For all these reasons, the Court GRANTS Bob, Raymond, and Tony’s motion \nto dismiss  and GRANTS in part and DENIES in part  JT Russell’s motion to \ndismiss as follows: \na. The Court DISMISSES Jim’s derivative counterclaims without \nprejudice for lack of jurisdiction.  \n \n \nb. The Court DISMISSES Jim’s accounting counterclaim without \nprejudice to his right to seek an accounting as a remedy.  \nc. The Court DENIES the motion to  dismiss Jim’s  dissolution \ncounterclaim. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 28th day of February, 2024. \n \n \n       /s/ Adam M. Conrad   \n      Adam M.
