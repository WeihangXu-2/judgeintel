HOLLINGSWORTH, in her \nofficial capacity as Executrix of the \nESTATE OF GLENN \nHOLLINGSWORTH; and VIABLE \nCORP.,  \n \nDefendants, \n \n  and \n \nJUDITH T. HOLLINGSWORTH, \nExecutrix of the ESTATE OF GLENN \nHOLLINGSWORTH, \n \nThird-Party Plaintiff, \n \n  v. \n \nIMPERIUM INSURANCE COMPANY, \n \nThird-Party Defendant. \n \nOPINION AND FINAL ORDER \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court after Plaintiff BDM Investments  \n(“BDM”) filed a Notice of Dismissal with Prejudice, dismissing its claims against \nJudith Hollingsworth individually and as executrix of the Estate of Glenn \nHollingsworth on October 17, 2017 .  The only claim remaining in this matter is \n \n \nagainst Defendants L enhil, Inc., Lennon Hills, LLC, and Viable Corporation \n(collectively “Lennon Hills Defendants”).  For the reasons stated below, the Court now \nDISMISSES the Lennon Hills Defendants, thereby resolving all claims in this action.  \nBowden & Gardner, PC by Edwin W. Bowden for Plaintiff BDM \nInvestments.  \n \nRountree Losee LLP by George Rountree, III, Diane Pappayliou, and \nAndrew R. Jones for Defendant Judith T. Hollingsworth, Executrix of the \nEstate of Glenn Hollingsworth, Deceased.  \n \nThe Law Offices of Oliver & Cheek, PLLC by George Mason  Oliver for \nDefendant Lenhil, Inc., Lennon Hills, LLC, and Viable Corporation.  \n \nGale, Chief Judge.  \n \n2. A m ore detailed summary of the facts  and allegations in this ca se is \nprovided in the Court’s past opinions.  See generally BDM Invs. v. Lenhil, Inc., 2014 \nNCBC LEXIS 32 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 21, 2014); BDM Invs. v.  Lenhil, Inc., 2014 \nNCBC LEXIS 6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 20, 2014); BDM Invs. v. Lenhil, Inc. , 2012 \nNCBC LEXIS 7 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 18, 2012).  For context, t he Court briefly \nsummarizes the relevant facts necessary for this Opinion and Final Order.   \n3. BDM brought this action against Glenn Hollingsworth \n(“Hollingsworth”), whose estate was substituted as a Defendant following his death, \nthe Lennon Hills Defendants, and others for damages arising from a transaction to \npurchase residential lots from Lennon Hills.   BDM asserted multiple causes of action \nagainst the Defendants, but its “ central theory  is that . . . Hollingsworth’s \ninducement, coupled with failing to disclose his possible agency relationship with the \n \n \nLennon Hills Defendants, allows BDM to rescind the transaction.”  BDM Invs., 2014 \nNCBC LEXIS 6, at *14-15.  \n4. The Court dismissed other defendants and all direct and indirect claims \nagainst the Lennon Hills Defendant s for their own actions, leaving  only seven \nindividual claims against Hollingsworth, his estate, or related parties.  Id. at *41, \n*46-51.    \n5. With leave of the Court, BDM then amended its complaint to bring a \nclaim of vicarious liability against the Lennon Hills Defendants  and a claim for \npiercing the corporate veil.  (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 214–234.)  The Court subsequently \ndismissed BDM’s claim for piercing the corporate veil.  See BDM Invs., 2014 NCBC \nLEXIS 32, at *15.   \n6. On October 17, 2017, BDM filed a Notice of Dismissal with Prejudice, \ndismissing all claims against Judith T. Hollingsworth, individually and as Executrix \nof the Estate of Glenn Hollingsworth, the Estate of Glenn Ho llingsworth, and Terry \nW. Hollingsworth.   \n7. The Notice of Dismissal with Prejudice does not expressly dismiss the \nclaim against the Lennon Hill Defendants for vicarious liability.   However, the \nvicarious liability claim is contingent upon BDM establishing H ollingsworth \ncommitted wrongful acts as agents o f the Lennon Hills Defendants.  The Court \nconcludes that there is no longer any viable claim against the Lennon Hills \nDefendants.   \n \n \n8. Accordingly, the Court now dismisses all remaining c laims against \nDefendants Lenhil, Inc., Lennon Hills, LLC, and Viable Corporation.   \n9. There being n o other claims remain ing in this action, this action is \nDISMISSED against all parties with prejudice and this constitutes the Court’s final \nresolution.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this the 16th day of November, 2017. \n \n \n /s/ James L. Gale \n James L. Gale \n Chief Business Court Judge \n "
