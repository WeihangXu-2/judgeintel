This action focuses on whether Defendants—all insurers who issued excess \nlevel insurance policies to Plaintiffs Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (“DEC”) (formerly \nDuke Power Company (“Duke Power”)) and Duke Energy Progress, LLC (“DEP”) \n(formerly Carolina Power & Light Company (“CP&L”)) (collectively, “Duke”) —are \nobligated to compensate Duke for alleged liabilities linked to coal combustion \nresiduals (“CCRs”), i.e., coal ash, at fifteen Duke -owned power plants in North and \nSouth Carolina.   \n \n \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions for summary judgment; \nrather, the Court summarizes material facts it considers to be uncontested.  Hyde  \nIns. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142, 215 S.E.2d 162, 165 \n(1975). \n5. DEC owns the Riverbend Steam Station (“Riverbend”) near  Mount Holly, \nGaston County, North Carolina.  The Riverbend plant was in operation  from 1929 \nuntil 2013, and a coal ash pond was placed into service at Riverbend in 1957.4   \n6. DEP owns the W.H. Weatherspoon Steam Electric Plant (“Weatherspoon”) \nnear Lumberton, Robeson County, North Carolina.  T he Weatherspoon plant was in \noperation from 1949 until 2011, and a coal ash pond was placed into service at \nWeatherspoon sometime between 1949 and 1955.5  \n                                                 \n4 (See Aff.

The AEGIS Defendants rely on a Duke consultant’s modeling report to \ncontend that “[t] he Wea therspoon ash pond was placed into service in 1949” and that \n“January 1, 1950 is effectively the date the Weatherspoon ash pond was placed into service.”  \n(Mem.

In contrast, Duke asserts that \n \n \n7. The Moving and Joining Defendants6 (collectively, the “Insurers”) contend \nin the current Motions that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because \nDuke has admitted that the property damage Duke suffered at the Riverbend and \nWeatherspoon plants occurred when the ash ponds at those plants were placed in \noperation in the 1950s and the relevant policies only provide coverage for property \ndamage occurring during the effective periods for those policies, which were in the \nlate 1970s and early 1980s.

The Chubb Defendants’ Motion concerns five policies the Chubb Defendants \nissued to Duke Power  between 1 979 and 1985 for the Riverbend site (the “Chubb \n                                                 \nthe Weatherspoon  coal ash pond began operating around 1955, citing a different report \nstating that “[t]he ash basin was constructed in phases using a combination of basin \nexcavation and earthen dike construction beginning in 1955.”  (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 6 n.19 (citing \nDuke’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 4 Comprehensive Site Assessment Report – W.H. Weatherspoon Power \nPlant (Aug. 5, 2015), at ES-vi, 6–7, ECF No. 662.1).)   \n \n6 The Chubb Defendants’ Motion was joined by  the AEGIS Defendants , (ECF No. 607); \nAssurances Générales de France n/k/a Allianz IARD (“AGF”),  (ECF No. 601); Old Republic \nInsurance Company (“Old Republic”), (ECF No. 605); The Continental Insurance Company \nfor London Guarantee and Accident Company of New York (“Continental”), (ECF No. 608) ; \nAllianz Global Risks US Insurance Company (f/k/a Allianz Insurance Company), Allianz \nUnderwriters Insurance Company (f/k/a Allianz Underwriters, Inc.) , and Fireman’s Fund \nInsurance Company (“ FFIC”; collectively, the “Allianz Defendants”), (ECF No. 610) ; and \nArrowood Indemnity Company (f/k/a Royal Indemnity Company)  (“Arrowood”), (ECF No. \n615).  AGF and Old Republic filed separate papers in support of the  Chubb Defendants’ \nMotion.  (ECF Nos. 601, 605.)  The AEGIS Defendants’ Motion was joined by Defendants \nFFIC, United States Fire Insurance Company (“U.S. Fire”), Federal, and PEIC.  ( ECF Nos. \n611, 617, 619.)  The Defendants joining the Chubb Defendants’ and the AEGIS Defendants’ \nMotions are referenced herein, collectively, as the “Joining Defendants.” \n \n \nPolicies”),7 (Certain Defs.’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Partial Summ. J. Regarding Trigger \nCoverage 1–2 [hereinafter “Chubb Defs.’ Supp. Br.”], ECF No. 575 ), and numerous \npolicies with similar language issued by certain Joining Defendants who have joined \nthe Chubb Defendants’ Motion.8  The AEGIS Defendants’ Motion similarly concerns \nfive policies the AEGIS Defendants issued to CP&L  between 1981 and 1986 for the \nWeatherspoon plant (the “AEGIS Defendants ’ Policies ,” together with the Chubb \nPolicies, the “Policies”),9 (Mot. Partial Summ. J. AEGIS, Berkshire Hathaway Direct \nIns. Co. (f/k/a ACI), & TIG Ins. Co., Successor to Ranger, Regarding Coverage W.H. \nWeatherspoon Steam Electric Plant 1, ECF No. 593), as well as several policies with \nsimilar language issued by certain Joining Defendants who have joined the  AEGIS \nDefendants’ Motion.10  \n9. The Chubb Policies  require the insurer “to indemnify . . . [ t]he Insured \nagainst Ultimate Net Loss, which the Insured may sustain by reason of the liability \nimposed upon the Insured by law . . . for damages because of . . . property damage, \ncaused by [an] occurrence.”  (Heskin 1st Aff. Ex. 8, at CEN000001–02, ECF No. 573.8; \nHeskin 1st Aff. Ex. 9 § I(a), ECF No. 573.9 .)  Each of t hese Policies states that it \n“applies to occurrences anywhere which take place during the policy period[,]”  \n                                                 \n7 The Chubb Policies at issue are listed at Appendix A. \n \n8 The Joining Defendants’ policies at issue on the Chubb Defendants’ Motion are listed at \nAppendix A. \n \n9 The AEGIS Defendants’ Policies at issue are listed at Appendix A. \n \n10 The Joining Defendants’ Policies at issue on the AEGIS Defendants’ Motion are listed at \nAppendix A. \n \n \n(Heskin 1st Aff. Ex. 9 § IV), and define an “occurrence” as “(1) an accident, or (2) event \nor continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in . . . physical damage \nto or destruction of tangible property, including loss of use [,]” (Heskin 1st Aff. Ex. 9 \n§ III(f)).  “Property damage” is defined as “physical injury to or destruction of tangible \nproperty which occurs during the policy period, including the loss or use thereof at \nany time resulting therefrom[.]”  (Heskin 1st Aff. Ex. 9, at DUKE_CAIR_000000070.)   \n10. Similarly, under each of the AEGIS Defendants’ Policies, the insurer must \n“indemnify . . . [t]he INSURED for any and all sums which the INSURED shall \nbecome legally obligated to pay as ULTIMATE NET LOSS . . . for damages because \nof . . . PROPERTY DAMAGE caused by an OCCURRENCE[.]”)  (See Mann Aff. Ex. D \nStipulated Copy [ACI] Policy No. CC -00-26-13 § I(a), ECF No. 596.4 .)  Each of t he \nAEGIS Defendants’ Policies further provides that the “ POLICY applies to \nOCCURRENCES . . . which take place anywhere during the POLICY PERIOD [,]” \n(Mann Aff. Ex. D § IV), and defines “occurrence,” in relevant part, as “(1) an accident; \nor (2) an event; or (3) continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in \n. . . PROPE RTY DAMAGE[,]” (Mann Aff. Ex. D § III(i)).  The AEGIS Defendants’ \nPolicies define “ property damage ,” in relevant part, as “physical injury to or \ndestruction of tangible property which occurs during the POLICY PERIOD[.]”  (Mann \nAff. Ex. D § III(k).) \n11. The Moving Defendants contend that the foregoing policy  provisions make \nclear that coverage is only available under the Policies if they were in effect when \ncovered property damage began .  Relying on reports  of Duke’s groundwater \n \n \nconsultants and statements made in Duke’s opposition brief, the Moving Defendants \ncontend that Duke has acknowledged that the relevant property damage here began \non the date the ash ponds were placed in operation—1950 for Weatherspoon and 1957 \nfor Riverbend.  Because the Moving Defendants’ Policies did not go into effect until  \n1979 and 1981, respectively, the Moving Defendants contend that the Policies at issue \nhave not been triggered and thus cannot provide coverage.  (Chubb Defs.’ Supp. Br . \n3, 8–9; AEGIS Defs.’ Supp. Br. 3, 17 n.69, 18; Joint Reply Br. 1–2.) \n12. Defendant AGF has joined in the Chubb Defendants’ Motion but advances \na separate argument to reach the same conclusion based on different language in \nAGF’s insurance policy (“AGF Policy”).11  (AGF’s Supp. Br. 3, ECF No. 601.)   \n13. The AGF Policy, through its incorporation of Lloyd’s UGL 1333 , provides \nthat the insurer must “ indemnify . . . the named Assured . . . for any and all sums \nwhich they shall be legally obligated to pay and shall pay . . . as damages . . . by reason \nof damage to or destruction of property, by reason of or resulting from any trade or \nbusiness of the named Assured[.]”  (AGF’s Supp. Br. Ex. 2  § I(a).)  The Limit of \nLiability provision in the AGF Policy limits co verage to the “ultimate net  loss as a \nresult of any occurrence covered under Insuring Agreement I(a)[.]”  (AGF’s Supp. Br. \nEx. 2 § II.)  The  AGF Policy defines “occurrence” as “one happening or series of \nhappenings arising out of or caused by one event taking place during the term of this \n                                                 \n11 The AGF Policy at issue on the Chubb Defendants’ Motion is Combined Companies Policy \nNo. 881/UGL 1333, (Mem. Law Supp. Joinder Def. AGF Certain Defs.’ Mot. Partial Summ. \nJ. Regarding Trigger Coverage [hereinafter “AGF’s Supp. Br.”] Ex. 1, ECF No. 601.2), which \nincorporates in part the terms and conditions of Lloyd’s Policy No. 881/UGL 1333  (“Lloyd’s \nUGL 1333”), (AGF’s Supp. Br. Ex. 2, ECF No. 601.3).  See Appendix A.  The AGF Policy was \nissued for the period from 1975 until 1978.   \n \n \ncontract[,]” (AGF’s Supp. Br. Ex. 2 , at MARSH-DEC-001065), which AGF contends \nrequires “a discrete causative event during the policy term” for coverage to be \nreached, (AGF Supp. Br. 3).  AGF asserts that Duke is unable to show that its alleged \ndamages arise from one event during the  1975–78 policy period and thus that the \nAGF Policy has not been triggered.  (AGF ’s Supp. Br. 3 , Ex. 1, at MARSH -DEC-\n000675.)   \n14. Like AGF, Defendant Old Republic joined in the Chubb Defendants’ Motion \nand advanced separate but similar arguments for dismissal based on the language in \nthe policy it issued to Duke Power for the period from  1981 until 1982.12  (Def. Old \nRepublic Ins. Co.’s Mot. Partial Summ. J. Regarding Trigger Coverage (Joinder) 1–2, \nECF No. 605.) \n15. While opposing the Motions on their merits, Duke also argues under North \nCarolina Rule of Civil Procedure  56(f) that the Motions are prematu re because the \nparties have not yet completed expert discovery on the trigger of coverage issues that \nare the subject of the Motions.  (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 16–19, ECF No. 662; Duke’s Opp’n \nBr. Ex. 12 Rule 56(f) Aff. Matthew G. Jeweler (Jan. 17, 2020) ¶¶ 5–8, ECF No. 662.1.)  \nIn particular, Duke contends that determining when “property damage” or an “injury \nin fact ” occurs under the Policies requires determining “ [w]hen and how often \nleaching and migration of CCR constituents impacted groundwater” at the two sites, \n(Duke’s Opp’n Br. 2), and that the current record “does not contain evidence of when \nthe leaching and migration processes commenced and/or subsequently took place at \n                                                 \n12 The Old Republic policy at issue on the Chubb Defendants’ Motion is identified at Appendix \nA. \n \n \nthe Riverbend or Wea therspoon ash basins, or when those processes resulted in \ndamage to groundwater, ” (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 8) .  Duke asserts that the “complex \nscientific process through which constituents in the CCRs in Duke’s ash basins \nleached and then migrated into the groundwater . . . including how it works, its \ntiming, and when it resulted in damage to groundwater will be the subject of expert \ntestimony in this ca se.”  (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 6–7.)  Duke therefore urges the Court to \ndelay consideration of the Motions until expert discovery has been completed.   \n16. After full briefing, 13 the Court held a hearing on the Motions on February \n27, 2020 (the “Hearing”) , at which Duke, the Chubb Defendants, the AEGIS \nDefendants, AGF, Old Republic, and the other appearing Defendants were \nrepresented by counsel.  The Motions are now ripe for resolution. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n17. It is well established under North Carolina law that “summary judgment is \nappropriate where ‘ the pleadings, depositions, answers  to interrogatories, and \nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \nissue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter \nof law.’ ”  Cabarrus Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Dep’t of State Treasurer, 839 S.E.2d 814, 823–\n24 (N.C. 2020) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  “An issue is ‘genuine’ if it can be proven \n                                                 \n13 Duke filed a single brief in opposition to the Motions and the separate arguments of AGF \nand Old Republic.  (ECF No. 662.)  The Chubb and AEGIS Defendants filed a joint reply in  \nsupport of the Motions, (ECF No. 681), in which Arrowood, Continental, the Allianz \nDefendants, and U.S. Fire joined,  (ECF Nos. 693–94, 696, 698, 700).  Defendants AGF and \nOld Republic each filed separate replies.  (ECF Nos. 684, 699, 727.)   \n \n \nby substantial evidence and a fact is ‘ material’ if it would constitute or irrevocably \nestablish any material element of a claim or a defense.”  McVicker v. Bogue Sound \nYacht Club, Inc., 257 N.C. App. 69, 72, 809 S.E.2d 136, 139 (2017) (quoting Lowe v. \nBradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369, 289 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1982)).  “Substantial evidence is \nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion . . . and means more than a scintilla or a permissible inference[.]”  DeWitt \nv. Eveready Battery Co., 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002) (citations and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  “Evidence presented by the parties is viewed in \nthe light most favorable to the non -movant.”  Summey v. Barker, 357 N.C. 492, 496, \n586 S.E.2d 247, 249 (2003) (citing Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, \n835 (2000)). \n18. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue \nof material fact.  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579, 573 S.E.2d \n118, 124 (2002).  This burden can be met either: “(1) ‘by proving an essential element \nof the opposing party ’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be \nbarred by an affirmative defense ’; or (2) ‘ by showing through discovery that the \nopposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of [ its] \nclaim.’ ”  Strickland v. Lawrence, 176 N.C. App. 656, 661, 627 S.E.2d 301, 305 (2006) \n(quoting Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83, 530 S.E.2d at 835).  If the moving party meets its \nburden, “the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784–85, \n \n \n534 S.E.2d 660, 664 (2000); see also N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (“[A]n adverse party may not \nrest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but . . . must set forth \nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”). \nIII.  \nANALYSIS \n19. The Insurers contend that under the Policies, a qualifying “occurrence” and \nqualifying “property damage” must begin during the policy period for coverage to be \ntriggered.  The Insurers argue that this interpretation is compelled by the Supreme \nCourt of North Carolina’s decision in Gaston County Dyeing Machine Co. v. Northfield \nInsurance Co., 351 N.C. 293, 524 S.E.2d 558 (2000) , in which the Supreme Court \ninterpreted the policy language at issue in that case to provide that “when . . . the \naccident that causes an injury -in-fact occurs on a date certain and all subsequent \ndamages flow from the single event, there is but a single occurrence; and only policies \non the risk on the date of the injury -causing event are triggered[,]” id. at 304, 524 \nS.E.2d at 565; (Chubb Defs.’ Supp. Br. 2–4, 14–16; AEGIS Defs.’ Supp. Br. 2–3, 7–9). \n20. The Insurers further contend that the reports and testimony of two \nconsultants Duke hired to complete groundwater modeling required under North \nCarolina’s 2014 Coal Ash Management Act (“CAMA”) , Dr. William Langley  \n(Riverbend modeling lead) and Dr. Ronald Falta (Weatherspoon modeling lead) , \nestablish as a matter of law  that groundwater contamination, and hence “property \n \n \ndamage” under the Policies (and “injury-in-fact” under Gaston), occurred at each site \nin the 1950s.14  \n21. The Insurers also point to Duke’s statements  in its opposition brief that \ngroundwater “was continuously and repeatedly exposed to CCR constituents over the \nentire period of operation of the ash ponds [,]” (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 5), and that “the \ndamage to groundwater due to CCR constituents took place each year [,]” (Duke ’s \nOpp’n Br. 27), as confirmatory admissions that the first damage to groundwater or \n“injury-in-fact” at the Riverbend and Weatherspoon ash ponds occurred in the 1950s, \n(Joint Reply Br. 1–2).   \n22. Because the earliest Chubb Policy was issued in 1979 and the ear liest \nAEGIS Defendant Policy was issued in 1981, the Insurers contend that Duke’s \nalleged property damage ( and “injury-in-fact” under Gaston) began long before the \nPolicies were in effect, thereby precluding coverage.  (Chubb Defs .’ Supp. Br. 3; \nAEGIS Defs.’ Supp. Br. 18.) \n23. The Insurers’ argument on the Motions therefore requires the Court to \nconclude as a matter of law that, applying Gaston as interpreted by the Insurers, the \nundisputed facts on the current record show (i) Duke’s a lleged “property damage” or \n                                                 \n14 (See Chubb Defs.’ Supp. Br. 6–9; Heskin 1st Aff.

The Court concludes that it cannot reach these conclusions on \nthe current record. \n24. Even if Gaston applies as the Insurers contend, the Insurers make too much \nof the reports and testimony of Duke’s consultants on the Motion.  Duke’s evidence \nshows that Drs. Langley and Falta were tasked with modeling  possible future \ngroundwater impacts resulting from various potential ash pond closure plans.15  To \nestimate future groundwater contamination, the consultants assumed , but did not \nverify or confirm, that groundwate r contamination at Riverbend and Weatherspoon \nbegan on the day that each of the ash basins was  placed in operation .  (Falta Aff. \n¶¶ 4–8; Langley Aff. ¶¶ 4– 7.)  Such assumptions about past groundwater \ncontamination do not conclusively establish the date “property damage” or “injury-in-\nfact” occurred at either site , particularly given both consultants’ affidavit testimony \nconfirming that their assumptions were not inten ded to substitute for a rigorous \ninvestigation and determination of the commencement of groundwater \ncontamination at either site .  (Falta Aff. ¶  8; Langley Aff. ¶  6.)  As such, th is \n                                                 \n15 (See Duke’s Opp’n Br. Ex. 6 Excerpts William G. Langley, Ph.D., P.E. Dep. Tr.

Weatherspoon Power Plant, Lumberton, NC (Oct. \n28, 2015), at 17–18, ECF No. 662.1.)   \n \n \nevidentiary premise of the Motions cannot be sustained as a matter of law on the \ncurrent record. \n25. Similarly, Duke’s statements in its opposition brief suggesting that \ngroundwater was “continuously and repeatedly exposed to CCR constituents over the \nentire period of operation of the ash ponds[,]” (Duke’s Opp’n Br. 5), are forecast s of \nevidence, not record evidence establishing undisputed facts.  Even if the Court were \nto accept these forecasts as stipulations of fact as urged by the Moving Defendants, it \nappears that evidence to be developed through expert discovery may be relevant to \nthe Court’s determination of the issues raised by the Motions, including evidence \nconcerning the causes of groundwater contamination at the two sites, the level of \nleached CCR consti tuents in each  site’s groundwater necessary to constitute \n“property damage” under the Policies, when alleged “property damage” first occurred \nat each site , and whether alleged “property damage” occurred once or on multiple \noccasions, all of which is the focus of ongoing expert discovery.   \n26. The Court therefore concludes that a determination of t he Motions , \nincluding on the separate grounds advanced by AGF and Old Republic, may require  \nconsideration of expert testimony and is therefore premature.  Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the Motions should be denied at this time  without prejudice to the \nInsurers’ rights to renew the Motions after expert discovery is concluded.   \n \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n27. WHEREFORE, the Court, for the reasons stated above,  hereby DENIES \nthe Chubb Defendants’ Motion and the AEGIS Defendants’ Motion without prejudice \nto the Insurers’ rights to renew either or both Motions after the completion of expert \ndiscovery.16 \nSO ORDERED, this the 5th day of June, 2020. \n \n/s/ Louis A.

The Court, however, will permit Duke an opportunity to \nprovide such an evidentiary foundation in the event one or both Motions are renewed after \nthe completion of expert discovery. \n \n \nAPPENDIX A \n \nPolicies at Issue on the Motions \n \nChubb Defendants’ Policies  \n \nCalifornia Union Policy ZCX 00 38 58 (ECF No. 573.8) \nCalifornia Union Policy ZCX 00 60 09 (ECF No. 573.10) \nPEIC Policy XCC 00 23 83 (ECF No. 573.11) \nFederal Policy (85) 7929-31-72 (ECF No. 573.13) \nCalifornia Union Policy ZCX 00 74 50 (ECF No. 573.14) \n \nAEGIS Defendants’ Policies \n \nACI Policy No. CC-00-26-13 (ECF No. 596.4) \nRanger Policy No. EUL 300659 (ECF No. 596.5) \nRanger Policy No. EUL 300578 (ECF No. 596.6) \nAEGIS Policy No. 211 CNJ (ECF No. 596.7)  \nRanger Policy No. BSP 122048 (ECF No. 596.8) \n \nJoining Defendants’ Policies (Chubb Defendants’ Motion) \n \nCombined Companies Policy No. 881/UGL 1333 (ECF Nos. 601.2–.3) \nOld Republic Policy No. OZX11486 (ECF No. 605.1) \nAEGIS Policy No. 172 (ECF No. 591.7) \nACI Policy No. CC-00-12-63 (ECF No. 591.8) \nACI Policy No. CC-00-26-11 (ECF No. 591.9) \nRanger Policy No. BSP 122047 (ECF No. 591.10) \nRanger Policy No. 300658 (ECF No. 591.11) \nRanger Policy No. 300579 (ECF No. 591.12) \nAEGIS Policy No. 209CNJ (ECF No. 591.13) \nLondon Guarantee and Accident Company of New York Policy No. LX3278836\n17 \nLondon Guarantee and Accide nt Company of New York Policy No. LX1898119 \n(Heskin 2nd Aff.
