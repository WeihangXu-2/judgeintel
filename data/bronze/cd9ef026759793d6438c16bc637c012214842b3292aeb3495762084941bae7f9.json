Mc Dougal, Esq. and Alan D. \nMcInnes, Esq. for Defendant.  \n \nTHE COURT makes the following FINDINGS of FACT, only for the limited \npurpose of determining the Motion: \n[1] Plaintiff Bayer CropScience LP (\"Bayer\") is a D elaware limited partnership \nwith its principal place of business in Durham County, North Carolina. 1 \n[2] Defendant Chemtura Corporation (\"Chemtura\") is a Delaware corporation \nwith its principal place of business in Middlebury, Connecticut. 2 \n[3] On or about March 31, 2008, Bayer and Chemtura entered into an \nagreement entitled Second Amended and Restated Ipconazole Development and \nSupply Agreement (\"Chemtura Agreement\"). 3  The initial term of the Chemtura \nAgreement runs until June 20, 2015. 4  However, either party can terminate the \nagreement if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure such breach within \nthirty days after being notified, with reasonable particularity, of the breach. 5 \n[4] Under the Chemtura Agreement, Chemtura granted Bayer the exclusive \nright to use the chemical Ipconazole 6 to develop certain formulated products, notably \nthe Vortex Formulation (\"Vortex\").7  Vortex primarily was to be used as a seed treatment \non corn (including popcorn and sweet corn), cotton, sorghum, peanuts, sunflower, \nvegetables and sugar beets in the United States. 8  Bayer's Canadian affiliate also was \ngranted the right to use Ipconazole to develop a Canadian formula, similar to Vortex, as \na seed treatment on corn (including popcorn and sweet corn) in Canada. 9 \n                                                 \n1 Compl.

Compl. ¶ 6. \n7 Chemtura and Bayer's predecessor-in-interest worked together to develop Vortex.  The active ingredient \nused in Vortex is Ipconazole.  Sutton Aff. 1. \n8 Chemtura Agreement § 2.2.  Chemtura obtained its r ights in Ipconazole by entering into an exclusive \nagreement with Kureha Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., the supplier of Ipconazole.  Sutton Aff. ¶ 3. \n9 Chemtura Agreement § 2.2. \n[5] Chemtura's performance under the Chemtura Agree ment is conditioned \non Bayer's satisfactory performance of a list of obligations, along with Bayer's obligation \nto purchase a required annual quantity of Ipcanazole. 10   The relevant portions of Bayer's \nobligations under the Chemtura Agreement, for purposes of this Opinion and Order, are \nreflected in sections 3.1(a) and (c), 9.4 and 16.1.11   These sections provide that: \n3.1(a): Bayer shall use commercially reasonable eff orts to \ndevelop the market potential for the use of [Ipcona zole] for \n[Vortex] and for approved [new uses] on [crops] in the \n[United States and Canada]. 12  \n \n3.1(c): Bayer shall use commercially reasonable eff orts to \nfully promote the sales and use of [Vortex] and app roved \n[new uses] for crops in the [United States and Cana da], by \nengaging in advertising and marketing programs. \n13  \n \n9.4: [Vortex] and any approved [new uses] shall be sold by \nBayer and/or Bayer's [Canadian affiliate], as appli cable, \nunder their own labels and trademarks or trade name s \n(including \"Vortex\") for [seed treatment use on cro ps in the \nUnited States and Canada.]  Under no circumstances shall \nBayer or Bayer's [Canadian affiliate] make any warr anty, \nexpress or implied, to any person with respect to t he \n[Ipconazole]. \n14  \n \n16.1: . . . [T]his [Chemtura] Agreement shall not b e \ntransferred or assigned, by operation of law or oth erwise, by \nBayer without Chemtura's prior written consent. \n15  \n \n[6] As part of the Chemtura Agreement, Chemtura per mitted Bayer to submit \nChemtura's data and information to the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n(\"EPA\") so that Bayer could receive the proper approval and registration needed to \n                                                 \n10  See id.  §§ 3.1, 6.1. \n11  As discussed infra , sections 3.1(a) and (c), 9.4 and 16.1 were cited by Chemtura in a notice to Bayer \nsetting forth Bayer's alleged default under the Chemtura Agreement. \n12  Id.  § 3.1(a). \n13  Id.  § 3.1(c). \n14  Id.  § 9.4. \n15  Id.  § 16.1. \nmanufacture Vortex and apply it to certain crop seeds. 16   Without Chemtura's data and \ninformation, Bayer would not be able to manufacture and sell Vortex because Bayer \nwould not be able to receive EPA approval. 17  \n[7] On or about April 7, 2008, Bayer entered into a n agreement (\"Monsanto \nAgreement\") with Monsanto Company (\"Monsanto\"), which, among other things, \nproduces corn seeds and treats its corn seed with fungicidal treatment. \n[8] Pursuant to the terms of the Monsanto Agreement , Bayer granted \nMonsanto the exclusive right to purchase Vortex for use as a seed treatment for \nMonsanto's corn seeds.18   Notwithstanding the Monsanto Agreement, Bayer remained \nobligated to Chemtura for performance of all the material terms of the Chemtura \nAgreement. \n[9] As part of a separate agreement entered into on  May 26, 2009, Bayer \npermitted Monsanto to obtain supplemental registration from the EPA for Vortex so that \nMonsanto could develop and use its own trademarks for the sale of Vortex. 19   However, \nBayer continued to sell Vortex to Monsanto for use on corn seed using Bayer's own \ntrademarks and trade names. 20  \n                                                 \n16  Compl. ¶ 9. \n17  May Aff. ¶¶ 8-10.  The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. §§ \n136 et seq. , generally provides for the federal regulation of covered chemical products, including \nregistration  and labeling  requirements necessary for the legal sale and use of such products in the United \nStates.  As mentioned above, without such registrations, Vortex, and other regulated products, may not \nbe sold. \n18  While negotiating the Monsanto Agreement, Monsanto  informed Bayer that it required Bayer to grant \nMonsanto the exclusive right to purchase Vortex from Bayer with respect to its use on corn seed as a \ncondition to entering into the Monsanto Agreement.  Rick Turner Aff. ¶ 7. \n19  Corn Seed Treatment Supplemental Registration Agre ement ¶¶ B-C, § 2.5. \n20  May Aff. ¶ 5. \n[10] Given the consolidated nature of the commercia l corn seed industry, \nincreasing sales and market potential for a product such as Vortex is difficult. 21   There is \nevidence before the court that an exclusive agreement with Monsanto, which is the \nlargest corn seed producer in the United States, is likely to produce greater sales and \npotential future growth opportunities for Vortex versus targeting sales to smaller corn \nseed producers that did not include sales to Monsanto.  Additionally, Bayer's contractual \nrelationship with Monsanto represents a source for potential growth regarding Vortex \nwith respect to other crop seeds. 22  \n[11] Bayer and Monsanto published a news release da ted April 8, 2008, \nannouncing the Monsanto Agreement.23   On April 24, 2008, Bayer and Chemtura \nconducted a meeting.  The meeting agenda listed the Monsanto Agreement as one of \nthe items to be discussed. 24   At this meeting, Bayer provided Chemtura with an \noverview of the Monsanto Agreement and explained the exclusive aspect of the \nagreement. 25  \n[12] On March 15, 2012, approximately four years af ter Bayer entered into the \nMonsanto Agreement, Chemtura notified Bayer by letter (\"Notice\") that it believed Bayer \nmaterially breached the Chemtura Agreement by entering into the Monsanto Agreement \nand granting Monsanto the exclusive right to purchase Vortex in the United States for \n                                                 \n21  The commercial corn seed market is dominated by Mo nsanto and Pioneer.  Rick Turner Aff. ¶ 4.  \nRoughly, Monsanto controls 35% of the United States market, with Pioneer controlling 34%.  Id.   \nSyngenta is less of a factor, controlling 7% of the same market.  However, Syngenta produces its own \nfungicide for seed treatment, which it uses on its own corn seeds and provides it to Pioneer pursuant to a \nlong-term agreement.  Id.  ¶ 5. \n22  There is evidence that Bayer and Monsanto could expand their current contractual relationship to \ninclude the application of Vortex on Monsanto's cotton and soybean seeds.  Mark Turner Aff. ¶¶ 6-7. \n23  May Aff. ¶ 4. \n24  Id. \n25  Smith Aff., Ex. B. \nuse as a seed treatment on corn. 26   Specifically, the Notice stated that Bayer's exclusive \ngrant of rights to Monsanto violated sections 3.1(a), 3.1(c) and 9.4 of the Chemtura \nAgreement. 27   Further, the Notice stated that because Bayer transferred certain material \nobligations to Monsanto, Bayer was also in breach of section 16.1 of the Chemtura \nAgreement, which permits assignments of obligations only with Chemtura's prior written \nconsent. 28   The above-referenced sections were the only sections that the Notice \nreferenced as a source for Bayer's alleged default.29  \n[13] In the Notice, Chemtura indicated its intent t o terminate the Chemtura \nAgreement, unless the alleged breach was cured within thirty days.30  \n[14] On April 12, 2012, Bayer responded to the Noti ce and informed Chemtura \nthat it had not manifested an intention to transfer its obligations under the Chemtura \nAgreement to Monsanto or to any other party and contended that it was not in material \nbreach of the Chemtura Agreement.31  \n[15] On April 24, 2012, Chemtura rejected Bayer's e xplanation and stated that \nit intended to terminate the Chemtura Agreement on April 30, 2012. 32   Chemtura \nindicated that it would cease selling Ipconazole to Bayer in an exclusive arrangement.33   \nChemtura also demanded that Bayer either terminate its registration for Vortex with the \nEPA or transfer the registration to Chemtura. 34  \n                                                 \n26  Sutton Aff. ¶ 22, Ex.

Bayer seeks preliminary \ninjunctive relief as a result of Chemtura's alleged unjustified, unilateral termination of the \nChemtura Agreement. \n[20] The Motion has been briefed and argued and is ripe for determination. \nBASED UPON the foregoing FINDINGS of FACT, the court reaches the \nCONCLUSIONS of LAW reflected in the following discussion: \n                                                 \n35  Id. \n36  Mark Turner Aff. ¶ 3. \n37  Id. ¶ 4. \n38  May Aff. ¶¶ 9-10. \n39  Id. \nPreliminary Injunction  \n[21] A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary m easure that \"should not be \nlightly granted.\"  Travenol Lab., Inc. v. Turner , 30 N.C. App. 686, 692 (1976).  It is an \nancillary remedy that only will be issued if a moving party is able to show (a) a likelihood \nof success on the merits of its case and (b) that it is likely to sustain irreparable loss \nunless the injunction is issued; or if, in the opinion of the court, in weighing the \nrespective interests of the parties, issuance is necessary for the protection of the \nmoving party's rights during the course of litigation. 40   A.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. McClure , \n308 N.C. 393, 401 (1983).  The burden is on the moving party to establish its right to a \npreliminary injunction.  Id .; Ridge Cmty. Investors, Inc. v.

Nov. 12, 1997); see also  G.S. 1-485. \nStatus Quo  \n[22] The parties dispute whether the Motion should be characterized as a \nmandatory or prohibitory injunction.  The distinction between a mandatory and \nprohibitory injunction is an important one because a mandatory injunction is more rare \nand generally disfavored as an interlocutory remedy.  Roberts v. Madison Cnty. \n                                                 \n40  Although Bayer has not yet filed a demand for arbitration, Bayer has indicated in its Complaint that it \nintends to do so with respect to all Claims alleged.  It is proper for a court to enter an injunction pending \narbitration if doing so would prevent one party from eviscerating the effectiveness of the arbitration.  A \npre-arbitration injunction would be proper if either the Federal Arbitration Act or North Carolina Rev ised \nUniform Arbitration Act (\"NCRUAA\") controlled the parties' dispute.  See  Blumenthal v. Merrill, Lynch, \nPierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. , 910 F.2d 1049, 1054 (2d Cir. 1990) (stating that federal policy favors \nentering an injunction if doing so would permit the parties to arbitrate disputes contemplated by their \narbitration agreement); Scottish Re Life Corp. v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co. , 184 N.C. App. \n292, 297-98 (2007) (holding that the NCRUAA permits  a court to enter provisional remedies, including \ninjunctive relief – if the requirements for an inju nction are met – before an arbitrator is appointed if doing \nso would preserve the effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding). \nRealtors Ass'n, 344 N.C. 394, 400 (1996); Bd. of Light & Water Comm'rs of Concord v. \nParkwood Sanitary Dist ., 49 N.C. App. 421, 424 (1980).  A preliminary injunction is a \nmeasure taken by a court to preserve the status quo of the parties during litigation.  \nTriangle Leasing Co. v. McMahon , 327 N.C. 224, 227 (1990). \n[23] Here, the parties operated under the Chemtura Agreement for nearly four \nyears before Chemtura decided to terminate the same on April 30, 2012.  Chemtura \ncontends that the status quo is that the parties do not have an agreement.  As such, \nChemtura argues that Bayer is seeking a mandatory injunction by forcing Chemtura to \nresume performance of the Chemtura Agreement.41  \n[24] However, the status quo does not, as Chemtura would have it, \"consist of \na photographic replication of the circumstances existing at the moment suit was filed,\" \nbut rather the status quo is \"the last peaceable uncontested status that existed before \nthe dispute arose.\"  Mass. Mut. v. Associated Dry Goods , 786 F. Supp. 1403, 1427 \n(N.D. Ind. 1992).  An \"injunction is generally framed so as to restrain the defendant from \npermitting his previous act to operate, or to restore conditions that existed before the \nwrong complained of was committed.\"  Anderson v. Waynesville , 203 N.C. 37, 46 \n(1932); see also Rauch Indus., Inc. v. Radko , No. 3:07-cv-197-C, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n79311, *19 (W.D.N.C. Oct. 25, 2007) (characterizing the status quo between the parties \nas \"the time that the allegedly unlawful acts complained of reasonably may be believed \nto have occurred\").  Adopting Chemtura's position regarding the status quo would \n                                                 \n41  Chemtura argues that it is a basic tenet of contract law that a party is not obligated to perform a \ncontract against its will and is free to breach an arm's-length contract.  Def. Resp. Opp'n Pl. Mot. Prelim. \nInj. 12.  While this tenet is generally true, a party's decision to breach a contract and not perform is \nsubject to limitation when a breach would cause irreparable harm to the non-breaching party.  In such a \ncase, the issuance of a preliminary injunction would limit the right of a party to breach an arm's-length \ncontract. \ncreate an incentive for a party to breach an existing contract before the other party can \nseek injunctive relief in an effort to alter the status quo and the nature of the injunctive \nrelief sought (i.e., mandatory relief rather than prohibitory relief). \n[25] In the present case, Bayer's breach of contrac t Claim arises from \nChemtura's alleged wrongful termination of the Chemtura Agreement on April 30, 2012.  \nSubsequently, Bayer filed this civil action on May 10, 2012.  The status quo between the \nparties is the contractual relationship that existed for over four years before the dispute \narose.  As such, maintaining the status quo would have Chemtura providing Ipconazole \nto Bayer pursuant to the Chemtura Agreement.  Consequently, Bayer is seeking an \ninjunction that is more appropriately characterized as a prohibitory injunction.  In \nsubstance, Bayer is seeking to prohibit Chemtura from wrongfully terminating the \nChemtura Agreement (i.e., prohibit Chemtura from disrupting the status quo during the \npendency of this litigation). \nLikelihood of Success on the Merits of Plaintiff's Breach of Contract Claim  \n[26] Bayer alleges that Chemtura breached the Chemt ura Agreement by \nunilaterally and unjustifiably terminating the contract. \n[27] In response, Chemtura contends that its termin ation of the Chemtura \nAgreement was proper because Chemtura gave sufficient notice to Bayer that it was in \nmaterial breach of the Chemtura Agreement, and Bayer failed to cure within the \nrequisite time period. \n[28] In determining whether Bayer is likely to succ eed on the merits of its \nbreach of contract Claim, the court must determine whether Chemtura's termination of \nthe Chemtura Agreement was proper.  In doing so, the court must examine (a) whether \nthe Notice was sufficient and (b) whether Bayer was in material breach of the Chemtura \nAgreement, which would provide proper grounds for Chemtura to terminate the contract.    \n[29] As an initial matter, the Chemtura Agreement c ontains a choice of law \nclause stating that the contract is governed by New York law, 42  and the parties do not \ndispute that New York law should apply to Bayer's breach of contract Claim.  As such, \nthe court will apply New York law to the merits of said Claim.  \n[30] The Chemtura Agreement provides specific circu mstances that allow the \nparties to terminate the agreement prior to its initial June 20, 2015 expiration date.  The \nChemtura Agreement states that it may be terminated by a party \"if the other party is in \nmaterial breach of [the Chemtura Agreement] and fails to cure such material breach \nwithin thirty (30) days after notice . . . setting forth the details thereof with reasonable \nparticularity has been given to such other party.\"43   Essentially, the Chemtura \nAgreement contemplates its termination if a party has substantive grounds to terminate \nand takes the proper procedural steps to give the other party notice. \n[31] Chemtura provided the Notice to Bayer, contend ing that Bayer had \nmaterially breached the Chemtura Agreement by entering into the Monsanto \nAgreement.  The Notice asserted that the Monsanto Agreement constituted (a) an \nimproper assignment of Bayer's obligations under the Chemtura Agreement, without \nChemtura's written consent, (b) a violation of the label/trademark clause and (c) a \nviolation of the requirement that Bayer use commercially reasonable efforts to develop \nthe market potential and fully promote the sale and use of Vortex. 44  \n                                                 \n42  Chemtura Agreement § 17.1. \n43  Id.  § 12.1(a)(i).  \n44  Millen Aff., Ex. 5 at 1-2.  The Notice had four substantive paragraphs, each of which specifically took \nissue with the Monsanto Agreement.  The Notice referenced four specific provisions in the Chemtura \n[32] Bayer, in its briefs and during oral argument,  did not raise any procedural \nissues with respect to the Notice.  It appears from the letters exchanged between \nChemtura and Bayer that Chemtura gave Bayer notice with reasonable particularity and \nthe proper amount of time to cure such alleged breaches with respect to the three \ngrounds for breach set forth in the Notice. 45   Because Chemtura took the proper \nprocedural steps in terminating the Chemtura Agreement, the court must decide \nwhether Chemtura's termination of the Chemtura Agreement was substantively proper.  \n[33] Chemtura argues that Bayer assigned a part of the Chemtura Agreement \nwithout Chemtura's consent.  The Chemtura Agreement provides, in pertinent part, that \n\"this Agreement shall not be transferred or assigned, by operation of law or otherwise, \nby Bayer without Chemtura's prior written consent.\"46  \n[34] In order to constitute an assignment under New  York law, the purported \nassignment must result in a complete and unqualified transfer of the assignor's property, \ninterest or right.  Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank Int'l Corp ., 540 F.2d 548, 558 (2d Cir. 1976); \nMele v. Travers , 293 A.D.2d 950, 951 (N.Y. App. Div. 3d Dep't 2002) (citation omitted).  \n\"An assignment at law contemplates a completed transfer of the entire interest of the \n                                                                                                                                                             \nAgreement that were allegedly breached: sections 16.1 (concerning assignments), 9.4 (concerning \nlabeling) and 3.1(a) and (c) (concerning commercially reasonable efforts to develop the market and \npromotion of sales and use of Vortex).  Chemtura's brief and oral argument in opposition to the Motion \nraise several new factual issues concerning Bayer's  performance under the Chemtura Agreement.  These \nnewly alleged breaches were not included in the Not ice to Bayer.  The Chemtura Agreement, however, \nexplicitly provides that a party may only terminate the contract for material breaches as to which notice is \ngiven with reasonable particularity so as to give the other party an opportunity to cure.  Regarding these \nnewly alleged breaches, Chemtura gave Bayer no notice and no opportunity to cure.  Consequently, the \nnewly alleged breaches cannot support Chemtura's te rmination of the Chemtura Agreement, and the \ncourt will only look to the issues raised by Chemtura in the Notice to determine whether Chemtura's \ntermination of the Chemtura Agreement was proper. \n45  Chemtura sent the Notice on March 15, 2012.  On Ap ril 12, 2012, Bayer responded, denying \nChemtura's allegations that a breach had occurred.  On April 24, 2012, forty days after giving notice, \nChemtura notified Bayer that it was terminating the Chemtura Agreement, effective April 30, 2012, as a  \nresult of Bayer's failure to cure.  Millen Aff., Ex. 5. \n46  Chemtura Agreement § 16.1.  \nassignor in the particular subject of assignment, whereby the assignor is divested of all \ncontrol over the thing assigned.\"  Coastal Commercial Corp. v. Samuel Kosoff & Sons, \nInc. , 10 A.D.2d 372, 376 (N.Y. App. Div. 4th Dep't 1960). \n[35] Bayer contends that the Monsanto Agreement doe s not constitute an \nassignment of its obligations to Chemtura, but it is merely a standard supply agreement \nwhereby Bayer sells Vortex to Monsanto for use on corn seed.  Bayer further contends \nthat due to the consolidation that exists within the commercial corn seed industry, \nentering into an exclusive agreement to sell Vortex to Monsanto was the best option \navailable to promote the sale of the product. 47  \n[36] Bayer, even after entering into the Monsanto A greement, remained \nobligated to Chemtura to purchase a certain amount of Ipconazole for corn seed and \nperform all other obligations as required by Article III of the Chemtura Agreement, \nentitled \"Bayer's Obligations.\"  The court is persuaded that the Monsanto Agreement \nwas not an assignment of Bayer's obligations in that Bayer, and not Monsanto, was the \nparty that continued to purchase and pay for Ipconazole from Chemtura.  Additionally, \nthe Chemtura Agreement and Monsanto Agreement contain different terms, obligations \nand conditions.  See  971 Madison Ave. Corp. v. Complex Assocs. , 90 A.D.2d 758, 758-\n59 (N.Y.

The Chemtura \nAgreement and Monsanto Agreement also use a different calculus to determine \npurchase quantities and price.

These differentiating terms and conditions of the agreements are evidence \nthat the Monsanto Agreement is a sales contract, rather than an assignment. \n[38] There is no evidence in the record that Bayer manifested an intent to \ntransfer its obligations under the Chemtura Agreement, and it appears that Bayer \nremains the primary obligor with respect to all portions of the Chemtura Agreement.  \nMoreover, the court is unable to conclude at this preliminary stage that Bayer's decision \nto enter into the Monsanto Agreement was not a commercially reasonable effort to \ndevelop the market for and promote the sale of Vortex.  As discussed, evidence is \nbefore the court that entering into the Monsanto Agreement, even on exclusive terms, \nmay have lead to greater sales of Vortex than if Bayer sold to smaller seed producers \nthat did not include Monsanto. 48  \n[39] Finally, the court is unable to conclude that Bayer violated the Chemtura \nAgreement's provisions dealing with labeling.  In pertinent part, the Chemtura \nAgreement provides that Vortex \"shall be sold by Bayer . . . under [its] own labels and \ntrademarks or trade names. . . .\"49   Under the Monsanto Agreement, Bayer sells Vortex \nto Monsanto under its own labels and trademarks or trade names. 50   Accordingly, it is \nunclear at this preliminary stage that Bayer has materially breached the \nlabeling/trademark provisions of the Chemtura Agreement.  \n[40] Therefore, based on the foregoing, the court C ONCLUDES that Bayer has \nshown a likelihood of success with regard to the issues of (a) whether Chemtura's \ntermination of the Chemtura Agreement on April 30, 2012, was improper and (b) \n                                                 \n48  Rick Turner Aff. ¶¶ 3-7. \n49  Chemtura Agreement § 9.4.  \n50  May Aff. ¶ 5.  \nwhether Bayer will prevail on the merits of its breach of contract Claim against \nChemtura. \nIrreparable Harm  \n[41] Bayer contends that if Chemtura is permitted t o terminate the Chemtura \nAgreement and stop providing Ipconazole, Bayer will be unable to (a) maintain its \nregistration for Vortex with the EPA, (b) fulfill its contractual obligations to Monsanto \nunder the Monsanto Agreement and (c) maintain customer goodwill, market share and \nits competitive position in the marketplace.  Bayer argues that the potential injury to it by \nChemtura's actions is material, indeterminate and irreparable should Chemtura \nterminate the Chemtura Agreement.  \n[42] The indeterminate nature of damages may consti tute irreparable harm.  \nA.E.P. Indus ., 308 N.C. at 406-07 (\"It is a basic principle of contract law that one factor \nused in determining the adequacy of a remedy at law for money damages is the \ndifficulty and uncertainty in determining the amount of damages to be awarded for \ndefendant's breach.\").  While not controlling, North Carolina federal courts have ruled \nthat harms such as the loss of \"customer goodwill\" and \"competitive positions, including \nthreatened loss of market share and threatened loss of existing and potential \ncustomers\" are the types of injuries that satisfy the irreparable harm requirement.  R.J. \nReynolds Tobacco Co. v. Mkt. Basket Food Stores, Inc. , No. 5:05-cv-253-V, 2007 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 6737, *34-35 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 30, 2007) (citing R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. \nv. Phillip Morris Inc ., 60 F. Supp. 2d 502, 509 (M.D.N.C. 1999)); Rauch Indus ., 2007 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 79311, at *5 (citing Multi-Channel TV Cable Co. v. Charlottesville \nQuality Cable Operating Co ., 22 F.3d 546, 552 (4th Cir. 1994)).  As recognized in those \ncases, these harms are not the type that a damages award at the end of trial would \nadequately cure.  Rauch Indus ., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79311, at *5.  Further, this court \npreviously has recognized that lost goodwill and future profits 51  under certain \ncircumstances may constitute irreparable harm for purposes of Rule 65.  GoRhinoGo, \nLLC v. Lewis , 2011 NCBC 38, ¶ 39 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 29, 2011) (citing Winnfield \nFood Sys., Inc. v. Hardees Food Sys., Inc ., No. 4:95-cv-5402 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 8, 1996)).  \n[43] Here, Bayer has demonstrated the threat of irr eparable harm in that \nChemtura's termination of the Chemtura Agreement would result in Bayer being unable \nto (a) maintain its registration for Vortex with the EPA, (b) fulfill its contractual \nobligations to Monsanto under the Monsanto Agreement and (c) maintain customer \ngoodwill, market share and its competitive position in the marketplace. 52   Accordingly, \nBayer has carried its burden of proof that it will be irreparably injured if an injunction is \nnot issued.  \nWeighing the Respective Interests  \n[44] As discussed above, Bayer contends that it wil l be materially harmed if \nChemtura stops performing under the Chemtura Agreement; meanwhile, Chemtura \nargues that it will be more significantly harmed if it is forced to continue performing \nunder the Chemtura Agreement.   \n                                                \n \n51  The court acknowledges that the loss of future profits alone may not be sufficient to constitute \nirreparable harm.  Indeed, loss of prospective profits may be a measure of contract damages.  Mosely & \nMosely Builders, Inc. v. Landin Ltd ., 87 N.C. App. 438, 446-47 (1987). The availabilit y and sufficiency of \nsuch monetary damages precludes an award of injunct ive relief.  See Bd. of Light , 49 N.C. App. at 423 \n(recognizing that when \"there is a full, complete, and adequate remedy at law, the equitable remedy of  an \ninjunction will not lie\").  However, the court concludes that the threatened loss of future profits under the \ncircumstances of this case, in combination with the various other losses alleged by Bayer, constitutes  \nevidence of irreparable harm.  \n52  May Aff. ¶¶ 9-10. \n[45] As reflected above, if Chemtura were allowed t o cease performing, \nBayer's potential damages, if it prevails at arbitration, would be significant and largely \nincalculable.  On the other hand, if Chemtura continues performance, it would be paid in \ndue course by Bayer for sales of Ipconazole.  If Chemtura ultimately prevails at \narbitration, then its contended damages – occasione d by lower sales and smaller \nmarket share than it would desire – would be mitiga ted by the Ipconazole sales, \nespecially if Bayer were to maintain Ipconazole purchases at volumes anticipated by the \nChemtura Agreement.53  \n[46] After weighing the respective interests of the  parties, the court concludes \nthat a preliminary injunction requiring continued sale of Ipconazole under the Chemtura \nAgreement pending final adjudication of this matter is likely to cause Chemtura \nmaterially less damage or injury than the harm faced by Bayer should the Chemtura \nAgreement be terminated now. \nSecurity  \n[47] Rule 65(c) requires that the granting of a pre liminary injunction shall be \nconditioned upon the giving of security by the applicant in a sum determined by the \ncourt to be proper for the payment of costs and damages that may be suffered by a \nparty ultimately determined to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.   \n[48] The parties dispute the amount of the bond tha t should be required as \nsecurity if a preliminary injunction is issued.  Chemtura contends that if it is forced to \ncontinue performance of the Chemtura Agreement, it will suffer an annual loss in excess \n                                                 \n53  Equity dictates that if a preliminary injunction is issued with regard to Ipconazole sales, Bayer als o \nshould perform fully under the Chemtura Agreement.  It would be fundamentally inequitable for Bayer to \nreceive Ipconazole from Chemtura without Bayer being compelled to perform its own obligations under \nthe Chemtura Agreement. \n \nof $11 million.  Chemtura requests that the bond amount be sufficient to cover its \nanticipated losses should Chemtura be required to continue performing under the \nChemtura Agreement.  To the contrary, Bayer contends that it should only be required \nto post a bond that amounts to Bayer's annual sales of Vortex, which is approximately \n$1.5 million.  However, Chemtura's contended damages, should it ultimately prevail on \nthe merits of this matter, are based upon damages contentions substantially beyond the \namount of annual sales by it to Bayer. \n[49] Accordingly, at this time, the court concludes  that a posting by Bayer of \nsecurity in the amount of $3 million would be reasonable and appropriate as a condition \nof granting the preliminary injunctive relief sought by the Motion.  However, the security \nrequirement is subject to an increase or reduction in amount, depending on the parties' \nsubmissions on this issue, which will be complete by Friday, July 20, 2012.  The court \nwill carefully consider the parties' submissions, and at a later time will determine \nwhether the amount of security should be modified.  \nNOW THEREFORE, based on the foregoing FINDINGS of FACT and \nCONCLUSIONS of LAW, it hereby is ORDERED that: \n[50] Plaintiff Bayer CropScience LP's Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is \nGRANTED.  \n[51] Effective upon the date of this Opinion and Or der, and until final resolution \nof this civil action or until otherwise ordered by this court, Chemtura and its officers, \nagents, servants, employees, attorneys and those persons in active concert or \nparticipation with Chemtura who receive actual notice of this Opinion and Order are (a) \nRESTRAINED, ENJOINED and FORBIDDEN from failing to comply with the terms of \nthe Chemtura Agreement, and (b) ORDERED to sell Ipconazole to Bayer as provided in \nthe Chemtura Agreement. \n[52] Further, effective upon the date of this Opini on and Order, and until final \nresolution of this civil action or until otherwise ordered by this court, Bayer and its \nofficers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and those persons in active concert or \nparticipation with Bayer who receive actual notice of this Opinion and Order are (a) \nRESTRAINED, ENJOINED and FORBIDDEN from failing to comply with the terms of \nthe Chemtura Agreement and (b) ORDERED to purchase and pay for Ipconazole from \nChemtura at a volume no lower on an annual basis than is contemplated by section 6.1 \nof the Chemtura Agreement. \n[53] Pursuant to the provisions of Rule 65(c), and as a condition of this Opinion \nand Order, on or before July 17, 2012, at 5:00 p.m., Bayer shall post security \n(\"Security\") in the amount of THREE MILLION DOLLARS ($3,000,000).  Said Security \nshall be in the form of a surety bond or other undertaking satisfactory to the Clerk of \nSuperior Court of Durham County, for the payment of such costs and damages as may \nbe incurred or suffered by Chemtura if it is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \nrestrained by this Opinion and Order. \n[54] This Opinion and Order is only intended to pre serve the status quo \nbetween Bayer and Chemtura during the pendency of this litigation; except as \nspecifically ordered herein, this Opinion and Order shall not be construed to affect the \nrights, obligations or liabilities of either party under the Chemtura Agreement. \n[55] Except as granted by the terms of this Opinion  and Order, the Motion is \nDENIED. \n This the 13th day of July, 2012, at 4:59 p.m.  \n "
