(Compl. \n¶ 12.) \n{5} Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC (“WCM”) is a Delaware limited liability \ncompany with its principal place of business in Mecklenburg County, North \nCarolina.  (Compl. ¶ 13.)1   \n{6} WCM is a Wachovia affiliate. (14 Mar. 2007 Harkness Aff. ¶ 2.) \n                                                 \n1 On 28 February 2008, Plaintiffs amended their Complaint to clarify that WCM is a single member \nLLC with three individual managers. \n \n{7} Defendants are all foreign entities, none of whom maintain offices in this \nstate.  According to Plaintiffs, however, “[e]ach of the defendants has engaged in \nbusiness in North Carolina through dealings with the Charlotte office of Wachovia, \nas Administrative Agent for the lending syndicate, and otherwise.”  (Compl. ¶ 28.) \n{8} Plaintiffs’ Complaint (filed on 14 March 2007) identifies Defendants \nHarbinger Capital Partners Master Fund I Ltd., Aurelius Capital Master, Ltd., \nAurelius Capital Partners, LP, Schultze Master Fund, Ltd., UBS Willow Fund, \nLLC, Arrow Distressed Securities Fund, and Latigo Master Fund, Ltd., collectively, \nas the “Fund Defendants.”  (Compl. ¶ 6.) \n{9} The Complaint identifies the remaining Defendants (Harbinger Capital \nPartners Offshore Manager, LLC, Aurelius Capital Management, LP, Aurelius \nCapital GP, LLC, Bond Street Capita1 LLC, and Latigo Partners, LP, collectively, \nas the “Agent Defendants.”  (Compl. ¶ 51.)   \nB. \nTHE CLAIMS \n1. \nTHE CREDIT AGREEMENT \n{10} This case arises out of Wachovia’s role as administrative agent for a $285 \nmillion loan commitment (“the Credit Agreement”) made to Le-Nature's, Inc. (“Le-\nNature’s” or the “Company”), a Pennsylvania entity that at one time was in the \nbusiness of developing and marketing bottled water and other noncarbonated \nbeverages.  (14 Mar. 2007 Harkness Aff. ¶ 3, Exs. G, K.)    \n{11} Wachovia funded a portion of the Credit Agreement directly and created a \nsyndicate of lenders to fund the balance (hereinafter the “Credit Facility”).2  (Compl. \n¶ 4; 14 Mar. 2007 Harkness Aff. ¶ 5.) \n                                                 \n2 As Defendants explained in their letter requesting assignment of this case to the Business Court, \n“[i]n the syndicated loan market, a lender issues large loans to borrowers by breaking the larger \noverall loan into smaller ‘syndicated’ pieces, thus diluting any one lender’s exposure on the debt.”  \nLetter from C. Richard Rayburn, Jr., counsel for Defendants, to the Honorable Robert P. Johnston, \nSenior Resident Superior Court Judge (Apr. 25, 2007). \n{12} Although not a party to the Credit Facility, WCM served as Lead Arranger \nand Sole Bookrunner for the transaction.3  (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 4.) \n{13} The syndicate of lenders were assigned their interests in the Credit \nFacility after executing a form Commitment Transfer Supplement (the \n“Supplement”), which was included as an exhibit to the Credit Agreement. (14 Mar. \n2007 Harkness Aff. ¶ 5.)  \n{14} Le-Nature’s is now bankrupt, following the discovery of a massive fraud \napparently perpetrated by the Company’s management which, among other things, \ninvolved the dissemination of inflated profit reports (and related false financial \nstatements) to the public, including Le-Nature’s creditors. (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 4, 44–47.) \n2. \nPLAINTIFFS’ CONTENTIONS \n{15} Plaintiffs allege the Fund Defendants (acting in some instances by and \nthrough the Agent Defendants) purchased certain interests in the Credit Facility \nfrom various original syndicate lenders, after news of Le-Nature’s fraud became \npublic.  (Compl. ¶ 2; 14 Mar. 2007 Harkness Aff. ¶¶ 13, 15.)  \n{16} Plaintiffs further allege the Fund Defendants acquired their interests in \nthe Credit Facility with an eye toward pursuing contract and tort claims against \nPlaintiffs as a result of Le-Nature’s financial demise.  (Compl. ¶ 2.)  \n{17}  According to Plaintiffs, the Fund Defendants obtained their interests in \nthe Credit Facility by executing Supplements and, in so doing, became parties to the \nCredit Agreement.  (Compl. ¶ 39.)   \n{18} The Credit Agreement states that North Carolina law shall govern the \n“rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement.”  (14 Mar. 2007 \nHarkness Aff. Ex. A § 9.13.) \n{19} Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit following Defendants’ public proclamations of \ntheir intent to “hold Wachovia and WCM responsible for losses caused . . . by the Le-\nNature's fraud.”  (Compl. ¶ 2.) \n                                                 \n3 Essentially, WCM was the lead underwriter and custodian of the relevant books and records for the \nCredit Facility. (14 Mar. 2007 Harkness. Aff. ¶¶ 5, 7, 15.)  \n{20} Plaintiffs contend the Fund Defendants’ acquisition of interests in the \nCredit Facility is governed by North Carolina law, which (they say) “flatly” \nprohibits the assignment of tort claims.  (Compl. ¶ 2.)  \n{21} Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment from this Court as to \nthe effectiveness and enforceability under North Carolina law of any tort claims \npurportedly assigned to the Fund Defendants (either directly or through their \nagents) under the Credit Facility.  (Compl. ¶ 9.) \n{22} Plaintiffs also assert affirmative claims for champerty, maintenance,4 and \nunfair and deceptive trade practices, based on the Fund Defendants’ acquisition of \ntort claims under the Credit Facility.  (Compl. ¶¶ 81–92, 100–06.)   \n{23} Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, Wachovia also seeks indemnification \nfrom the Fund Defendants for a portion of the over $1 million in expenses and costs \nit claims to have incurred as administrative agent in connection with Le-Nature’s \nbankruptcy proceedings.  (Compl. ¶ 8.)  \n3. \nDEFENDANTS’ CONTENTIONS \n{24} Defendants dispute this Court’s jurisdiction over them, alleging they have \nno contacts with North Carolina sufficient to require them to defend against \nPlaintiffs’ claims in this state.  \n{25} As to the substance of the claims, the Fund Defendants contend there is \nnothing untoward about the manner in which they acquired their interests in the \nCredit Facility.   \n{26} Defendants assert that trading in “distressed debt”5 is an established part \nof the commercial loan industry.  Defendants state that such trading is \n                                                 \n4 “‘[M]aintenance’ [is] an officious intermeddling in a suit, which in no way belongs to one, by \nmaintaining or assisting either party with money or otherwise to prosecute or defend it. ‘Champerty’ \nis a form of maintenance whereby a stranger makes a bargain with a plaintiff or defendant to divide \nthe land or other matter sued for between them if they prevail at law, whereupon the champertor is \nto carry on the party’s suit at his own expense.”  \nWright v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 63 N.C. App. \n465, 469, 305 S.E.2d 190, 192 (1983) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  \n5 “Distressed debt” is debt that “is or is perceived to be in some degree of financial distress that \nimpairs the prospects of full and timely repayment.”  (21 Mar. 2007 Ganz Aff. ¶ 6.)   \naccomplished through standardized practices developed as part of a national \nsecondary loan market.6  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Stay 5–6.) \n{27} According to Defendants, the organization at the forefront of efforts to \nmore efficiently manage the secondary loan market is the Loan Syndications and \nTrading Association (the “LSTA”), which Defendants describe as a non-profit trade \nassociation “dedicated to the promotion and orderly development of a fair, efficient, \nliquid, and professional trading market for commercial loans.”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. \nMot. Stay 5.) \n{28} Defendants allege they purchased their interests in the Credit Facility \npursuant to “standard terms and conditions” established by the LSTA (the \n“Standard Terms”), and that such terms require (among other things) the \napplication of New York law to the assignment of rights in the Credit Facility.  \n(Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Stay 6; 14 Mar. 2007 Harkness Aff. Ex. H.) \nC. \nTHE TRO AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n{29} On the same day Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, they moved for and \nobtained a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) enjoining Defendants from \n“asserting, filing, prosecuting, attempting to assign or re-assign, or otherwise \npursuing any Personal Tort Claims against Plaintiffs or any of their agents . . . that \narise from or relate in any respect to credit extended by any entity to Le-Nature’s \nInc.”  (TRO 6.) \n{30} The TRO defines “Personal Tort Claims” broadly to include \neach and every of the following statutory or common law claims or \ncauses of action, whether under the law of North Carolina or of any \nother state :  (i) claims for fraudulent  and negligent omissions or \nmisrepresentations, or both, (ii) claims alleging constructive fraud, (iii) \nnegligence claims, (iv) breach of fiduciary duty claims, (v) tortious \ninterference claims, (vi) unfair trad e practice claims, (vii) racketeering \nclaims, (viii) conspiracy with respect to or to commit any of the \naforelisted claims, or to commit any other wrongful act or omission, \n                                                 \n6 Defendants assert that “[i]n 2006, the volume of the U.S. secondary loan trading market was \napproximately $239 billion, of which . . . $40 billion or 17% was ‘distressed debt.’”  (21 Mar. 2007 \nGanz Aff. ¶ 6.) \nand (ix) aiding or abetting with respect to or to commit any of the \naforelisted claims, or to commit any other wrongful act or omission.   \n \n(TRO 6–7 (emphasis added).) \n \n{31} On 12 April 2007, Superior Court Judge Robert C. Ervin converted the \nTRO into a preliminary injunction, which effectively enjoined Defendants from \npursuing their Personal Tort Claims against Plaintiffs in any court other than this \none. \n{32} Following entry of the preliminary injunction, this case was transferred to \nthe North Carolina Business Court.    \nD. \nTHE NEW YORK ACTION \n{33} On 17 September 2007 (six months after Plaintiffs filed suit in North \nCarolina), seven of the eight original Fund Defendants,7 along with ten other \nparties who purchased interests in the Credit Facility (either directly from \nPlaintiffs in the syndication process or in the secondary loan market), filed an 85-\npage complaint in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York \n(the “SDNY”) against WCM, BDO Seidman, LLC (Le-Nature’s independent \nauditors) and two of Le-Nature’s senior corporate officers (hereinafter the “New \nYork Action”).8 \n{34} Defendants allege in the New York Action that “[WCM], unlike \n[Defendants], knew about Le-Nature’s’ improper practices and struggling finances \nlong before completion of the . . . Credit Facility, yet chose to press forward with the \nloan and its syndication to advance its own agenda, as well as that of its affiliates.”9  \n(N.Y. Compl. ¶ 5.)   \n                                                 \n7 Defendants Taconic Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Taconic Capital Management, LLC, have settled \nwith Plaintiffs and thus, are no longer parties to the North Carolina action.  (Pls.’ Mot. Contempt 2.) \n8 Wachovia is not a named defendant in the New York Action. \n9 That agenda (according to Defendants) included WCM’s “strong desire to build up its fledging high-\nyield bond business, which was dependent on generating financing transactions for mid-market \ncompanies such as Le-Nature’s.”  (N.Y. Compl. ¶ 59.)   To that end, WCM was willing (again \naccording to Defendants) to “expand its high-yield underwriting business through quantity, rather \nthan quality, and was willing to underwrite deals that other banks were not even willing to consider \n{35} Put bluntly, Defendants allege that WCM “knew that Le- Nature’s was \nengaging in fraud.”  (N.Y. Compl. ¶ 6.)  \n{36} The Fund Defendants allege a single claim for relief against WCM in the \nNew York Action:  conspiracy to commit racketeering activity, in violation of the \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). \n(N.Y. Compl. ¶¶ 198–205.) \n{37} The remaining plaintiffs in the New York Action have also sued WCM for \n(1) fraud, (2) aiding and abetting fraud, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4) \ncivil conspiracy.  (N.Y. Compl. ¶¶ 206–36, 273–83.) \n{38} The Fund Defendants contend they have toed a fine line in the New York \nAction, in purported deference to Judge Ervin’s preliminary injunction order. \n{39} Construing the preliminary injunction as only prohibiting them from \npursuing state law tort claims against Plaintiffs in another jurisdiction, the Fund \nDefendants assert they have complied with that restriction in the New York Action \nby only alleging (as against WCM) a single count of conspiracy to violate the federal \nRICO statute.10 \n{40} Defendants now move to stay this case in light of what they describe as “a \nsingle, more comprehensive action [in New York] asserting affirmative claims \nagainst [WCM] and other defendants arising out of the fraud perpetrated at Le-\nNature’s, Inc.”  (Defs.’ Mot. Stay 1.)   \n{41} Alternatively, Defendants move to dismiss the Complaint entirely, \nasserting that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nbecause of their relatively low credit quality.”  (N.Y. Compl. ¶ 60 (emphasis in original).) \n10 Defendants also spill much ink in their lengthy federal complaint attempting to convince the \nSDNY of the purported errors committed by Judge Ervin in his preliminary injunction order.  Not \nonly do these allegations ignore black-letter law as to the proper form of pleadings, see, e.g., Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 8 (requiring only a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is \nentitled to relief”), they are also entirely gratuitous as—unless this Court missed the memo \nannouncing the demise of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine—the SDNY is in no position to review or \nopine upon the orders and judgments of Judge Ervin.  \nSee D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 \nU.S. 462, 482 (1983) (stating that a federal district court has no authority to review state court \njudgments); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415–16 (1923) (holding that district courts do \nnot have appellate jurisdiction over state courts).  \n \n{42} Plaintiffs resist these motions and have moved that the Court find \nDefendants in civil contempt for lodging a federal RICO conspiracy claim against \nWCM in New York, asserting that the filing of the claim violates Judge Ervin’s \npreliminary injunction order.11 \n \nII. \nLEGAL PRINCIPLES \nA. \nMOTION TO STAY \n{43} This Court’s authority to stay a pending action is found at section 1-75.12 \nof the North Carolina General Statutes, which states: \nIf, in any action pending in any court of this State, the judge shall find \nthat it would work substantial injustice for the action to be tried in a \ncourt of this State, the judge on motion of any party may enter an \norder to stay further proceedings in the action in this State.  A moving \nparty under this subsection must stipulate his consent to suit in \nanother jurisdiction found by the judge to provide a convenient, \nreasonable and fair place of trial. \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-75.12 (2007). \n{44} The decision to grant or deny a stay “is a matter within the sound \ndiscretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of \nthat discretion.”  Lawyers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. of N.C. v. Nexsen Pruet Jacobs & \nPollard, 112 N.C. App. 353, 356, 435 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1993) (citation omitted).   \n{45} In determining whether to grant a stay under section 1-75.12 of the North \nCarolina General Statutes, the trial court may consider the following factors:   \n(1) the nature of the case, (2) the co nvenience of the witnesses, (3) the \navailability of compulsory process to produce witnesses, (4) the relative \nease of access to sources of proof, (5) the applicable law, (6) the burden \nof litigating matters not of local concern, (7) the desirability of \nlitigating matters of local concern in  local courts, (8) convenience and \n                                                 \n11 WCM advised the Court at the hearing of this matter that it has moved to dismiss the claims \npending against it in New York.  As of the entry of this Order, however, the Court is unaware of any \naction taken by the SDNY on WCM’s motion. \n \naccess to another forum, (9) choice of forum by the plaintiff, and (10) all \nother practical considerations. \nId.   \n{46} A trial court is not obligated to consider each enumerated factor, nor is it \nnecessary that the court find that all factors positively support a stay.  Id. at 357, \n435 S.E.2d at 574. \n{47} Instead, the court acts within its discretion as long as it considers whether \n“(1) a substantial injustice would result if the trial court denied the stay, (2) the \nstay is warranted by those factors present, and (3) the alternative forum is \nconvenient, reasonable, and fair.”  Id. \nB. \nDISSOLVING/MODIFYING A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n{48} A preliminary injunction order is interlocutory in nature, A.E.P. Indus., \nInc. v. McClure, 308 N.C. 393, 400, 302 S.E.2d 754, 759 (1983), and is a matter \ngenerally left to the sound discretion of the trial court.  In re Albright, 278 N.C. 664, \n669, 180 S.E.2d 798, 802 (1971). \n{49} As such, one superior court judge may modify or dissolve a preliminary \ninjunction order entered by another judge only upon a clear showing of changed \nconditions since the entry of the order.  See Stone v. Martin, 69 N.C. App. 650, 652, \n318 S.E.2d 108, 110 (1984) (stating general rule as to modification of interlocutory \norders by a different judge).  But see Ruff v. Parex, Inc., 1999 NCBC 6 ¶ 38 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. June 17, 1999), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/1999%20NCBC \n%206.htm (suggesting that transfer of a case to the North Carolina Business Court \nfor management through trial may by itself be sufficient grounds to allow \nmodifications of orders entered by a predecessor judge).  \n{50} “The burden of showing the change in circumstances is on the party \nseeking a modification or reversal of an order previously entered by another judge.”  \nFirst Fin. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Coverage, Inc., 154 N.C. App. 504, 507, 572 S.E.2d \n259, 262 (2002).   \n \n \n \n \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n{51} The Court has carefully considered the factors deemed relevant by our \nappellate courts when ruling on a motion to stay.   \n{52} In that regard, the Court is mindful that these factors are not intended to \nbe a “rigid checklist in determining whether to grant a stay.”  Lawyers Mut., 112 \nN.C. App. at 357, 435 S.E.2d at 574. \n{53} This case proves the wisdom of that admonition, as the record here is \nsilent as to most of the factors.  Nevertheless, what evidence is available on the \nquestion leads me to conclude that a stay is appropriate.    \n{54} First, the Court acknowledges that Plaintiffs have strong ties to North \nCarolina.  Wachovia is a national banking association, but it maintains its principal \nplace of business in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Similarly, while WCM is a \nDelaware limited liability company, it too maintains its principal place of business \nin Charlotte, North Carolina. \n{55} As for the nature of the case, the parties agree that Le Nature’s \nperpetrated a massive fraud in obtaining financing for its operations, including the \nCredit Agreement at issue here.  Where the parties diverge, however, is over who \nshould bear responsibility for that fraud. \n{56} Plaintiffs allege that the Fund Defendants, all of whom are foreign entities \nwith (it appears) sporadic connections to this state, acquired interests in the Credit \nFacility for the express purpose of laying the blame for Le-Nature’s fraud at \nPlaintiffs’ door. \n{57} According to Plaintiffs, however, they too were victimized by Le Nature’s \nwhen they extended over $17 million in credit to the Company in reliance on \n“audited financial statements and other information indicating that Le-Nature’s \nwas a growing, vibrant, and profitable company.”  (Compl. ¶ 1.)   \n{58} Not surprisingly, Defendants have a different view of the Le Nature’s \ndebacle.  They allege that WCM actively concealed Le Nature’s fraud because, \namong other things, it “knew that, had the real situation at Le Nature’s been \nrevealed, it would have been unable to syndicate the [Credit Facility]” and thus, \nwould have been unable to foist off its exposure for the debt to the unsuspecting \nsyndicate lenders.  (N.Y. Compl. ¶ 7.)    \n{59} Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit to preempt Defendants’ threats to sue them in \ntort for the financial losses caused by Le-Nature’s demise.  In their Complaint, \nPlaintiffs insist that, “Defendants’ assertion of such purportedly assigned causes of \naction amounts to illegal trafficking in litigation claims and is flatly prohibited by \nNorth Carolina law.”  (Compl. ¶ 2.) \n{60} Defendants respond that New York law governs the scope of their rights in \nthe Le-Nature’s debt acquired in the secondary loan market.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nStay 5–6.) \n{61} On these facts, and nothing else appearing, North Carolina generally \nwould have a strong interest in resolving a dispute involving businesses with a \nsubstantial presence in this State. \n{62} This is particularly so where Plaintiffs have chosen their home forum to \nlitigate.  See Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas, 2006 \nNCBC 8 ¶ 51 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 2, 2006), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net \n/opinions/2006%20NCBC%208.htm (stating that courts generally give great \ndeference to a plaintiff’s choice of forum, particularly where the plaintiff selected its \nhome forum to bring suit). \n{63} But the posture of this case, when viewed in the context of the broader \nlitigation pending in New York, leads me to conclude that a stay is appropriate. \n{64} Plaintiffs’ primary claim is that the Fund Defendants have no right under \nNorth Carolina law to sue them in tort for claims purportedly acquired in the \nsecondary loan market.  According to Plaintiffs, they felt compelled to sue after the \nFund Defendants threatened publicly to sue them for the losses caused by Le-\nNature’s fraud.  \n{65} In short, rather than call the Fund Defendants’ bluff, Plaintiffs filed what \nis primarily a preemptive declaratory judgment action in North Carolina, thus \nguaranteeing the very fight they profess to have wanted to avoid, but in a forum \nmore to their liking.   \n{66} Against this backdrop, Plaintiffs’ choice of forum is not entitled to \nsubstantial weight.  See Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol. v. Durham Coca-Cola \nBottling Co., 141 N.C. App. 569, 579, 541 S.E.2d 157, 164 (2000) (“[I]n situations in \nwhich two suits involving overlapping issues are pending in separate jurisdictions, \npriority should not necessarily be given to a declaratory suit simply because it was \nfiled earlier.  Rather, if the plaintiff in the declaratory suit was on notice at the time \nof filing that the defendant was planning to file suit, a court should look beyond the \nfiling dates to determine whether the declaratory suit is merely a strategic \nmaneuver to achieve a preferable forum.”). \n{67} Second, Plaintiffs’ claims in this Court are predominately questions of law.  \nMore particularly, whether the Fund Defendants will be allowed to assert tort \nclaims against Plaintiffs that they acquired via assignment of a portion of the \nCredit Facility will be for a judge to decide.  See Stetser v. TAP Pharm. Prods. Inc., \n165 N.C. App. 1, 14, 598 S.E.2d 570, 579 (2004) (holding that a trial court’s \napplication of conflict of law rules is a legal conclusion). \n{68} Consequently, that WCM may now have to litigate that issue as a \nDefendant in the New York Action, rather than as a Plaintiff in North Carolina, \ndoes not, in the Court’s view, amount to material prejudice.   \n{69} Third, the Court’s analysis cannot ignore a comparison of the cast of \ncharacters and claims in the two actions.  As Defendants note in their papers, this \nCourt has before it only a subset of the issues pending in New York.  In contrast, \nthe New York Action involves the seven remaining Fund Defendants, thirteen \nadditional parties not before this Court, and nine affirmative claims not yet \nasserted in North Carolina.  \n{70} And while it is true that Wachovia is not a named defendant in the New \nYork Action, “[t]o grant a stay, it is not required that the parties and issues in both \nactions be identical.  Substantial or functional identity is sufficient.”12  AT&T Corp. \nv. Prime Sec. Distribs., Inc., No. 15177, 1996 Del. Ch. LEXIS 134, at * 6 (Del. Ch. \nOct. 24, 1996). \n{71} Here, although Wachovia is not a party to the New York Action, its \naffiliate WCM certainly is.  For that reason, I have little doubt that Wachovia’s \ninterests will be adequately protected in New York, and that the New York Action \nwill fully and finally resolve this dispute.  \n{72} Additionally, the core premise of Plaintiffs’ Complaint is that Defendants \nhave no right to sue them for Le-Nature’s financial implosion.  For whatever reason, \nDefendants have heeded that message in New York as to Wachovia.  Thus, \nWachovia’s cry of foul because Defendants have not done what Wachovia insists \nthey have no right to do is not particularly compelling.  The more relevant \ndifference between the New York Action and this one is that the former is far \nbroader in scope, both as to parties and claims. \n{73} With respect to the other factors deemed relevant to the question before \nme, although neither side presents any evidence on the point, the Court may safely \nassume that at least some of the relevant witnesses are current or former \nemployees of the parties, who presumably are under the parties’ control and thus \nwould appear for trial in North Carolina or New York.  \n{74} On the other hand, to the extent testimony is required from present or \nformer Le Nature’s employees, such witnesses would not be within the control of the \nparties and, unless otherwise subject to the court’s jurisdiction, could not be \ncompelled to testify in either state.  \n{75} The parties’ briefs are also replete with argument, but little evidence, as to \nthe relative ease of access to sources of proof. \n                                                 \n12 None of the Agent Defendants is a party in the New York Action.  This omission, however, is of no \ngreat consequence, given that the Agent Defendants hold no direct interests in the Credit Facility \nand therefore have no claims to pursue against Plaintiffs arising from that transaction.  In any \nevent, despite the lack of perfect symmetry as to parties, the Court is satisfied that the competing \nactions are at least substantially identical.      \n \n{76} Just as with witness testimony, however, at least some of the relevant \ndocuments are likely within the control of the parties, and thus would be readily \naccessible to all parties, regardless of where the issues are tried.  As for documents \nwithin Le-Nature’s control (or that of other third-parties), neither this Court nor the \nSDNY hold any particular advantage, as both have procedures available to compel \nproduction of evidence by third-parties.  Accordingly, the locations of sources of \nproof do not clearly point to one jurisdiction as more or less convenient, particularly \nsince it appears the parties have substantial financial resources to expend on \nlitigation. \n{77} Relying on Green v. Wilson, 163 N.C. App. 186, 592 S.E.2d 579 (2004), \nPlaintiffs contend that a stay would be improper “because this Court has already \nasserted jurisdiction over the tort claims against Wachovia that the defendants \nhave attempted to trade by assignments.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Stay 10.) \n{78} Green, however, involved a dispute over title to real property located in \nNorth Carolina.  The precise question in that case was whether the trial court could \nproperly consider a motion to stay in favor of an action pending in Georgia, where \nNorth Carolina had exclusive in rem jurisdiction over the real property.  Green, 163 \nN.C. App. at 188, 592 S.E.2d at 581.  \n{79} The Court of Appeals held that a stay was never appropriate in such \ncircumstances, because “[w]hen title to property is determined, only the court with \nin rem jurisdiction may serve as a proper forum.”  Id. at 190–91, 592 S.E.2d at 582. \n{80} Plaintiffs’ attempt to apply the Green holding to the facts before me, \nhowever, is the legal equivalent of attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole. \n{81} In the first place, unlike the plaintiffs in Green, Plaintiffs here do not \ncontend they own the assigned tort claims; “[r]ather, they are . . . attempting to \nprevent Defendants from pursuing these claims.”  (Defs.’ Br. Opp’n. Pls. Mot. \nContempt. 10.)   \n{82} Second, in issuing his preliminary injunction order, Judge Ervin did not \nassert jurisdiction over a res (at least not in the sense that a court asserts exclusive \nauthority over property within its territorial jurisdiction), but instead acted only to \ntemporarily enjoin the Fund Defendants from pursuing their tort claims against \nPlaintiffs (except in this Court) to prevent a multiplicity of suits related to the \nassigned claims.  (Prelim. Inj. Order ¶¶ 17–18.) \n{83} Third, unlike the real property dispute in Green, Plaintiffs cannot credibly \nargue that this Court has exclusive jurisdiction over the claims or the parties before \nit.  \n{84} Accordingly, Green is of little utility here.  \n{85} Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants’ Motion to Stay “rests on the false \nassumption all of the disputes between the parties here can be and will be \nadjudicated in New York.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Stay 2.)  This is because, according \nto Plaintiffs, none of their affirmative claims in this case are compulsory \ncounterclaims in the New York Action.  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Stay 2.) \n{86} But that argument proves too much, as the fact that Plaintiffs may not be \ncompelled to bring their claims in New York does not mean they are barred from \ndoing so.13  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(2)(A) (stating only that a pleader need not state \nan otherwise compulsory counterclaim “if [at the time] the [federal court] action was \ncommenced, the claim was the subject of another pending action”).    \n{87} In the end, whatever I do in North Carolina, the New York Action will \nproceed.  Accordingly, I find no good reason for expending precious judicial \nresources by insisting on the presentation of overlapping (if not identical) testimony \nand evidence in two jurisdictions.  As our Court of Appeals has aptly noted: \nThe declaratory remedy should not be invoked to try a controversy by \npiecemeal, or to try particular issues without settling the entire \n                                                 \n13 Wachovia’s separate claim for indemnification may not be asserted as a counterclaim in the New \nYork Action because Wachovia is not (at present) a party there.  But although Wachovia asserts that \nthe Credit Facility lenders owe it over $1 million in indemnification (Compl. ¶ 76), its claim in the \nNorth Carolina action lies only against three Defendants, for a total sum of $58,973.12.  (14 Mar. \n2007 Harkness Aff. Ex. I.)  In contrast, the New York Action alleges that the potential losses \nattributable to the Credit Facility are north of $165 million.  (N.Y. Compl. ¶ 4.)  Clearly then, the \nprimary dispute between the parties centers, not on Wachovia’s right to indemnity, but instead on \nthe Fund Defendants’ purported right to pursue their multi-million tort claims.  There is little doubt \nthat this latter issue can and will be addressed in New York.  Additionally, should Wachovia prefer \nto resolve its indemnity claim in a single action, nothing prevents it from assigning the claim to its \naffiliate WCM, who could then pursue it as a counterclaim in New York.   \n \ncontroversy.  This is especially so where a separate suit has been filed, \nor is likely to be filed, that will more fully encompass the scope of the \nentire controversy. \n \nCoca-Cola Bottling Co., 141 N.C. App. at 578, 541 S.E.2d at 163 (internal citation \nand quotation marks omitted). \n{88} Finally, the Court acknowledges the parties’ wildly divergent views as to \nthe choice of law applicable to the assignments at issue here.  Not surprisingly, both \nsides insist that the answer to this question is as plain as the nose on my face.   \n{89} This Court, however, has learned through experience that “to spell out the \nobvious is often to call it in question.”14  On this sparse record, and without the \nbenefit of fully developed arguments by the parties, I cannot say whether North \nCarolina or New York law applies to this dispute.   \n{90} Plaintiffs contend North Carolina law applies to the assignments because \nthat was the choice of law agreed to by the Fund Defendants under the Credit \nFacility.   \n{91} In that regard, the Court notes that the Supplements (which Plaintiffs rely \non as their “hook” for the application of North Carolina law), are somewhat \nambiguous on the point because, although they purport to limit assignments to the \nreach of applicable law, they also state that the interests being assigned include \n“contract claims, tort claims, malpractice claims, statutory claims and all other \nclaims at law or in equity related to the rights and obligations sold and assigned.”  \n(14 Mar. 2007 Harkness Aff. Ex. C.) \n{92} Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend this Court cannot honor the purported \nchoice of New York law in the Standard Terms because “[a] North Carolina court \nwill never apply foreign law if that law offends a fundamental public policy of this \nState—and application of foreign champerty law in this action would run afoul of \nthis basic principle.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Stay 15.) \n                                                 \n14 Eric Hoffer, The Passionate State of Mind, and other Aphorisms 122 (1955). \n \n{93} This statement, however, goes too far.  Our Supreme Court has indeed \nheld that “foreign law or rights based thereon will not be given effect or enforced if \nopposed to the settled public policy of the forum.”  Boudreau v. Baughman, 322 N.C. \n331, 342, 368 S.E.2d 849, 857 (1988) (citation omitted). \n{94} But subsequent cases applying this doctrine to contractual choice of law \nclauses have cited with approval the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187 \n(1971), which provides in pertinent part: \nThe law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual \nrights and duties will be applied, . . . unless either \n \n(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or \nthe transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties’ \nchoice, or \n \n(b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a \nfundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest \nthan the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and \nwhich, under the rule of § 188, woul d be the state of the applicable law \nin the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties. \n \nCable Tel Servs., Inc. v. Overland Contracting, Inc., 154 N.C. App. 639, 642–43, 574 \nS.E.2d 31, 33–34 (2002) (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187 \n(1971)). \n{95} Thus, before this Court even considers the public policy implications of \napplying New York law to this dispute, it would first need to determine whether \nNorth Carolina law would apply to the assignments had the Fund Defendants not \nchosen otherwise in the Standard Terms. \n{96} As to that question, “North Carolina has long adhered to the general rule \nthat ‘lex loci contractus,’ the law of the place where the contract is executed governs \nthe validity of the contract.”  Citibank, S.D., N.A. v. Palma, 646 S.E.2d 635, 638  \n(N.C. Ct. App. 2007) (citation omitted). \n{97} Given the number of assignments executed in this case, however, and the \nlimited record before me, I cannot say with any confidence what the answer to that \nquestion is.   \n{98} In Boudreau, our Supreme Court also held that North Carolina’s public \npolicy exception to the comity generally afforded the laws of our sister states is a \nnarrow one.  Thus, \nthe mere fact that the law of the forum differs from that of the other \njurisdiction does not mean that the foreign statute is contrary to the \npublic policy of the forum.  To render foreign law unenforceable as \ncontrary to public policy, it must violate some prevalent conception of \ngood morals or fundamental principle of natural justice or involve \ninjustice to the people of the forum state. \n \nBoudreau, 322 N.C. at 342, 368 S.E.2d at 857–58 (citations omitted). \n{99} No less relevant here is the basis for such a rule in the first place.  The \nnotion that North Carolina courts should not sacrifice important public policy \nnorms at the altar of a sister state’s jurisprudence makes perfect sense when a \nparty deliberately seeks to enforce its rights in this state.  As our Supreme Court \nhas explained: \nTo justify a court in refusing to enforce a right of action which accrued \nunder the law of another state , because against the policy of our laws, \nit must appear that it is against good morals or natural justice, or that \nfor some other such reason the enforcement of it would be prejudicial \nto the general interests of our own citizens. . . . The general rule is that \nwhen an action is transitory, and the right has become fixed and \nliability has been incurred in the state where the transaction \noccurred[,] \nsuch right of action may be pursued and such liability \nenforced in any court which has jurisdiction of such matters and can \nsecure jurisdiction of the parties, provided that the statute under \nwhich the cause of action arose is not inconsistent with the public \npolicy of the state in which the cause of action is sought to be enforced.   \n \nRodwell v. Camel City Coach Co., 205 N.C. 292, 295–96, 171 S.E. 100, 102 (1933) \n(emphasis added, internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \n{100} This case, however, is altogether different. \n{101} Here, it is Plaintiffs who—by virtue of having been the first to file in this \nstate—seek to invoke North Carolina’s public policy prohibiting champerty and \nmaintenance as a defensive measure to enjoin the Fund Defendants (none of whom \nhave ever sought to enforce their rights under the Credit Facility in North Carolina) \nfrom pursuing litigation against them. \n{102} As a result, this Court is not convinced that this state’s public policy would \nineluctably require the application of North Carolina law to the principal dispute \nbetween the parties.  In any event, if North Carolina law does apply, that decision \nshould be the result of an informed analysis of substantive choice of law rules, not \nan arbitrary race to a particular courthouse.   \n{103} In the New York Action (where Defendants do seek to enforce their rights \nunder the Credit Facility), the SDNY would apply New York’s traditional choice of \nlaw rules to resolve the question.  See, e.g., Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994, 1002 \n(2d Cir. 1989) (stating that a federal court adjudicating a supplemental state law \nclaim must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state).  \n{104} With respect to Defendants’ contention that the Standard Terms require \napplication of New York law, it is true that New York courts generally honor a \ncontractual choice of law clause, so long as “the jurisdiction chosen by the parties \nhas a substantial relationship to the parties or their performance.”  Woodling v. \nGarrett Corp., 813 F.2d 543, 551 (2d Cir. 1987). \n{105} Nevertheless, “[u]nder New York law . . . tort claims are outside the scope \nof contractual choice-of-law provisions that specify what law governs construction of \nthe terms of the contract.”  Dessert Beauty, Inc. v. Platinum Funding Corp., 519 F. \nSupp. 2d 410, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Fin. One Pub. Co. v. Lehman Bros. \nSpecial Fin., Inc., 414 F.3d 325, 335 (2d Cir. 2005)).  As a result, the Standard \nTerms do not dispose of the choice of law issue in this case.    \n{106}   Instead, it appears that “New York courts confronted with a choice of law \nissue in torts (including the validity of a purported assignment of tort claims) \nconduct an ‘interest analysis,’ assessing which of the competing jurisdictions has the \ngreatest interest in seeing its law applied to the matter at issue.”  Stichting Ter \nBehartiging Van De Belangen Van Oudaandeelhouders in Het Kapitaal Van \nSaybolt Int'l B.V. v. Schreiber, 407 F.3d 34, 50 (2d Cir. 2005) (citation omitted).15 \n{107} In Stichting, the question before the court was whether New Jersey or New \nYork law applied to the plaintiff’s assignment of a legal malpractice claim.  Id. at \n58. \n{108} As appears to be the case before me, the question in Stichting was \ndispositive because New Jersey law prohibits such assignments, while New York \nlaw authorizes them.  Id. at 47.   \n{109} Following a thorough exposition of the relevant legal principles, the court \nin Stichting concluded that New York choice of law principles provided no clear \nanswer, given that the “interests of the competing jurisdictions suggest[ed] \nconflicting results.”  Id. at 53.  The court therefore certified the question to the New \nYork Court of Appeals, but before that court could opine on the matter, the parties \nsettled their dispute.  Stichting Ter Behartiging Van De Belangen Van \nOudaandeelhouders in Het Kapitaal Van Saybolt Int'l B.V. v. Schreiber, 421 F.3d \n124, 125  (2d Cir. 2005). \n{110} Admittedly, Stichting raises more questions than it answers.  At a \nminimum, however, Stichting shows that even if (as Defendants insist), the \nassignments in this case are valid as a matter of New York law, that result does not \nforeclose the application of North Carolina law to any tort claims Defendants may \nattempt to pursue against WCM in the New York Action. \n{111}  The point of this brief foray into the choice of law thicket is to show that \nthe answer is not a “slam-dunk” for either side.  This much, however, is clear:  the \n                                                 \n15 I note that, “[i]n actions arising in tort, North Carolina applies the doctrine of “lex loci deliciti” \nmeaning that “the law of the state where the tort was allegedly committed controls the substantive \nissues of the case.”  Gbye v. Gbye, 130 N.C. App. 585, 585, 503 S.E.2d 434, 434 (1998).  At least one \nNorth Carolina federal court has suggested that North Carolina state courts would apply the “most \nsignificant relationship test” to claims involving multi-state misrepresentations.  See Jordan v. Shaw \nIndus., No. 6:93CV542, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17917, at *16–17 (M.D.N.C. August 13, 1996) (citing \nMichael v. Greene, 63 N.C. App. 713, 306 S.E.2d 144 (1983)).  Greene, however, addressed a choice of \nlaw issue arising in the context of an unfair and deceptive trade practices act claim.  My research \nhas disclosed no case where our appellate courts have applied this latter test to common law \nmisrepresentation claims. \n  \nSDNY is a court that routinely addresses complex business disputes and thus, is as \ncapable as any of sorting out the choice of law question in this case.  \n{112} I find that the SDNY is a fair and convenient forum for the litigation of the \nclaims before me.  I also reject the notion that granting Defendants’ Motion to Stay \n“simply shift[s] the inconvenience from one party to another.”  Sara Lee Corp. v. \nGregg, No: 1:02CV00195, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26985, at *15 (M.D.N.C. July 31, \n2002) (citation omitted).   \n{113} Instead, my decision merely recognizes the practical reality that the New \nYork Action is better able to arrive at a more comprehensive resolution of the \nlitigation, given the broader scope of claims and parties before it.  As a result, while \nthis Court is certainly capable of handling this case, judicial economy counsels \nagainst my proceeding further.  \n{114} In sum, I have determined that (1) a stay is warranted by those factors \npresent on the record before me, (2) the SDNY is a convenient, reasonable, fair, and \nmore comprehensive forum for the resolution of this litigation, and (3) it would work \na substantial injustice for this action to be tried in North Carolina. \n{115} In light of these findings, the Court modifies Judge Ervin’s preliminary \ninjunction order as specified below.  \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{116} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Stay, subject to the Court’s \nauthority pursuant to section 1-75.12(b) of the North Carolina General Statutes to \nmodify the stay order and take such other action as the interests of justice require.  \nFor example, should WCM prevail on its motion to dismiss in the New York Action, \nthe Court would obviously revisit its stay order. \n{117} The preliminary injunction entered by Judge Ervin is modified so as to \nallow the Fund Defendants to attempt to assert in the New York Action all claims \narising from their acquisition of interests in the Credit Facility. \n \n{118} To resolve the judicial “Whac-a-Mole” dilemma posited by Plaintiffs at oral \nargument and in their papers,16 that portion of Judge Ervin’s preliminary \ninjunction order barring Defendants from further assignment of Personal Tort \nClaims to entities not a party to this litigation, except on the express terms set forth \nin his order, shall remain in full force and effect. \n{119} The Court defers action at this time on the Motion for Contempt and the \nMotion to Dismiss, but this decision should not be construed by Defendants as an \nadjudication of the merits of either motion, which the Court reserves for a later \ndate. \nSO ORDERED this the 13th day of March, 2008. \n  \n                                                 \n16 For readers without young children, “Whac-a-Mole” is an arcade game involving mechanical moles \nthat pop up from their holes at random. “The object of the game is to force the individual moles back \ninto their holes by hitting them directly on the head with the mallet, thereby adding to the player's \nscore.  If the player does not strike a mole within a certain time or with enough force, it will \neventually sink back into its hole with no score.”  Wikapedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-\nMole (last visited March 6, 2008).  Plaintiffs contend the Court’s preliminary injunction order serves \nthe purpose of preventing Defendants from playing “Whac-a-Mole” with the tort claims by “simply \nassign[ing] their claims to other entities—effectively sending Wachovia on a completely futile and \nendless wild goose chase in search of the correct defendant to sue.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Stay 7.)  \nThe Court confesses to be a “Whac-a-Mole” aficionado, but it will enjoin any such amusement in this \ncase so as to allow a full and expeditious resolution of the claims in New York.    \n  \n  "
