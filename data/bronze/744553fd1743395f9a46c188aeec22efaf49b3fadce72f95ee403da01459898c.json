Plaintiff American Air Filter Company, Inc. (Plaintiff or “AAF”) is a \nglobal manufacturer of clean air products and equipment. AAF offers a wide range of \nproducts such as air filters, dust collection e quipment, and other filters and \nequipment for commercial buildings, data centers, healthcare facilities, food and \n                                                 \n1 The Court’s factual findings are for purposes of deciding the Motion only, and are not \nbinding in any subsequent proceedings.  Daimlerchrysler Corp. v. Kirkhart , 148 N.C. App. \n572, 578, 561 S.E.2d 276, 282 (2002) (quoting Kaplan v. Prolife Action League of Greensboro, \n111 N.C. App. 1, 16, 431 S.E.2d 828, 835 (1993)).  \n \n \nbeverage establishments, and schools. AAF is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, \nand does business in North Carolina, including Wake County. \n2. Defendant Camfil USA, Inc.  (“Camfil”) is a direct competitor of AAF.  \nCamfil also does business in North Carolina, including Wake County. \n3. Defendant Samuel C. Price, Jr. (“Price”) 2 is a resident of Johnston \nCounty. AAF hired Price in the position of Branch Manager on or around December \n11, 1989. (VFAC ¶ 28.)3 Price was assigned to AAF’s Raleigh, North Carolina branch. \nAAF later moved Price to the position of District Manager, but returned him to the \nposition of Ralei gh Branch Manager in 2001. Price was responsible for sales in \nvarious counties in the State of North Carolina, and after his return to the Branch \nManager, for three national accounts based in South Carolina. \n4. AAF’s “business is driven by relationships with its customers.” (Id. ¶ 8.) \nAAF has made “significant investment[s] in developing and enhancing relationships” \nwith its customers, and in “obtaining and compiling a substantial body of confidential \nand proprietary  information and trade secrets . . . critical to its ability to serve \nexisting and prospective” customers.  (Id. ¶¶ 11–12.) \n5. AAF maintains web -based tools called “Sales Playbook” and \n“Salesforce.com” in which it compiles confidential and proprietary information used \nin its sales efforts. (Id. ¶¶ 15, 16, 18.) Sales Playbook and Salesforce.com are password \n                                                 \n2 Price and Camfil are referred to collectively as “Defendants.” \n \n3 References to the allegations contained in the Verified First Amended Complaint, filed by \nPlaintiff on December 5, 2016, are denoted “VFAC.” \n \n \nprotected. As an additional security measure, Sales Playbook cannot be downloaded \nor printed. \n6. AAF also has a proprietary program called Total Cost of Ownership \nDiagnostics (“TCOD”).  TCOD “provides tec hnical data about AAF products and \ncompetitors’ products based on AAF’s internal and third -party testing and \nperformance studies.” (VFAC ¶ 17.). TCOD also calculates the costs of ownership of \nAAF’s products as compared to competitors’ products. TCOD is password protected. \n7. Plaintiff alleges that “[t]he specific trade secrets accessible through \nthese programs include,” inter alia: “secret and highly sensitive company-wide prices \nthat AAF corporate officers negotiated on behalf of AAF with its national account s”; \n“quoting tools that use proprietary algorithms to create custom quotes that \nincorporate prices AAF negotiated with national accounts, AAF’s custom discounts, \nand customer-specific needs”; “audit reports created by AAF sales professionals at the \nphysical location of customer facilities which include identification of customers’ \ncurrent air filtration products, sizes, specifications, and customer -specific issues or \ntalking points developed by AAF sales professionals”; “information on the costs of \ngoods so ld that could allow calculation of AAF profit margins ”; “technical \nspecifications and data that resulted from extensive internal and third-party product \ntesting and performance studies”; and “detailed drawings and product specifications \ncreated by AAF for new customer construction projects.” (Id. ¶ 18.) \n8. “AAF developed its trade secrets through decades of data collection, \nresearch, and business development.” (Id. ¶ 24.) \n \n \n9. AAF disables employee access to its systems and trade secrets \nimmediately upon an employee’s notice of resignation or termination, o r if the \nemployee notifies AAF that they are going to work for a competitor. \n10. Price “had access to and regularly relied on” AAF’s trade secrets, and \nAAF provided Price with information available only to AAF “insiders.” (Id. ¶¶ 35, 37.) \n11. At the time AAF hired Price, and through 2006, AAF and Price executed \nseveral employment agreements. On November 13, 2006, AAF and Price executed a \nwritten “Sales Representative Employment Agreement” (“2006 Agreement”). ( VFAC \n¶ 43, Ex. B.) The 2006 Agreement expressly stated that it superseded the previous \nagreements. Plaintiff contends that in exchange for Price’s commitments in the 2006 \nAgreement, AAF provided Price a 3.5% increase in salary and a “Sales Quota and \nContribution Margin Target” that were “materially different” from Price’s Sales \nQuota and Contribution Margin Target for 2005. (Id. ¶ 46.) Price contends that the \nsalary increase was not provided as part of the 2006 Agreement, but instead was a \n“standard cost of living/merit increase” provided to all AAF employees. (Price 1st Aff. \n¶ 20.) Price also claims he received no increased opportunity to earn commissions for \n2007, and that he earned less compensatio n in 2007 than he had in 2006. \nAdditionally, Defendants contend  that any consideration provided to Price  for the \n2006 Agreement was illusory because the 2006 Agreement expressly reserved to AAF \nthe right to unilaterally change the salary and commissions at any time. \n12. The 2006 Agreement contained a non -competition clause that provided \nas follows: \n \n \nIf the Employee terminates this Agreement or Company \nterminates this Agreement for cause, then in either event, \nfor a period of one (1) year after such termination, \nEmployee will not either on Employee’s own behalf or on \nbehalf o f any other person, firm, corporation or other \nentity, either directly or indirectly, (a) contact, for the \npurpose of diverting, any of Company’s customers or the \nAccounts; (b) solicit the trade of, or trade with any of \nCompany’s customers or the Accounts/Territory; (c) engage \nin any Competitive Business with the Accounts/Territory; \n(d) seek to cause any person, firm or corporation with whom \nthe Employee came in contact as a representative or \nCompany to refrain from doing business in whole or in part \nwith o r through Company; or (e) solicit or induce any \nemployee, current or future, of Company, to leave Company \nor to work for another individual. \n \n(VFAC ¶ 49; 2006 Agreement § 6.1.)   \n \n13. The 2006 Agreement was the final written employment agreement \nentered into b etween AAF and Price. Plaintiff alleges that the 2006 Agreement \n“automatically renewed for successive one-year periods” thereafter. (Id. ¶ 50.) \n14. In 2016, Price decided to leave his employment with AAF because of \nfrustrations with his level of compensation. (Price 1st Aff.  ¶ 44.) Price discussed \nemployment with Camfil in late July and early August, 2016. (Brunetti Aff. ¶ 5.) On \nJuly 24, 2016, a Camfil representative emailed to Price an offer of employment and a \nnon-disclosure agreement. Plaintiff alleges “ [u]pon information and belief, Price \nagreed as of July 24, 2016, to work for Camfil in the same capacity and for at least \nthe same territory as he worked for AAF.” ( VFAC ¶ 54.) Despite filing multiple \naffidavits with the Court in opposition to the Motion, Def endants have alleged only \nthat “Price did not accept the July 24, 2016 offer and discussions continued,” but have \n \n \nnot provided the date on which Price accepted employment with Camfil. (Brunetti \nAff. ¶ 5.) Price began employment with Camfil on August 15, 2016. \n15. On August 5, 2016, Price sent an email to AAF management notifying \nthem of his resignation effective August 12, 2016. Plaintiff alleges that Price told \n“senior AAF managers and others that he would be retiring from the air filtration \nindustry and would not be joining a competitor.” 4 (VFAC ¶ 52.) Price contends that \nhe did not tell AAF management or co-workers that he was retiring. (Price 1st Aff. ¶ \n45.) \n16. Price did not inform AAF that he had accepted employment with Camfil.  \nPlaintiff alleges that “[h]ad Price informed AAF that he would be working for Camfil, \nAAF would have discharged him on the spot,” and “revoked Price’s access to trade \nsecrets immediately.” ( VFAC ¶ 56.) Pla intiff contends that Price’s failure to inform \nAAF that he had accepted employment with Camfil render any authority or consent \nPrice had to access its trade secrets “legally [in]effective.” ( Id. ¶ 59.) Plaintiff first \nlearned that Price was working for Camfil in late August, 2016. \n17. Price continued to work for AAF through August 12, 2016. With its reply \nbrief filed on January 19, 2017, and at the hearing, Plaintiff provided to the Court \ndocumentation purporting to show that between July 24 and August 12, 2016 , Price \naccessed the TCOD program, his AAF Microsoft Outlook program, and other allegedly \n                                                 \n4 Price’s claim that he was retiring apparently would explain why AAF deviated from its \nalleged practice of immediately disabling access to its systems upon an employee’s notice of \nresignation. \n \n \nconfidential information, and emailed or downloaded files to himself.5 The documents \ndid not reveal the specific files or data accessed by Price. Price contends that any \naccess to AAF’s systems that he made in the final weeks of his employment was to \nfulfill his job duties for AAF. He also claims that he accessed and downloaded from \nMicrosoft Outlook only personal information and contacts. Price denies that he \nmisappropriated any AAF trade secrets, and claims he has not shared any AAF trade \nsecrets with Camfil. (Price 1st Aff. ¶ 49.) \n18. It is undisputed that since going to work for Camfil, Price has contacted \nseveral AAF customers. Plaintiff alleges that Price contacted AA F customers “in an \neffort to divert their business from AAF to Camfil and damage AAF’s goodwill wi th \nits customers.” (VFAC ¶ 83.) Price claims that since joining Camfil he has “not made \nany sales to any AAF customer that I called on previously as an AAF employee.” \n(Price 1st Aff.  ¶ 46.) Camfil has directed Price not to solicit or sell to any AAF \ncustomer that he serviced while employed by AAF. ( Id.; Brunetti Aff. ¶ 8.)6 Plaintiff \nconcedes that it has not  lost any customers to Camfil, and that it does not ha ve \nevidence that Price or Camfil has made a sale to any AAF customers. \n19. Plaintiff filed the Complaint initiating this action on November 4, 2016, \nand filed the VFAC on December 5, 2016. The VFAC raises claims against Price for \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiff’s counsel was unable to provide the Court with any compelling reasons for the delay \nin providing the documents or for Plaintiff’s failure to provide a foundational affidavit for the \ndocuments. Nevertheless, the Court, in its discretion, will consider the documents  for \npurposes of deciding the Motion. \n \n6 Despite Defendants’ assurances, at the hearing Plaintiff’s counsel provided the Court \ninformation indicating that Price has continued to contact his former AAF customers  up to \nthe time of the hearing. \n \n \nbreach of the 2006 Agreement a nd breach of fiduciary duty. The VFAC also raises \nclaims against Defendants for tortious interference with contract, misappropriation \nof trade secrets in violation of the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act, \nviolation of the North Carolina Unfair a nd Deceptive Trade Practices Act , and civil \nconspiracy. \n20. Plaintiffs did not seek a temporary restraining order, but, instead, on \nDecember 9, 2016 filed the Motion, along with supporting affidavits and evidentiary \nmaterials. On January 6, 2017, Defendants filed a Response in Opposition to Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction, and on January 19, 2017, Plaintiff replied. On January \n26, 2017, the Court held a hearing on the Motion. The Motion is now ripe for \ndisposition. \nDISCUSSION \n21. Plaintiff seeks an injunction prohibiting Price “from continuing to \nbreach his Employment Agreement” and prohibiting Price and Ca mfil “from \nmisappropriating AAF’s valuable trade secrets and other confidential information.” \n(Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj. 1.)  \n22. A preliminary injunction may be i ssued during litigation when “it \nappears by affidavit that a party thereto is doing or threatens or is about to do . . . \nsome act . . . in violation of the rights of another party to the litigation respecting the \nsubject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.” N.C. Gen. Stat. \n§ 1-485(2) (hereinafter, references to the North Carolina General Statutes will be to \n“G.S.”). A preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy and will not be lightly \n \n \ngranted.” Travenol Labs., Inc. v. Turner, 30 N.C. App. 686, 692, 228 S.E.2d 478, 483 \n(1976). The movant bears the burden of establishing the right to a preliminary \ninjunction. Pruitt v. Williams , 288 N.C. 368, 372, 218 S.E.2d 348, 351 (1975).  To \nobtain a preliminary injunction a movant must sho w “a likelihood of success on the \nmerits of his case and . . . [that the movant] is likely to sustain irreparable loss unless \nthe injunction is issued, or if, in the opinion of the Court, issuance is necessary for \nthe protection of his rights during the co urse of litigation.”  Analog Devices, Inc. v. \nMichalski, 157 N.C. App. 462, 466, 579 S.E.2d 449, 452 (2003 ); accord Looney v. \nWilson, 97 N.C. App. 304, 307 –08, 388 S.E.2d 142, 144 –45 (1990).  Likelihood of \nsuccess means a “reasonable likelihood.” A.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. McClure, 308 N.C. 393, \n404, 302 S.E.2d. 754, 761 (1983). \n23. In addition, the Court must balance the equities, and a preliminary \ninjunction “should not be granted where there is a serious question as to the right of \nthe defendant to engage in the activity and to forbid the defendant to do so, pending \nthe final determination of the matter, would cause the defendant greater damage \nthan the plaintiff would sustain from the continuance of the activity while the \nlitigation is pending.” Bd. of Provincial Elders v. Jones, 273 N.C. 174, 182, 159 S.E.2d \n545, 551–52 (1968); accord Cty. of Johnston v. City of Wilson, 136 N.C. App 775, 780, \n525 S.E.2d 826, 829 (2000)  (noting that a court  should weigh “ the advantages a nd \ndisadvantages to the parties”  in deciding whether to issue a preliminary \ninjunction). The issuance of an injunction is “a matter of discretion to be exercised by \n \n \nthe hearing judge after a careful balancing of the equities.” State ex rel. Edmisten v. \nFayetteville St. Christian Sch., 299 N.C. 351, 357, 261 S.E.2d 908, 913 (1980). \n24. In support of the Motion, AAF has argued the likelihood of success of its \nclaims for breach of the 2006 Agreement and misappropriation of trade secrets, and \nthe Court will address only these claims. \nI. Breach of 2006 Agreement. \na. Likelihood of Success. \n25. Preliminarily, the parties dispute whether the question of the 2006 \nAgreement’s enforceability should be decided under the law of Kentucky or North \nCarolina.7 Plaintiff urges the Court to honor the choice of law provisi on in the 2006 \nAgreement and apply Kentucky law.8 (Pl.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 12) Defendants \ncontend that the Court should apply North Carolina law because “Kentucky law on \nrestrictive covenants conflicts with North Carolina law and public policy,”  and \nbecause North Carolina has the greater interest in the subject matter of this dispute \n(Defs.’ Resp. Opp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 6–7.)  \n26. The Court, however, need  not determine the appropriate law to be \napplied in this case because even if Plaintiff could esta blish likelihood of success \n                                                 \n7 There is a material difference in the standards applied by the two states in determining the \nenforceability of covenants not to compe te. Compare Charles T. Creech, Inc. v. Brown , No. \n2011-CA-000629-MR, 2012 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1033, at * 13–14 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 17, \n2012), rev’d on other grounds , 433 S.W.3d 345 (2014) (outlining requirements for \nenforceability of a non-compete agreement under Kentucky law) with Hartman v. W.H. Odell \n& Assocs., 117 N.C. App. 307, 311, 450 S.E.2d 912, 916 (1994) (providing requirements for \nenforceability of a non-compete agreement under North Carolina law). \n \n8 Section 7.2 of the 2006 Agreement provides “[t[he construction performance and completion \nof this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Kentucky.” \n \n \nunder either state’s law, it has failed to establish that it will suffer irreparable harm \nif an injunction enforcing the non-compete provision is not issued.  \nb. Irreparable Harm. \n27. “A prohibitory preliminary injunction is granted on ly when irreparable \ninjury is real and immediate.” United Tel. Co. v. Universal Plastics, Inc. , 287 N.C. \n232, 235, 214 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1975) (emphasis added). “An applicant for a preliminary \ninjunction must do more than merely allege that irreparable injury will occur. The \napplicant is required to set out with particularity facts supporting such sta tements \nso the court can decide for itself if irreparable injury will occur.” Id. \n28. The request for a preliminary injunction in this case arises under \ncircumstances which establish that Plaintiff has not suffered any harm almost six \nmonths after Price allege dly violated the non -competition covenant  by acc epting \nemployment with Camfil. Plaintiff concedes that it has no evidence that Price has \nsolicited away any AAF customers or that any AAF customers have ceased doing \nbusiness with AAF and are now customers of Camfil. Plaintiff also has not presented \nevidence that there is a real and immediate danger of Price soliciting away any of \nAAF’s customers. \n29.   It also is significant that Plaintiff learned Price was employed with \nCamfil in late August, 2016, but did not file this action until November, 2016, did not \nseek a TRO to enforce t he non -competition covenant, and did not move for a \npreliminary injunction until December 9, 2016. Plaintiff’s lack of urgency in seeking \ninjunctive relief counsels against the idea that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm. \n \n \nSee N. Iredell Neighbors for Rural Life v. Iredell Cty. , 196 N.C. App. 68, 79, 674 \nS.E.2d 436, 443 (2009) (affirming trial court’s finding of no irreparable harm where \n“some two months elapsed without any contention by plaintiffs of an urgent threat of \nirreparable harm and after having reviewed the standards set forth in both the \nfederal and North Carolina cases”); Southtech Orthopedics, Inc. v. Dingus , 428 F. \nSupp. 2d 410, 420 (E.D.N.C. 2006) (applying North Carolin a law) (“[T]he six to nine \nweek delay between plaintiff’s discovery of defendant’s competitive activities and its \nfiling suit weighs against injunctive relief.”).  \n30.   The p rimary purpose of non -competition covenants is  to protect the \nemployer’s customers and associated good will with those customers. United Labs., \nInc. v. Kuykendall , 322 N.C. 643, 651, 370 S.E.2d 375, 381 (1988) (“[P]rotection of \ncustomer relationships and goodwill against misappropriation by departing \nemployees is well recognized as a legi timate protectable interest of the employer.”). \nThe evidence establishes that Plaintiff has not lost, and is not likely to suffer an \nimmediate loss of, customers from Price’s alleged breach of the non -competition \ncovenant.  \n31. Accordingly, Plaintiff has faile d to show that it is likely to sustain \nirreparable harm unless an injunction is issued prohibiting Price from breaching or \ncontinuing to breach the terms of the 2006 Agreement , and enforcing the 2006 \nAgreement. \n32. The Court concludes, in its discretion, that Plaintiff’s Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction prohibiting Price from breaching or continuing to breach the \n \n \nterms of the 2006 Agreement, and seeking enforcement of the 2006 Agreement, \nshould be DENIED. \nII. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets. \na. Likelihood of Success. \n33. Under the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act (NCTSPA), \n“misappropriation” is defined as “ acquisition, disclosure, or use of a trade secret of \nanother without express or implied authority or consent, unless such trade secret was \narrived at by independent development, reverse engineering, or was obtained from \nanother person with a right to disclose the t rade secret.” G.S. § 66-152(1). A “trade \nsecret” is “business or technical information, including but not limited to a formula, \npattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or process \nthat: (a) Derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not being \ngenerally known or readily ascertainable through independent development or \nreverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or \nuse; and (b) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to \nmaintain its secrecy.” G.S. § 66-152(3). \n34. Defendants first argue that Plaintiff has not identified its trade secrets \nwith sufficient specificity to support a claim for misappropriation under the NCTSPA. \n(Defs.’ Resp. Opp. Mot. Prelim. Inj.  20-22.) Defendant contends that Plaintiff \nidentifies only “generalized categories of information.” ( Id. 21.) This argument is \nwithout merit. Plaintiff provided evidence that the TCOD is a propri etary program \ndeveloped by AAF that contains data regarding AAF’s and its competitor’s products \n \n \ncompiled, in part, through AAF’s own internal testing and performance studies. The \nprogram calculat es the costs of ownership of AAF’s products as compared to its \ncompetitor’s products based on the customer’s operating parameters.  ( Id. ¶ 17.) \nPlaintiff also presented evidence that the trade secrets  at issue in this matter \nincluded, inter alia , information about prices AAF negotiated with its national \naccounts, tools that use proprietary algorithms to create custom quotes, reports \ncreated by AAF at its customers’ facilities which include identification of customers’ \ncurrent air filtration produc ts, sizes, specifications, and other customer -specific \nissues, AAF’s costs of goods sold from which AAF’s profit margins can be determined, \nand detailed drawings and product specifications created by AAF for customers . (Id. \n¶ 18.) This description of the i nformation at issue satisfies Plaintiff’s obligations to \nidentify its trade secrets. \n35. A prima facie case of misappropriation is established by introducing \n“substantial evidence” that the defendant: “ (1) knows or should have known of the \ntrade secret; and (2) has had a specific opportunity to acquire it for disclosure or use \nor has acquired, disclosed, or used it without the express or implied con sent or \nauthority of the owner.” G.S. § 66-155. A prima facie case of misappropriation may be \nestablished by circu mstantial evidence. TSG Finishing, LLC v. Bollinger , 238 N.C. \nApp. 586, 595, 767 S.E.2d 870, 878 (2014). \n36.  The Act also provides that “actual or threatened misappropriation of a \ntrade secret may be preliminarily enjoined during the pendency of the action.” G.S. § \n \n \n66-154; Horner Int’l Co. v. McKoy , 232 N.C. App. 559, 56 8–69, 754 S.E.2d 852, 859  \n(2014). \n37. Plaintiff alleges Price misappropriated AAF’s trade secrets by, among \nother actions, accessing Plaintiff’s confidential databases and by repeatedly accessing \nand downloading files from his Microsoft Out look program, following Price’s receipt \nof the offer of employment from  Camfil. Plaintiff contends that Price’s access to the \ntrade secrets was without authorization because he accessed the information after \naccepting employment with Camfil. \n38. It is undisputed that Price knew or should have known of the trade \nsecrets. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s likelihood of success turns on whether there is \nsufficient evidence to satisfy the second “prong” of G.S. § 66-155; did Price have \nopportunity to acquire the trade secrets or actually acquire, use, or disclose the trade \nsecrets without the consent of AAF?  \n39. The evidence establishes, and Defendants do not dispute, that Price had \nopportunity to acquire AAF’s trade secrets . Defendants argue, however, that  a \npreliminary injunction should issue only “ where actual mis appropriation is \ndemonstrated.” (Defs.’ Resp. Opp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 22, quoting Allegis Grp., Inc. v. \nZachary Piper LLC, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 12, *27 (N.C. Super. Ct. 2 013).) Defendants \ncontend that Plaintiff has not presented evidence “that Price actually took anything.” \n(Id. at 24; emphasis in original.) \n40. North Carolina, however, has expressly  rejected the contention that \nevidence of actual misappropriation is required to obtain injunctive relief under the \n \n \nTSPA. Horner, 232 N.C. App. at 568–70, 754 S.E.2d at 859–60. In Horner, the \ndefendant argued that the trial court erroneously issued a preliminary injunction \nprohibiting the defendant from disclosing trades secrets because plaintiff established \nonly the “opportunity for misappropriation.” Id. at 568, 754 S.E.2d at 859. The Court \nof Appeals rejected this argument, holding: \nDefendant’s strenuous assertions on appeal that Plaintiff \nproduced no direct or circumstantial evidence of his \n“acquisition, use, or disclosure of [Plaintiff’s] information”  \nis misplaced.  The TSPA permits prelimi nary injunctions \nwhere a  prima facie case for “ actual \nor threatened misappropriation of a trade secret”  is \nestablished. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-154(a) (emphasis added). \n. . . Defendant’s knowledge of trade secrets and opportunity \nto use those in his work for his new employer create a \nthreat of misappropriation, and thus the trial court’s grant \nof a preliminary injunction during the pendency of the \naction was proper. \n \nId. at 569–70, 754 S.E.2d at 859–60. Accordingly, Plaintiff is not required to establish \nactual misappropriation to obtain an injunction. \n41. Defendants further argue that even if opportunity to acquire trade \nsecrets, by itself, is sufficient to raise a prima facie case of misappropriation, the \nprima facie showing is rebutted by Defendants “by sh owing that the employer \ngranted access to the trade secrets or that circumstances surrounding any accesses \nwere not suspicious.” (Defs.’ Resp . Opp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. 22 –23.). In support, \nDefendants rely on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ’ recent decision in RLM \nCommunications, Inc. v. Tuschen, 831 F.3d 190 (4th Cir. 2016). \n42. In RLM, t he Fourth Circuit considered the evidentiary standard for \nestablishing a prima facie case under G.S. § 66-155 in the context of reviewing the \n \n \ndistrict court’s order granting summary judgment. The Court noted that if a plaintiff \nsatisfied the first “prong” of the statute, th at defendant knew of the trade secrets, \n“[a]t first blush, [the] second prong appears to allow a plaintiff to show either that \nthe defendant had an op portunity to acquire trade secrets or that the defendant in \nfact acquired them without permission.” 831 F.3d. at 199 (emphasis in original). The \nCourt opined that such an interpretation was problematic because: \nIn the employment context, if knowledge and o pportunity \nsuffice for a prima facie case of misappropriation, then an \nemployer can state a prima facie case against its employee \nmerely by showing that it gave the employee access to its \ntrade secrets. The employer can therefore force such an \nemployee to go to trial on a misappropriation claim—unless \nthe employee can rebut the prima facie case. \nUnfortunately, the statute does not clearly address \nrebuttal in a case such as this one, where the employee \nclaims that she never acquired or used trade secrets at all. \nThe statute provides three grounds for rebutting the prima \nfacie evidence, but all grounds assume that the employee \nhas in fact acquired the trade secrets: “prima facie evidence \nis rebutted by the introduction of substantial evidence that \nthe person a gainst whom relief is sought acquired the \ninformation comprising the trade  secret by independent \ndevelopment, reverse engineering, or it was obtained from \nanother person with a right to disclose the trade secret.” If \nthese grounds were exclusive, an absurd  result would \nfollow: Every employee in North Carolina who had access \nto her employer's trade secrets but did not acquire them \nwould have to go to trial to fend off the employer's claim of \nmisappropriation.  \n \nId. at 200–01.  \n43. The Fourth Circuit concluded t hat the North Carolina Supreme Court \nwould “not adopt such an interpretation ” of G.S. § 66 -155. Id. at 201. Instead, after \nreviewing existing North Carolina case law on the question, the Court held that the \n \n \nSupreme Court would adopt one of two interpretations. The first would require that \nto establish a prima facie case of misappropriation “the employer . . . prove not merely \nthat its employee had access to trade secrets, but also that the employee abused such \naccess—the employer would have to s how knowledge and \nan unauthorized opportunity to acquire or use trade secrets .” Id. (emphasis in \noriginal). \n44. The Fourth Circuit held that a second potential interpretation of G.S. § \n66-155 would permit the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case by showin g “mere \nknowledge and opportunity” to acquire the trade secret, which would “give rise to an \ninference of misappropriation.” Id. The defendant c ould rebut “the inference by \nshowing that the circumstances  surrounding the opportunity were not suspicious ,” \nincluding by showing that “the opportunity was provided with consent.” Id. at 201–\n02.9 The Court concluded, however, that: \nThe practical effect of this burden shifting, of course, is that \nan employer accusing an employee of misappropriation will \noften gain little benefit from making a prima facie case \nbased on opportunity. Instead, the framework will collapse \ninto the question whether the employer has \nsufficient evidence of misappropriation to raise an \ninference of actual acquisition or use of its trade secr ets. \nHere again, this result is generally consistent with the \npractice of the North Carolina courts. \n \nId. at 202. \n \n                                                 \n9 The Fourth Circuit’s conclusion in this regard is consistent with the conclusion reached in \nSunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head & Engquist Equip., L.L.C. , 2002 NCBC LEXIS 2, *43 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. 2002) (“There is no specific requirement that plaintiff show that defendants have \ndisclosed or used the trade  secrets, only that they had a specific opportunity to acquire the \ntrade secrets for use or disclosure. Once plaintiff establishes a  prima facie case, the burden \nshifts to defendants to show that the trade secret was not acquired improperly.”). \n \n \n45. The Court finds the Fourth Cir cuit’s reasoning and conclusion in RLM \ncompelling. Evidence that a former employee had access to, and theref ore an \n“opportunity to acquire,” an employer’s trade secrets, without more, is not sufficient \nto establish a prima facie case of misappropriation.  Rather, the employer must \nestablish either that the former employee accessed its trade secrets without \nauthorization or provide other sufficient evidence of misappropriation to raise an \ninference of actual acquisition or use of its trade secrets. \n46. Applying this burden, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has produced \nsufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case  of misappropriation. The evidence \nshows that Camfil is one of AAF’s direct and major competitors, and that Price is now \nworking for Camfil. Price’s primary responsibility with AAF and Camfil are the \nsame—sales. Price admitted that he has contacted several  of his former AAF \ncustomers since becoming employed with Camfil, and apparently may still be \ncontacting AAF customers despite Defendants promises that he would not do so. TSG \nFinishing, 238 N.C. App. at 595, 767 S.E.2d at 878 (h olding that “plaintiff \ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim for trade secret \nmisappropriation” where defendant former-employee was performing “similar duties” \nand working for “share[d] customers” with a direct competitor.”). \n47. More significantly, Camfil extended Price a job offer on July 24, 2016, \nand Price continued to work for AAF and accessed its system s containing AAF’s \nconfidential and proprietary information, until August 12, 2016.  Between July 24 \nand August 12, 2016, Price accessed the TCOD progra m, his AAF Microsoft Outlook \n \n \nprogram, and other allegedly confidential information, and emailed or downloaded \nfiles to himself. Defendants contend that Price did not accept employment with \nCamfil on July 24, 2016, but has failed to provide the date on which Price did accept \nemployment. \n48. In addition, Price did not inform AAF that he was going to work for \nCamfil when he notified AAF of his resignation on August 5, 2016. Had he done so, \nAAF would have immediately terminated Price’s employment and his access to its \ntrade secrets.  Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has \nmade a sufficient showing to raise an inference that Price’s access to its trade secrets \nafter July 24, 201 6 was not authorized. Barker Indus. v. Gould , 146 N.C. App. 561,  \n565–66, 553 S.E.2d 227, 230 (2001) (“[B]road injunctive relief is available where there \nhas been some showing of bad faith or underhanded dealings on the part of the party \nto be enjoined.”). \n49. Finally, the evidence in the record at this juncture supports th e \nconclusion that Price is performing the same type of sales duties he performed for \nAAF, and that there is a threat that Price could use AAF’s trade secret s in his \nemployment with Camfil. This supports issuance of the requested injunction.  Horner, \n232 N.C. App. at 570, 754 S.E.2d at 860.  \n50. The Court concludes that Plaintiff has established a likelihood of success \non its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets. \nb. Irreparable Harm. \n \n \n51. The Court also concludes that the Plaintiff has shown that it is likely \nsuffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction does not issue.  The acquisition \nand potential disclosure or use of the information in Plaintiff’s confidential databases, \nwhich contain extensive data collected by Plaintiff from its customers and proprietary \ncosting formulas, would cause irreparable harm to the Plaintiff.  \n52. Finally, balancing the relative burdens on the parties, it is clear that \nDefendants will suffer little harm from being enjoined from misappropriating \nPlaintiff’s trade secrets during the course of this action.  Defendants have submitted \naffidavits to this Court stating that they have not acquired or used Plaintiff’s trade \nsecret information . Accordingly, an injunction prohibiting such conduct will have \nlittle impact on Defendants. \n53. On these grounds, and balancing the equities here, the Court concludes, \nin its discretion, that Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction prohibiting \nDefendants from misappropriating AAF’s trade secrets should be GRANTED.  \n54. Before a preliminary injunction will issue, a bond must be posted “ in \nsuch sum as the judge deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as \nmay be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to  have been wrongfully \nenjoined.” G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 65(c). “Since the purpose of t he security requirement is \nto protect the restrained party from damages incurred as a result of the wrongful \nissuance of the injunctive relief, the trial court has the discretion to determine what \namount of security, if any, is necessary to protect the enjoined party’s interests.” Barr-\nMullin, Inc. v. Browning, 108 N.C. App. 590, 598, 424 S.E.2d 226, 231 (1993) (citing \n \n \nKeith v. Day, 60 N.C. App. 559, 561, 299 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1983)). In its discretion and \nin consideration of the likelihood of material damag e and harm to the Defendants if \nwrongfully enjoined, the Court requires Plaintiff to post a bond of $100.00.  \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: \n1. The Motion is DENIED, in part, and GRANTED, in part.
