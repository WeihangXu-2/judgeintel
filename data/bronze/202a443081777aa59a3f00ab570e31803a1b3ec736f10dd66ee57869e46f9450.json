Webb, Esq., John W. Holten, Esq., \nCaitlin M. Poe, Esq.  for Defendants Jared Burnette and JBAC \nProperties, LLC.  \n \n McGuire, Judge. \nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND   \n1. On December 8, 2011, Clark and Burnette formed JBAC, a North \nCarolina limited liability company.  (Deposition of Andrew Clark, ECF No. 60.1, at p. \n23.)  Clark and Burnette each own a 50% membership interest in  JBAC and are \nJBAC’s managers.  (ECF No. 60.1, at p. 25.)  JBAC owns and operates rooming houses \nand other rental properties in Raleigh , North Carolina.  ( Complaint, ECF No. 3, ¶ \n21.) \n2. On November 16, 2012, Clark and Burnette executed the Operating \nAgreement of JBAC Properties, LLC .  (“Operating Agreement,” ECF No. 40.2, at \ncover page and p. 1 ; ECF No. 60.1, at p. 2 6; Deposition of Jared B urnette, ECF No. \n57.1, at p. 70. )  Attorney Lance R. Fife (“Fife”) prepared the Operating A greement.  \n(Affidavit of Lance Fife, ECF No. 60.2 , at ¶¶ 23.)  It is undisputed that at the time \nthe parties executed the Operating Agreement, JBAC owned properties on which it \noperated rooming houses and rental properties.  The Operating Agreement contains, \ninter alia, the following terms relevant to determination of the Motions: \n \n  \n \nARTICLE 4 \nMEMBERS AND UNITS \n \n4.01 Members The names, addresses and Ownership \nUnits of the Members are as set forth on Exhibit A hereto \nas amended from time to time. The Manager shall be \nrequired to update Schedule A from time to time as \nnecessary to accurately reflect the information therein. \nAny amendment or revision to Schedule A made in \naccordance with this Agreement shall not be deemed an \namendment to this Agreement. Any reference in this \nAgreement to Schedule A shall be deemed to be a reference \nto Schedule A as amended and in effect from time to time. \n \n(ECF No. 40.2, at p. 4.) \n \nARTICLE 5 \nRIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MANAGERS \n \n5.02 Managers  \n \n(a) The Company shall have two (2) Managers, who shall \nbe Jared Burnette and Andrew Clark, and shall remain \na [sic] Managers of the Company until their death, \nincapacity or resignation. In the event of death, \nincapacity or resignation of the Managers, then the \nsurviving Manager shall be the Successor Manager. \n \n(b) The Managers shall have the responsibility for the day \nto day operation and management of the Company, and \nthey shall have the authority to sign any legal \ndocuments for the Company. Both  mangers [sic] shall \nbe required to sign and [sic] Deeds transferring real \nproperty from the name of the company. Either \nmanager (and only one (1) manager) is required to sign \nany HUD settlement statements when the company \npurchases real property but written consent by the \nother manager is required prior to signing the HUD \nstatement.  \n \n(c) Any purchase or expense that exceeds $5,000.00 \nrequires written consent form [sic] both managers. \n \n(Id. at pp. 4–5.) \n  \n \n5.03 Certain Powers of Managers . Without limiting the \ngenerality of Section 5.01, and subject to the restrictions \nunder Section 5.04, the Managers shall have power and \nauthority, on behalf of the Company: \n \n. . .  \n \n(h) The managers agree that each manager has the \nfollowing duties:  \n \nAndrew Clark:  Primarily responsible for Collections, \nProperty Maintenance and day to day operations.  \n \nJared Burnette:  Primarily responsible for Acquiring, \nFinancing, and Strategic Direction of Investments. \n \n(Id. at pp. 5 –6, emphasis in original.)  The evidence shows that the management \nduties assigned to Clark and Burnette reflected their different anticipated \ncontributions to JBAC.  Burnette had more experience in residential real estate and \nClark thought he could learn from working with him. (ECF No. 60.1, at p . 22. ) \nBurnette also made a more substantial upfront investment in the company: Burnette \ncontributed about $300,000 while Clark and his wife have contributed a total of \n$70,000 over the years.  (Id. at p. 28.) \n3. The Operating Agreement further provided as follows: \nARTICLE 16 \nDISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION \n \n \n16.03 Winding Up, Liquidation and Distribution of Assets    \n \n. . .  \n \n(b)(3) In the event Clark elects to dissolve the Company: \nBurnette shall have at his sole election the rights to keep \nall existing real estate. In determining the amount to be \nallocated to Clar k, the Members agree that Clark shall \n  \n \nreceive one-half (1/2) of the value of the properties listed on \nExhibit “A” at the acquisition price (initial value) shown on \nExhibit “A” ( after deducting any and all liens or mortgage \nor Deeds of Trust that encumber the properties or any \nother debts of the Company) and NOT of [ sic] the current \nfair market value “FMV” of the properties at the time of the \nWithdrawel [sic] or Dissolution as described in this \nOperating Agreement. \n \n(b)(4) In the event Burnette elects to dissolve the Company: \nIn determining the amount to be allocated to Clark, the \nMembers agree that Clark and Burnette shall split any \nequity in the company equally. \n \n(ECF No. 40.2, at p. 15.) \n4. Despite the reference in article 16.03(b)(3) indicating that “Exhibit A” is \na list of properties owned by JBAC with their  “acquisition price (initial value),” the \nExhibit A attached to the Operating Agreement at the time the parties executed it is \na schedule purporting to contain the members’ initia l contributions and ownership \nunits.  (ECF No. 40.2 at p. 18.)\n1  It is undisputed that, at the time Clark and Burnette \nexecuted the Operating Agreement , a list of JBAC properties and the acquisition \nprices or values of the properties  (“JBAC Properties List”)  was not attached to the \nOperating Agreement.  Burnette testified: “I do not recall exactly when we signed the \n[Operating Agreement] but I do believe that we signed [the Operating Agreement] \nand then we sent the acquisition costs.”  (ECF No. 57.1, at p. 77.)  However, later the \nsame day, at 4:39 p.m. on November 16, 2012, Burnette sent an email to Fife, copying \n \n1 The Exhibit A attached to the Operating Agreement is referenced in Article 4.01, which \nstates, “[t]he names, addresses and Ownership Units of the members are set forth on Exhibit \nA hereto as amended from time to time”;   and in Article 9.01, which states,“[t]he amounts, \ndescription, value of any non -cash contributions and payment terms of the Capital \nContributions of each Member are set forth on Exhibit ‘ A’ hereto as amended from time to \ntime.”  (Id. at pp. 4, 9.) \n  \n \nClark, stating, “[h]ere is the link to ‘JB AC Properties Acquisition Cost.xls’ in my \nDropbox.”  (ECF No. 57.1, at p. 71–72; November 16, 2012 Email, ECF No. 60.4, at p. \n2.) \n5. On November 17, 2012, Fife emailed the Operating Agreement to \nBurnette and Clark .  Fife’s November 17, 2012 email states, “ [a]ttached is the \nOperating Agreement for JBAC Properties.”  (Nov . 17, 2012 Email, ECF No. 57.3.)  \nThe last page of the Operating Agreement attached to Fife’s email ( p. 18)  is the \nschedule containing the members’ initial contributions and ownership units.  ( Id.)  \nThe Operating Agreement attached to the November 17 , 2012 Email does not have \nthe JBAC Properties List attached.  (Id.) \n6. On November 20, 2012, Burnette sent an email to  Fife, copying Clark, \nstating: “Lance.  No hurry on this but wanted to make sure you had the acquisition \ncosts to attach to the JBAC Properties LLC operating agreement.  There is a link in \nthe e-mail chain and I pasted it below as well.”  (Nov. 20, 2012 Email, ECF No. 60.4, \nat p.1; ECF No. 57.1, at p. 76.)  The list contained in the November 20, 2012 Email is \ntitled “JBAC Properties” and lists the acquisition dates, addresses, and “acquisition \ncost” of twenty (20) properties.  (ECF No. 60.4.)  Clark admits that the November 20, \n2012 Email was delivered to his email address .  (ECF 60.1, at p. 35.)  Nevertheless, \nClark claims that the first time he remembers seeing the JBAC Properties List was \nafter the lawsuit was filed.  (Id.) \n7. During discovery, Defendants produced a copy of the Operating \nAgreement with a copy of the JBAC Properties List  paperclipped to the agreement \n  \n \nfollowing page eighteen.  (ECF No. 60.2, Ex. A at .pdf p. 22.)  Fife states in his affidavit \nthat the Operating Agreement attached to his affidavit, the last page of which \nincludes the list of properties that Burnette sent Fife on November 20, 2012, is a “copy \nof the fully-executed copy of the Operating Agreement that I retained in my physical \npaper files.”  (ECF No. 60.2, at ¶ 6.)  This JBAC Properties List attached to Fife’s copy \nof the Operating Agreement was not produced to Clark until in or about August 2020.  \n(ECF No. 60.1, at p. 36.) \n8. It is undisputed that the Operating Agreement placed on Burnette the \nresponsibility “for Acquiring, Fin ancing, and Strategic Direction of Investments, \nincluding the acquisition of additional properties for JBAC. ”  (ECF No. 40.2, at p. 6 ; \nECF 57.1, at p. 82.)   Burnette acquired twenty (20)  properties for JBAC before the \nexecution of the Operating Agreement in November 2012.  However, Clark contends, \nand Burnette does not dispute, that Burnette’s last acquisition of property for JBAC \nfollowing execution of the Operating Agreement occurred on October 3, 2013.  (Clark’s \nThird Supplemental Response to Interrogatory, ECF No. 57.7, at .pdf p. 7.)   \nNevertheless, Clark claims that he did not become “aware that [Burnette] had no \nfurther intention of acquiring property for JBAC [until] on or about Sep tember 26, \n2018, during a meeting at Morgan Street Food Hall.”  (ECF No. 60.1, at p. 62.) \n9. Clark also contends that Burnette failed to adequately participate in the \nday-to-day management of JBAC.  ( Clark’s Br. in Supp. of Mot. SJ, ECF No. 58, at \npp. 4–6.)  Burnette testified: “[i]t is my understanding that I do not manage the day-\nto-day operations of JBAC; however, I have spent a growing amount of time being \n  \n \ninvolved in JBAC since the start” and “[s]o my intention was never to run the day-to-\nday operations of JBAC.  That was not my responsibility.”  (ECF No. 57.1, at p. 82.)  \nBurnette also testified that he “was to be taking care of acquisitions and financing for \nthe acquisitions and the strategic direction.”   ( Id.)  However, Burnette also claims \nthat he was “pretty active in JBAC the entire time.”  (Id.) \n10. It also is undisputed that after this lawsuit was filed, Burnette retained \ncounsel to defend him and JBAC in the action.  Burnette wired $50,000 in funds from \nJBAC’s bank account to pay the law firm he retain ed.  (ECF No. 57.1, at pp. 61–63.)  \nIt is undisputed that Burnette did not seek Clark’s consent, as co-manager of JBAC, \nto make that payment. \n11. On June 25, 2019, Clark filed a complaint against Defendants Burnette \nand JBAC.  (Complaint, ECF No. 3.)  In the Complaint, Clark alleges the following: a \nclaim against Burnette for breach of the Operating Agreement  (First Claim); in the \nalternative, a claim against Burnette for quantum meruit (Third Claim); a claim for \njudicial dissolution pursuant to N.C.G .S. § 57D -6-02 (Fourth Claim); and claims \nagainst both Burnette and JBAC for  declaratory judgment pursuant to N.C.G.S. §§ \n1-253 and 1-254 (Second Claim) (Id. at ¶¶ 36–68.)  The claim for declaratory judgment \nseeks the following declarations:  \na. That Defendant has failed to fulfill his obligations \nunder paragraph 5.03(h) of the operating agreement \nentered into on or about November 16, 2012 between \nPlaintiff and Defendant, that said failure constitutes a \nbreach of the operating agreement, and as a result of \nDefendant’s breach he should be precluded from \nenforcing other terms of the operating agreement, \nnamely paragraph 16.03(b)(3). \n  \n \n \nb. That paragraph 16.03(b)(3) of the operating agreement \n. . . is voided because it is inconsistent with Defendant’s \nstated intention to attorney Lance Fife on or about \nNovember 18, 2011 regarding the parties “sharing in \nrisk and gain.”  \n \nc. That paragraph 16.03(b)(3) of the operating agreement \n. . . is voided because it is both substantively and \nprocedurally unconscionable.  \n \nd. That paragraph 16.03(b)(3) of the operating agreement \n. . . is voided because it refers to the “acquisition price \n(initial value)” on “Exhibit A;” however, the actual \nExhibit A attached to the operating agreement \nreferences only “Initial Capital Contributi ons” and \n“Ownership Units.”  Put another way, the Exhibit A \nreferred to in paragraph 16.03(b)(3) does not appear to \nexist.  \n \ne. That the operating agreement . . .  does not contain a \nmerger clause and is therefore not the entire agreement \nbetween the parties.  \n \nf. That Defendant had certain obligations under the \noperating agreement . . . to wit, “Acquiring, Financing, \nand Strategic Direction of Investments,” and Defendant \nhas failed to fulfill his obligations under the operating \nagreement.  \n \ng. That Plaintiff had certain obligations under the \noperating agreement . . . to wit: “Collections, Property  \nMaintenance and day to day operations,” and Plaintiff \nhas satisfactorily fulfilled his obligations under the \noperating agreement.  \n \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 48(a)–(g).) \n12. On August 20, 2019, Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. \n13) and a Memorandum in  Support of Motion to Dismiss .  (ECF No. 14.)  Following \n  \n \nbriefing and a hearing, the Court denied Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on January \n28, 2020.  (ECF No. 25.) \n13. On March 11, 2020 Defendants filed an Amended Answer and \nCounterclaim.  (“Counterclaim,” ECF No. 29.)  Defendants’ counterclaim was a cause \nof action for declaratory judgment regarding Burnette’s right to reimbursement of \nattorneys’ fees he paid on behalf of JBAC and Burnette’s right to advancement of his \nattorneys’ fees paid in defending against this lawsuit.  (Id. at pp. 11–12.) \n14. On June 10, 2020, Defendants  filed a motion for s ummary judgment \nseeking judgment in their favor on the counterclaim for reimbursement and \nadvancement.  (“Defs.’ Mot. for SJ on Defs. ’ CCs,” ECF No. 3 8.) Following briefing \nand a hearing, the Court issued its Order and Opinion granting Defs.’ Mot. for SJ on \nDefs.’ CCs.  (ECF No. 65.)  \n15. On October 28, 2020, Clark filed his  Motion for Summary Judgment, a \nMemorandum of Law in s upport (Clark’s Br. in Supp. of Mo t. SJ, ECF No. 58) , and \nan Index of Exhibits in Support of his Motion  and exhibits.  (ECF No. 57  and 57.1–\n57.8.)  Clark seeks summary judgment on all of his  claims.  Defendants filed a \nResponse in Opposition to Clark ’s Motion for Summary Judgment ( “Defs.’ Response \nin Opp.,” ECF No. 62), and Clark filed a reply brief (ECF No. 66).   \n16. On October 29, 2020, Defendants filed their Motion for Summary \nJudgment as well as an Index of Exhibits in support of the motion and exhibits.  (ECF \nNos. 60 and 60.1–60.6.)  Defendants also filed a brief in support of their  Motion for \nSummary Judgment.  (“Defs.’ Brief in Support,” ECF No. 61.)   Defendants move for \n  \n \nsummary judgment on Clark’s claims for breach of contract against Burnette (First \nClaim); for qu antum meruit against Burnette (Third Claim); and for declaratory \njudgment against both Burnette and JBAC (Second Claim).  Defendants do not seek \nsummary judgment on Clark’s claim for dissolution of JBAC (Fourth Claim).   Clark \nfiled his Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Partial \nSummary Judgment ( “Clark’s Br. in Opp. ,” ECF No. 64) , and Defendants filed a  \nReply.  (ECF No. 69.)   \n17. On December 11, 2020, Defendants filed a Motion to Strike pursuant to \nRules 37 and 26(e) (“Motion to Strike,” ECF No. 67) and a Memorandum in Support \nof their Motion to Strike.  (ECF No. 68.)  On December 23, 2020, Clark  filed a Brief \nin Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Strike (ECF No. 72) and on January 4, 2021, \nDefendants filed their Reply in Support of Motion to Strike.  (ECF No. 73.)  \n18. The Court held a hearing on the Motions  on January 27, 2021 where \ncounsel presented their arguments.  The Motions are now ripe for decision.  \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n19. “Summary judgment is appropriate ‘if the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that any party is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.’”  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic \nServs., LLC, 365 N.C. 520, 523 (2012) (quoting N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  \nThe moving party bears the burden of presenting evidence which shows that there is \nno genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled  to judgment as a \n  \n \nmatter of law.  Hensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc., 193 N.C. App. 561, 563 (2008).  \nWhere the moving party is the defendant, they may meet this burden by “proving an \nessential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at \ntrial, or would have been barred by an affirmative defense.”  Variety Wholesalers, Inc., \n365 N.C. at 523.  An issue is “material” if “resolution of the issue is so essential that \nthe party against whom it is resolved may not prevail.”  McNair v. Boyette, 282 N.C. \n230, 235 (1972).  “A ‘genuine issue’ is one that can be maintained by substantial \nevidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83 (2000). \n20. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required \nshowing, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a foreca st of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784–85 \n(2000).  As recently reiterated by the North Carolina Court of Appeals, the burden on \nthe non-movant goes beyond merely producing some evidence or a scintilla of evidence \nin support of its claims.  Rather,  \n[i]f the movant meets this burden, the nonmovant must \ntake affirmative steps to set forth specific facts showing the \nexistence of a genuine issue of material fact. An adverse \nparty may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of \nhis pleading. A genuine issue of material fact is one that \ncan be maintained by substantial evidence. Substantial \nevidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion and \nmeans more than a scintilla or a permissible inference. \n  \nKhashman v. Khashman, 2017 N.C. App. LEXIS 715, at *15 (N.C. Ct. App. Sept. 5, \n2017) (unpublished) (citations and internal quotation marks and modifiers omitted). \n  \n \nIII. ANALYSIS \n \n21. The Court will first address Defendants’ Motion to Strike, followed by \nthe Motions for Summary Judgment. \nA. Motion to Strike  \n22. In the Motion to Strike, Defendants move to strike the affidav it of \nCarrole Mulkey Dayton, dated September 15, 2020.   (“Dayton Affidavit,” ECF No. \n57.6.)  Defendants seek to strike the Dayton Affidavit pursuant to Rules 37(d) and \n26(e) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”), on the grounds that \nClark violated Rule 26(e) by failing to produce the Dayton Affidavit, a document \nresponsive to Burnette’s First Set of Requests for Production, until after the close of \ndiscovery.  (ECF No. 67, at p. 1.)  In the alternative, Defendant s request the Court \nexercise its inherent authority to strike the affidavit.  (Id.)  Clark opposes the Motion \nto Strike.  (ECF No. 72.) \n23. “A motion to strike is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial \ncourt.”  Kingsdown, Inc. v. Hinshaw , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 15, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nFeb. 17, 2016) (citing Broughton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., 161 N.C. App. 20, 25 \n(2003)). \n24. The Court has thoroughly considered the arguments of the parties and  \nfinds that Defendants have failed to establish t hat they have been substantially \nprejudiced by the filing of the Dayton Affidavit, particularly in light of the fact that \nthe Court has not relied on its contents in deciding the Motions for Summary \n  \n \nJudgment.  Therefore, the Court CONCLUDES, in its discret ion, that the Motion to \nStrike should be DENIED.  \nB. Motions for Summary Judgment \n \n25. Since both Clark and the Defendants separately seek summary \njudgment in their favor on Clark’s claims for  declaratory judgment, breach of \ncontract, and quantum meruit, the Cour t will first address these three claims.  The \nCourt will then turn to Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment on its claim for judicial \ndissolution. \ni. Declaratory Judgment  \n26. Clark and the Defendants seek summary judgment in their favor on \nClark’s claim for declaratory judgment against  Burnette and JBAC.  (ECF No. 3, at \np. 6.)  Resolution of the declaratory judgment claim will significantly inform the \nCourt’s determination of t he remaining claim s.  Thus, the Court begins with this \nclaim. \n27. Under North Carolina law, a declaratory judgment is a statutory \nremedy that grants the courts authority to “declare rights, status, and other legal \nrelations” when an “actual controversy” exists between parties to a lawsuit.  N.C.G.S. \n§ 1-253; Town of Pine Knoll Shores v. Carolina Water Serv ., 128 N.C. App. 321, 321 \n(1998).  The Court may, by declaratory judgment, “determine[ ] any question of \nconstruction or validity” and declare “rights, status  or other legal relations” under a \nwritten contract.  N.C.G.S. § 1-254.  “As with all other actions, . . . there must be a \njusticiable controversy before the Declaratory Judgment Act may be invoked.  There \n  \n \nis a justiciable controversy if litigation over the matter upon which declaratory relief \nis sought appears unavoidable.”  Ferrell v. Department of Transp., 334 N.C. 650, 656 \n(1993).  An action for declaratory judgment is ripe for adjudication when “there is an \nactual or real existing controversy between p arties having adverse interests in the \nmatter in dispute.”  Andrews v. Alamance Cty., 132 N.C. App. 811, 813–14 (1999). \n28. It is undisputed that the Operating Agreement is a valid contract.  The \nCourt now turns to each of the declarations that Clark requests.  \na. Paragraphs 48(a) and 48(f) of the Complaint \n \n29. In paragraphs 48(a) and 48(f) of the Complaint , Clark effectively seeks \nthe same declarations: that Burnette breached Article 5.03(h) of the Operating \nAgreement, the provision making Burnette “[p]rim arily responsible for Acquiring , \nFinancing, and Strategic Direction of Investments” for JBAC.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 48(a) \nand (f).)  Clark argues that Burnette failed to fulfill his obligations under Article \n5.03(h) because he did not acquire any new properti es for JBAC after October 2013.  \n(ECF No. 58, at pp. 11– 17.)  Clark also seeks a declaration that “as a result of \n[Burnette]’s breach he should be precluded from enforcing other terms of the \noperating agreement, namely [Article] 16.03(b)(3).”  (Id. at ¶ 48(a).) \n30. It is undisputed that Burnette did not acquire any properties for JBAC \nafter October 2013.  (ECF No. 58, at p. 5; ECF No. 66, at pp. 6– 7.)  However, Clark \nconcedes that Burnette acquired seven properties for JBAC after the parties executed \nthe Operating Agreement and prior to October 2013 .  (Id.)  Clark makes no express \nargument as to why Burnette’s failure to acquire properties after October 2013 is a \n  \n \nbreach of Article 5.03(h), but implies that the language of Article 5.03(h) creates an \nongoing obligation to regularly acquire additional properties which Burnette failed to \nfulfill after October 2013.  Defendants argue that the language in Article 5.0 3(h) \nregarding Burnette’s duties is unambiguous and places no specific obligations on \nBurnette as to how many properties he must acquire for JBAC or how often.  (ECF \nNo. 62, at pp. 3–4.)  Defendants contend that Burnette fulfilled his obligation under \nArticle 5.03(h) because it is undisputed that he purchased properties for JBAC after \nthe Operating Agreement was executed.  (ECF No. 62, at p. 3.) \n31.   “With all contracts, the goal of construction is to arrive at the intent of \nthe parties when the contract was issued.   The intent of the parties may be derived \nfrom the language in the contract.”  Bank of Am., N.A. v. Rice, 230 N.C. App. 450, 456 \n(2013) (citation omitted);  see also Lane v. Scarborough , 284 N.C. 407, 409- 10, \n(1973) (“Whenever a court is called upon to interpret a contract its primary purpose \nis to ascertain the intention of the parties at the moment of its execution. ”)  The \nintention of the parties “ is to be ascertained from the expressions used, the subject \nmatter, the end in view, the purpose sought, and the situation of the parties at the \ntime.”  Lane, 284 N.C. at 410 (quoting Electric Co. v. Ins. Co., 229 N.C. 518, 520 \n(1948)).  In analyzing the intent of the parties “[t]he court must construe the contract \n‘as a whole ’ and [its provisions] must be appraised in relation to all other \nprovisions.”  Schenkel & Shultz, Inc. v. Hermon F. Fox & Assocs., P.C., 362 N.C. 269, \n273 (2008) (citation omitted). \n  \n \n32. “When the language of the contract is clear and  unambiguous, \nconstruction of the agreement is a matter of law for the court and the court cannot \nlook beyond the terms of the contract to determine the intentions of the parties.”  Id. \n“Whether or not the language of a contract is ambiguous . . . is a question for the court \nto determine.”  Lynn v. Lynn, 202 N.C. App. 423, 432 (2015)  (citation omitted).  An \nambiguity exists when the effect of provisions is uncertain or capable of several \nreasonable interpretations.   Id.  If a contract is ambiguous, interpretation of the \ncontract is a question of fact for the jury.  Variety Wholesalers, Inc., 365 N.C. at 525. \n33. The Court has thoroughly considered the language regarding Burnette’s \nduties under  Article 5.03(h) an d concludes that it is ambiguous  and, accordingly, \ncannot be applied by the Court to determine that  Burnette breached that provision \nof the Operating Agreement.   The provision assigns Burnette the “duties” of \n“acquiring, financing, and strategic direction of investments,” but does not define \nthose terms nor provide specific requirements for fulfilling those duties.  To the \ncontrary, the language is , at best, vague.  In addition, the other terms of the \nOperating Agreement do not provide context to or illuminate the specific nature of \nthe duties undertaken by Burnette in Article 5.0 3(h).  Therefore, the interpretation \nof the language in Article 5.03(h) is an issue for the jury. \n34. Defendants further argue that Clark’s claim for breach of Article 5.03(h) \nis barred by the three-year statute of limitations.  (ECF No. 61, at p. 6.)  Specifically, \nBurnette argues that his last acquisition on behalf of JBAC occurred in October 2013, \nand that to the extent Burnette’s failure to acquire properties forms the basis for a \n  \n \nbreach of contract  claim, such a breach is barred by the three -year statute of \nlimitations pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 1-52(1) since this lawsuit was not filed until June \n15, 2019.  (ECF No. 61, at pp. 7-8.) \n35. Clark correctly contends that a cause of action for breach of contract \ndoes not accrue until the claimant learns, or reasonably should have learned, that a \nbreach has occurred.  (ECF No. 64, at p. 9.)  Chisum v. Campagna, 2021 NCSC 7, ¶75 \n(2021) (“[A] claim for breach of contract accrues when the plaintiff knew or should \nhave known that the contract had been breached.”).\n2  Clark testified in his deposition \nthat in “the latter part of 2016, it was becoming clear that a breach existed (ECF No. \n60.1, at p. 50), and that he “became aware that [Burnette] had no further intention \nof acquiring property for JBAC on or about Sept ember 26, 2018”  ( Id. at p. 62) .  If \nbelieved, both of these dates would be within three years prior to the filing of this \nlawsuit and fall within the applicable statute of limitations.  Consequently, the Court \nfinds that a dispute of fact exists regarding when Clark’s claim for breach of contract \naccrued and summary judgment is inappropriate. \n36. Therefore, the Court concludes that to the extent Clark seeks \ndeclarations that Burnette “failed to fulfill his obligations” under Article 5.03(h) and \nthat “as a result of [Burnette]’s breach he should be precluded from enforcing other \nterms of the operating agreement, namely [Article] 16.03(b)(3),” Clark’s Mot ion for \n \n2 In Chisum, the Supreme Court also held that a claim for a declaratory judgment seeking a \ndeclaration that a  breach of contract occurred accrues at the time the claimant knew or \nshould have known a breach occurred.  Chisum, 2021 NCSC 7, at *37. \n \n  \n \nSummary Judgment should be DENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment seeking judgment in Defendants’ favor on this claim should be DENIED. \nb. Paragraph 48(b) of the Complaint \n \n37. Clark seeks a declaration that “paragraph 16.03(b)(3) of the oper ating \nagreement entered into on or about November 16, 2012 between Plaintiff and \nDefendant is voided because it is inconsistent with Defendant’s stated intention to \nFife on or about November 18, 2011 regarding the parties ‘sharing in risk and gain.’”  \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶48(b)).  Defendants argue that Burnette’s November 18, 2011 \ncommunication to Fife occurred almost a year before the parties executed the \nOperating Agreement, and that even if Burnette’s communication to Fife constituted \nan agreement, the Operating Agreement superseded it.  (ECF No. 61, at p. 15.)   \n38. Clark fails to present any argument in his briefs regarding the \ndeclaration he seeks in paragraph 48(b).  Therefore, the Court concludes that to the \nextent Clark seeks a declaration that “paragraph 16.03(b)(3) of the O perating \nAgreement . . . is voided because it is inconsistent with Defendant’s stated intention \nto attorney Lance Fife on or about November 18, 2011 regarding the parties ‘sharing \nin risk and gain, ” Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment  should be DENIED , and \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED. \nc. Paragraph 48(c) of the Complaint \n39. Clark seeks a declaration that “paragraph 16.03(b)(3) of the [O]perating \n[A]greement entered into on or about November 16, 2012 between Plaintiff and \n  \n \nDefendant is voided because it is both substantively and procedurally \nunconscionable.”   (ECF No. 3, at ¶48(c).)   \n40. In their Memorandum in Support of their summary judgment  motion, \nDefendants argue that Clark  had sufficient opportunity to review the terms of the \nOperating Agreement, and that Clark  has failed to present  any evidence showing \nboth procedural and substantive unconscionability, both elements that Cl ark must \nprove when asserting a contract is unconscionable.  (ECF No. 61, at p. 18.)  In Clark’s \nBrief in Opposition, Clark fails to present any argument regarding the declaration he \nseeks in paragraph 48(c).  Therefore, the Court concludes that to the extent Clark \nseeks a declaration tha t “paragraph 16.03(b)(3) of the operating agreement . . . is \nvoided because it is both substantively and procedurally unconscionable,”  Clark’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment should be DENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment should be GRANTED.  \nd. Paragraph 48(d) of the Complaint  \n41. Clark seeks a declaration that \nparagraph 16.03(b)(3) of the operating agreement entered \ninto on or about November 16, 2012 between Plaintiff and \nDefendant is voided because it refers to the “acquisition \nprice (initial value)” on “Exhibit A;” however, the actual \nExhibit A attached to the operating agreement references \nonly “Initial Capital Contributions” and “Ownership \nUnits.”  Put another way, the Exhibit A referred to in \nparagraph 16.03(b)(3) does not appear to exist. \n \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶48(d).) \n42. In support of summary judgment, Clark argues: (a) Article 16.03(b)(3) \nshould be voided because he did not receive and did not have the opportunity to \n  \n \nreview the JBAC Properties List  either prior to or at the moment the Operating \nAgreement was signed, which Clark contends , establishes a lack of “meeting of the \nminds” as to what constitutes the JBAC Properties List,  (ECF No. 58, at p. 12) ; (b) \nthat the addition of the JBAC Properties List after execution of the Operating \nAgreement req uired an  “amend[ment] by affirmative vote as required by Section \n17.14 of the Operating Agreement”  ( id. at p p. 12 –13); and (c) that the document \nlisting the properties is not titled as “Exhibit A” and contains some information \nregarding the “Acquisition Cost” of the properties that differs from the sales price for \nthe properties provided in Wake County’s public records.  (id. at p. 12.)  \n43.  Defendants argue that the parties had a meeting of the minds with \nregards to the JBAC Properties List  because Clark was on notice of the properties \nJBAC owned as they were listed in the company’s books and records, and because  \nBurnette transmitted the JBAC Properties List  to Clark on the same day the \nOperating Agreement was executed in an email he sent to Fif e.  (ECF No. 61, at pp. \n20–21.)  Defendants also argue that the differences between the “acquisition costs” in \nthe JBAC Properties List and the sales prices that appears in Wake County’s records \nare due to Wake County listing a “package sale price ,” which is different from the \nacquisition cost for each property listed in the alleged Exhibit A.  (ECF No. 62, at p. \n12.)     \n44. “No contract is formed without an agreement to which at least two \nparties manifest an intent to be bound. ”  Parker v. Glosson, 182 N.C. App. 229, 232 \n(2007)  (citing Croom v. Goldsboro Lumber Co., Inc., 182 N.C. 217, 220 (1921) (stating \n  \n \nthat mutual assent is an “essential element” of every contract.  This mutual assent is \ncustomarily described as a “meeting of the minds.”  See Charles Holmes Mach. Co. v. \nChalkley, 143 N.C. 181, 183 (1906) (“The first and most essential element of an \nagreement is the consent of the parties, an  aggregatio mentium, or meeting of two \nminds in one and the same intention, and until the moment arrives when the minds \nof the parties are thus drawn together, the contract is not complete, so as to be legally \nenforceable.”)).  “A contract, and by implication a provision, ‘leaving material portions \nopen for future agreement is nugatory and void for indefiniteness.’ ”  MCB, Ltd. v. \nMcGowan, 86 N.C. App. 607, 609 (1987) (citing Boyce v. McMahan, 285 N.C. 730, 734 \n(1976)).  “Consequently any contract provision . . .  failing to specify either directly or \nby implication a material term is invalid as a matter of law.”  Id. at 609.  \n45. The Court first considers the language of Article 16.03(b)(3) in its proper \ncontext and in conjunction with the  other terms of the Operating Agreement.  \nSingleton v. Haywood Elec. Membership Corp., 357 N.C. 623, 629 (2003) (“The various \nterms of the [contract] are to be harmoniously construed . . . .”).  Each clause and word \nis considered wit h reference to each other and is given effect by reasonable \nconstruction.  Sec. Nat'l Bank of Greensboro v. Educators Mut. Life Ins. Co., 265 N.C. \n86, 93 (1965) (“[A] paragraph or excerpt must be interpreted in context with the rest \nof the agreement.”  (quoting 1 Strong's North Carolina Index: Contracts  § 12, at 585 \n(1957))). \n46. Article 16 of the Operating Agreement is titled “Dissolution and \nTermination.”  (ECF N o. 40.2, at p. 14 .)  Article 16.03(b)(3) is found within  Article \n  \n \n16.03, “Winding Up, Liquidation and Distribution of Assets.”  (Id.)  Articles 16.03(a) \nand (b) provide that “[u]pon dissolution, the Company shall conduct an accounting of \nits accounts, assets, liabilities and operations” and “[t]he Managers shall distribute \nall of the Company’s assets . . . in the following order,”  first to “the payment of the \nexpenses of liquidation and the debts and liabilities of the Company” and then to \nsetting up any reserves necessary to additional anticipated obligations of JBAC.  (Id.) \n47. Article 16.03(b)(3) specifi cally addresses the valuation of JBAC real \nproperty assets and provides that in the event Clark dissolve s JBAC, Burnette can \nelect to keep “all existing real estate” and that “ Clark shall receive one- half (1/2) of \nthe value of the properties listed on Exhibit ‘A’ at the acquisition price (initial value) \nshown on Exhibit \"A\" ( . . . ) and NOT of the current fair market value ‘ FMV’ of the \nproperties at the time of . . . Dissolution [.]”  (Id. at p. 15 (capitalization in original).)  \nOn the other hand, the parties agreed that if Burnette elected to dissolve JBAC, Clark \nand Burnette would “split any equity in the Company equally.”  ( Id., at Art. 16.04.)  \nIt is clear from the context that the Company’s “equity” includes the fair market value \nof JBAC’s real property at the time of dissolution. \n48. Considered in context with the other provisions of Article 16, the \nlanguage used in Article 16.03(b)(3) does not support Clark’s contention that he and \nBurnette did not have a meeting of the minds.  Rather, the language reflects that the \nparties agreed upon a means of determining how Clark’s value in JBAC’s real \nproperty would be valued if he dissolved JBAC, a nd that he would be credited with \none-half the cost of acquiring the property.  Article 16.03(b)(3) does not leave \n  \n \n“material portions open for future agreement ,” nor does it “fail[ ] to specify either \ndirectly or by implication a material term.”  MCB, Ltd., 86 N.C. App. at 609. \n49. Clark contends that, because he had not seen the JBAC Properties List \nwhen he signed the Operating Agreement, there could not have been a meeting of the \nminds as to the contents of the list.  The Court disagrees.  Article 16.03(b)(3)  clearly \nexpresses the parties’ intent to set out the acquisition costs of certain JBAC \nproperties in a list to be attached to the Operating Agreement.  It is undisputed that \nExhibit A to the Operating Agreement executed by Clark was not the Exhibit A \nreferenced in Article 16.03(b)(3).  Nevertheless, the intent to include such a list is \nclear. \n50. Furthermore, since Article 16.03(b)(3) reflects Clark and Burnette’s \nagreement to attach to the Operating Agreement a list of JBAC properties to be used \nfor valuing Clark’s interest, neither the failure to attach it at the moment of execution \nnor the erroneous reference to “Exhibit A”  negates the agreement.   “Every valid \ncontract must contain a description of the subject -matter; but it is not necessary it \nshould be so described as to admit of no doubt what it is, for the identity of the actual \nthing and the thing described may be shown by extrinsic evidence.”  Rawls & Assocs. \nv. Hurst, 144 N.C. App. 286, 290 (2001).  Here, the list of JBAC properties that the \nparties intended to attach to the Operating Agreement can be established by extrinsic \nevidence.  \n51. The Court finds no merit in Clark’s argument that there was no meeting \nof the minds due to the failure to attach the JBAC Properties List at the time Clark \n  \n \nsigned the Operating Agreement.  Article 16.03(b)(3) clearly outlines the aftermath \nof dissolution, and how Clark’s interest in JBAC’s real property would be valued if he \nelected to dissolve.  The parties had a meeting of the minds that the properties and \ntheir acquisition costs or values would be provided in a separate list to be attached to \nthe Operating Agreement.  Section 16.03(b)(3) does not leave any material provision \nopen such that the Court can declare this section “nugatory and void for \nindefiniteness.”  MCB, Ltd., 86 N.C. App. at 609 (citing Boyce v. McMahan, 285 N.C. \n730, 734 (1976)). \n52. The fact that the document labeled “ Exhibit A ” attached to the \nOperating Agreement was not the JBAC Properties List also does not create an issue \nof fact as to a meeting of the minds.  Clark, as a signatory to the Operating \nAgreement, is charged with knowledge of the provisions of the Operating Agreement.  \nJones v. Home Sec. Life Ins. Co., 254 N.C. 407, 413 (1961) (“In the absence of fraud or \nmistake, a party will not be h eard to say that he was ignorant of the contents of a \ncontract signed by him.” (quoting Cuthbertson v. Insurance Co ., 96 N.C. 480, 486  \n(1887)); see also Bell v. Nationwide Ins. Co.,  146 N.C. App. 725, 728  (2001) (quoting \nsame).  Clark was, or should have b een, aware that Exhibit A was not the list of \nproperties referenced in Article 16.03(b)(3), and that he was signing the Operating \nAgreement without the JBAC Properties List being attached.  Clark does not allege \nhe was defrauded, and he cannot now be heard  to claim that he was unaware that \nthe JBAC Properties List was not attached at the time he signed the Operating \nAgreement.   \n  \n \n53. The fact that the sales prices for some of the properties in Wake County’s \nrecords differ slightly from the acquisition costs listed in what Defendant now claims \nto be the JBAC Properties List also does not create an issue of fact as to whether \nthere was a meeting of the minds.  What actually constituted the JBAC Properties \nList, as well as the contents of that list and the accuracy of the acquisition prices, can \nbe shown by extrinsic evidence. \n54. Finally, since the Court concludes that the parties had a meeting of the \nminds  and agreed that the JBAC Properties List would be attached to the Operating \nAgreement, the Court is not persuaded by Clark’s argument that the later \nattachment of the list required an amendment to the Operating Agreement. \n55. Therefore, to the extent Clark  seeks a declaration that paragraph \n16.03(b)(3) of the Operating Agreement is voided  because the “Exhibit A referred to \nin paragraph 16.03(b)(3) does not appear to exist,”  Clark’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment should be DENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment \nshould be GRANTED. \ne. Paragraph 48(e) of the Complaint \n56. Clark seeks a declaration that “the operating agreement entered into on \nor about November 16, 2012 between Plaintiff and Defendant does not contain a \nmerger clause and is therefore not the entire agreement between the parties.”  (ECF \nNo. 3, at ¶ 48(e). )  Defendants seek summary judgment regarding this declaration, \narguing that Clark has failed to create an issue of fact that there are additional \nagreements between Clark and Burnette outside of the Operating Agreement.  (ECF \n  \n \nNo. 61, at p. 22.)  Defendants argue that “[w]hen asked . . . what other terms besides \nthe [Operating Agreement] form the parties’ entire agreement,” Clark responded only \nthat “Burnette has on multiple occasions . . . represented to Clark that each is to be \na 50/50 partner sharing equally in risk and gain.”  (ECF No. 61, at p. 22 (citing Clark’s \n3rd Supp. Resp. Interrog., ECF No. 57.7, at p. 10 ).)  Defendants contend that the \nOperating Agreement creates the 50/50 partnership, and Clark’s so -called “extrinsic \nagreement . . . does not alter and is consistent with the” Operating Agreement.  (Id.) \n57. Clark did not respond to Defendants’ argument and did not address the \ndeclaration sought in paragraph 48(e) of the Complaint anywhere in his briefing. \n58. While the Operating Agreement does not contain a merger clause, Clark \nhas failed to produce evidence creating a genuine issue of fact that the Operating \nAgreement is not the entire agreement between the parties.  Therefore, to the extent \nClark seeks a declaration that the Operating Agreem ent does not contain a merger \nclause, Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED, and \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be DENIED.  However, to the \nextent Clark seeks a declaration that the Operating Agreement is not the entire \nagreement between the parties , Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be \nDENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED. \nf. Paragraph 48(g) of the Complaint \n59.   Clark seeks a declaration that  \n[Clark] had certain obligations under the operating \nagreement entered onto on or about November 16, 2012 \nbetween Plaintiff and Defendant to wit : Collections, \nProperty Maintenance and day to day operations, and \n  \n \nPlaintiff has satisfactorily fulfilled his obligation s \nunder the operating agreement.  \n \n60. It is undisputed that Burnette was not significantly involved in JBAC’s \nday-to-day operations until approximately 2019.  Clark contends that since JBAC has \nbeen in operation since late 2011,  \nthe fact that [Clark] satisfa ctorily performed the day -to-\nday management of JBAC [is]  the only logical inference \nthat can be drawn  . . . [o]therwise, JBAC would have \nsimply ceased to exist.  A real estate management company \ncould not have existed for roughly eight years without \nsomeone handling day -to-day operations, collections, and \nproperty maintenance.   \n \n(ECF No. 58, at p. 18.) \n \n61. Defendants argue that, at times, Clark’s management of the day-to-day \noperations did not yield sufficient cash flow, and that once Burnette started becoming \nmore involved with JBAC’s operations, its performance improved dramatically.  (ECF \nNo. 61, at p. 23.)   Burnette testified that there were periods of time during which \nClark did not keep JBAC’s properties rented, failed to ti mely collect rent from \ntenants, and did not keep up with repairs to the properties.  (ECF No.  57.1, at pp. \n124–26.)  Clark himself testified : “[t]here were many, many times where we were \nunable to pay our bills.”  (ECF No. 60.1, at p. 46.) \n62.  The evidence raises an issue of fact as to whether Clark “ satisfactorily \nfulfilled his obligations under the operating agreement” to perform the duties of \n“collections, property maintenance and day to day operations.”  Therefore, to the \nextent Clark seeks a declaration t hat he satisfactorily performed his obligations for \n“collections, property maintenance and day to day operations ” of JBAC,  Clark’s \n  \n \nMotion for Summary Judgment should be DENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment should be DENIED. \nii. Breach of Contract \n63. Clark also claims Burnette breached the Operating Agreement “by inter \nalia failing to take any affirmative steps to acquire, or successfully strategically direct \nJBAC’s investments.”  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 36–43.)  In his briefing, Clark also contends \nthat Burnette breached the Operating Agreement by “1) not managing the day-to-day \noperations of JBAC; and 2) spending over $5,000.00 from JBAC’s accounts witho ut \nthe written consent of Clark” and “being totally unfamiliar with JBAC’s operating \nprocedures in order to facilitate day -to-day operating activities.”  (ECF No. 5 8, at p. \n8.) \n64. The Court already has addressed Clark’s claim that Burnette breached \nArticle 5.03(h) by failing to acquire additional properties for JBAC after October 2013.  \nFor the same reasons stated therein, to the exten t the parties seek summary \njudgment in their respective favors on Clark’s claim that Burnette breached the \nOperating Agreement by failing to acquire additional properties for JBAC after \nOctober 2013, Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be DENIED, and \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be DENIED. \n65. With regard to Clark’s additional claims for breach of the Operatin g \nAgreement, Defendants first argue that they are entitled to summary judgment \nbecause Clark did not allege them in the Complaint, and cannot raise the claims for \nthe first time in a motion for summary judgment.  (ECF No. 61, at p.  8; ECF No. 62, \n  \n \nat p. 4.)   However, Defendants admit that Clark raised the alleged additional \nbreaches in his responses to Defendants’ discovery requests.  (ECF No. 61, at p. 8.)  \nThis is borne out by the record evidence which establishes that Clark explicitly raised \nthe claims in supplemental responses to Defendants’ interrogatories.  (ECF No. 57.7, \nat pp. 6–8.)  The additional claimed breaches are properly before the Court. \n66. Clark’s claim that Burnette breached the Operating Agreement by \nfailing to participate in the day -to-day ma nagement of JBAC borders on being \nfrivolous.  As Defendants correctly contend, the provision at issue – “[t]he Managers \nshall have the responsibility for the day -to-day operation and management of the \nCompany” (ECF No. 40.2, at p. 5, Article 5.02(b)) – is standard language in a limited \nliability operating agreement delegating general authority to the managers.  (ECF \nNo. 62, at pp. 5 –6.)  However, the parties expressly agreed in the Operating \nAgreement that Clark had primary responsibility for day -to-day man agement of \nJBAC.  (ECF No. 40.2, at p. 6 .)  Well established rules of contract construction hold \nthat the specific assignment of duties governs over the general assignment.   Lail v. \nCleveland County Bd. of Educ. , 183 N.C. App. 554, 563 (2007) (“Our cannons  of \ncontract construction hold that ‘when general terms and specific statements are \nincluded in the same contract and there is a conflict, the general terms should give \nway to the specifics.’”  (quoting Wood--Hopkins Contracting Co. v. North Carolina \nState Ports Auth ., 284 N.C. 732, 738 (1974)) ).  The Court concludes that the \nunambiguous terms of the Operating Agreement assign day -to-day management \n  \n \nresponsibilities to Clark and not to Burnette, and therefore Clark’s claim fails as a \nmatter of law. \n67. Therefore, to the exten t the parties seek summary judgment in their \nrespective favors on Clark’s claim that Burnette breached the Operating Agreement \nby failing to participate in the day -to-day management of JBAC, Clark’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment should  be DENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment should be GRANTED. \n68. Clark also alleges that Burnette breached Article 5.02(c) by directing the \npayment of $50,000 from JBAC’s accounts to the law firm Burnette  retained to \nrepresent both him and JBAC i n this lawsuit without obtaining Clark’s consent as \nco-manager of JBAC.  (ECF No. 58, at pp. 9– 10.)  Clark contends that by admitting \nthat he directed the payment , Burnette has “admitted” breaching the Operating \nAgreement.  (Id. at p. 9.)  In response, Def endants argue that he did not breach the \nagreement because “[t]he Operating Agreement entitles both Burnette and JBAC to \nadvancement of defense expenses.”  (ECF No. 62, at p. 7.) \n69. The Court concludes that it effectively decided this claim when it issued \nits Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment on Defendants’ \nCounterclaim.  Clark v. Burnette, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 139, *11 -12 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nDec. 2, 2020) (“Order and Opinion”).  In the Order and Opinion, the Court held that \nBurnette was entitled to advancement of the legal expenses incurred in defending the \nclaims made against him in this lawsuit and for legal expenses he paid out-of-pocket \nfor the defense of the claims made against JBAC.  Id. at *24.  Such entitlement arises \n  \n \nboth under the terms of the Operating Agreement and under the North Carolina \nLimited Liability Act.  Id. at *22.  Accordingly, while the better course of conduct may \nhave been for Burnette to consult with Clark and seek his consent before directing \nthe $50,000 payment from JBAC to his lawyers, the Court holds that his failure to do \nso was not a breach of the Operating Agreement.3 \n70. Therefore, to the extent the parties seek summary judgment in their \nrespective favors on Clark’s claim that Burnette breached the Operating Agreement \nby failing to obtain Clark’s consent to make the $50,000 payment for advancement \nand reimbursement of legal expenses, Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment should \nbe DENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be GRANTED. \niii. Quantum Meruit  \n71. In the alternative to the claim for breach of contract, Clark alleges a \nclaim for quantum meruit against Burnette. Clark argues that he “furnished . . . \nlabor, time, and expertise for the use and benefit of Defendant  [sic],” that Burnette \naccepted this labor without objection, and that Clark did not supply his labor \ngratuitously.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 51, 53, 54.)   Clark alleges that Burnette “has failed \nor refused to modify the oppressive terms of the . . . [O]perating [A]greement in a way \nthat would fairly protect and compensate Clark for the value of [his] labor, time, and \nexpertise.”  (Id. at ¶ 55.)  Plaintiff and Defendants move for summary judgment on \nClark’s claim for quantum meruit.  (ECF Nos. 56 and 59.) \n \n3 The Court understands that the parties have now agreed upon a process for providing advancement \nand reimbursement.  By its holding that Burnette did not violate the Operating Agreement in directing \nthis initial payment to the law firm , the Court is not authorizing Burnette to direct future payment s \nfor advancement or reimbursement other than under the process agreed upon by the parties.  \n  \n \n72. Defendants arg ue that the existence of the Operating Agreement, an \nexpress contract between the parties, defeats Clark’s claim for unjust enrichment .  \n(ECF No. 61, at p. 12.)  Where an express contract exists covering the same subject \nmatter, a claim for quantum meruit must fail.  Vetco Concrete Co. v. Troy Lumber Co., \n256 N.C. 709, 713 (1962) (“[A]n express contract precludes an implied contract with \nreference to the same matter.”).  Clark concedes that “in the event some or all of the \nOperating Agreement is held to be enforceable by the Court that his quantum meruit \nclaim is no longer necessary.”  (ECF No. 64, at p. 12.)   \n73. It is undisputed that the Operating Agreement is an enforceable , \nexpress contract.  The Operating Agreement explicitly provides for how the members \nof JBAC are to be compensated by salary (ECF No. 40.2, at p. 6), and by distributions \n(Id. at p.  10).  Given that a n express contract exists  regarding the issue of \ncompensation, Clark’s claim for unjust enrichment seeking compensation for services \nhe performed for JBAC must fail.  Therefore, to the extent it seeks summary \njudgment on Clark’s claim for unjust enrichment  seeking compensation for services \nhe performed for JBAC , Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment s hould be \nGRANTED, and Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment should be DENIED.  \niv. Judicial Dissolution  \n74.  Clark moves for summary judgment on his claim for judicial dissolution \npursuant to N.C.G.S. § 57D-6-02.  (ECF No. 56.)  \n75. The superior court may dissolve an LLC in a proceeding brought by \neither of the following: \n  \n \n(1) . . .  \n \n(2) A member, if it is established that (i) it is not practicable to \nconduct the LLC's business in conformance with the \noperating agreement and this Chapter or (ii) liquidation of \nthe LLC is necessary to protect the rights and interests of \nthe member. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 57D-6-02 \n76. The Court concludes that the question as to whether Burnette breached \nthe Operating Agreement remains for determination by a jury.  Since a jury trial is \nnecessary, the Court will defer ruling upon the request for judicial dissolution until \nthe trial of this matter.  Therefore, to the extent Clark  seeks summary judgment in \nhis favor on the claim for judicial dissolution, Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment \nshould be DENIED at this time.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that:  \na. Defendants’ Motion to Strike is DENIED.  \nb. To the extent Clark seeks declarations that Burnette “failed to fulfill his \nobligations” under Article 5.03(h) and that “as a result of [Burnette]’s breach \nhe should be precluded from enforcing other terms of the operating agreement, \nnamely [Article] 16.03(b)(3),” Clark’s Motion for Summary Judgment is  \nDENIED, and Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment seeking judgment \nin Defendants’ favor on this claim is DENIED. \nc.
