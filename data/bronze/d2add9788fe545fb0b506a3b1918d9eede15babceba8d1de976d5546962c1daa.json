Mark  Wilson, for Plaintiff Premier, \nInc. \nThe Spence Law Firm, LLC, by Mel C.  Orchard, III, and Tin, Fulton, \nWalker & Owen, PLLC, by Sam McGee , for Defendants Dan Peterson; \nOptum Computing Solutions, Inc ., Hitschler-Cera, LLC, Donald \nBauman, Michael Held, The Held Family Limited Partnership, Robert \nWagner, Alek Beynenson, I-Grant Investments, LLC, James Munter, \nGail Shenk, Steven E. Davis, Charle s W. Leonard, III, and John Does \n1-10.   \nBledsoe, Judge. \n \nI. \nPROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n{2} This lawsuit arises out of a dispute concerning unpaid earnout payments \nthat Defendants allege they were entitled  to receive pursuant to a stock purchase \nagreement between the parties.  Premier filed this lawsuit in 2011 seeking a \ndeclaratory judgment determining that it had not breached the parties’ agreement, \nand Defendants filed counterclaims for breach of contract and the recovery of \ncertain audit expenses and attorneys’ fees.  Premier’s Mo tion seeks summary \njudgment on its claim for declaratory relief, as well as on Defendants’ \ncounterclaims.   \n{3} On September 29, 2006, Premier acquired Cereplex, Inc. (“Cereplex”) by \nentering into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Defendants, who \nare the former shareholders of and stakeholders in Cereplex.  (See Pl.’s Mem. Supp. \nMot. J. on the Pleadings or Summ. J. Ex. 1, hereinafter “Agmt.”.)  Cereplex \ndeveloped and designed web-based surveillance and analytic services to healthcare \nproviders through its software products, Setnet and PharmWatch.  (Peterson Aff. \nSept. 29, 2011 ¶ 3.)  After acquiring Cereplex, Premier developed SafetySurveillor, a \nsuccessor product that combined the functi onalities of Setnet and PharmWatch into \none software program.  (Peterson Aff. ¶ 8. )  SafetySurveillor, like its predecessors, \ngenerates automated alerts to notify the user of potential medical problems that \nrequire attention.  (Peterson Aff. ¶ 9.)  SafetySurveillor’s key features relate to its \nability to (i) facilitate infection prevention  by firing alerts to infection control \nprofessionals or other designated medical personnel regarding the potential \nexistence of clusters or outbreaks of heal thcare-associated infections, (Peterson Aff. \n¶¶ 5, 9); and (ii) provide configurable ph armacological-related alerts to medical \npersonnel based on set variables, including high-cost medication, drug \ncombinations, length of therapy, lab results, and other factors, (Peterson Aff. ¶ 11).   \n{4} The Agreement provides that Defend ants were to receive an annual \nearnout payment from Premier (the “Earnout Payment”) each year for five years \nfollowing the date of the Agreement.  (Ag mt. § 2(b)(iii).)  The Agreement provides \nthat the Earnout Payment was to be in “an amount equal to $12,500 for each \nHospital Site where a Product Implementation occurs during the applicable 12-\nmonth period[.]”  (Agmt. § 2(b)(iii).)   \n{5} “Hospital Site” is defined in the Agreement as “an individual hospital, \nnursing home, care center or similar facility (and for the avoidance of doubt a single \nhealth care company or hospital group may consist of multiple Hospital Sites).”  \n(Agmt. § 2(b)(iii).)   \n{6} “Product Implementation” is defined in the Agreement as:  \na Hospital Site that has (A) subscribed to or licensed the Company’s \nSetnet or PharmWatch product (or any derivative thereof, successor \nproduct, or new product that substantially replaces the functionality of \neither product), whether such produc t is provided, sold or licensed (for \na charge or at no charge, or provid ed on a stand-alone basis or bundled \nwith other products and/or services ) to the applicable Hospital Site by \nCompany (or its successor in interest ), any affiliate of the Company or \nany reseller authorized by the Company, and (B) completed any \napplicable implementation, configuration and testing of the product so \nthat the product is ready for production use by the Hospital Site. \n(Agmt. § 2(b)(iii).)   \n{7} The Agreement further provides that  Defendants were authorized to \nconduct an annual audit to verify that Premier was paying the correct Earnout \nPayment to Defendants each year.  Defe ndants were responsible for paying the \nexpenses associated with the annual audit, unless the audit revealed that Premier \nhad underpaid the required Earnout Amount by more than five percent.  (Agmt. § \n6(e).) \n{8} In order for SafetySurveillor to fire an  alert, Premier must have access to \na Hospital Site’s data, which includes protected health information (“PHI”).  (Davis \nDep. 14:18–14:23.)  According to Defendants, PHI cannot be provided unless express \npermission is given from the Hospital Site.  (Davis Aff. ¶¶ 3–4.)  Generally, Hospital \nSite permission comes in the form of a Business Associate Agreement (“BAA”), \nwhich grants permission for a Hospital Site’s PHI to be shared with Premier.  (Pope \nDep. 61:23–62:1.)  Although Premier ente rs into BAAs with some individual \nHospital Sites from time to time, more commonly Premier enters into BAAs with \nhospital networks that cover the individu al Hospital Sites within each network.  \n(Pope Dep. 63:18–63:23, 64:13–64: 22.)  Thus, according to Defendants, under \napplicable federal regulations, for a Hospital Site to generate an alert, the Hospital \nSite must have provided PHI to Premier subject to a BAA.  (Pope Dep. 61:23–62:1.) \n{9} Between May 2010 and September 2010, Defendant Dan Peterson (“Dr. \nPeterson”), the co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Cereplex, \nconducted a pilot audit so that Defendan ts could assess Premier’s compliance with \nthe Earnout Payment obligations under the Agreement.  (Peterson Aff. ¶ 23.)  \nAccording to Dr. Peterson, his audit “reported on the occurrence of single-event \nalerts as a simple and sure way to identify Product Implementations of \nSafetySurveillor.”  (Peterson Aff. ¶ 26.)  A single-event alert refers to the \nnotification the SafetySurveillor program dispatches to infection control \nprofessionals or other designated medica l personnel to identify either (i) the \npotential presence of a healthcare-associated infection in a patient who was \ndischarged from a Hospital Site and later sought medical attention from another \nHospital Site; or (ii) a possible problem with the antibiotic therapy prescribed to a \npatient.  (Peterson Aff. ¶ 9.) \n{10} In conducting the audit, Dr. Peterson discovered that alerts had been fired \nfrom over 1,000 healthcare facilities.  (Defs.’ Answer and Countercls. Ex. B.)  \nAccording to Dr. Peterson, “[e]ach alert relates to an individual patient and is \nspecific to the facility at which that patien t was seen, and each alert was sent to at \nleast one clinician who had chosen to be al erted about the event.”  (Peterson Aff. ¶ \n26.)  Dr. Peterson also averred that in orde r for an alert to be fired from a facility, \nthe SafetySurveillor program must have ac quired access to the facility’s patient \ndata.  (Peterson Aff. ¶ 19.) \n{11} Dr. Peterson concluded from his audit that Premier had provided \nSafetySurveillor to over 1,000 Hospital Sites but had only paid Earnout Payments \nbased on 263 Hospital Sites under the Pr oduct Implementation provision of the \nAgreement.  (Peterson Aff. ¶¶ 27–28.)  Defe ndants thereafter advised Premier that \nDefendants should be paid Earnout Payments based on the use of the \nSafetySurveillor product at the Hospital Sites  identified in the audit that had used \nthe product but for whose use Defendants  had not been paid (the “Unlisted \nFacilities”).  (Peterson Aff. ¶ 32.)  Af ter Premier refused payment, Defendants \nadvised Premier that they intended to file  suit against Premier for miscalculating \nthe Earnout Payment and violating the terms of the Agreement.  (Davis Dep. 79:13–\n79:18.)   \n{12} Subsequently, on January 19, 2011, Pr emier filed this action seeking a \ndeclaratory judgment that it had not br eached the Agreement.  The case was \ndesignated to this Court that same day, and assigned to Judge Calvin Murphy on \nJanuary 21, 2011.  On April 27, 2011, Defendants filed an answer and \ncounterclaims for breach of contract and recovery of audit expenses and attorneys’ \nfees.   \n{13} On August 30, 2011, Premier filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings \npursuant to Rule 12(c) of the North Caro lina Rules of Civil Procedure or, in the \nalternative, a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56.  This Court \n(Murphy, J.) granted summary judgment in favor of Premier on both its declaratory \njudgment claim and on Defendants’ counterclaims on December 11, 2012 (“Judge \nMurphy’s Order”).   \n{14} Defendants appealed Judge Murphy’s Order and, on March 4, 2014, the \nCourt of Appeals issued its opinion resolving Defendants’ appeal (“Court of Appeals’ \nOpinion”).  \nPremier, Inc. v. Peterson, 232 N.C. App. 601, 755 S.E.2d 56 (2014).  The \nCourt of Appeals reversed Judge Murphy’s Order, concluding that summary \njudgment was improperly entered, and remanded the case to this Court for “further \nfactual development” to determine whether Premier breached the Agreement.  Id. \nat 610, 755 S.E.2d at 62. \n{15} In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeals specifically interpreted the \nphrase “subscribed to or licensed” in the critical provision of the Agreement defining \n“Product Implementation,” (Agmt. § 2(b)(iii)), and concluded, as a matter of law, as \nfollows:   \n [T]he unmistakable meaning of the language the parties agreed upon \nin drafting the Agreement is that some affirmative act on the part of \nthe Hospital Site is required.  Defendants simply cannot escape the \nfact that the definition of Product Implementation makes clear that it \nis the Hospital Site that must “subscribe[] to or license[]” the product.      \n. . . [T]he mere receipt of SafetySu rveillor by a facility is, standing \nalone, insufficient to trigger an Earnout Payment under the \nAgreement. \nId. at 607, 755 S.E.2d at 60.  Consistent wi th this conclusion, the Court of Appeals \nfurther concluded that “the Agreement contemplates a mutual arrangement \nbetween Premier and the Hospital Site wh ereby Premier agrees to provide the \nSafetySurveillor product and the Hospital Site agrees to accept it and utilize its \nservices.”  \nId. at 608, 755 S.E.2d at 61.  Finally, the Court of Appeals remanded the \ncase to this Court, specifically instruct ing that “further factual development is \nnecessary to explore what affirmative acts—if any—were taken by the facilities \nidentified by Defendants to obtain the SafetySurveillor product so that any such \nacts can be evaluated in accordance with ou r interpretation of the ‘subscribed to or \nlicensed’ language in the Agreement.”  Id. at 610, 755 S.E.2d at 62.   \n{16} After remand, the parties submitted a joint Case Management Report on \nJune 26, 2014 advising that they had agreed  that fact discovery would follow a two-\nphased sequence: the first phase to consis t of fact witness depositions, and the \nsecond phase to consist of written discovery (the “Sequencing Agreement”).   \n{17} On June 30, 2014, the Court (Murphy, J.) entered an Amended Case \nManagement Order (the “CMO”) establis hing new deadlines for discovery and \nproviding that the parties would have th rough and including November 1, 2014 to \nconduct fact discovery as contemplated under the Sequencing Agreement (the \n“Initial Fact Discovery Deadline”).     \n{18} On the evening of October 31, 2014, the day before the Initial Fact \nDiscovery Deadline was to expire, Defe ndants served their First Set of \nInterrogatories and Requests for Produc tion of Documents.  Thereafter, on \nNovember 21, 2014, Premier filed a Motion for Protective Order seeking the Court’s \nruling that Defendants’ discovery requests were untimely under Rule 18.8 of the \nGeneral Rules of Practice and Procedure for the North Carolina Business Court \n(“Business Court Rule(s)”) because the discovery could not be answered by the \nInitial Fact Discovery Deadline.1  Although Defendants had plainly failed to comply \nwith Business Court Rule 18.8, the Court ch ose to give great deference to the Court \nof Appeals’ directive to permit “fuller development of the factual record” concerning \nPremier’s alleged breach, Premier, 232 N.C. App. at 610, 755 S.E. 2d at 62, and \ndirected Premier by Order dated March 12,  2015 to serve responses to Defendants’ \ntardy discovery requests.  The parties su bsequently engaged in extensive written \ndiscovery and related document production.2   \n{19} Premier timely filed the Motion on December 1, 2015, and briefing was \ncompleted on January 13, 2016.  The Court held a hearing on the Motion on \nFebruary 26, 2016, and the Motion is now ripe for resolution.   \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{20} Summary judgment is appropriate wh en the “pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if \nany, show that there is no genuine issue as  to any material fact and that any party \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The moving party \n                                                 \n1  Business Court Rule 18.8 provides that “[t]he requirement that discovery be completed within a \nspecified time means that adequate provisions mu st be made for interrogatories and requests for \nadmission to be answered, for docu ments to be produced, and for depositions to be held within the \ndiscovery period.”  BCR 18.8.  \n  \n2  As the Court noted in its August 26, 2015 order: \n   \nSince this case was remanded to this Court, the Court has sought to give full effect to \nthe Court of Appeals’ directive that this Court provide for “fuller development of the \nfactual record,” Premier, 755 S.E.2d at 62. In particular, the Court has permitted the \nparties to implement the Sequencing Agreement, pursuant to which Defendants \nelected to take three fact depositions in Oc tober 2014, and, over Plaintiff’s vigorous \nobjections regarding proper content and scope, has afforded Defendants a full and \nfair opportunity to obtain written discovery and over 26,300 pages of documents from \nPlaintiff consistent with the Court’s underst anding of the instructions contained in \nthe Court of Appeals Opinion.  \n \n(Order Amending Amended Case Management Order (Second Revised) ¶ 11.) \n \nhas “the burden of showing there is no triable issue of material fact.”  Farrelly v. \nHamilton Square, 199 N.C. App 541, 543, 459 S.E.2d 23, 25–26 (1995).   \n{21} The movant may meet this burden “by showing either that: (1) an \nessential element of the non-movant’s ca se is nonexistent; or (2) based upon \ndiscovery, the non-movant cannot produce evidence to support an essential element \nof its claim; or (3) the movant cannot su rmount an affirmative defense which would \nbar the claim.”  McKinnon v. CV Indus ., 213 N.C. App. 328, 332, 713 S.E.2d 495, \n499 (2011) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  In determining \nwhether this burden has been met, the Co urt must view the evidence in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its \nfavor.  Whitley v. Cubberly , 24 N.C. App. 204, 206–07, 210 S.E.2d 289, 291 (1974); \nsee generally McKee v. James , 2014 NCBC LEXIS 74, at *13–14 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nDec. 31, 2014) (discussing standard). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n{22} The Agreement unambiguously provides that an annual Earnout Payment \nshall be paid to Defendants in “an amount equal to $12,500 for each Hospital Site \nwhere a Product Implementation occurs.” (Agmt. § 2(b)(iii).)  The Agreement further \nprovides, in part, that a Product Implementation “means a Hospital Site that has \n(A) subscribed to or licensed the [SafetySurveillor product]. . . .”  (Agmt. § 2(b)(iii).) \n{23} As noted above, the Court of Appeals concluded that “the unmistakable \nmeaning of the language the parties agreed upon in drafting the Agreement is that \nsome affirmative act on the part of the Hospital Site is requ ired” for a Product \nImplementation to occur.  Premier, 232 N.C. App. at 607, 755 S.E.2d at 60.  The \nCourt specifically rejected Defendants’ contention that the “subscribed to or \nlicensed” language could be “satisfied simply by virtue of Premier’s provision of the \nSafetySurveillor product to a facility,” and instead held that “it is the Hospital Site \nthat must ‘subscribe[] to or license[]’ the product,” id., because “the Agreement \ncontemplates a mutual arrangement between Premier and the Hospital Site \nwhereby Premier agrees to provide the SafetySurveillor product and the Hospital \nSite agrees to accept it and utilize its services.”  Id. at 608, 755 S.E.2d at 61.  \nHaving reached that conclusion, the Court of Appeals instructed that further \nfactual development be permitted in this Court to “explore what affirmative acts—if \nany—were taken by the facilities identified by Defendants to obtain the \nSafetySurveillor product \nso that any such acts can be evaluated in accordance with \nour interpretation of the ‘subscribed to or licensed’ language in the Agreement.”  Id. \nat 610, 755 S.E.2d at 62 (emphasis added).   \n{24} The Court concludes that the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the \nAgreement is binding on this Court under the law of the case doctrine.  This well-\nestablished doctrine provides that “when an appellate court passes on a question \nand remands the cause for further proceedin gs, the questions there settled become \nthe law of the case . . . in subseque nt proceedings in the trial court.”  Bank of Am., \nN.A. v. Rice , 780 S.E.2d 873, 880 (N.C. Ct . App. 2015) (quoting Hayes v. City of \nWilmington, 243 N.C. 525, 536, 91 S.E.2d 673, 681–82 (1956)).  The doctrine applies \nto “points actually presented and ne cessary to the determination of the \ncase,”Condollene v. Condollene, 137 N.C. App. 547, 551, 528 S.E.2d 639, 642 (2000), \nand requires that “[n]o judgment other than that directed or permitted by the \nappellate court may be entered.”  D & W, Inc. v. City of Charlotte , 268 N.C. 720, \n722, 152 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1966).  As a result, “[o]n the remand of a case after \nappeal, the mandate of the reviewing court is binding on the lower court, and must \nbe strictly followed, withou t variation and departure.”  Couch v. Private Diagnostic \nClinic, 146 N.C. App. 658, 667, 554 S.E.2d 356, 363 (2001) (citations and quotation \nmarks omitted), disc. rev. denied and appeal dismissed , 355 N.C. 348, 563 S.E.2d \n562 (2002).  Accordingly, based on the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the \nAgreement, it is the law of this case that for a Product Implementation to occur \nunder the Agreement, a Hospital Site must have taken some affirmative act to \nobtain the SafetySurveillor product.   \n{25} Much of Defendants’ opposition to Premier’s’ Motion, however, is premised \non Defendants’ contention that the Cour t of Appeals mistakenly interpreted the \n“subscribe to or license” language in the Agreement and misunderstood how the \nSafetySurveillor product was purchased, implem ented, and used in actual practice.  \n(Defs.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. 4.)  In particular, Defendants argue that \nSafetySurveillor was marketed and sold to hospital systems, not individual facilities \nor Hospital Sites within those systems, and that the subscription agreements for \nthe product were entered between Premier and the hospital systems or networks, \nnot with the individual facilities or Hospital Sites.  (Defs.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. \n4.)  As a result, Defendants argue that th e Agreement should be read as providing \nthat a Product Implementation occurs not only when the Hospital Site takes an \naffirmative act to obtain the SafetySurv eillor product, but also when someone \nacting on behalf of the Hospital Site takes an affirmative act to obtain the product.  \n(Defs.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. 19–22.)  Construing the Ag reement in this fashion, \nDefendants argue that they have brought forward evidence showing that \naffirmative acts were taken on behalf of the Unlisted Facilities to obtain the \nSafetySurveillor product sufficient to defeat Premier’s Motion. \n{26}  The Court is not persuaded.  First, it  is undisputed that Defendants have \nnot brought forward evidence showing that  any Unlisted Facility took affirmative \nacts to obtain the SafetySurveillor pr oduct.  For example, Dr. Peterson \nacknowledged this lack of evidence at his deposition: \nQ:  So as we sit here today, you have  no evidence to show that any of \nthe thousand plus entities for which you believe you’re entitled to an \nearnout have taken any affirmative acts on their own to subscribe to or \nlicense the SafetySurveillor product, correct? \n. . .  \nA:  At this very preliminary point, I do not have that. \n(Peterson Dep. 15:13–15:24.)   \nQ:  As you sit here today, you have no facts to show that any of the \nentities for which you’re claiming you are owed an earnout have agreed \nto utilize the services of SafetySurveillor, correct? \nA:  Correct.   \n(Peterson Dep. 22:2–22:7.)  Defendants offer no evidence to the contrary from any \nother Defendant, and likewise have not offe red any evidence from any third party, \nincluding from any of the Unlisted Facilities. \n{27} Unable to proffer specific evidence that any Unlisted Facility took \naffirmative acts to obtain the Safety Surv eillor product, Defendants point to four \nalleged “affirmative acts” made on behalf of the Unlisted Facilities that Defendants \ncontend create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a Product \nImplementation occurred. \n{28} First, Defendants contend that a hospital network’s entry into a BAA with \nPremier on behalf of an individual Unlisted Facility constitutes an affirmative act \nby that Facility because under federal law a BAA must be in place for a Facility to \nsend PHI to Premier.  Defendants, however, have presented no evidence that a BAA \nexisted between any Unlisted Facility and Premier.  The Court concludes that \nevidence of a legal requirement requirin g a BAA between Premier and the hospital \nnetworks is not evidence of an affirmat ive act taken by an Unlisted Facility, as \nrequired under the Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the Agreement.   \n{29} Similarly, Defendants next argue that  an affirmative act occurred each \ntime an Unlisted Facility sent PHI to Premier because of the legal requirement that \nsuch information could not be transfe rred without a BAA between Premier and the \nhospital networks covering the Facility.  Again, however, Defendants do not offer \nany evidence that any Unlisted Facilitie s (rather than the hospital networks) \nactually sent PHI to Premier, and, in an y event, the Court concludes that any such \nevidence does not demonstrate an affirmat ive act taken by an Unlisted Facility as \nrequired under the Agreement.   \n{30} Defendants also contend that the creation of an alert by an Unlisted \nFacility constitutes an affirmative act beca use it demonstrates that the Facility has \nrequested that an infection preventionist at the Facility receive an alert.  \nDefendants, however, have presented no evidence showing that any of the Unlisted \nFacilities actually set up alerts, requested al erts, were ever sent an alert, or were \naware that alerts were generated by Sa fetySurveillor.  Moreover, even if an \ninfection preventionist set up alerts for a Facility, Defendants have presented no \nevidence that the infection preventionist’s action was actually taken by the Facility, \nrather than simply by the infection preventi onist himself or for another entity.  As \nsuch, Defendants’ evidence does not show an affirmative act taken by an Unlisted \nFacility under the Court of Appeals’ Opinion.   \n{31} Finally, Defendants argue that the ho spital networks should be deemed \nthe agents of the Unlisted Facilities and that, therefore, the acts taken by the \nnetworks on behalf of the Facilities constitute acts of the Facilities themselves.  The \nCourt finds Defendants’ argument without merit.  First, Defendants did not plead \nagency in their answer or counterclaims, di d not raise the issue in their opposition \nbrief, and asserted the argument for the fi rst time at the hearing on the Motion.  \nRegardless, Defendants have not presente d any evidence of the existence of an \nagency relationship between any of the hospital networks and any of the Facilities.  \n“An agency relationship arises when partie s manifest consent that one shall act on \nbehalf of the other and subject to his control.”  Bauer v. Douglas Aquatics, Inc. , 207 \nN.C. App. 65, 74, 698 S.E.2d 757, 764 (20 10) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  In particular, Defendants have presented no evidence that any Facility or \nany hospital network manifested consent that the network would act as an agent on \nbehalf of the Facility and under the Facilit y’s control.  As a result, Defendants’ \nagency argument is unavailing at this stage of the litigation.  \nSee Smock v. \nBrantley, 76 N.C. App. 73, 75, 331 S.E.2d 714,  716 (1985) (citation omitted) (when \nthere is no evidence tending to prove an agency relationship, the existence of agency \nis a question of law for the Court). \n{32} In sum, despite ample opportunity to  develop a more complete factual \nrecord, Defendants have failed to bring forward evidence that any of the Unlisted \nFacilities took “affirmative acts . . . to  obtain the SafetySurveillor product.”  \nPremier, 232 N.C. App. at 610, 755 S.E.2d at 62.  Beca use the Court of Appeals has \nconcluded that “the Agreement requires some affirmative act by a Hospital Site to \nsubscribe to or license the SafetySurveillor product in order for Product \nImplementation to occur,” \nid., Defendants cannot show that there was a Product \nImplementation at any Unlisted Facility.  Because Earnout Payments are only due \nunder the Agreement for a Product Implementation, the Court concludes that no \nEarnout Payments are due for use of the SafetySurveillor product at any Unlisted \nFacility.  \n{33} Premier also seeks summary judgment on the basis that Defendants have \nfailed to offer evidence showing that (i) any of the Unlisted Facilities met the \ndefinition of a “Hospital Site” under th e Agreement and (ii) that any Unlisted \nFacility “completed any applicable implementation, configuration and testing of the \nproduct so that the product is ready for production use.”\n3  Defendants counter \nPremier’s first argument by contending that “a simple google search of the locations \nlisted by Dr. Peterson easily  resolves” whether the “facilities constitute Hospital \nSites.”  (Def. Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. 12 n.2).  While the Court declines Defendants’ \ninvitation to perform over 1,000 Google searches, the Court is satisfied that \nDefendants have offered enough evidence, through Google search and otherwise, to \ncreate at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether some or all of the \nUnlisted Facilities constitute “Hospital Sites” under the Agreement.   \n{34} As to Premier’s second argument , however, the Court finds that \nDefendants have largely offered evidence and arguments that ineluctably rest on \nthe theory expressly rejected by the Court of Appeals that receipt of an alert \nequates to an affirmative act and thus a Product Implementation. \nPremier, 232 \nN.C. App. at 607, 755 S.E. 2d at 60 (“[T]he mere recei pt of SafetySurveillor by a \nfacility is, standing alone, insufficient to trigger an Earnout Payment under the \nAgreement.”).  As a result, the Court concludes that Premier’s Motion should also be \ngranted based on Defendants’ failure to bring forward evidence that any Unlisted \nFacility “completed any applicable implementation, configuration and testing of the \nproduct so that the product is ready for production use” as required under the \nAgreement.   \n{35} Based on the above, the Court concludes that Premier is entitled to the \nentry of a declaratory judgment finding that Premier has not violated Defendants’ \n                                                 \n3  The “Product Implementation” definition in the Agreement includes a Hospital Site that has “(B) \ncompleted any applicable implementation, configuration and testing of the product so that the \nproduct is ready for production use by the Hospital Site.”  (Agmt. § 2(b)(iii).) \nrights to receive Earnout Payments und er the Agreement for alleged Product \nImplementations at the Unlisted Facilities and that, as a result, dismissal of \nDefendants’ counterclaims with prejudice is proper. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{36} Accordingly, the Court hereby GRANTS Premier’s Motion and ORDERS \nas follows: \ni. Defendants’ counterclaims for breach  of contract, attorneys’ fees, \nand recovery of audit expenses are hereby DISMISSED with \nprejudice. \nii. The Court hereby enters judgment  for Premier on Premier’s claim \nfor declaratory judgment. \n{37} It is, therefore, ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Premier \nhas not violated Defendants’ rights to receive Earnout Payments under the \nAgreement for alleged Product Implemen tations at the Unlisted Facilities or \notherwise violated any purported rights of Defendants as alleged by Defendants in \nthis action.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 13th day of May, 2016. \n \n/s/ Louis A.
