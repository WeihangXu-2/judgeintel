Ruley, for \nDefendant Tammy Whitworth. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \n \nI. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \n3. Plaintiffs’ 10.9 Request seeks the Court’s intervention to prevent a party \ndeponent from making extensive, substantive corrections to her deposition testimony \nthrough the timely submission of a signed errata sheet setting forth those corrections \nand the reasons therefor  under North Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 30(e) (“Rule \n30(e)”). \n4. Whitworth was deposed  on September 27, 2017 , a nd the court reporter \ntranscribing the depo sition provided Whitworth a copy of the deposition transcript \nshortly thereafter.  Consistent with Rule 30(e), Whitworth was permitted thirty days \n \n \nto read and make changes to her deposition testimony “ in form or substance.”  By \norder dated November 3, 2017 , the Court extended Whitworth’s transcript review  \nperiod through and including December 11, 2017 for good cause shown.  \n5. On December 11, 2017, Whitworth submitted to Plaintiffs and the court \nreporter her signed errata sheet reflecting numerous changes to her deposition  \ntranscript and the reasons therefor (the “Errata Sheet”) .  Of particular relevance to \nthis 10.9 Request , Whitworth made thirty-eight substantive changes to her \ndeposition testimony on the signed Errata Sheet.   \n6. On January 3, 2018, Plaintiffs ’ counsel advised Whitworth’s counsel that \nthey “d[id] not accept the[]  changes” set forth in Whitworth’s Errata Sheet.  After \nadditional correspondence between the parties in January and March 2018 did not \nresult in a resolution of the dispute, Plaintiffs submitted the 10.9 Request to the \nCourt on July 12, 2018.   \n7. Whitworth submitted a response to the 10.9 Request on July 19, 2018, after \nwhich the Court held the July 23 Conference, at which all parties were represented \nby counsel.  \nII. \nANALYSIS \n8. Plaintiffs contend that twenty-seven of Whitworth’s thirty-eight changes set \nforth in the Errata Sheet should be stricken because they involve extensive and \nimpermissible substantive alterations to Whitworth’s deposition testimony that \neffectively substitute Defendants’ counsel’s words for Whitworth’s own.  \n \n \nAlternatively, Plaintiffs assert that, should the Court permit the Errata Sheet to alter \nWhitworth’s testimony , Plaintiffs should be permitted  to re -depose Whitworth \nconcerning her Errata Sheet entries.  \n9. In response, Whitworth and Defendants assert that nearly all the changes \nset forth in Whitworth’s Errata Sheet were made to clarify her deposition testimony \nor make her testimony accurate and were fully permitted by the express terms of \nRule 30(e).   \n10. The plain language of Rule 30(e) permits a deponent to change the \ndeponent’s deposition transcript “in form or substance,” so long as the deponent \n“sign[s] a statement reciting such changes and the reasons  . . . for making them.”  \nN.C. R. Civ. P.  30(e).  Here, it is undisputed that Whitworth timely and properly \nsubmitted the signed Errata Sheet and that she set forth on the Errata Sheet, by \npage and line number, the specific changes she made to her deposition transcript and \nthe specific reasons for each change.   \n11. Relying on various federal decisions interpreting Rule 30(e) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, which, in relevant part, is nearly identical to Rule 30(e) of \nthe North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiffs argue that extensive and \ncomprehensive changes of the degree Whitworth made here should not be permitted \nunder North Carolina’s Rule 30(e) and that Whitworth’s Errata Sheet should \ntherefore be stricken.  See, e.g., William L. Thorp Revocable Tr. v. Ameritas Inv. Corp., \n57 F. Supp. 3d 508, 517 (E.D.N.C. 2014) (concluding that Federal Rule 30(e) “does not \npermit a party to make changes that substantively contradict or modify sworn \n \n \ndeposition [testimony]”); see also Garcia v. Pueblo Country Club, 299 F.3d 1233, 1242 \nn.5 (10th Cir. 2002) (“[Federal Rule 30(e)] cannot be interpreted to allow one to alter \nwhat was said under oath.  If that were the case, one could merely answer the \nquestions with no thought at all then return home and plan artful \nresponses.  Depositions differ from interrogatories in that regard.  A deposition is not \na take home examination.”).   \n12. Although the Court is sympathetic to Plaintiffs’ complaints, North Carolina \nRule 30(e) is unequivocal.  A  deponent may make changes “in form or substance,” \nprovided the deponent signs, recites, and explains as provided in the Rule.  While \nNorth Carolina courts often look to federal decisions interpreting identical provisions \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance, the Court is not pe rsuaded by \nthe federal cases cited by Plaintiffs here in the face of the unambiguous language \nused in both the North Carolina and Federal Rules.1    \n13. Moreover, the decisions relied upon by Plaintiffs reflect the minority view  \nwithin the federal judiciary , and a majority of  federal courts have permitted broad \nsubstantive changes to a deponent’s testimony  under Federal Rule 30(e) .  See, \ne.g., Raytheon Co. v. Indigo Sys. Corp., No. 4:07 -CV-109, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n12558, at *6–7 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 18, 2009) (“The majority of federal courts place no limit \n                                                           \n1  Because “[t]he North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure are, for the most part, verbatim \nrecitations of the  federal rules[,]” “[d]ecisions under the  federal rules are . . . pertinent \nfor guidance and enlightenment in developing the philosophy of the North Carolina \nrules.”  Turner v. Duke Univ., 325 N.C. 152, 164, 381 S.E.2d 706, 713 (1989) .  Federal \ndecisions, however, are not binding on this Court or any North Carolina court interpreting a \nquestion solely of state law.  See Virmani v. Presbyterian Health Servs. Corp., 350 N.C. 449, \n465, 515 S.E.2d 675, 686 (1999).  \n \n \non the nature of the changes a witness may make to the substance of his testimony” \nand allow “both the original and amended versions of changed deposition testimony \nto remain in the record, leaving the witness to explain the changes to a likely \nskeptical jury.”); Harden v. Wicomico Cty., 263 F.R.D. 304, 307 (D. Md. 2009) (“A \nmajority of courts interpret  [Federal] Rule 30(e)  literally to allow for any timely, \nsubstantive change for which a reason is given.”);  see also, e.g., Podell v. Citicorp \nDiners Club, Inc., 112 F.3d 98, 103 (2d Cir. 1997)  (“[T]he language of [ Federal Rule \n30(e)] places no limitations on the type of changes that may be made, nor does \n[Federal Rule 30(e)] require a judge to examine the sufficiency, reasonableness, or \nlegitimacy of the reasons for the changes—even if those reasons are unconvincing.”); \nReilly v. TXU Corp., 230 F.R.D. 486, 487–90 (N.D. Tex. 2005) (reviewing the various \napproaches for interpreting the allowable scope of  Federal Rule 30(e) changes and \nultimately adopting a broad int erpretation “ consistent with the plain language ” \nof Federal Rule 30(e), allowing any changes, “in form or substance” ); Lugtig v. \nThomas, 89 F.R.D. 639, 641 (N.D. Ill. 1981) (“Allowing a witness to change his \ndeposition before trial eliminates the likelihood of deviations from the original \ndeposition in his testimony at trial; reducing surprises at the trial through the use \nof Rule 30(e) is an efficient procedure.”).  The Court finds the reasoning of these courts \npersuasive in interpreting North Carolina Rule 30(e).  \n14. In addition, this Court has previously rejected similar attempts to challenge \nextensive substantive changes where the deponent, like Whitworth here, adhered to \nNorth Carolina Rule 30(e)’s requirements by “sign[ing] a statement reciting such \n \n \nchanges and the reasons given . . . for making them.”  See Order Mot. Strike Errata \nSheet at 6 , Bueche v. Noel , No. 07 CVS 597 (Henderson County , N.C. Super. Ct. ) \n(Diaz, J.), ECF No. 120; Order Def.’s 10.9 Request at 2, BB&T Boli Plan Tr. v. Mass. \nMut. Life Ins. Co., No. 15 CVS 2638 (Forsyth County , N.C. Super. Ct.) (Bledsoe, J.), \nECF No. 88.  The Court sees no basis for a contrary result on the facts here. \n15. Whitworth has complied with the straightforward requirements of North \nCarolina Rule 30(e), and, as a result, the Court concludes that Whitworth’s Errata \nSheet changes must be permitted.  Accordingly, the Court , in the exercise of its \ndiscretion, denies Plaintiffs’ 10.9 Request and will not  strike any of Whitworth’s \nErrata Sheet entries.   \n16. The Court imposes two safeguards, however, in light of the extensive \nsubstantive changes Whitworth has made to her deposition transcript.  First, \nWhitworth’s original answers to the questions posed at her deposition  will remain \npart of the record and may be used for impeachment , as contemplated under the \napplicable North Carolina R ules of Evidence, or for any other relevant or proper \npurpose.  See, e.g., Order Mot. Strike Errata Sheet at 6 –7, Bueche (citing N. Trade \nU.S., Inc. v. Guinness Bass Imp. Co., No. 3:03CV1892, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54435, \nat *6–7 (D. Conn. Aug. 7, 2006)); see also, e.g., Podell, 112 F.3d at 103 (holding, under \nFederal Rule 30(e),  that the record must include both the original and altered \nresponses); United Subcontractors, Inc. v. Darsey , No. 3:13 -cv-603-J-99TJC-MCR, \n2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152912, at *6 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 24, 2013) (allowing original \n \n \ndeposition answers to remain part of the record and to be read at trial); Lugtig, 89 \nF.R.D. at 641 (to similar effect).  \n17. In addition, the Court will permit Plaintiffs to re -depose Whitworth, for a \nperiod of no more than one hour  of on-the-record time2 and at Defendants’ expense, \nregarding the changes Whitworth has made to her deposition transcript and the \nreasons for those changes and to ask reasonable follow-up questions that flow from \nWhitworth’s answers to these permitted inquiries .  See Order Mot. Strike Errata \nSheet at 7, Bueche (citing Medina v. Horseshoe Entm’t, No. 05-0097, 2006 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 49137, at *10 –11 (W.D. La. July 19, 2006));  see also, e.g., Reilly, 230 F.R.D. \nat 491 (permitting limited re -deposition at deposed party’s expense in light o f the \nnumber and significance of transcript corrections) ;  Foutz v. Town of Vinton, 211 \nF.R.D. 293, 295 (W.D. Va. 2002) (permitting limited re-deposition at deposed party’s \nexpense in light of deponent’s 19-page errata sheet containing substantive corrections \n“to give the defendants the opportunity to impeach [the deponent]  with his \ncontradictory answers”); Lugtig, 89 F.R.D. at 642  (finding reopening deposition at \ndeposed party’s expense appropriate when deponent made significant changes that \nrendered deposition incomplete or useless without further testimony). \n18. The Court further notes that Plaintiffs may seek to challenge Whitworth’s \nsubstantive corrections to the extent Defendants offer those corrections as a basis to \nadvance or defeat summary judgment at a later stage of these proceedings.  See, e.g., \n                                                           \n2  Counsel for the parties agreed at the July 23 Conference that one hour of on-the-record \ntime will be sufficient for the limited re-deposition of Whitworth contemplated by this Order \nand Opinion. \n \n \nThorn v. Sundstrand Aerospace Corp., 207 F.3d 383, 389 (7th Cir. 2000) (permitting \na trial judge to disregard substantive errata sheet changes on summary judgment \nwhere the changes do not reflect errors in transcription).  The Court defers any \ndetermination on whether the Court will consider Whitworth’s Errata Sheet changes \non any motion for summary judgment that may be filed in this action unless and until \nthat issue is raised in the summary judgment phase of this case .  See Order Def.’s \n10.9 Request at 3, BB&T Boli Plan Tr.; see also, e.g., Carter v. W. Am. Ins. Co. , 190 \nN.C. App. 532, 539, 661 S.E.2d 264, 270 (2008) (“A non -moving party cannot create \nan issue of fact to defeat summary judgment simply by filing an affidavit \ncontradicting his prior sworn testimony.”) .  See generally  United States ex rel. \nRobinson v. Ind. Un iv. Health Inc., 204 F. Supp. 3d 1040, 104 1–45 (S.D. Ind. 2016) \n(discussing the “sham affidavit doctrine” and its application to errata sheets).   \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n19. WHEREFORE, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, hereby DENIES \nPlaintiffs’ 10.9 Request to strike portions of Whitworth’s Errata Sheet and ORDERS \nas follows: \na. Whitworth’s E rrata Sheet is hereby permitted to stand, shall not be \nstricken, and shall be appended to Whitworth’s deposition transcript; \nb. Whitworth’s original answers to the questions posed at her  deposition \nwill remain part of the record of this case and may be used for \n \n \nimpeachment, as contemplated by the applicable North Carolina Rules \nof Evidence, or for any other relevant and proper purpose;  \nc. Plaintiffs will be permitted to re-depose Whitworth, at Plaintiffs’ \nelection and at Defendants’ expense, for a total period of no more than \none hour  of on -the-record time , at a date, time, and place mut ually \nconvenient to the parties;   \nd. Any such re-deposition of Whitworth shall occur promptly hereafter but \nin any event no more than sixty (60) days after the entry of this Order \nand Opinion; and  \ne. The questions the parties may ask at any re-deposition of Whitworth are \nstrictly limited to the corrections Whitworth made on the signed Errata \nSheet, the reasons therefor, and any reasonable follow-up questions that \nflow from the answers given.   \nSO ORDERED, this the 2nd day of August, 2018. \n \n     /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III   \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Chief Business Court Judge "
