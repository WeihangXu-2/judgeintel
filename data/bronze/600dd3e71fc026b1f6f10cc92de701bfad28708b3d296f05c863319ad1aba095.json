THIS MATTER  is before the Court on (i) Defendants-Counterclaim \nPlaintiffs Scopia Capital Management LP (“Scopia”) and Community Based Care, \nLLC’s ( “CBC”; together, the “Scopia P arties”) Motion for Leave to Amend \nCounterclaim (the “Motion to Amend”), (ECF No. 230) ; (ii) Plaintiff-Counterclaim \nDefendant Aym Technologies, LLC’s (“Aym”) Motion for Summary Judgment (the \n“Motion for Summary Judgment”), (ECF No. 232); and (iii) the Scopia Parties’ Motion \nfor Sanctions and Award of Attorneys’ Fees (the “Motion for Attorneys’ Fees”), (ECF \nNo. 237), (collectively, the “Motions”). \n2. This case arises from failed negotiations between Aym’s Chief Executive \nOfficer (“CEO”), Lewis Quinn  (“Quinn”), and the Scopia P arties concerning Aym’s \npotential investment in CBC or one of the Scopia Parties’ investment funds .  The \nScopia Parties contend that Quinn, on behalf of Aym, misrepresented Aym’s intention \nto invest while simultaneously seeking to either sell Aym to the Scopia Parties or, in \nAym Techs., LLC v. Scopia Cap. Mgmt. LP, 2021 NCBC 20B. \nthe event that the Scopia Parties did not purchase Aym,  cause Aym to directly \ncompete with them. \n3. Having considered the Motions, the related briefing, and the arguments of \ncounsel at the hearing on the Motions, the Court, in the exercise of its  discretion, \nhereby DENIES the Scopia Parties’ Motion to Amend, GRANTS Aym’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment, and DENIES the Scopia Parties’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. \nBrooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard LLP, by Eric M. David, \nJennifer K. Van Zant, and Cordon M. Smart, for Plaintiff-Counterclaim \nDefendant Aym Technologies, LLC. \n \nPollack Solomon Duffy LLP, by Barry Pollack, and Ogletree, Deakins, \nNash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C., by Benjamin R. Holland and Carl Short, \nfor Defendants-Counterclaim Plaintiffs Scopia Capital Management LP \nand Community Based Care, LLC. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion for summary judgment.  \nSee Hyde Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp. , 26 N.C. App. 138, 142 (1975).  \nRather, the Court summarizes the relevant evidence of record, including both the \nfacts in dispute and those that are uncontested, to provide context for the claims and \nthe Motions.   \n5. Quinn is the CEO of Aym, a software company  that develops programs for \nintellectual and developmental disability (“IDD”) providers in North Carolina.  (Aff. \nLewis Quinn ¶¶ 1, 5 [hereinafter “Quinn Aff.” ], ECF No. 137.)  Aym ’s software \npackage, OnTarget, enables IDD providers to operate their businesses from a single, \nintegrated platform.  (Quinn Aff. ¶ 6.) \n6. At some point prior to the summer of 2015, Quinn devised a plan for Aym to \nacquire certain customers and thereby provide “a foundation for a larger venture” to \n“acquire non-customer providers” and offer “higher quality services to the market[.]”  \n(Quinn Aff. ¶ 22.)  According to Quinn, he memorialized this strategy in a paper called \nthe “Vertical Integration Plan” (the “Plan”), which contained information on “how to \nidentify targets for acquisition,” how to “start with a foundation company and \nthereafter acquire smaller targets,” and how to “finance the acquisitions.”  (Quinn. \nAff. ¶ 25.) \n7. Scopia, a New York -based asset management firm , was at this same time \nalso interested in acquiring  smaller providers within the IDD industry.  (Aff. David \nWittels ¶ 2 [hereinafter “Wittels Aff.”], ECF No. 119.2.)  By 2014, Scopia was involved \nin a venture to “roll up” providers around the count ry and open a North Carolina \noffice.  (Wittels Aff. ¶ 2.) \n8. In February 2015, David Wittels (“Wittels”), a soon-to-be-member of CBC’s \nboard of directors and a former member of Scopia, (Aff. David Wittels ¶ 1 [hereinafter \n“Wittels Aff. II”], ECF No. 266), had a chance encounter with Quinn’s friend, Douglass \nKahn (“Kahn”), at which time they discussed Scopia’s efforts to create what would \nultimately become CBC, (see May 2015 Emails, at SJ 003–005 [hereinafter “May 2015 \nEmails”], ECF No. 236.1).  CBC was later formed in June 2015 to serve as a holding \ncompany for the investments of various Scopia -affiliated funds.  (Scopia Parties’ \nAnswer Compl. & Countercl. ¶ 7 [hereinafter “Countercls.”], ECF No. 69.)   \n9. In May 2015, shortly before CBC’s formation, Wittels proposed to Kahn an \ninvestment opportunity in CBC.  (May 2015 Emails.)  Kahn suggested that Wittels \nspeak with Quinn regarding Aym’s potential investment in CBC.  (May 2015 Emails.)  \nIn July 2015, Kahn forwarded to Quinn communications between Kahn, Wittels, and \nGene Rodgers (“Rodgers”), another investor in the IDD industry,  regarding the \npotential CBC investment opportunity.  (Decl. Carl M. Short III [hereinafter “Short \nDecl.”] Ex. G, ECF No. 195.2.) \n10. At that point, Quinn, acting for Aym, (see, e.g., Short Decl. Ex. N, at 63:25–\n64:3, ECF No. 265), be gan negotiations with Scopia  regarding Aym’s potential \ninvestment in Scopia and CBC.  Quinn “believed an opportunity existed wher e Aym \ncould join the newly-formed CBC and operate the new IDD company with the addition \nof further targets identified by Aym.”  (Quinn Aff. ¶ 58.)   \n11. As these discussions progressed, Quinn sought to sell Aym to CBC.  ( See \nWittels Aff. II ¶ 1 4 (“At some point in or about late July or early August 2015, Mr. \nQuinn asked about the possibility of CBC purchasing Aym[.]”); July 27 Quinn Email, \nat SJ 001, ECF No. 236.1 (asking Rodgers whether “there would be any support for a \nnon-cash acquisition of A ym[,]” “[a]n equity for equity transaction”); July 27 Quinn \nEmail, at SJ 048, ECF No. 236.1 (forwarding to Wittels  Aym’s vertical acquisition \nstrategy to “give [Wittels] a pretty good idea of how [Quinn] s[aw] the business”).)  \nRodgers, however,  expressed doubt that “an equity play would work,” ( July 27 \nRodgers Email , at SJ 001, ECF No. 236.1), and Wittels testified that the Scopia \nParties were upfront in their discussions with Quinn that CBC was not interested in \npurchasing Aym, (Wittels Aff. II ¶ 14.) \n12. Quinn, meanwhile, indicated that Aym was no longer interested in  \nacquiring companies within the IDD industry.  In particular, Wittels testified that he \nspoke with Quinn by telephone on 26 July 2015 and Quinn had stated that while he \n“had considered having Aym acquire IDD service providers[,]” “such an effort at \nexpansion by Aym into IDD services was a thing of the past.”  (Wittels Aff. II ¶ 8.)  \nAccording to Wittels, Quinn made the same representation several days later on 31 \nJuly 2015.  (Wittels Aff. II ¶ 12.) \n13. During July and August 2015, Scopia communicated to  Quinn important \ndetails regarding the investment opportunity in CBC.  In particular, in August 2015, \nScopia advised Quinn that Scopia had recruited Brook Phillips (“Phillips”) to serve as \nan executive officer for CBC.  (See Short Decl. Ex. U, ECF No. 265; Short Decl. Ex. 2, \nat 38:2–5, ECF No. 231.4.)   \n14. The Scopia representatives also negotiated Quinn’s potential role with CBC.  \nRodgers suggested that Quinn could fill an executive role, although Rodgers admitted \nhe had never thought of hiring Quinn as an executive when he knew Aym to be a \ncompetitor in the industry.  (Dep. Wittels 67:23–68:11, at SJ 103–04, ECF No. 236.1; \nJuly 26 Emails, at SJ 047, ECF No. 236.1.)  As  negotiations continued, however, \nQuinn felt a lack of enthusiasm from the Scopia representatives regarding his \ninvolvement as CEO , and he emailed Wittels on 10 August 2015 to say that “the \nrelationship [was] feeling a little too forced” and that he was “going to pass on the \ndeal.”  (Aug. 10 Emails, at SJ 022–24, ECF No. 236.1 (“I am not sure why but I don’t \nsee . . . enthusiasm with my candidacy for the CEO position.  I am only interested in \nthis relationship being 100% positive from the outset.”).) \n15. Nevertheless, at Rodgers’s urging,  the parties met on 11 August 2015 to \ndiscuss Quinn’s potential role at CBC.  (Aug. 10 Emails, at SJ 026–27, ECF No. 236.1 \n(“I know things have moved fast, and I think we need to take a break from emails and \ncalls and spend a few hours together.”) .)  A week later  Wittels sent Quinn a draft \nemployment agreement but offered him the position of CBC’s president rather than \nCEO.  (Aug. 18 Email & Draft Employment Agreement, at SJ 008–21, ECF No. 236.1; \nDep. Lewis Quinn  [hereinafter “Quinn Dep.”]  22:3–5, at SJ 082, ECF No. 236.1 (“I \nremember challenging him on—and saying, you—you told me in that meeting that it \nwould be—that I would be CEO[.]”).) \n16. On 24 August 2015, Quinn emailed Wittels that he had sent the employment \nagreement to his attorney and was expecting to hear from him that day.  (Aug. 24 \nEmail, at SJ 006, ECF No. 236.1.)  The following day, Quinn submitted to a \npsychological evaluation as part of the CBC recruitment process.  (Quinn Dep. 31:22–\n32:25, 35:1–36:21, at SJ 089–92.) \n17. On 31 August 2015, Wittels asked Quinn whether there was any update \nfrom Quinn’s attorney about the employment agreement, but  Quinn did not reply.  \n(Aug. 31 Email, at SJ 006, ECF No. 236.1 .)  Although Quinn later testified that he \n“felt like there could be furth er negotiation,” (Quinn Dep. 37:18–19, at SJ 093,), \nWittels heard nothing further from Quinn until February 2016, (Wittels Aff. II ¶ 19). \n18. Between Wittels’ s August 31 email and Quinn’s next communication in \nFebruary 2016, nVolve Partners, LLC acquired Aym a s part of Quinn’s  roll-up \nventure, (Short Decl. Ex. J., at 5:15–6:23, 170:13–71:25, ECF No. 265), and Phillips \nagreed to go to work for  Aym, (Short Decl. Ex. M, ECF No. 195.2 (“Brook resigned \nyesterday.  Starts with us in 4 weeks.”)).   Neither the Counterclaim allegations nor \nthe record evidence reflects when or why Phillips declined the offered position with \nCBC.  ( Short Decl. Ex. W, at 48:3–13, ECF No. 265  (including Wittels’s testimony \nthat “for whatever reason —and I don’t know, maybe  you can tell me—[Phillips’s \nemployment] didn’t work out, did it?”).) \nII. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n19. Aym filed its Complaint initiating this action on 5 December 2016 against \nRodgers, the Scopia P arties, and Scopia HCM Partners, LLC  (“Scopia HCM”) .  \n(Compl., ECF No. 1.) 1  The Scopia Parties, Scopia HCM, and Rodgers subsequently \nmoved to dismiss the Complaint, (see ECF Nos. 11, 22), which the Court granted in \npart and denied in part  on 9 February 2018 (“Order and Opinion on the Motions to \nDismiss”).  In its ruling, the Court dismissed all claims against Scopia HCM.  (Order \n& Op. Mots. Dismiss, ECF No. 58.) \n \n1 The case was designated as a mandatory complex business case on 17 January 2017, \n(Designation Order, ECF No. 3), and assigned to the undersigned on 25 January 2017, \n(Assignment Order, ECF No. 6).   \n20. Thereafter, on 14 M arch 2018, the Scopia Parties timely answered the \nComplaint and asserted counterclaims against Aym for alleged misrepresentation \nand alleged unfair and deceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75 -1.1.  \n(Countercls. ¶¶ 29, 35.)   After the completion of di scovery, on  27 February 2019, \nRodgers and the Scopia P arties moved for summary judgment on the remaining \nclaims against them.  (Rodgers’s Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 97; Scopia Parties’ Mot. \nSumm. J., ECF No. 119.)  On 16 October 2019, the Court granted both  motions for \nsummary judgment, leaving only the Scopia P arties’ counterclaims against Aym for \ntrial (“Order and Opinion on the Motions for Summary Judgment”) .  ( Order & Op.  \nMots. Summ. J., ECF No. 175.) \n21. On 6 December 2019, the Scopia Parties moved to stay the  Counterclaim \nproceedings in this action (the “Motion to Stay”) pending the resolution of a related \ncase in the Supreme Court of New York for New York County  (the “New York \nAction”).  (Scopia Parties’ Mot. Stay, ECF No. 177.)  The Court denied the Motion to \nStay, reasoning that the Counterclaims and the New York Action involved “very \ndifferent conduct.”  Aym Techs., LLC v. Rodgers, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 33, at *6 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Mar. 19, 2020). \n22. The Scopia Parties thereafter moved to reopen discovery on the \nCounterclaims, contending that emails recently produced in the New York Action \nrevealed that Aym withheld information related to the Counterclaims that it should \nhave produced during discovery in this action. ( Scopia Parties’ Mot. R eopen Disc., \nECF No. 195.)  After full briefing and hearing, the Court granted the Scopia Parties’ \nmotion in part and denied the motion in part on 24 July 2020 (the “July 24 Order”).  \n(Order Scopia Parties’ Mot. Reopen Disc. [hereinafter “July 24 Order”], ECF No. 210.)  \nIn the July 24 O rder, the Court reopened discovery in light of Aym’s discovery \nmisconduct for the limited purpose of permitting the Scopia Parties to conduct time - \nand topic-limited depositions of Kahn and Quinn.  Upon further motion by the Scopia \nParties, t he Court subsequently required Aym, by separate order dated 1 October \n2020 (the “October 1 Order”) , (Order Scopia Parties’ Mot. Enforce Order, ECF No. \n220), to provide written, verified answers to seven interrogatories that the Court \ndeemed “relevant to the Scopia Parties’ counterclaims and . . . appropriate for further \ninquiry as relating to the procedures Aym employed in responding to the Scopia \nParties’ discovery requests[,]”  (Oct. 1 Order ¶ 8 (internal quotation marks omitted).) \n23. On 10 December 2020, the Scopia Parties filed the Motion to Amend and \nMotion for Attorneys’ Fees.  ( ECF Nos. 230, 237.)  On 14 December 2020, Aym filed \nits Motion for Summary Judgment.  (ECF No. 232.)\n2   \n24. After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motions on 9 February \n2021 (the “Hearing”), at which all parties were represented by counsel.  The Motions \nare now ripe for resolution. \n \n2 The Motions were tim ely filed consistent with the Court’s Order dated 19 August 2020, \n(ECF No. 211), as amended by the October 1 Order.  The Court notes that the evidentiary \nrecord before the Court on the Motions includes evidentiary materials that were obtained or \ncreated after the Court reopened discovery and thus were not before the Court on Defendants’ \nmotions for summary judgment.  (See ECF Nos. 97, 119, 175.) \nIII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n25. “Summary judgment is proper ‘if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.’ ”  Morrell v. Hardin Creek, Inc., 371 N.C. 672, 680 (2018) \n(quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  “[A] genuine issue is one which can be maintained by \nsubstantial evidence.”  Kessing v. Nat’l Mortg. Corp. , 278 N.C. 523, 534 (1971).  \n“Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept \nas adequate to support a conclusion and means more than a scintilla or a permissible \ninference.”  Daughtridge  v. Tanager Land, LLC, 373 N.C. 182, 187 (2019) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).   \n26. On a motion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence must be considered ‘in \na light most favorable to the non-moving party.’ ”  McCutchen v. McCutchen, 360 N.C. \n280, 286 (2006) (quo ting Howerton v. Arai Helmet, Ltd. , 358 N.C. 440, 470 (2004)).  \n“[T]he party moving for summary judgment ultimately has the burden of establishing \nthe lack of any triable issue of fact.”  Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Constr. Co., 313 \nN.C. 488, 491 (1985). \n27. The party moving for summary judgment may satisfy its burden by proving \nthat “an essential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be \nproven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense, or by showing through \ndiscovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential \nelement of [the] claim[.]”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83 (2000) (citations omitted).  \n“If the moving party satisfies its burden of proof, then the burden shifts to the non-\nmoving part y to ‘set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.’ ”  Lowe v. Bradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369–70 (1982) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  \nIf the nonmoving party does not satisfy its burden, then “summary judgment, if \nappropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant].”  United Cmty. Bank (Ga.) v. \nWolfe, 369 N.C. 555, 558 (2017) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).   \nIV. \nANALYSIS \n28. Aym seeks summary judgment on the Scopia Parties ’ claims for \nmisrepresentation and unfair and deceptive trade practices under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1, \nNorth Carolina’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act  (“UDTPA”).  (Mem. Law \nSupp. Aym’s Mot. Summ. J. 1 [hereinafter “Aym ’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J.”], ECF \nNo. 245.)  The Scopia Parties seek, through their Motion to Amend, to add allegations \nshowing that Aym engaged in competitive acts be tween August 2015 and January \n2016, thus broadening the relevant time frame of Aym’s purported misconduct as \ncurrently alleged.  ( Scopia Parties’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Leave Amend Countercl. 1  \n[hereinafter “Scopia Parties’ Br. Supp. Mot. Amend”] , ECF No. 231 .)  Finally, t he \nScopia Parties seek to recover attorneys’ fees from Aym based on Aym’s persistence \nin pursuing its now-dismissed claims.  (Scopia Parties’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Sanctions & \nAward Att’ys’ Fees 1 [hereinafter “Scopia Parties’ Br. Supp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees”], ECF \nNo. 238 .)  The Court addresses each M otion in turn,  starting with the Motion to \nAmend, then the Motion for Summary Judgment, and finally  the Motion for \nAttorneys’ Fees. \nA. Motion to Amend \n29. The Scopia Parties seek to amend their Counterclaims to allege new facts \nconcerning Aym’s recruitment of Brook Phillips based on emails they obtained after \nAym’s discovery misconduct prompted the Court  to reopen discovery on the \nCounterclaims.  (July 24 Order.)  The Scopia Parties move to add one new paragraph \nand a handful of new allegations in others to support their contention that Aym ’s \nrecruitment of Phi llips began without their knowledge prior to January 2016 , but \nafter they disclosed their interest in hiring Phillips as a CBC executive during their \nnegotiations with Aym in August 2015 .  (Scopia Parties’ [Proposed] First Am. \nCountercl. ¶ 25 [hereinafter “Proposed Countercls.”], ECF No. 230.1.)   \n30. The focus of these new allegations is a 6 January 2016 email ( Short Decl. \nEx. M), which shows that Phillips agreed  to work for Aym as of January 2016, and \nnew deposition testimony from Quinn, (Short Decl. Ex. 2, at 38:2–5), which, according \nto the Scopia Parties, permits a factfinder to conclude that Quinn began recruiting \nPhillips for Aym after he learned in August 2015 of Scopia’s interest in hiring Phillips \nfor CBC.  (See Scopia Parties’ Br. Supp. Mot. Amend 1 (“These facts go to the heart of \nthe issue of Aym’s intent to deceive Scopia and CBC into believing that Aym’s \nprincipal, Lewis Quinn, wanted to invest in a Scopia fund when he actually sought \nonly to sell Aym to Scopia, or, if that did not work, to gather  information that Aym \ncould use to interfere with Scopia’s launch of CBC for his and Aym’s undisclosed \ncompetitive purposes.”).) \n31. Aym argues in opposition that the “Motion is a backdoor attempt by [the \nScopia Parties] to allege claims arising under the non-disclosure agreement executed \nby Lewis Quinn that are currently pending in parallel proceedings in the New York \n[Action].”  (Aym Mem. Law. Opp’n Mot. Leave Amend Countercl. 1 [hereinafter \n“Aym’s Br. Opp’n Mot. Amend”], ECF No. 253.)  Aym contends that the Motion should \nbe denied on grounds of undue delay, futility, and unfair prejudice.  (Aym’s Br. Opp’n \nMot. Amend 10, 13, 19.) \n32. While Rule 15(a) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (“Rules(s)”) \nprovides that leave to amend “shall be freely given when justice so requires,” N.C. R. \nCiv. P. 15(a), leave may be denied  in the court’s discretion, including on grounds of \n“undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies, un due \nprejudice and futility of the amendment.”  Bartlett Milling Co., L.P. v. Walnut Grove \nAuction & Realty Co., 192 N.C. App. 74, 89 (2008) (citation omitted).   \n33. “The futility standard under Rule 15 is essentially the same standard used \nin reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),  but provides the Court liberal \ndiscretion to find that an amendment lacks futility.”  Simply the Best Movers, LLC v. \nMarrins’ Moving Sys., Ltd. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 28, at *5 –6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 6, \n2016).  “ When an amendm ent would be futile in light of the propriety of summary \njudgment on a plaintiff ’s claim, it is not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to \ndeny the amendment.”  N.C. Council of Churches v. State, 120 N.C. App. 84, 93 (1995).  \nBecause, as explained below, the Court concludes that dismissal of the Counterclaims \nis proper even if the Court considers the amendments the Scopia Parties seek to \nadvance, the Motion to Amend shall be denied as futile. \nB. Motion for Summary Judgment \n34. Aym seeks summary judgment dismissing the Scopia Parties’ counterclaims \nfor fraud and for violation of section 75 -1.1.  Those claims are both premised on the \nScopia Parties’ contention that Aym falsely misrepresented its interest in investing \nin CBC or one of the Sc opia Parties’ funds to gain valuable competitive information \nto facilitate either Aym’s sale to the Scopia Parties or Aym’s competitive activities .  \n(Aym’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 1; see Scopia Parties’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J.  1, \nECF No. 264.) \n1. Proper Party \n35. As an initial matter, Aym contends that  dismissal is appropriate because, \nas pleaded, liability under the Counterclaims falls to Quinn individually, not to Aym.  \n(Aym’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 19.)  The Court disagrees.   \n36. First, the Scopia Parties have alleged, and Aym has consistently taken the \nposition in this litigation, that Quinn acted during the relevant time period on behalf \nof Aym.  (See, e.g., Countercls. ¶ 12.)  Quinn has acknowledged the same under oath.  \n(See, e.g., Short Decl. Ex. N 63:25–64:3 (testifying that he (Quinn) was “the person at \nAym who was communicating on behalf of Aym with Mr. Wittels and the others”); \nAff. Lewis Quinn ¶¶ 20 –21 [hereinafter “Quinn Aff. II”], ECF No. 36 (stating that \ndiscussions were conducted with Aym).)  Aym cannot now disavow its prior position \nwhen it becomes advantageous to do so on summary judgment.  See Gould v. Kemper \nNat’l Ins. Cos., No. 95-1883, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4844, at *2 (7th Cir. 1996) (noting \nthat “a plaintiff is not allowed to change position on critical factual elements of her \ncase once their legal significance becomes clear”); Shire Laby’s., Inc. v. Corepharma, \nLLC, Civ. Action No. 06 -2266 (SRC), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88617, at *24 (D.N.J. \nNov. 3, 2008) (noting that to allow a party “to change position [on factual matters at \nsummary judgment ] would reward manipulation and allow [the party]  to gain an \nunfair advantage”). \n37. The Scopia Parties have also expressly pleaded that the investment \nopportunity they pursued with Quinn contemplated the investment of Aym’s capital, \nnot Quinn’s.  ( See Countercls. ¶ 32 .)  And the evidence of record before th e Court, \nviewed in the light most favorable to the Scopia Parties, supports this conclusion.  In \nparticular, Quinn repeatedly conducted business from his Aym email address, ( see, \ne.g., July 27 Quinn Email, at SJ 001; Aug. 10 Emails, at SJ 022–24; Aug. 24 Email, \nat SJ 006), and has acknowledged that the relevant discussions were between the \nScopia Parties and Aym, not Quinn.  (Quinn Aff. II ¶¶ 20–21). \n38. Accordingly, for each of these reasons, the Court concludes that Aym  is not \nentitled to summary judgment on this ground. \n2. Misrepresentation \n39. The Scopia Parties allege a single misrepresentation claim, which is based \non Aym’s alleged  fraud.  ( Countercls. ¶¶ 29– 34; Proposed Countercls.  ¶¶ 30 –35.)  \nAlthough they do not distinguish in their Counterclaims or proposed amendments  \nwhether the claim is based on fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, \nor both, the parties have chosen to address both types of claims in their briefing, (see \nAym’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 13, 17; Scopia Parties’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J.  9, \n18), and the Court will consider the claim accordingly. \na. Affirmative Misrepresentation \n40. Aym contends that to the extent the Scopia Parties’ misrepresentation claim \nis based on affirmative misrepresentations (i.e., “actual fraud”), the claim should be \ndismissed for the Scopia Parties’ failure to plead with particularity under Rule 9(b) \nand to offer evidence that Aym made any representations with the intent to deceive \nor that the Scopia Parties reasonably relied upon any such representations.  \n41. As an initial matter, the Scopia Parties do not appear to contest Aym’s \ncontention that their Counterclaims, as originally pleaded, cannot survive scrutiny \nunder either Rule 9(b) or Rule 56.  ( See Scopia Parties’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J.  10 \n(framing Aym’s intent in terms of the proposed allegations that “they were interested \nonly in selling Aym or gathering information that could be used to hurt Scopia and \nCBC while launching Aym’s competitive venture”); see also generally Scopia Parties’ \nBr. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. (failing to address Aym’s Rule 9(b) argument).) \n42. The Scopia Parties appear instead to focus their arguments on defeating \nAym’s Rule 56 motion and on Quinn’s alleged statement to Wittels on 25 July 2015 \nand again on 31 July 2015 that Aym’s “effort at expansion” was a “thing of the past.” \n(Wittels Aff. II ¶ ¶ 8, 12.)\n3  They argue that Quinn’s statements to Wittels are  the \n \n3 Aym contends that the Court should ignore Wittels’s affidavit because it contradicts his \nprior deposition testimony.  ( Aym’s Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. J.  5, ECF No. 269); see, e.g., \ncritical misrepresentations upon which they reasonably relied to their detriment and \nwhich serve as the basis for their affirmative misrepresentation claim.  They contend \nthat, absent those representations, they  never would have incurred the significant \ntime and expense they did by, among other things, drafting Quinn’s employment \nagreement and arranging for his psychological evaluation.  (Scopia Parties’ Br. Opp’n \nMot. Summ. J. 15–18; Wittels Aff. II ¶¶ 8, 12.)   \n43. But t he Scopia Parties do not incorporate  Wittels’s recently proffered  \ntestimony into their proposed amended Counterclaims.  And w hile that testimony \nmay be evidentiary support for th ose proposed Counterclaims, Rule 9(b) is only \nconcerned with whether their allegations of fraud are pleaded with particularity.  \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (“In all averments of fraud, .  . . the circumstances constituting \nfraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.”).  To that end, our Supreme Court \nhas long held that to satisfy Rule 9(b)’s requirements, a plaintiff must “ alleg[e the] \ntime, pla ce and content of the fraudulent representation, identity of the person \nmaking the representation and what was obtained as a result of the fraudulent acts \nor representations.”  Terry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 85 (1981).  This the Scopia Parties \nhave failed to do. \n44. Instead, the Scopia Parties have alleged that Quinn asked Rodgers “to \ninform Scopia that Quinn was interested in making a substantial investment in the \n \nPinczkowski v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 153 N.C. App. 435, 440 (2002) (“[A] party opposing a motion \nfor summary judgment cannot create a genuine issue of material fact by filing an affidavit \ncontradicting his prior sworn testimony.”).  The Court concludes that it need not decide this \nissue because Aym is entitled to summary judgment even considering the averments in the \naffidavit.  \nfund that would own CBC[,]” (Countercls. ¶ 10; Proposed Countercls. ¶ 10), and that \nQuinn sent an email to “confirm[ ] his representation that he (Quinn) was interested \nin making a substantial investment in the opportunity[,]” (Countercls. ¶ 11; Proposed \nCountercls. ¶ 11).  The Scopia Parties further allege in conclusory fashion that Quinn \n“pretend[ed] to be a potential investor[,]” ( Countercls. ¶ 18; Proposed Countercls. \n¶ 18), and “ made several representations . . . confirming Quinn’s purported interest \nin a substantial investment in CBC[,]” without specifying what those specific \nrepresentations were, (Countercls. ¶ 30; Proposed Countercls. ¶ 31).   \n45. Most significantly, however, none of these allegations sets forth  the \nmisrepresentation on which the Scopia Parties now purport to base their affirmative \nmisrepresentation claim : Wittels’s affidavit testimon y that Quinn speci fically \nmisrepresented Aym’s competitive efforts to be a “thing of the past .”  Given this \nfailure of pleading, t he Court necessarily concludes that the Scopia Parties have \nfailed to allege the content of the misrepresentation on which the y base their claim \nas required under Rule 9(b).  See Terry , 302 N.C. at 85.   Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that summary judgment is proper dismissing the Scopia Parties’ \naffirmative misrepresentation claim  for failure to plead either the original or \nproposed amended Counterclaims with requisite particularity under Rule 9(b).    \nb. Fraudulent Concealment \n46. To satisfy Rule 9(b) ’s particularity requirement  for their fraudulent \nconcealment claim, the Scopia Parties must specifically allege: \n(1) the relationship [between plaintiff and defendant] giving rise to the \nduty to speak; (2) the event or events triggering the duty to speak and/or \nthe general time period over which the relationship arose and the \nfraudulent conduct occurred; (3) the gene ral content of the information \nthat was withheld and the reason for its materiality; (4) the identity of \nthose under a duty who failed to make such disclosures; (5) what [the \ndefendant] gained by withholding information; (6) why plaintiff ’s \nreliance on the omission was both reasonable and detrimental; and (7) \nthe damages proximately flowing from such reliance. \n \nLawrence v. UMLIC-Five Corp., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. June \n18, 2007) ( adopting Breeden v. Richmond C mty. College, 171 F.R.D. 189, 195 –96 \n(M.D.N.C. 1997)). \n47. Generally, commercial parties engaging in an arms-length transaction with \none another do not have a duty to disclose.  S ee, e.g., B & F Slosman v. Sonopress, \nInc., 148 N.C. App. 81, 8 7 (2001) ( concluding that there was no duty to disclose \nbetween “sophisticated businessmen”); Comput. Decisions, Inc. v. Rouse Office Mgmt. \nof N.C., Inc., 124 N.C. App. 383,  389 (1996) (concluding that there was no duty to \ndisclose simultaneous negotiations with a third party where sophisticated parties \nwere negotiating at arm’s length); C.F.R. Foods, Inc. v. Randolph Dev. Co., 107 N.C. \nApp. 584, 589 (1992) (concluding there was no duty to disclose where defendant had \na full opportunity to make inquiries but failed to do so); RREF BB Acquisitions, LLC \nv. MAS Props., L.L.C., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *28 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 9, 2015)  \n(“Typically, commercial parties in arms-length negotiations with one another do not \nhave a duty to disclose.”). \n48. A duty to disclose will arise, however, when: (1) “a fiduciary relationship \nexists between the parties to the transaction” or (2) there is no fiduciary relationship \nbut either “a party has taken affirmative steps to conceal material fac ts from the \nother” or “ one party has knowledge of a latent defect in the subject matter of the \nnegotiations about which the other party is both ignorant and unable to discover \nthrough reasonable diligence.”  Sidden v. Mailman , 137 N.C. App. 669, 675 (2000) \n(citation omitted). \n49. As with their affirmative misrepresentation claim, the Scopia Parties do not \nappear to challenge Aym’s attack on the allegations and evidence in connection with \nthe original or proposed Counterclaims relating to the fraudulent concealment claim.  \n(See Scopia Parties’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 18–19 (stating only that “[t]he evidence \nsupports a finding that Aym misrepresented that it had ceased competitive activities, \nand that it therefore had an ongoing duty to disclose its competitive efforts to Scopia \nand CBC in the context of their negotiations[.]”).)  Instead, the Scopia Parties contend \nthat Quinn’s alleged misrepresentations of Aym’s future competitive intent, alleged \nfor the first time in the proposed Counterclaims , give rise to Aym’s duty to disclose.  \n(Scopia Parties’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J. 19.)   The Court concludes , however, that \nthey do not.   \n50. Significantly, “[t]o show a duty to disclose based on affirmative steps to \nconceal a material fact, a plaintiff must allege the specific affirmative acts taken to \nconceal that fact.”  Vitaform, Inc. v. Aeroflow, Inc. , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 132, at *31 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 4, 2020); see Zagaroli v. Neill , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 106, at *23 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 29, 201 6) (finding no duty to disclose where defendants failed  \nto allege “any specific affirmative acts” to conceal forged checks).  W hile the Scopia \nParties do allege that Quinn hid  his desire to sell Aym and Aym’s competitive \nventures, (see, e.g. , Countercls . ¶ 18; Proposed Countercls. ¶ 18 ), they fail to  \nspecifically allege what steps Quinn took to hide this information .  Indeed , their \nallegations to this effect are largely conclusory and generally state that Quinn \n“pretend[ed] to be a potential investor to interfere with the launch of CBC and serve \nhis and Aym’s own undisclosed competitive interests[.]”  (Proposed Countercls. ¶ 12; \nsee also Proposed Countercls. ¶¶ 18–19, 31–32 (to similar effect).)   \n51. The only factual allegations they now assert in support of these conclusions \nare that Quinn started “a competing  venture in the North Carolina IDD market [,]” \n(Proposed Countercls. ¶ 19), which he did not disclose to the Scopia Parties, (Proposed \nsee Countercls. ¶¶ 18, 31), that he “undertook efforts to dissuade Phillips from joining \nCBC in favor of the competitive venture that Quinn hid from Scopia and CBC [,]” \n(Proposed Countercls. ¶ 25), and that “[b]y in or about December 2015, \nPhillips . . . had made plans to join Quinn’s and Aym’s new competitive ven ture[,]” \n(Proposed Countercls. ¶ 29).   \n52. But there are no allegations suggesting that either Quinn or Aym ever \nagreed with the Scopia Parties that they would not form a competitive venture in \nNorth Carolina, and the Scopia Parties have not identified any le gal duty that \nprevented Quinn or Aym from pursuing this course.  Moreover, given that nothing \nprecluded Quinn or Aym from creating a competing business, the pleaded facts do not \ngive rise to a duty requiring Aym to disclose its competitive plans in its arms’ length \nnegotiations with the Scopia Parties.  See, e.g., Comput. Decisions, Inc., 124 N.C. App. \nat 389 (lessor had no duty to disclose to lessee that it was negotiating a competing \nlease with another party);  B & F Slosman, 148 N.C. App. at 86 (no duty to disclose \nwhere claimants “were sophisticated businessmen, who were experienced with  [the \nrelevant] transactions”). \n53. And although the Scopia Parties plead that Quinn dissuaded Phillips from \njoining CBC and that Phillips made plans to join Qui nn and Aym ’s new business, \nthey conspicuously fail to allege that Aym sought Phillips out for employment (rather \nthan the other way around), that either Phillips or Aym was contractually restricted \nfrom working with the other, that Aym secured Phillips’s e mployment while either \nhe or Quinn were negotiating employment with the Scopia Parties, or that Aym took \nsteps to actively hide this information from the Scopia Parties when negotiations \nbroke down in August.  Although the Scopia Parties offer evidence through Wittels’s \nlatest affidavit that Aym specifically lied about its competitive intent, as noted above, \nthat evidence is not specifically pleaded in either the original or proposed amended \nCounterclaims and thus may not be considered for purposes of Rule 9(b) analysis.  See \nRule 9(b) (establishing the pleading standard rather than evidentiary standard for \nfraud claims); In re Estate of Loftin , 21 N.C. App. 627, 630 (1974)  (stating that “[i]n \norder to comply with Rule 9(b), the pleadings must state the facts to be relied upon \nto establish fraud”). \n54. For each of these reasons, therefore, the Court concludes that the \nCounterclaims, as originally pleaded and as proposed, fail Rule 9(b)’s particularity \nrequirement and must be dismissed.  \n3. UDTPA \n \n55. The Scopia Parties assert a UDTP A claim against Aym based on the same \nconduct supporting its misrepresentation claim .  B ecause the misrepresentation \nclaim fails, as explained above, the UDTPA claim based on this same conduct likewise \nmust fail.  See, e.g. , Combs & Assocs., Inc. v. Kennedy , 147 N.C. App. 362, 373– 74 \n(2001) (affirming summary judgme nt dismissing unfair or deceptive trade practices \nclaim when the underlying claims had been dismissed and plaintiff had alleged no \nother unfair or deceptive acts) ; Silverdeer, LLC v. Berton, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 21, at \n*28–29 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 24, 2013) (holding that UDTPA claim derivative of fraud \nand other claims “rises and falls” with those claims). \n56. The Court further concludes that the UD TPA claim fails for the separate \nand independent reason that Aym’s alleged misconduct was not “in or affecting \ncommerce” under the UDTPA.  Section 75-1.1 declares unlawful “[u]nfair methods of \ncompetition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or \naffecting commerce [.]”  N.C.G.S. § 75 -1.1(a).  “  ‘[C]ommerce’ inclu des all business \nactivities, however denominated, but does not include professional services rendered \nby a member of a learned profession.”  Id. § 75-1.1(b).   \n57. The UDTP A, however,  does not reach  all wrongs in a business setting, \nincluding misconduct in the context of a securities transaction.  See Skinner v. E. F. \nHutton & Co. , 314 N.C. 267, 274 (1985) (holding that securities transactions are \nbeyond the UDTPA’s scope).  Under the securities exception, the Court’s inquiry must \nfocus on “whether the transact ions at issue involved securities or other financial \ninstruments involved in raising capital.”  White v. Consol. Planning, Inc. , 166 N.C. \nApp. 283, 304 (2004); see Latigo Invs. II, LLC v. Waddell & Reed Fin., Inc. , 2007 \nNCBC LEXIS 17, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 11, 2007) (stating that this is “the only \nrelevant question for [the Court]” and that the “proper focus under the relevant cases \nis . . . ‘what is the purpose of the transaction’ ” (emphasis added)).  If the transactions \nat issue involve capital raising, our courts have held that the securities exception to \nsection 75-1.1 will apply.  White, 166 N.C. App. at 304. \n58. Here, the Scopia Parties have repeatedly pleaded that the ir negotiations \nwith Quinn and Aym were for the purpose of raising investment capital.  (See \nCountercls. ¶¶ 8, 10–11; Proposed Countercls. ¶¶ 8, 10–11.)  Indeed, the gravamen of \nthe Counterclaims is that Quinn and Aym misrepresented and failed to disclose \nmaterial information in that capital -raising process.  (See e.g., Countercls. ¶¶ 1, 10, \n12; Proposed Countercls . ¶¶ 1, 10, 12.)  As such, the Court concludes that the \nsecurities exception applies.  See HAJMM Co. v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc. , 328 \nN.C. 578, 59 5 (1991) (holding that “[r]evolving fund certificates a re a cooperative ’s \nfunctional equivalent of traditional corporate securities [,]” are not “in or affecting \ncommerce[,]” and are therefore outside the scope of the UDTPA as “ capital-raising \ndevices”); White, 166 N.C. App. at 304 (holding that “[w]ithout some evidence that the \n[transaction at issue] constituted securities or other capital -raising instruments[,]” \nthe transactions fell within the scope of the UDTPA). \n59. The Scopia Parties attempt to avoid this result by contending that because \ntheir day-to-day business involves capital raising activities, the securities exception \ndoes not apply.  ( Scopia Parties’ Br. Opp’n Mot. Summ. J.  21 n.4.)  While this \nargument appears to fall within the statute’s embrace as articulated in HAJMM Co., \nwhich held that “ ‘[b]usiness activities’ is a term which connotes the manner in which \nbusinesses conduct their regular, day -to-day activities, ” 328 N.C. at 594, the \nargument fails to consider that the Supreme Court in H AJMM was likewise \nmotivated to apply the securities exception because the transactions at issue —the \npurchase and sale of securities —were subject to pervasive state and federal \nregulation, HAJMM Co., 328 N.C. at 594 (“[T]o extend the [UDTPA] to securities \ntransactions would create overlapping supervision, enforcement, and liability in this \narea, which is already  pervasively regulated by state and federal statutes and \nagencies.”).  That is precisely the case here, where the Scopia Parties’ inv estment \nsolicitation of Quinn and Aym and any purchase and sale of investment securities \nthat might have followed are likewise subject to extensive state and federal securities \nregulation.   \n60. Because our courts have repeatedly held that the only question for the Court \nunder this exception is whether the basis for the transaction involved securities , see \nid.; White, 166 N.C. App. at 304; Latigo Invs. II, LLC, 2007 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *11, \nthe Court concludes that the considerations motivating the recognition of a securities \nexception to section 75-1.1 are fully present here and that the exception should apply \nas a result.   \n61. Aym’s Motion shall therefore be granted , and the Court shall dismiss the \nScopia Parties’ UDTPA claim. \nC. Motion for Attorneys’ Fees \n62. The Scopia Parties contend  that they should be awarded attorneys ’ fees of \n$367,920.02 for the fees they incurred between the Court’s 9 February 2018 Order \nand Opinion on the Motions to Dismiss and its 16 October 2019 Order and Opinion \non the Motions for Summary Judgment.  (Scopia Parties’ Br. Supp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees \n17.)  They seek attorneys’ fees under N.C.G.S. §§ 6 -21.5, 1D-45, and 75-16.1 on the \ngrounds that Aym failed to withdraw its remaining claims after the Court’s Order \nand Opinion on the Motions to Dismiss revealed their lack of merit and because Aym’s \ndiscovery misconduct further justifies an award of attorneys’ fees.  ( Scopia Parties’ \nBr. Supp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees 1–2.)   \n1. N.C.G.S. § 6-21.5 \n63. In determining whether to impose attorneys’ fees under N.C.G.S. § 6-21.5, a \ncourt is required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.  See Sunamerica \nFin. Corp. v. Bonham , 328 N.C. 254, 257 (1991) (quoting N.C.G.S. § 6- 21.5).  The \nCourt therefore sets forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of law to \nsupport its resolution of the Scopia Parties’ request for attorneys’ fees and sanctions.4 \na. Findings of Fact \n64. Aym commenced this action by filing its Complaint and asserting claims \nagainst the Scopia Parties and Rodgers for misappropriation of trade secrets, \nconversion, violation of the UDTPA, and tortious interference, and against Rodgers \n \n4 Any Finding of Fact that is more appropriately deemed a Conclusion of Law, and any \nConclusion of Law that is more appropriately deemed a Finding of Fact, shall be so deemed \nand incorporated by reference as a finding of fact or conclusion of law, as appropriate. \nalone for breach of contract.  (Compl. ¶¶ 26, 30, 38, 41, 47, 53 .)  Aym alleged that it \nhad provided Rodgers with its Plan and other confidential information, that Rodgers \nhad passed that information on to the Scopia Parties, and that the Scopia Parties had \nthen used that information to purchase targets from Aym’s acquisition list.  (See, e.g., \nCompl. ¶ 31.)   \n65.  The Scopia Parties moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6), arguing in relevant part that Aym had failed to allege facts identifying a \ntrade secret, or alt ernatively, facts showing that Aym had reasonably protected its \ntrade secret.  (Scopia Parties’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Pursuant Rule 12(b)(6) \n(REFILED) 5, ECF No. 13 .)  The Court subsequently dismissed  several claims but \nallowed Aym’s claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and violation of the \nUDTPA to proceed against the Scopia Parties, but only “to the extent [Aym] allege[d] \nmisappropriation of the Plan.”  (Order & Op. Mots. Dismiss 35.) \n66. The Scopia Parties subsequently filed their Motion for Summary Judgment \nseeking dismissal of Aym’s claims, contending that Aym had failed to produce \nevidence that the Plan contained a list of acquisition targets and that Aym had \nprovided the Plan to others without requesting confidentialit y.  (Mem. Supp. Scopia \nParties’ Summ. J. Mot. 20, 22, ECF No. 120.)  In its Order and Opinion on the Motions \nfor Summary Judgment, the Court held that “it cannot be disputed that the Plan does \nnot comport with Aym’s characterization of that document in its  Complaint” and \ndismissed Aym’s remaining claims.  (Order & Op. Mots. Summ. J. 14–15.) \n67. On 2 March 2020, the Scopia Parties moved to reopen discovery  on the \ngrounds that Aym had failed to produce emails between Quinn and Kahn relevant to \nthe Counterclaims.  ( Scopia Parties’ Mot.  Reopen Disc .)  The  Court granted the \nmotion and, among other things, permitted a further deposition of Quinn concerning \nAym’s discovery-related conduct.  (July 24 Order.) \n68. On 14 September 2020, the Scopia Parties moved to enforce the Court’s July \n24 Order, contending that Aym had evaded questions and indicated a lack of \nknowledge during the deposition and seeking to compel Aym’s response to several \ninterrogatories.  ( Scopia Parties’ Mot.  Enforce Order, ECF No. 216.)  On  1 October \n2020, the Court granted the motion and allowed the Scopia Parties to serve the \nrequested interrogatories on Aym.  (Order Scopia Parties’ Mot. Enforce Order.) \nb. Conclusions of Law \n69. Under N.C.G.S. § 6 -21.5, “[a] trial court may award attorneys ’ fees to a \nprevailing party where there is ‘a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law \nor fact[.]’”  Willard v. Barger, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 22, \n2021) (quoting N.C.G.S. § 6-21.5).  “A justiciable issue has been define d as an issue \nthat is real and present as opposed to imagined or fanciful. ”  Sunamerica, 328 N.C. \nat 257 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  There is a complete absence \nof a justiciable issue when it “conclusively appear[s] that such issues are absent even \ngiving the pleadings the indulgent treatment they receive on motions for summary \njudgment or to dismiss.”  Id. (citation omitted). \n70. “[T]he party against whom attorneys ’ fees are being considered has ‘ a \ncontinuing duty to review the appropriateness of persisting in litigating a claim which \n[is] alleged [to lack a justiciable issue].’ ”  Bryson v. Sullivan, 330 N.C. 644, 660 (1992) \n(quoting Sunamerica, 328 N.C. at 258).   Thus, “ sanctions under N.C.G.S. § 6 -21.5 \nmay be appropriate . . . if the [claimant] persists ‘in litigating the case after a point \nwhere he should reasonably have become aware that the pleading he filed no longer \ncontained a justiciable issue. ’ ”  Brooks v. Giesey, 334 N.C. 303, 310 (1993) (quoting \nSunamerica, 328 N.C. at 258).   \n71. “N.C.G.S. § 6-21.5 requires review of all relevant pleadings and documents \nin determining whether attorneys’ fees should be awarded[,]” Bryson, 330 N.C. at 660, \nand “[t]he decision to award or deny attorney’s fees under Section 6-21.5 is a matter \nleft to the sound discretion of the trial court [,]” W&W Partners, Inc. v. Ferrell Land \nCo., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 104, at *11  (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 6, 2019) (quoting Persis \nNova Constr., Inc. v. Edwards, 195 N.C. App. 55, 67 (2009)). \n72. Granting a Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 56 motion , however, standing alone, does \nnot establish a complete absence of a justiciable issue under section 6-21.5.  See, e.g., \nSunamerica, 328 N.C. at 259; Jacobson v. Walsh, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 2, at *41 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Jan. 22, 2014) (“A grant of summary judgment, standing alone, is not \nsufficient to support an award of attorney’s fees under N.C.G.S. § 6-21.5.”) \n73. The Scopia Parties contend that Aym “kn [e]w or should have known” that \nits claims surviving the Court’s Order and  Opinion on the Motion s to Dismiss were \nbased on a nonexistent list within the Plan.  (Scopia Parties’ Br. Supp. Mot. Att ’ys’ \nFees 5.)  They further argue that “Aym should have sought dismissal of the Complaint \nafter the Court limited Aym’s claims to those based on a document supposedly \ncontaining a list of identifiable acquisition targets when Aym knew such a document \ndid not exist.”  (Scopia Parties’ Br. Supp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees 12.)   \n74. In response, Aym points to several pieces of evidence suggesting a basis for \ntheir arguments that a Plan and list of targets  existed, including , in particular,  \nQuinn’s recent deposition testimony stating that Quinn gave Rodgers a color -coded \nlist of acquisition targets during an August 5, 2013 meeting.  (Aym’s Mem. Law Opp’n \nScopia Parties’ Mot. Sanctions & Award Att’ys’ Fees 12 [hereinafter “Aym’s Br. Opp’n \nMot. Att’ys’ Fees”], ECF No. 252; see Quinn Dep. 123:1–26:13, ECF No. 102).   \n75. Although the color-coded list was not made a part of the summary judgment \nrecord and,  until now, Aym, which is represented by new counsel, has never \ncontended that the color-coded list constituted or was a part of the Plan , (Scopia \nParties’ Reply Supp.  Mot. Att’ ys’ Fees  2–3, ECF No. 270), the Court nonetheless \nconcludes that the list may potentially constitute some evidence that there was not a \ncomplete lack of a justiciable issue for Aym’s remaining claims, particularly given the \nhigh bar our appellate courts have articulated for awarding fees under section 6-21.5, \nsee Sunamerica, 328 N.C. at 257 (strictly construing N.C.G.S. § 6 -21.5).  It is also \nunclear to the Court that Aym could have pleaded a successful claim on the evidence \nof record, although it is quite clear that Aym failed to do so. \n76. The Court also rejects Aym’s discovery misconduct as an alternative basis \nfor an award of fees under section 6 -21.5.  Whether Aym abused the discovery rules \nhas no bearing on whether a justiciable controversy existed when Aym pursued its \nclaims after the Court’s Order and Opinion on the Motions to Dismiss.  See Willard, \n2021 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *9 (“The relevant inquiry u nder section 6-21.5 is whether a \njusticiable issue is present.  If there is, the moving party’s motion must fail.” (citing \nBrooks, 334 N.C. at 310)).   \n77. For each of these reasons, therefore, the Court concludes that the Scopia  \nParties’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees under N.C.G.S. § 6-21.5 should be denied. \n2. Sections 1D-45 and 75-16.1 \n78. As an initial matter, because the Court has dismissed the Scopia Parties’ \nCounterclaim for violation of section 75 -1.1, their related claim for attorn eys’ fees \nunder section 75-16.1 necessarily fails and must be dismissed. \n79. For its part, s ection 1D-45 requires an award of attorneys’ fees resulting \nfrom the defense of a claim for punitive damages “against a claimant who files a claim \nfor punitive damages that the claimant knows or should have known to be frivolous \nor malicious.”  N.C.G.S. § 1D-45.  Under that section, “a claim for punitive damages \nis ‘frivolous’ where its proponent can present no rational argument based upon the \nevidence or law in support of it. ”  Philips v. Pitt Cnty. Mem ’l. Hosp., Inc. , 242 N.C. \nApp. 456, 458 (2015) (citation omitted).  “Furthermore, a claim is ‘malicious’ where it \nis ‘wrongful and done intentionally without just cause or excuse or as a result of ill \nwill.’ ”  Id.5 \n \n5 The same standard applies under N.C.G.S. § 75 -16.1 for frivolous or malicious UDTPA \nactions.  AmeriGas Propane, L.P. v. Coffey, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. \n17, 2016) (citing Philips, 242 N.C. App. at 458; see N.C.G.S. § 75-16.1 (providing for attorneys’ \nfees where “[t]he party instituting the action knew, or should have known, the [UDTP A] \n80. The Scopia Parties contend that Aym knew or should have known that its \nclaims were both frivolous and malicious because Aym “did not cite to any genuine \nand defensible legal basis for an award of punitive damages in its Complaint” and \n“persisted in its allegations long after it was clear that there was no basis for its \nclaim[.]”  (Scopia Parties’ Br. Supp. Mot. Att ’ys’ Fees 16– 17.)  The Scopia Parties, \nhowever, do not point to evidence establishing that Aym “knew or should have known” \nthat it could present no rational argument in support of its claim for punitive \ndamages, or that Aym’s claim was made wrongfully.  See Philips, 242 N.C. App. at \n458.  Based on the evidence of record, the Court cannot conclude that Aym knew or \nshould have known that its claim for punitive damages was either frivolous or \nmalicious at any point in this litigation.  See AmeriGas, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 17, at *9 \n(denying motions for attorneys’ fees wh en the facts of record did not establish that \nthe plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages was frivolous or malicious).  The Court \ntherefore shall exercise its discretion to deny the Scopia Parties’ Motion for Attorneys’ \nFees under Sections 1D-45.\n6 \n \naction was frivolous and malicious”); see also Morris v. Bailey, 86 N.C. App. 378, 387 (1987) \n(“Award or denial of attorney fees under N.C.G.S. [§] 75- 16.1 is a matter within the sole \ndiscretion of the trial judge.”). \n  \n6 Because the analysis and determination is the same under sections 1D-45 and 75-16.1, the \nCourt further concludes that, even if the  Court were to assume that the Scopia Defendants \ncould prevail on their UDTPA claim, their claim for attorneys’ fees under section 75 -16.1 \nwould necessarily fail for this additional reason.  \n   \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n81. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby ORDERS as follows: \na. In the exercise of the Court’s discretion, t he Motion to Amend is \nDENIED;  \nb. The Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, and the Scopia \nParties’ claims are dismissed with prejudice7; and \nc. In the exercise of the Court’s discretion, t he Motion for Attorneys’ Fees \nis DENIED. \n SO ORDERED, this the 31st day of March, 2021. \n \n/s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III   \nLouis A. Bledsoe, III \nChief Business Court Judge \n \n7 “The decision to dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the discretion of the trial \ncourt[.]”  First Fed. Bank v. Aldridge , 230 N.C. App. 187, 191 (2013).   The Court concludes \nhere, in the exercise of its discretion, that dismissal of the Scopia Parties’ Counterclaims shall \nbe with prejudice in light of the advanced stage of this litigation, the Scopia Parties’ failure \nto vigorously prosecute their Counterclaims prior to the expiration of the original discovery \nperiod (even indicating an intent to dismiss upon the Court’s dismissal of Aym’s claims), and \nthe Court’s determination that the Scopia Parties have been afforded a full and fair \nopportunity to move to amend their Counterclaims to assert claims with supporting \nallegations consistent with the requirements of Rule 9(b). \n "
