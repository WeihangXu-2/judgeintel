McGeough, 2007 NCBC 33 \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA         IN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \n                                                                                   SUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \nCOUNTY OF MECKLENBURG                     05 CVS 18918 \n \nBATTLEGROUND VETERINARY \nHOSPITAL, P.C. and VETCOR \nPROFESSIONAL PRACTICES, LLC, \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n \n v. \n \nMARK MCGEOUGH and SARAH \nMCGEOUGH, \n \n  Defendants. \nORDER  \n \nJackson Lewis, LLP by Paul H. Derrick and Kimberly A. Doyle for Plaintiffs \nBattleground Veterinary Hospital, P.C and VetCor Professional Practices, \nLLC.  \n \nLaw Office of Jacqueline M. Druar, PLLC by Jacqueline M. Druar and Law \nOffices of Robert M. Axelrod by Robert M. Axelrod for Defendants Mark \nMcGeough and Sarah McGeough.  \n \nDiaz, Judge. \n \nI. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n{1} Plaintiffs in this case contend Defendants (both of whom are \nveterinarians) breached certain covenants not to compete after they resigned as \nemployees of Plaintiff Battleground Veterinary Hospital, P.C. (“Battleground”). \n{2} Plaintiffs allege claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of fiduciary \nduty of loyalty, (3) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, (4) unfair \nand deceptive trade practices, (5) misappropriation of trade secrets, (6) tortious \ninterference with contract, and (7) civil conspiracy.  (Compl. ¶¶ 37–77.) \n{3} Before the Court are the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. \n  \n \n \nII. \nCONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES \n{4} According to Plaintiffs, Defendants are former employees who, despite \nexecuting covenants not to compete, operate Birkdale Animal Hospital (“Birkdale”), \na veterinary practice that competes directly with Battleground’s clinics.  \n{5} Plaintiffs also allege Defendants encouraged each other to ignore their \ncovenants and breached their fiduciary duties to Plaintiffs by, among other things, \nco-opting resources and time that should have been devoted to promoting \nBattleground’s interests and using them instead to establish Birkdale.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs accuse Defendants of misappropriating Plaintiffs’ trade \nsecrets to facilitate the development of their new practice and wrongfully soliciting \nBattleground’s clients and employees. \n{6} Between 12 May 2003 and 23 July 2005, Mark McGeough served as \nBattleground’s sole shareholder, officer, and director.  Mark McGeough contends \nthat during this time period, he “nullified” the covenants not to compete that \npurported to bind Defendants, and that he had full authority to do so by virtue of \nhis sole control of Battleground.   \n{7} Alternatively, Defendants argue the restrictive covenants by their terms \napply only when an employee is terminated.  Because they both resigned, \nDefendants contend they are not bound by the covenants. \n{8} As for the tort claims alleged in Plaintiffs’ Complaint, Defendants assert \nthat, as Battleground’s sole shareholder, officer, and director during the time of the \nacts that form the basis of Plaintiffs’ claims, Mark McGeough could do as he wished \nwith Battleground’s assets, and therefore neither he nor his co-defendant may be \nheld liable in tort.   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nIII. \nSUMMARY OF DECISION \n{9} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all \nclaims alleged by Battleground. \n{10} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the \nSecond and Third Causes of Action asserted by VetCor Professional Practices, LLC \n(“VetCor”) for breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting the same.   \n{11} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to \nVetCor’s Fifth Cause of Action alleging misappropriation of trade secrets.   \n{12} In all other respects, however, the parties’ cross-motions for summary \njudgment are DENIED.  \n \nIV. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{13} Battleground filed its Complaint on 19 October 2005. \n{14} Defendants filed their answer on 28 December 2005. \n{15} On 19 May 2006, Superior Court Judge Forrest D. Bridges denied \nBattleground’s motion for a preliminary injunction, although he required \nDefendants to (1) return a customer list taken from Battleground, (2) refrain from \nsoliciting those customers on the list, (3) return certain customer records to \nBattleground, (4) make any future requests for records in the same manner as is \ncustomary in the veterinary community, and (5) advise those customers whose \nrecords were returned to Battleground of the Court’s order.   \n{16} On 30 May 2006, VetCor moved to intervene as a party plaintiff.  \n{17} On 1 June 2006, the matter was transferred to the North Carolina \nBusiness Court as a complex business case and assigned to me.  \n{18} Defendants filed an amended answer on 16 August 2006. \n{19} On 19 October 2006, the Court entered a consent order granting VetCor’s \nmotion to intervene. \n  \n \n \n{20} On 7 May 2007, Defendants moved for summary judgment as to all claims \nand filed a supporting brief. \n{21} On 31 May 2007, Plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment as to all \nclaims and filed a supporting brief.   \n{22} On 20 June 2007, both sides filed briefs in opposition to the cross-motions \nfor summary judgment. \n{23} On 27 June 2007, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for \nsummary judgment. \n{24} On 28 June 2007, Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion for \nsummary judgment.   \n{25} The Court heard oral arguments on the motions on 30 July 2007.  \n \nV. \nSUMMARY OF THE FACTS1\nA. \nTHE PARTIES \n{26} Battleground is a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of \nbusiness in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶ 1.)  It operates several \nveterinary clinics throughout North Carolina. (Compl. ¶ 2.)2     \n{27} VetCor is a Delaware limited liability company.  (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. \nQ.) \n{28} VetCor and Battleground are affiliated companies.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. \nExs. 2–3.)   \n{29} VetCor serves as Manager of Battleground’s clinics pursuant to an \nAdministrative Services Agreement (the “ASA”) between it and Battleground.  (Pls. \nMot. Summ. J. Ex. 1.)   \n                                                 \n1 Unless otherwise noted, the facts set forth herein are undisputed. \n2 At some point following the filing of this action, Battleground changed its name to North Carolina \nVeterinary Services, P.C. (DeFeo Dep. 4:10–18.) \n  \n \n \n{30} The ASA (and its various amendments) allocates responsibility for \nBattleground’s operation between the provision of professional and administrative \nservices.3  Responsibility for the former is vested solely in Battleground and its \nprofessional personnel, while control of the latter resides exclusively with VetCor.  \n(Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1; Defs. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. Q.) \n{31} As Manager, VetCor’s duties under the ASA include (1) hiring and \ntraining all administrative personnel, (2) establishing guidelines for hiring all \nprofessional personnel, (3) preparing budgets, maintaining records, and managing \npatient billings, (4) purchasing equipment and supplies (with VetCor retaining \nownership of said property), and (5) locating and maintaining appropriate facilities \nfor the practice.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1.)   \n{32} In exchange for providing these services, VetCor is paid an annual fee and \nis entitled to reimbursement of certain expenses.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1.)  \n{33} Defendants are veterinarians who practice in North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶¶ \n16–17.) \n{34} Defendants are married.  (Compl. ¶ 3.)   \nB. \nTHE CLAIMS \n1. \nSARAH MCGEOUGH’S COVENANT \n{35} On 8 January 2001, Sarah McGeough began work as an associate \nveterinarian in Battleground’s Charlotte, North Carolina clinic.  (Compl. ¶ 17; \nSarah McGeough Aff. ¶ 4.) \n{36} Plaintiffs allege Sarah McGeough signed a covenant on her first day of \nemployment that, among other things, prevented her, for twelve (12) months from \nthe date of termination of her employment, from (1) engaging in a competitive \nveterinary practice anywhere within a ten (10) mile radius of Battleground’s \n                                                 \n3 This allocation is a function of North Carolina law, which provides that veterinary services may \nonly be rendered by a properly licensed veterinarian.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 90-187.11–187.12 \n(2005). \n  \n \n \nCharlotte clinic,4 (2) soliciting clients or employees of Battleground, either for her \nown benefit or that of any other person or entity, or (3) taking any action that \nwould, directly or indirectly, be detrimental to Battleground or would benefit a \ncompetitor of Battleground.  (Compl. ¶¶ 17–18; Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex 3.) \n{37} Sarah McGeough also agreed in her covenant to keep Battleground’s \nconfidential and proprietary information “in confidence and trust” and to not \ndisclose it either during her employment or after her termination.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. \nJ. Ex. 3.)    \n{38} Sarah McGeough’s covenant states that her employer for purposes of the \ncovenant shall be deemed to include Battleground and “its direct or indirect \nsubsidiaries and affiliates.”  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 3.)   \n{39} Sarah McGeough contends the covenant formed no part of her initial \nemployment negotiations with Battleground.  (Sarah McGeough Aff. ¶ 5.) \n{40} She further alleges that (1) Battleground did not present her with the \ncovenant until sometime in February 2001, (2) she was offered no additional \nconsideration for signing it, and (3) although the covenant’s signature block is dated \n8 January 2001, she did not sign the document until 12 March 2001, the same day \nshe signed a separate offer of employment detailing her compensation and fringe \nbenefits package.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 7; Sarah McGeough Aff. ¶ 5.)5 \n{41} Sarah McGeough was promoted to Chief of Staff of the Battleground \nCharlotte clinic in or around September 2001.  (Sarah McGeough Dep. 72:19–73:1.) \n2. \nMARK MCGEOUGH’S COVENANT \n{42} Plaintiffs allege Mark McGeough began working for Battleground as Chief \nof Staff of Battleground’s Concord, North Carolina facility on or about 1 February \n2001, and that he executed a covenant not to compete that same day.  (Compl. ¶ 16.)   \n                                                 \n4 Birkdale is 9.2 miles away from Battleground’s Charlotte clinic.  (Order Prelim. Inj. ¶ 18.) \n5 Sarah McGeough’s offer of employment refers specifically to the separate covenant.  (Pls. Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. 7.) \n  \n \n \n{43} Mark McGeough’s covenant prevented him, for twelve (12) months from \nthe date of termination of his employment, from (1) engaging in a competitive \nveterinary business anywhere within a nine (9) mile radius of Battleground’s \nConcord clinic,6 (2) soliciting clients or employees of Battleground, either for his \nown benefit or that of any other person or entity, or (3) taking any action that \nwould, directly or indirectly, be detrimental to Battleground or would benefit a \ncompetitor of Battleground.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex 2.) \n{44} Mark McGeough further agreed to keep Battleground’s confidential and \nproprietary information “in confidence and trust” and to not disclose it either during \nhis employment or after his termination.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2.) \n{45} Mark McGeough’s covenant states that his employer for purposes of the \ncovenant includes Battleground and “its direct or indirect subsidiaries and affiliates \n(including, without limitation, VetCor Professional Practices LLC).”  (Pls. Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. 2.)   \n{46} According to Mark McGeough, he did not begin work for Battleground \nuntil 23 March 2001 and did not sign the covenant until 9 April 2001.  (Mark \nMcGeough Dep. 44:6–46:23.)  The signature page of his covenant, however, is dated \n16 February 2001.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2.) \n{47} Both covenants state that they may not “be amended, modified or waived \nexcept by a written instrument duly executed by the person against whom \nenforcement of such amendment, modification, or waiver [is] sought.”  (Pls. Mot. \nSumm. J. Exs. 2–3.) \n3. \nDEFENDANTS’ ALLEGED BREACHES \n{48} On or about 12 May 2003, Mark McGeough acquired all the shares of \nBattleground and became its sole officer and director.7  (Defs. Am. Answer ¶ 1; \nDefs. Mot. Summ. J. Exs. J, L.)   \n                                                 \n6 Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that Mark McGeough did not violate this geographic \nrestriction, as Birkdale is approximately 18 miles from the Battleground Concord clinic.  \n7 The record does not disclose what consideration Mark McGeough paid to acquire his interest in \nBattleground.  \n  \n \n \n{49} On that same day, Mark McGeough gave a company named VetCor of \nConcord, LLC an unconditional and irrevocable option to purchase his ownership \ninterest in Battleground for $100.00. (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 6.)   McGeough also \nsigned a separate escrow agreement wherein he promised to use reasonable efforts \nto cause Battleground to fulfill its obligations under the ASA.  (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. \nEx. K.)8   \n{50} On or about 16 December 2004 (while serving as Battleground’s sole \nshareholder, officer, and director), Mark McGeough executed a document purporting \nto nullify the covenants.  (Mark McGeough Aff. ¶ 8.)  Plaintiffs allege they did not \nknow about McGeough’s action until sometime in January 2006.  (DeFeo Dep. \n145:6–147:3.)\n9  \n{51} Sometime in February 2005, Sarah McGeough took maternity leave from \nher employment with Battleground.  She submitted her formal resignation effective \n4 May 2005.  (Sarah McGeough Dep. 130:6–133:8.)  \n{52} Mark McGeough resigned his employment with Battleground on or about \n23 July 2005.  (Mark McGeough Aff. ¶ 9.)   \n{53} On 4 August 2005, Defendants opened Birkdale.  (Compl. ¶¶ 21–22; Sarah \nMcGeough Aff. ¶¶ 9–10; Mark McGeough Aff. ¶¶ 10–11.) \n{54} Beginning in January 2005, Mark McGeough began laying the \ngroundwork for Birkdale.  The planning work included meetings with lenders and \nothers during what would have been his normal working hours at Battleground’s \nConcord clinic.  Both Defendants culled customer information from Battleground’s \nrecords, including, in some instances, the amounts particular clients spent on \nveterinary care.  Defendants also used Battleground’s resources to prepare \ncustomer lists and address labels that were then used to create mailings \nannouncing the opening of Birkdale.  Finally, McGeough let several Battleground \n                                                 \n8 The escrow agreement also refers to the execution of “the Administrative Services Agreement dated \nas of the date hereof by and between the Manager and [Battleground.]”  McGeough never executed \nan ASA. \n9 On 12 January 2006, VetCor purported to rescind Mark McGeough’s nullification notice.  (Defs. \nMot. Summ. J. Ex T.) \n  \n \n \nemployees know that he would hire them at his new practice, and at least one such \nemployee accepted employment with Birkdale.  (Compl. ¶¶ 23–25, 27–28; Mark \nMcGeough Dep. 115:15–117:2, 139:21–140:12, 148:15–151:2, 154:8–156:5, 175:5–\n176:14, 182:22–183:13; Sarah McGeough Dep. 52:7–53:25, 79:19–83:24, 149:21–\n151:20.)   \n{55} On or about 18 August 2005 (almost a month after Mark McGeough \nresigned), VetCor of Concord, LLC exercised its option to purchase Mark \nMcGeough’s interest in Battleground.  (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. O.)   \n{56} Defendants do not dispute the facts surrounding their activities in \norganizing Birkdale.  Defendants do dispute the enforceability of the covenants.  \nThey also dispute that any information they used to develop and open Birkdale was \nin fact confidential and proprietary.  Finally, Defendants assert they owed no \nfiduciary duties to VetCor or Battleground and, as a result, all claims that flow from \nthat premise fail as a matter of law.   \n \nVI. \nPRINCIPLES OF LAW \nA. \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD \n{57} Summary judgment should be granted if “the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if \nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party \nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c) \n(2005).   \n{58} The moving party bears the burden of showing a lack of any triable issue \nof fact.  Collingwood v. Gen. Elec. Real Estate Equities, Inc., 324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 \nS.E.2d 425, 427 (1989) (citing Caldwell v. Deese, 288 N.C. 375, 218 S.E.2d 379 \n(1975)).  Once the moving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must \n“produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that the [nonmoving party] will be \nable to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.”  \nId.  \n  \n \n \n{59} Summary judgment, however, is a drastic remedy that should be granted \ncautiously.  First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Branch Banking & Trust Co., 282 N.C. \n44, 50, 191 S.E.2d 683, 688 (1972).  Where the slightest doubt exists as to the merits \nof the motion, it should be denied.  Volkman v. DP Assocs., 48 N.C. App. 155, 157, \n268 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1980). \nB. \nBREACH OF CONTRACT \n{60} The intention of the parties to a contract controls the interpretation of the \ncontract.  Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co. v. Dortch, 318 N.C. 378, 380, 348 S.E.2d \n794, 796 (1986) (citing Lineberry v. Trust Co., 238 N.C. 264, 77 S.E.2d 652 (1953)).  \nAs the North Carolina Court of Appeals has explained, \n[i]f the language of a contract is clear and only one reasonable \ninterpretation exists, the courts must enforce the contract as written \nand cannot, under the guise of interpretation, rewrite the contract or \nimpose terms on the parties not bargained for and found within the \ncontract.  If the contract is ambiguous, however, interpretation is a \nquestion of fact, and resort to extrinsic evidence is necessary.  An \nambiguity exists in a contract if the language of a contract is fairly and \nreasonably susceptible to either of the constructions asserted by the \nparties.  Thus, if there is any uncertainty as to what the agreement is \nbetween the parties, a contract is ambiguous.  \n \nCrider v. Jones Island Club, Inc., 147 N.C. App. 262, 266–67, 554 S.E.2d 863, 866–\n67 (2001) (internal citations, alteration, footnote, and quotation marks omitted). \n{61} “Under North Carolina law, a covenant not to compete is valid and \nenforceable if it is:  (1) in writing; (2) made a part of the employment contract; (3) \nbased on valuable consideration; (4) reasonable as to time and territory; and (5) \ndesigned to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer.”  Okuma Am. \nCorp. v. Bowers, 638 S.E.2d 617, 620 (2007) (citing Farr Assocs., Inc., v. Baskin, 138 \nN.C. App. 276, 279, 530 S.E.2d 878, 881 (2000)).   \n{62} “When the relationship of employer and employee is established before the \ncovenant not to compete is signed there must be consideration for the covenant such \nas a raise in pay or a new job assignment.”  Whittaker Gen. Med. Corp. v. Daniel, \n  \n \n \n324 N.C. 523, 527, 379 S.E.2d 824, 827 (1989) (citing Chemical Corp. v. Freeman, \n261 N.C. 780, 136 S.E.2d 118 (1964)).   \n{63} Nevertheless, if a covenant not to compete “is a part of an original verbal \nemployment contract, it will be considered to be based on valuable consideration.”  \nYoung v. Mastrom, Inc., 99 N.C. App. 120, 123, 392 S.E.2d 446, 448 (1990) (citing \nRobins & Weill v. Mason, 70 N.C. App. 537, 320 S.E.2d 693 (1984)).  It is immaterial \nthat the written covenant is executed after the employee starts to work, so long as \nthe terms incorporated therein were agreed upon at the time of employment.  Id. \n(citing Stevenson v. Parsons, 96 N.C. App. 93, 97, 384 S.E.2d 291, 293 (1989)). \nC. \nBREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY \n{64}  “For a breach of fiduciary duty to exist, there must first be a fiduciary \nrelationship between the parties.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651, 548 S.E.2d \n704, 707 (2001) (citing Curl v. Key, 311 N.C. 259, 264, 316 S.E.2d 272, 275 (1984)). \n{65} In Camp, the Court defined such a relationship as one in which “‘there has \nbeen a special confidence reposed . . . on one side, and resulting domination and \ninfluence on the other.’” Id. at 651–52, 548 S.E.2d at 707–08 (quoting Abbitt v. \nGregory, 201 N.C. 577, 598, 160 S.E. 896, 906 (1931)) (emphasis in original).  \n{66} As a general rule, “‘the relation of employer and employee is not one of \nthose regarded as confidential.’”  Id. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at 708 (quoting King v. \nAtlantic Coast Line R.R. Co., 157 N.C. 44, 72 S.E. 801 (1911)).  Even when an \nemployee is entrusted with substantial managerial authority, a fiduciary \nrelationship will not exist absent evidence that such authority led to the employer \nbeing subjugated to the “improper influences or domination of [its] employee.”  Id.    \n{67} In North Carolina, corporate officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to \nthe corporation.  Pierce Concrete, Inc. v. Cannon Realty & Constr. Co., 77 N.C. App. \n411, 413–14, 335 S.E.2d 30, 31 (1985) (citing Meiselman v. Meiselman, 309 N.C. \n279, 307 S.E.2d 551 (1983)).  More specifically, the law requires officers and \ndirectors to discharge their duties “(1) In good faith; (2) With the care an ordinarily \nprudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and \n  \n \n \n(3) In a manner [they] reasonably believe[] to be in the best interests of the \ncorporation.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 55-8-30(a), 55-8-42(a) (2005). \nD. \nAIDING AND ABETTING BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY \n{68} It remains an open question whether North Carolina law recognizes a \nclaim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. \n{69} The reason for doubt is that the sole North Carolina appellate decision \nrecognizing such a claim involved allegations of securities fraud, and its federal \nunderpinnings were subsequently overruled by the United States Supreme Court.  \nSee Sompo Japan Ins. Co., v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 2005 NCBC 2 ( N.C. Super. \nCt. June 10, 2005), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2005%20NCBC%202. \nhtm (discussing Blow v. Shaughnessy, 88 N.C. App. 484, 364 S.E.2d 444 (1988) and \nCentral Bank of Denver, N.A., v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. \n164 (1994)).  But see Equitable Life Assurance Soc’y of the U.S. v. Am. Bankers Ins. \nCo. of Fla., No. 88-535-CIV-5-H, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10880, at *34 (E.D.N.C. May \n12, 1995) (stating that North Carolina would still recognize a claim for aiding and \nabetting breach of fiduciary duty based solely on tort principles); In re Lee Memory \nGardens, Inc., 333 B.R. 76, 80 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2005) (stating that “North Carolina \nlaw recognizes a cause of action for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty” \nand citing Blow v. Shaughessy for that proposition).   \n{70} Even assuming North Carolina law continues to recognize a claim for \naiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, it applies only to third parties who \ndo not stand in a fiduciary relationship to the alleged victim, but who provide \nsubstantial assistance toward accomplishing the alleged breach.  Sompo, slip. op. at \n¶¶ 10–11. \nE. \nUNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES \n{71} The elements of a claim alleging a violation of the North Carolina Unfair \nand Deceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C. Gen Stat § 75.1-1 (2005) (“UDTPA”), are \n“(1) defendant[] committed an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) in or affecting \n  \n \n \ncommerce, and (3) plaintiff was injured as a result.”  Phelps-Dickson Builders, \nL.L.C. v. Amerimann Partners, 172 N.C. App. 427, 439, 617 S.E.2d 664, 671 (2005) \n(citing Edwards v. West, 128 N.C. App. 570, 574, 495 S.E.2d 920, 923 (1998)).   \n{72} The UDTPA defines “commerce” broadly, to include “all business \nactivities, however denominated”, but not “professional services rendered by a \nmember of a learned profession.”   N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1(b) (2005). \n{73} Courts apply a two-part test when considering the UDTPA’s learned \nprofession exemption.  “First, the person or entity performing the alleged act must \nbe a member of a learned profession.  Second, the conduct in question must be a \nrendering of professional services.”  Reid v. Ayers, 138 N.C. App. 261, 266, 531 \nS.E.2d 231, 235 (2000) (citations omitted). \n{74} In considering facts related to the second prong of this test, “the crucial \ninquiry [is] whether the [particular function or conduct is] a necessary part of the \n[professional] services provided.”  Id. at 267, 531 S.E.2d 231, 235 (citing Cameron v. \nNew Hanover Mem. Hosp., 58 N.C. App. 414, 446–47, 293 S.E.2d 901, 920–21 \n(1982)). \n{75} Finally, proof of an independent tort generally is sufficient to make out \nmake out a separate UDTPA claim.  See Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter, 351 N.C. 27, 31–\n33, 519 S.E.2d 308, 311–12 (1999) (finding that the breach of a fiduciary duty by an \nemployee also gave rise to a UDTPA claim); Governor’s Club, Inc. v.

App. 30, 41, 392 S.E.2d 663, 670 (1990) (holding that a claim \nalleging tortious interference with contract also makes out a UDTPA violation).  \n \n \n  \n \n \nF. \nMISAPPROPRIATION OF TRADE SECRETS \n{76} North Carolina’s Trade Secrets Protection Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 66-152–\n157 (2005) (the “TSPA”), defines a trade secret as business or technical information \nthat “derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not being \ngenerally known or readily ascertainable through independent development . . . and \nis the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its \nsecrecy.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152(3)(a)–(b).   \n{77} Proper factors to consider when determining whether an item is a trade \nsecret are:   \n(1) the extent to which [the] information is known outside the business; \n(2) the extent to which it is known to employees and others involved in \nthe business; (3) the extent of measures taken to guard [the] secrecy of \nthe information; (4) the value of [the] information to business and its \ncompetitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended in developing \nthe information; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the \ninformation could properly be acquired or duplicated by others. \n   \nState ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. MCI Telecomms., Corp., 132 N.C. App. 625, 634, \n514 S.E.2d 276, 282 (1999) (quoting Wilmington Star News v. New Hanover Reg’l \nMed. Ctr., 125 N.C. App. 174, 182, 480 S.E.2d 53, 57 (1997)). \n{78} While customer lists may sometimes be afforded trade secret protection, \nsee Norman W. Drouillard & Print Purchasing Consultants, Inc. v. Keister Williams \nNewspaper Servs., Inc.,  108 N.C. App. 169, 173, 423 S.E.2d 324, 327 (1992), courts \nwill not grant relief under the TSPA where the list consists of information that is \neasily accessible or can be retrieved by reviewing public information.  Combs & \nAssocs. v. Kennedy, 147 N.C. App. 362, 370–71, 555 S.E.2d 634, 640 (2001) (citing \nNovacare Orthotics & Prosthetics E., Inc. v. Speelman, 137 N.C. App. 471, 478, 528 \nS.E.2d 918, 922 (2000)).  \n  \n \n \n{79} The TSPA defines “misappropriation” as the “acquisition, disclosure, or \nuse of a trade secret of another without express or implied authority or consent . . . \n.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152(1) (emphasis added).10 \nG. \nTORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT \n{80} To establish a claim for tortious interference with contract, a plaintiff \nmust show:  (1) a valid contract between it and a third person that confers upon the \nplaintiff a contractual right against a third person, (2) the defendant knows of the \ncontract, (3) the defendant intentionally induces the third person not to perform the \ncontract, (4) and in doing so the defendant acts without justification, (5) resulting in \nactual damage to the plaintiff.  United Labs, Inc. v. Kuykendall, 322 N.C. 643, 661, \n370 S.E.2d 375, 387 (1988). \n{81} With respect to the fourth element of this tort, “[t]he interference is \n‘without justification’ if the defendant’s motives for procuring termination of the \nemployment contract were ‘not reasonably related to the protection of a legitimate \nbusiness interest’ of the defendant.”  Privette v. Univ. of N.C., 96 N.C. App. 124, \n134, 385 S.E.2d 185, 190 (1989) (quoting Smith v. Ford Motor Co., 289 N.C. 71, 94, \n221 S.E.2d 282, 292 (1976)).   \n{82} A competitor may hire an employer's former employees without being \nliable for tortious interference with contract.  Peoples Security Life Ins. Co. v. \nHooks, 322 N.C. 216, 221–22, 367 S.E.2d 647, 650–51 (1988).  For example, merely \noffering an employee the opportunity to terminate an at-will employment \nrelationship or even locating that employee in a territory where he may be induced \nto breach a non-competition agreement is by itself not enough to make out a claim \nof tortious interference.  Id. at 222, 367 S.E.2d at 650.   \n{83} On the other hand, where a party directly entices another to breach his \ncontractual commitments (by, for example, unlawfully encouraging a new employee \n                                                 \n10 Plaintiffs also purport to allege common law claims for misappropriation of trade secrets.  \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint, however, does not allege (and the Court is unable to discern) any relevant \nevidentiary distinction between a claim alleging common law misappropriation and one alleging \nmisappropriation under the TSPA. \n  \n \n \nto solicit his prior customers or use proprietary information to compete in violation \nof valid covenants prohibiting the same), a claim for tortious interference with \ncontract may lie.  Roane-Barker v. Se. Hosp. Supply Corp., 99 N.C. App. 30, 38–39, \n392 S.E.2d 663, 668–669 (1990). \nH. \nCIVIL CONSPIRACY   \n{84}  Where a party seeks “recovery for injury caused by acts committed \npursuant to a conspiracy, . . . the combination or conspiracy charged does no more \nthan associate the defendants together and perhaps liberalize the rules of evidence \nto the extent that under the proper circumstances the acts of one may be admissible \nagainst all.”  Henry v. Deen, 310 N.C. 75, 86–87, 310 S.E.2d 326, 334 (1984) (citing \nShope v. Boyer, 268 N.C. 401, 150 S.E.2d 771 (1966)). \n{85} The gravamen of the action, however, is the resultant injury, and not the \nconspiracy itself.  Shope, 268 N.C. at 405, 150 S.E.2d at 773–74.  To create civil \nliability for conspiracy, there must have been a wrongful act resulting in injury to \nanother committed by one or more of the conspirators pursuant to the common \nscheme and in furtherance of the objective.  See id.  \n \nVII. \nANALYSIS \nA. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION-BREACH OF CONTRACT \n{86} Plaintiffs’ First Cause of Action seeks relief for the alleged breach of two \ncovenants not to compete.  Plaintiffs allege that (1) the covenants are unambiguous,  \n  \n \n \nand (2) the undisputed facts show each Defendant breached the same.11   \n{87} Defendants respond that (1) Mark McGeough nullified the covenants \nduring his tenure as Battleground’s sole shareholder, officer, and director, (2) the \ndoctrine of laches bars Plaintiffs from objecting to Mark McGeough’s decision to \nnullify the covenants, and (3) the covenants fail for lack of consideration. \n{88} Alternatively, Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment \nbecause the plain language of the covenants show they do not apply where, as here, \nan employee is not terminated but instead resigns.  \n{89} The Court addresses these contentions in turn. \n1. \nMARK MCGEOUGH’S NULLIFICATION OF THE COVENANTS \n{90} Defendants allege that when Mark McGeough assumed the roles of sole \nshareholder, officer, and director of Battleground, he necessarily obtained \nunfettered discretion to nullify the covenants at issue.  Defendants are correct, but \nonly with respect to Battleground’s claim for breach of contract.   \n{91} All corporations organized under North Carolina law, including those \nentities where power and authority are closely held, are governed by the \nrequirements of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ \n55-1-01–55-17-05 (2005) (the “Business Corporation Act”).  \n{92} Among other things, the Business Corporation Act prescribes general \nstandards of conduct for a corporation’s officers and directors.  As applied here, \nwhen Mark McGeough became the sole director and officer of Battleground, he \nundertook to discharge his duties “(1) In good faith; (2) With the care an ordinarily \nprudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and \n                                                 \n11 Plaintiffs contend the ASA provides a separate basis for relief against Defendants because it too \nimposes restrictions regarding confidentiality and competition.  This argument fails on at least five \nlevels: first, Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not allege a breach of the ASA; second, the ASA does not \nidentify the confidential information it purports to protect; third, the ASA provides expressly that \nthe then President of Battleground (who was not Mark McGeough) was executing the ASA solely in \nhis representative capacity; fourth, the ASA attached to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment \ndoes not name either Defendant as a party to its terms; and fifth, Defendants never signed the \nattached ASA nor, it appears, any other version of that document.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1; Defs. \nMot. Summ. J. Ex. Q.) \n  \n \n \n(3) In a manner he reasonably believe[d] to be in the best interests of the \ncorporation.”  Id. §§ 55-8-30(a), 55-8-42(a).  \n{93} As to this third point, the Business Corporation Act precludes a director \nfrom engaging in so-called “conflict of interest” transactions in which the director \nhas either a direct or indirect personal interest.  Id. § 55-8-31(a).  \n{94} Although the Act does not define a “direct” conflict of interest, the point, \nas one commentator has explained, is left to “common sense.”  Russell M. Robinson, \nII, Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law 15-3 (7th ed. 2006).  There is little \ndoubt, however, that a director has a “direct” conflict of interest where either he or \nsome member of his immediate family has a material financial interest in the \ntransaction.  Id. (citing Model Act official comment 8.31 ¶ 5 (1984)).  \n{95} A conflict of interest transaction is voidable by the corporation unless it is \napproved by a proper vote of disinterested directors or shareholders or the \ntransaction is otherwise fair to the corporation.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-8-31(a).  The \nburden of proof on the fairness issue is on “the party seeking to sustain the \ntransaction.”  Robinson, supra, § 15.01[4]; see also Schwartzbach v. Apple Baking \nCo., 109 N.C. App. 216, 219, 426 S.E.2d 438, 440 (1993) (analyzing prior version of \nthe statute).      \n{96} Moreover, these corporate governance principles do not evaporate merely \nbecause one person has sole control of a corporation.  Cf. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-2-03(c) \n(emphasizing that no provision in the Business Corporation Act or any prior act \n“shall be construed to require that a corporation have more than one shareholder”); \nId.  § 55-8-01(c) (allowing a corporation to dispense with or limit the authority of a \nboard of directors and transfer authority for performing such duties to one \nindividual).   \n{97} To the contrary, so long as corporate formalities are observed, a “one-\nperson” corporation remains an entity separate and distinct from its sole \nshareholder.  On the other hand, where control leads to the abandonment of \ncorporate formalities such that the corporate entity is a mere instrumentality of the \nindividual shareholder, and where such control is used to commit a fraud or other \n  \n \n \nwrong, North Carolina courts will not hesitate to pierce the corporate veil to reach a \ncontrolling shareholder’s personal assets.  See generally Glenn v. Wagner, 313 N.C. \n450, 454–55, 329 S.E.2d 326, 330–31 (1985) (summarizing the “instrumentality \nrule” for piercing the corporate veil); see also Strawbridge v. Sugar Mountain \nResort, Inc., 320 F. Supp. 2d 425, 439 (W.D.N.C. 2004) (denying summary judgment \nfor defendant on piercing claim, in part because plaintiff’s evidence showed that sole \nshareholder was also the corporation’s sole director and president).   \n{98} It is difficult to conceive of a transaction more fraught with conflict than \none where an officer or director of a corporation purports to dispose of a corporate \nasset by rescinding contractual obligations that otherwise bind both the director \nand his wife to refrain from competing with that same entity.  That said, Plaintiffs \nin this case have not alleged a piercing claim.  And it seems obvious (at least to the \nCourt) that the provisions related to conflict of interest transactions in the Business \nCorporation Act are primarily intended to protect minority shareholders from \noverreaching by majority shareholders.   \n{99} The question presented by the instant facts, however, is what constraints, \nif any, are imposed on the actions of an individual vis-à-vis a corporation’s assets \nwhere that individual is also the corporation’s sole shareholder, officer, and director.   \n{100} The Court has found no North Carolina authority on the issue.  The \nconsensus in other jurisdictions, however, appears to be that a sole shareholder of a \ncorporation is generally free to dispose of corporate assets as he sees fit, except \nwhere such actions harm or defraud the corporation’s creditors, or otherwise violate \npublic policy.  Anderson v. Benson, 394 N.W.2d 171, 175 (Minn. Ct. App. 1986); \naccord L.R. Schmaus Co. v. Commissioner, 406 F.2d 1044, 1045 (7th Cir. 1969); \nHousehold Reinsurance Co., Ltd., v. Travelers Ins. Co., No. 91 C 1308, 1992 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 1006 (E.D. Ill. January 31, 1992).  \n{101} Applying this principle here, the Court holds that Battleground has no \nclaim for breach of contract.  When he nullified the covenants purporting to bind \nDefendants, Mark McGeough was Battleground’s sole shareholder.  As such, absent \nharm to a creditor or a violation of public policy, he was free to dispose of \n  \n \n \nBattleground’s assets as he saw fit.   For that reason, and notwithstanding the \nattempt by Battleground’s new management to rescind Mark McGeough’s action, \nthe Court holds that Battleground—through its then sole shareholder—consented to \nthe nullification of the covenants. \n{102} Plaintiffs argue, however, that (1) the ASA vests title to the covenants in \nVetCor, not Battleground, and (2) Mark McGeough conceded as much in his \ndeposition.  (Pls. Reply Mot. Summ. J. 2.)  Plaintiffs are incorrect.  \n{103} In fact, the ASA says only that VetCor retains title in all “inventory . . ., \nequipment, furnishings and supplies reasonably necessary for the efficient \noperation of the Practice.”  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1.)  What’s more, the ASA goes \nout of its way to establish a clear demarcation between the administrative services \nthat VetCor as Manager provides and the professional services rendered by \nBattleground’s employee veterinarians. \n{104} It is true that the ASA vests the Manager with control of Battleground’s \nadministrative operations.  But managerial control is not synonymous with \nownership of a corporation’s assets.  Moreover, Section 2.4 of the ASA states that \nBattleground is “solely responsible for setting all professional standards of the \nPractice and shall be responsible for employment, supervision and discharge of all \nProfessional Personnel and that the Manager shall have no responsibility for the \nconduct or supervision of the professional services of the Practice.”  (Pls. Mot. \nSumm. J. Ex. 1.) \n{105} If anything, this language suggests that Battleground (acting through its \nowners) has unfettered discretion to determine how and whether it will enforce \ncovenants that might otherwise bind its employee veterinarians. \n{106} Nor do the deposition excerpts cited by Plaintiffs in their reply brief help \ntheir cause, as they show only that Mark McGeough understood he would not own \nBattleground’s assets once he resigned his employment.  (Pls. Reply Mot. Summ. J. \n2 (citing Mark McGeough Dep. 80–82.))  McGeough did, however, have sole \nownership of Battleground when he nullified the covenants. \n  \n \n \n{107} On these facts, the Court concludes that Battleground (and not VetCor) \nowned the covenants at issue.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion \nfor summary judgment as to Battleground’s claim for breach of contract.   \n{108} The Court reaches a different result as to VetCor’s claim for breach of \ncontract. \n{109} Mark McGeough’s covenant specifically identifies VetCor as an additional \nparty.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2.)  And Sarah McGeough’s covenant states that the \n“Company” identified as a party therein, shall “include [Battleground] and its direct \nor indirect subsidiaries and affiliates.”  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 3.)  Moreover,  \nPlaintiffs’ Verified Complaint alleges that Battleground is affiliated with the \n“VetCor family of veterinary facilities.” (Compl. ¶ 7.)12\n{110} The parties also agreed the covenants could not be modified or waived \nexcept by a writing signed by the party against whom the modification or waiver \nwas being enforced.  (Pls. Mot. Summ. J. Exs. 2–3.)  Thus, even if Mark McGeough \ncould nullify Battleground’s rights under the covenants, his action could not work a \nlawful termination of VetCor’s rights. \n{111} The result is the same even if VetCor is considered a third-party \nbeneficiary of the contract rather than an additional party.  \n{112} North Carolina courts have long recognized the rights of a third party to \nsue for breach of a contract executed for its benefit.  See e.g., Raritan River Steel Co. \nv. Cherry, Bekaert & Holland, 329 N.C. 646, 651, 497 S.E.2d 178, 181 (1991). \n{113} In determining whether a third party has a right of action on a contract, \nthe primary inquiry is one of intent, namely whether the parties to the contract \nintended that the third party receive a benefit that may be enforced in court.  Id.  In \nmaking this determination, courts may consider circumstances surrounding the \ntransaction as well as the language of the contract itself.  Id. \n                                                 \n12 That VetCor did not sign the covenants is of no legal significance, as the requirement that a \ncovenant not to compete be in writing is satisfied when the document is signed by the party against \nwhom enforcement is sought.  Manpower of Guilford Co. v. Hedgecock, 42 N.C. App. 515, 520, 259 \nS.E.2d 109, 113 (1979). \n  \n \n \n{114}  Here, both covenants refer to VetCor either directly or indirectly, \nindicating that the original parties intended to give VetCor the ability to enforce the \ncovenants.  As such, the covenants could not be materially modified or changed to \nVetCor’s detriment without its consent.  Am. Trust Co. v. Catawba Sales & \nProcessing Co., 242 N.C. 370, 380, 88 S.E.2d 233, 240 (1955). \n{115} Accordingly, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment against \nVetCor on this ground. \n2. \nLACHES \n{116} Next, Defendants argue Plaintiffs should be barred from objecting to \nMark McGeough’s nullification of the covenants because of the doctrine of laches.  \nThe Court disagrees.  \n{117} “In equity, where lapse of time has resulted in some change . . . in the \nrelations of the parties which would make it unjust to permit the prosecution of the \nclaim, the doctrine of laches will be applied.” Teachey v. Gurley, 214 N.C. 288, 294, \n199 S.E. 83, 88 (1938).   \n{118} To prevail on the affirmative defense of laches, the party asserting the \ndefense bears the burden of proving that  \n(1) the claimant knew of the existence of the grounds for the claim; (2) \nthe delay was unreasonable and must have worked to the \ndisadvantage, injury or prejudice of the party asserting the defense; \n[and] (3) the delay of time has resu lted in some change . . . in the \nrelations of the parties.  \n \nTown of Cameron v. Wadell, 150 N.C. App. 174, 177, 563 S.E.2d 198, 201 \n(2002).   \n{119} “[H]owever, the mere passage of time is insufficient to support a finding of \nlaches.  The amount of delay required to establish laches depends on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case.”  Id. (citations omitted).  \n{120} Plaintiffs’ allege they had no knowledge of Mark McGeough’s actions until \nafter the lawsuit was filed and the purported nullification came to light in \ndiscovery.  (Defeo Dep. 145:6–147:3.)  The record also shows Plaintiffs attempted to \n  \n \n \nrescind the cancellations as conflict of interest transactions as soon as they became \naware of them.  (Defs. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. T.)  On this record, there is no evidence of \na significant delay, much less any delay that prejudiced Defendants.    \n{121} Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment on VetCor’s breach of contract claim based on laches.  \n3. \nFAILURE OF CONSIDERATION \n{122} Defendants also argue Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim fails for lack of \nconsideration.  More specifically, Defendants allege (1) the covenants formed no \npart of their initial employment negotiations with Battleground, (2) they were not \npresented with the terms of their covenants until months after they began working \nfor Battleground, and (3) as a result, Plaintiffs cannot rely on the initial offer of \nemployment as consideration for the covenants.  \n{123} Plaintiffs respond that Defendants’ testimony regarding the date they \nsigned the covenants is barred by the parol evidence rule.  The Court disagrees. \n{124} Generally, the parol evidence rule prohibits “the consideration of evidence \nas to anything which happened prior to or simultaneously with the making of a \ncontract which would vary the terms of the agreement.”  Harrell v. First Union Nat. \nBank, 76 N.C. App. 666, 667, 334 S.E.2d 109, 110 (1985). \n{125} However, the rule does not apply to written recitals of fact in a contract, \nincluding the date upon which the agreement took effect.  See Cutlar v. Cutlar, 3 \nN.C. 157 (1801) (allowing a party to introduce evidence that a deed was delivered on \na different day than that evidenced in the written document).13  \n{126} In this instance, the dates contained in the covenants are merely prima \nfacie evidence of the date they were executed.  Cf. Weiss v. Woody, 80 N.C. App. 86, \n92, 341 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1986) (allowing parol evidence to show the consideration \nrecited in the contract was not actually received since the recital acted merely as a \n                                                 \n13 Although Cutlar v. Cutlar appears on page 157 of Volume 3 of the North Carolina Reports, the \ncase is cited by Lexis as 3 N.C. 334. \n  \n \n \nreceipt in this context, providing prima facie evidence of the amount actually paid).  \nAs such, they may be disputed without running afoul of the parol evidence rule \nbecause any contradictory evidence as to the execution dates does not vary the \nterms of the covenants but simply sheds light on a relevant fact.  \n{127} Here, there is a factual dispute as to when Defendants executed the \ncovenants and whether they were in fact aware of the covenants’ terms before they \nbegan work for Battleground. \n{128} Plaintiffs rely on the covenants themselves, which show dates of execution \ncontemporaneous with the dates Defendants began working for Battleground.  \nDefendants, on the other hand, allege they were not presented with the covenants \nwhen they accepted employment with Battleground and did not execute the \ncovenants on the dates set forth therein.  Consistent with that view of the facts, \nSarah McGeough has presented evidence showing inconsistent dates on the various \nemployment documents she signed.   \n{129} “When the relationship of employer and employee is established before the \ncovenant not to compete is signed there must be consideration for the covenant such \nas a raise in pay or a new job assignment.”  Whittaker Gen. Med. Corp. v. Daniel, \n324 N.C. 523, 527, 379 S.E.2d 824, 827 (1989) (citing Chemical Corp. v. Freeman, \n261 N.C. 780, 136 S.E.2d 118 (1964)).   \n{130} On the other hand, if a covenant not to compete “is a part of an original \nverbal employment contract, it will be considered to be based on valuable \nconsideration.”  Young v. Mastrom, Inc., 99 N.C. App. 120, 123, 392 S.E.2d 446, 448 \n(1990) (citing Robins & Weill v. Mason, 70 N.C. App. 537, 320 S.E.2d 693 (1984)).  \nMoreover, a mere delay in reducing an otherwise valid agreement to writing is not \nfatal to prosecution of a claim for breach of the covenant.  Id.  \n{131}   Because there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether the \nparties agreed to the covenants on or after the date of employment, this issue must \nbe resolved by a jury.  Accordingly, the Court DENIES the parties’ cross motions for \nsummary judgment on this ground.  \n \n  \n \n \n4. \nAMBIGUITY OF CONTRACT LANGUAGE  \n{132} Both sides insist the language of the covenants unambiguously supports \nsummary judgment in their favor as to the breach of contract claim.  In fact, \nbecause the language is anything but clear, a jury must determine the intent of the \nparties.   \n{133} The covenants purport to bar Defendants from certain competitive activity \nfor twelve (12) months from the date of termination of Defendants’ employment.  \n(Pls. Mot. Summ J. Exs. 2–3.)  There is no dispute, however, that Defendants \nresigned their employment with Battleground.  (Compl. ¶ 20.) \n{134} In Novacare Orthotics, the Court of Appeals held that a covenant not to \ncompete containing virtually similar language was ambiguous, in that it could not \nbe construed as a matter of law to apply when a defendant resigned his \nemployment.  Novacare Orthotics & Prosthetics E., Inc. v. Speelman, 137 N.C. App. \n471, 476, 528 S.E.2d 918, 921 (2000). \n{135} Plaintiffs contend Mark McGeough’s attempt to nullify the covenants \ndistinguishes this case from Novacare because it shows Defendants actually \nbelieved the covenants applied regardless of how they ended their employment.  \nConversely, Defendants minimize the evidentiary import of Mark McGeough’s \nactions and argue the covenants should be construed against Plaintiffs because they \ndrafted them.  See e.g. Chavis v. S. Life Ins. Co., 318 N.C. 259, 262, 347 S.E.2d 425, \n427 (1986).  While both assertions have some merit, neither is sufficient to dispose \nof the issue as a matter of law. \n{136} The facts of the present case are not distinguishable in any material way \nfrom Novacare.  Thus, because the proper interpretation of the covenants is a \nquestion of fact for a jury, the Court denies the parties’ cross-motions for summary \njudgment on this ground.   \n{137} In sum, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as \nto Battleground’s claim for breach of contract, but DENIES the cross-motions as to \nVetCor’s claim.  \n  \n \n \nB. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION-TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE \nWITH CONTRACT14\n \n{138} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to \nBattleground’s claim alleging tortious interference with contract but otherwise \nDENIES the cross-motions. \n{139} To prevail on this claim, Plaintiffs must show (among other things) that \neach Defendant induced the other to breach a valid contract that existed between \nPlaintiffs and the other Defendant. \n{140} Because the Court has already determined that Battleground has no valid \nclaim for breach of contract as to the covenants, it follows that Battleground’s claim \nfor tortious interference with contract also fails.   \n{141} VetCor’s separate claim for tortious interference with contract, however, \ndepends in part on whether the covenants apply to Defendants on the facts \npresented.15  Because that issue is hotly disputed, resolution of VetCor’s related tort \nclaim must await a trial. \nC. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION—BRE ACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY  \n{142} Plaintiffs’ Second Cause of Action alleging breach of fiduciary duty is \nunusual because of the facts discussed previously regarding Mark McGeough’s sole \ncontrol of Battleground during the relevant period.  \n{143} The premise for the claim stems from Defendants’ alleged \nmisappropriation of Battleground’s proprietary information and assets to develop \ntheir competitive practice. \n{144} As to this claim, the undisputed facts show Mark McGeough spent at least \nsome of his working hours while employed by Battleground developing his business \n                                                 \n14 The Court has grouped related claims for purposes of its analysis, and thus has considered some \nclaims out of order. \n15 As to the fourth element of this tort, Defendants’ conduct falls somewhere between what is \nauthorized by Peoples as lawful competition and what is barred by Roane-Barker as tortious \ninterference with contract.  Regardless, as there are other issues related to the claim that must be \nresolved by a jury, the Court declines to decide this question at summary judgment.  \n  \n \n \nplan for Birkdale and arranging financing.  McGeough also solicited Battleground \nemployees to join his new practice.   \n{145} Further, both Defendants took Battleground’s customer lists, along with \nrecords documenting spending patterns for some of Battleground’s clients, which \nDefendants then used to develop their initial marketing program.  Defendants also \nused Battleground’s resources to prepare customer lists and address labels, which \nthey then used to create mailings announcing the opening of Birkdale. \n{146} Finally, Mark McGeough attempted to nullify employment covenants with \nBattleground that he feared would prevent Defendants from opening their new \npractice.   \n{147} Defendants make no real effort to refute these facts.  Instead, Defendants \nargue (1) they owed no fiduciary duties to VetCor, (2) Mark McGeough cannot be \nguilty of breach of fiduciary duty as to Battleground, since his actions could only \nhave harmed him as Battleground’s sole shareholder, (3) Sarah McGeough owed no \nfiduciary duty to Battleground, as she was a mere employee and not an officer of the \ncompany, and (4) Sarah McGeough cannot be guilty of breaching a fiduciary duty to \nBattleground where its sole shareholder at the time approved of her actions.   \n{148} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to \nPlaintiff VetCor.  To the extent VetCor alleges a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, \nit has presented no evidence describing the nature of its fiduciary relationship with \neither Defendant. \n{149} There is evidence that VetCor is Battleground’s creditor by virtue of its \nrole as Manager of Battleground’s clinics.  And of course, it is undisputed that Mark \nMcGeough was for a time Battleground’s sole director. \n{150} “As a general rule, [however,] directors of a corporation do not owe a \nfiduciary duty to creditors of the corporation.”  Keener Lumber Co. v. Perry, 149 \nN.C. App. 19, 29–30, 560 S.E.2d 817, 824 (2002) (quoting Whitley v. Carolina Clinic, \nInc., 118 N.C. App. 523, 526, 455 S.E.2d 896, 899 (1995)).   \n{151} In certain circumstances, however, corporate directors may owe a \nfiduciary duty to creditors of the corporation.  The circumstances under which a \n  \n \n \ndirector’s fiduciary obligations extend to creditors have been limited to those \nsituations “amounting to a ‘winding up’ or dissolution of the corporation.”  Id. at 31, \n560 S.E.2d at 825 (quoting Whitley, 118 N.C. App. at 528, 455 S.E.2d at 900). \n{152} VetCor has presented no such evidence here and thus, no basis for \nproceeding on a claim alleging breach of fiduciary duty against either Defendant.  \n{153} The Court also GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to \nBattleground’s claim alleging breach of fiduciary duty.   \n{154} Before resigning her employment, Sarah McGeough served as Chief of \nStaff for Battleground’s Charlotte clinic.  As such, there is little doubt that \nBattleground reposed a substantial level of confidence and authority in this \nDefendant.  But what is missing from Battleground’s proof is any evidence that \nSarah McGeough’s position resulted in her influencing or dominating her employer.  \nSee Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651–52, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707–08 (1984). \n{155} Without such evidence, there is no basis for concluding that a fiduciary \nrelationship existed between these parties, and thus, no basis for finding a breach of \nfiduciary duty.  \n{156} In any event, there is a more fundamental reason why Defendants are not \nliable for breach of fiduciary duty vis-à-vis Battleground.     \n{157} Mark McGeough’s fiduciary obligation to Battleground arises from his role \nas Battleground’s sole officer and director.  As such, he was obligated to discharge \nhis duties in good faith, with due care, and in a manner consistent with \nBattleground’s best interests.  N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 55-8-30 (a), 55-8-42(a). \n{158} As noted earlier, these statutory obligations are intended to prevent those \nin control of a corporation from profiting at the expense of those in the minority.  In \nthis case, however, there were no other shareholders to whom Mark McGeough \nowed a duty of loyalty. \n{159} Thus, to hold that Mark McGeough breached a fiduciary duty would mean \nonly that he breached a duty to himself.  Because this conclusion is a non sequitur, \nthe Court declines to adopt it.  See In re Safety Int’l Inc., 775 F.2d 660, 662 (5th Cir. \n1985) (finding no breach of fiduciary duty for alleged usurpation of corporate \n  \n \n \nopportunity where the only two shareholders of the corporation ratified the \ntransaction and no creditors were prejudiced); In re Tufts Electronics, Inc., 746 F.2d \n915, 917 (1st Cir. 1984) (holding that the sole shareholder, president, and director of \ncorporation “cannot be accused of defrauding or concealing information from himself \n. . .”); In re Mediators, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7639, at*26–27 (S.D.N.Y. June 4, \n1996) (citing Tufts for the proposition that a corporation cannot assert a claim for \ndiversion of a corporate opportunity where the sole shareholder consented to the \nsame); \nComm. of Unsecured Creditors of Specialty Plastic v. Doemling, 127 B.R. \n945, 952 (W.D. Pa. 1991) (holding that absent harm to a corporate creditor, the \npresident and sole shareholder of a corporation does not breach his fiduciary duty to \nthe corporation by usurping a corporate opportunity because, as sole shareholder, \nhe necessarily “consented to his own acquisition of the opportunity”); Pittman v. \nAm. Metal Forming Corp., 649 A.2d 356, 359 (Md. 1994) (holding that a sole \nshareholder is not liable for usurpation of corporate opportunity when no minority \nshareholders or creditors are harmed).   \n{160} Similarly, even if Sarah McGeough owed a fiduciary duty to Battleground, \nshe cannot be liable for a breach of said duty when the company’s sole shareholder \napproved her actions. \n{161} Accordingly, the Court GRANTS summary judgment for Defendants as to \nthis claim.     \nD. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION-AIDING AND ABETTING \nBREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY \n \n{162} The Court also GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to \nthe claim alleging aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.  Even assuming \nsuch a claim exists under North Carolina law, liability for aiding and abetting \npresupposes that the principals are liable for the underlying tort.  The Court having \nalready determined otherwise, this claim fails as a matter of law.   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nE. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION-MISAPPROPRIATION OF \nTRADE SECRETS \n \n{163} Plaintiffs’ allege in their Fifth Cause of Action that Defendants \nmisappropriated Battleground’s client mailing lists and records, information that \nPlaintiffs insist warrants protection under the TSPA.   \n{164} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on this \nclaim.  \n{165} The Court concludes that VetCor has no claim for trade secrets protection \nas the confidential information at issue in this case belongs only to Battleground.  \n{166} As to Battleground’s claim, the TSPA defines a trade secret as business or \ntechnical information that “derives independent actual or potential commercial \nvalue from not being generally known or readily ascertainable through independent \ndevelopment . . . and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152(3)(a)–(b). \n{167} A significant factor in determining whether certain information is \nproperly classified as a trade secret is “the ease or difficulty with which the \ninformation could properly be acquired or duplicated” by lawful means.  \nWilmington \nStar News v. New Hanover Reg. Med. Ctr., 125 N.C. App. 174, 182, 480 S.E.2d 53, \n57 (1997). \n{168} Moreover, a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets will lie only where \nthe information is acquired, disclosed, or used “without express or implied authority \nor consent . . . .”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152(1) (emphasis added).   \n{169} The Court doubts that Defendants’ use of a client mailing list, standing \nalone, is sufficient to make out a TSPA claim, as it appears Defendants could have \neasily replicated this information through lawful means.  See Novacare Orthotics & \nProsthetics E., Inc. v. Speelman, 137 N.C. App. 471, 478, 528 S.E.2d 918, 922 (2000) \n(holding that a mailing list is not a trade secret where the information is easily \nretrievable through a local telephone book). \n  \n \n \n{170}  Battleground appears to stand on firmer footing as to Defendants’ use of \nits records regarding client spending patterns, as Defendants would be hard-pressed \nto show that such information could be duplicated or retrieved by lawful means. \n{171} Unfortunately for Battleground, the alleged “misappropriation” of this \ninformation occurred with the active acquiescence and consent of Mark McGeough, \nwho was in sole control of Battleground until 23 July 2005 and who remained its \nsole shareholder until 18 August 2005, a full two weeks after Defendants opened \ntheir new veterinary practice. \n{172} Accordingly, as with its claim alleging breach of fiduciary duty, on these \nfacts, Battleground’s TSPA claim fails as a matter of law.   \nF. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION-UDTPA CLAIM \n{173} Read narrowly, Plaintiffs’ Fourth Cause of Action alleging a UDTPA claim \nis premised on the same facts supporting its claim that Defendants misappropriated \ncertain trade secrets. \n{174} The Court has already determined Defendants are entitled to summary \njudgment as to Plaintiffs’ trade secrets claim.  Accordingly, it would normally \ndismiss this claim as well. \n{175} Summary judgment, however, is a drastic remedy that should be granted \ncautiously.  To that end, the Court must apply an indulgent standard to a party’s  \nclaim and dismiss it only where there is no ground for recovery as a matter of law.  \nLincoln v. Beuche, 166 N.C. App. 150, 155, 601 S.E.2d 237, 243 (2004). \n{176} Here, there remains a genuine issue for trial as to VetCor’s claim alleging \ntortious interference with contract.16  Because a claim alleging tortious interference \nwith contract is also sufficient to make out a UDTPA violation, see Roane-Barker v. \nSe. Hosp. Supply Corp., 99 N.C. App. 30, 41, 392 S.E.2d 663, 670 (1990), VetCor’s \nUDTPA claim also survives summary judgment, unless there is some other ground \nfor dismissing it.   \n                                                 \n16 Because Battleground’s other substantive claims have all been dismissed, it has no grounds for \npursuing a UDTPA claim. \n  \n \n \n{177} Defendants contend that dismissal of the UDTPA claim is appropriate \nbecause their conduct is protected by the statute’s learned professional exemption.   \n{178} Plaintiffs do not dispute that Defendants, as veterinarians, are members \nof a learned profession.  The question then is whether Defendants’ alleged tortious \ninterference with VetCor’s contract rights involves the rendering of veterinary \nservices.   \n{179} In Reid v. Ayers, 138 N.C. App. 261, 531 S.E.2d 231 (2000), the Court of \nAppeals applied the learned professional exemption to dismiss a UDTPA claim \nlodged against an attorney whose practice encompassed debt collection.  According \nto the court,  \n[d]ebt collection, along with the collection of any attorney's fees \nincurred as a penalty, is a necessary part of the practice of debtor-\ncreditor law.  Because defendants were engaged in that very \npractice here, they were rendering a professional legal service. \nAccordingly, their acts fall within the learned profession exemption.   \n \nId. at 267, 531 S.E.2d at 236. \n \n{180} The court in Reid, however, noted an outer limit to the scope of the \nlearned professional exemption.  First, the court emphasized that “[a]dvertising is \nnot an essential component of the rendering of legal services and thus would fall \noutside the exemption.”  Id.  Second, while eschewing a bright line test, the court \noffered the following analysis: \n[W]e think that the exemption applies anytime an attorney or law \nfirm is acting within the scope of the traditional attorney-client \nrole.  It would not apply when the attorney or law firm is engaged \nin the entrepreneurial aspects of legal practice that are geared \nmore towards their own interests, as opposed to the interests of \ntheir clients. \nId. \n{181} Left unclear is the result that obtains where, as is the case here, the \nevidence as to a professional’s conduct admits of two motives. \n{182} On the one hand, Plaintiffs’ evidence is that Defendants induced each \nother to unlawfully interfere with VetCor’s contract rights by (1) developing a \n  \n \n \ncompeting practice, (2) soliciting Battleground’s clients and employees, and (3) \nmisappropriating Battleground’s client list and associated records to market the \nopening of their new practice.  These acts, according to Plaintiffs, have nothing \nwhatever to do with the rendering of professional services.   \n{183} Conversely, Defendants’ evidence is they had developed long-standing \nprofessional relationships with the clients they saw while working for Battleground, \nand their actions in developing and marketing their new practice (while obviously \nbenefiting their own interests) also gave these clients an opportunity to make the \nbest choice for their veterinary needs. \n{184} Reid does not address the legitimacy of a professional’s conduct on these \nfacts.  Because the law on this issue is not settled, and because there remains a \ngenuine issue of material fact as to Defendants’ liability for tortious interference \nwith contract, the Court defers ruling on this issue until trial.  \n{185} Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary \njudgment as to Battleground’s Fourth Cause of Action, but otherwise DENIES the \nparties’ cross-motions for summary judgment as to the claim.  \nG. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION-CIVIL CONSPIRACY \n{186} As with the claim alleging a violation of the UDTPA, Plaintiffs’ allegation \nof civil conspiracy focuses on the same facts supporting their claim that Defendants \nmisappropriated trade secrets. \n{187} Applying an indulgent standard to this allegation, however, the Court \nDENIES Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to VetCor’s civil conspiracy \nclaim, as a jury could find an agreement between the Defendants to interfere with \nVetCor’s contract rights.   \n{188} The Court having dismissed all of Battleground’s substantive claims in \nthis case, it GRANTS Defendants’ motion as to Battleground’s claim of civil \nconspiracy.    \n \n \n  \n \n \nVIII. \nCONCLUSION \n{189} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all \nclaims alleged by Battleground. \n{190} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to \nVetCor’s Second and Third Causes of Action alleging breach of fiduciary duty and \naiding and abetting the same.   \n{191} The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to \nVetCor’s Fifth Cause of Action alleging misappropriation of trade secrets.   \n{192} In all other respects, the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment are \nDENIED.  \n \n \nThis the 19th day of October, 2007. \n         \n  \n \n "
