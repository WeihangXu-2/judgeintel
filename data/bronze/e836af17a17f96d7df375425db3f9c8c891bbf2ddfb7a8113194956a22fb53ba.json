  "raw_text": "Rickenbaugh v. Power Home Solar, LLC, 2019 NCBC 79. \n \n \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n19 CVS 244 \n \nJAMES RICKENBAUGH; and \nMARY RICKENBAUGH, \nIndividually and on Behalf of all \nOthers Similarly Situated, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nPOWER HOME SOLAR, LLC, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION ON \nDEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS \nOR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, TO \nCOMPEL BILATERAL ARBITRATION \nAND STAY PROCEEDINGS \n \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court upon Defendant Power Home Solar, \nLLC’s (“Power Home”) Motion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, to Compel Bilateral \nArbitration and Stay Proceedings (the “Motion”).  (ECF No. 15.) \n2. After considering the Motion, the related briefs, and the arguments of \ncounsel, the Court hereby DENIES the Motion , DEFERS to an arbitrator to be \nselected by the parties the determination of the availability of class arbitration for \nthe claims Plaintiffs James (“James”) and Mary (“Mary”) Rickenbaugh (together, the \n“Rickenbaughs”) have asserted in this action , ORDERS all claims  asserted by \nPlaintiffs to arbitration, and STAYS litigation of Plaintiffs’ claims in this civil action \npending the outcome of arbitration proceedings between the parties. \nWeaver, Bennett & Bland, P.A., by Matthew M. Villmer and Bo Caudill, \nfor Plaintiffs James and Mary Rickenbaugh. \n \nThe Law Office of B. Elizabeth Todd, PLLC, by Elizabeth Todd; Womble \nBond Dickinson (US) LLP, by James P. Cooney; DarrowEverett LLP, by \nDavid A. Sullivan, for Defendant Power Home Solar LLC. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge.   \n \n \nI. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n3. Power Home is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place \nof business in Mooresville, North Carolina .  The company is one of the largest solar \ninstallation companies in the United States and operates in North Carolina, South \nCarolina, Virginia, Ohio, and Michigan.   ( Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 1, 3, 14–15, ECF \nNo. 3.) \n4. The Rickenbaughs  are residents of Mecklenburg County .  In 2017, they  \nagreed to have Power Home install its standard energy savings package, including a \nNEST thermostat, ten LED lightbulbs, blown attic insulation, a hot water heater \n“blanket,” and twelve solar panels at their residence and at a detached building that \nserved as a home office in Charlotte, North Carolina.  (Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 16, 25, \n30, 32.) \n5. According to the Rickenbaughs, Power Home’s sales process was designed \nto make customers believe they would experience a “guaranteed drop in their energy \nbills” of between 80% and 99% over the 25 -year lifespan of the  Power Home solar \nenergy system.  ( Class Action Compl. ¶ 21.)   They allege that t he Power Home \nrepresentative they spoke with advised that the standard energy savings package \nthey eventually purchased “was guaranteed to save [them]  at least 97% on their \nenergy bills, and any bill from Duke Energy would be a nominal amount.”  ( Class \nAction Compl. ¶ 30.)  Based on these representations, on February 21, 2017 , James, \nwith Mary ’s consent, agreed to pay $15,708 for Power Home’s energy savings \n \n \npackage.  (Class Action Compl. ¶ 32, Ex. A.)  James and Power Home’s representative \nelectronically signed Power Home’s standard purchase contract (the “Agreement”) to \neffect the transaction.  (Class Action Compl. ¶ 32, Ex. A.) \n6. Of significance here, the Agreement contained the following provision titled \n“Arbitration of Disputes”:  \nIn the event of any dispute the parties will work together in good faith \nto resolve any issues.  If such issues cannot be resolved, the parties agree \nthat any dispute arising out of or relating to the negotiation, award, \nconstruction, performance or non -performance, of any aspect of this \nagreement, shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with \nthe Construction Industry Rules of the American Arbitration \nAssociation and judgment upon the award rendered by any such \narbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. \n \nNOTICE: BY INITIALING IN THE SPACE BELOW YOU ARE \nAGREEING TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THE \nMATTERS INCLUDED IN THE “ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES” \nPROVISION DECIDED BY NEUTRAL ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED \nBY NORTH CAROLINA & SOUTH CAROLINA LAW AND YOU ARE \nGIVING UP ANY RIGHTS YOU MIGHT POSSESS TO HAVE THE \nDISPUTE LITIGATED IN A COURT OF JURY TRIAL.  BY \nINITIALING IN THE SPACE BELOW YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR \nJUDICIAL RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL, UNLESS THOSE \nRIGHTS ARE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IN THE “ARBITRATION \nOF DISPUTES” PROVISION.  IF YOU REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO \nARBITRATION AFTER AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, YOU MAY \nBE COMPLELLED [sic] TO ARBITRATE UNDER THE AUTHORITY \nOF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE OR OTHER \nAPPLICABLE LAWS, YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE ARBITRATION \nPROVISION IS VOLUNTARY.  WE HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND \nTHE FOREGOING AND AGREE TO SUBMIT DISPUTES ARISING \nOUT OF THE M ATTER INCLUDED IN THE “ARBITRATION OF \nDISPUTES” PROVISION OF NEUTRAL ARBITRATION. \n \n(Class Action Compl. Ex. A. ¶ 13.)   \n7. Between February and April 2017, Power Home installed its energy \nefficiency products at the Rickenbaughs’ residence and home office, and on April 11, \n \n \n2017, the newly installed solar panels were activated.  (Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 33–\n34.)  The Rickenbaughs allege that the actual energy savings reflected in their power \nbills for May and June 2017 were only “a fraction” of the 97% energy savings promised \nby Power Home.  (Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 30, 35–36.)  The Rickenbaughs complained \nto a Power Home representative, and they allege in this lawsuit that Power Home \nrefused to provide the promise d energy savings or otherwise afford them a remedy.  \n(Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 37–40.)   \n8. The Rickenbaughs commenced this action  on January 7, 2019 “ as \nrepresentatives of all others similarly situated under the provisions of Rule 23(a) of \nthe North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure[.]”  (Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 41–43.)  They \nassert claims against Power Home for common law fraud and fraud in the \ninducement, unfair and deceptive trade practices  under N.C.G.S. § 75-1.1, breach of \ncontract, punitive damages, and unjust enrichment.  (See Class Action Compl.)  The \nRickenbaughs allege that other members of the purported class include homeowners \nin the states in which Power Home does business and “in other places throughout the \nUnited States[,]” thus creating a class that could be made up of more than 10,000 \npeople.  (Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 59–60.)   \n9. On March 26, 2019, Power Home filed the Motion with supporting brief, \ncontending that  the Agreement requires that the Rickenbaughs’ claims be \nadjudicated through bilateral arbitration.  (ECF Nos. 15–17.)  The Motion was fully \nbriefed and came on for hearing before the Court on May 10, 2019.  The Court \nthereafter entered a stay of these proceedings under N.C.G.S. § 1 -569.7(f) pending \n \n \nthe Court’s determination of the Motion and requested supplemental briefing.  (ECF \nNo. 31.)  Supplemental briefing was completed on June 10, 2019.  (ECF Nos. 32–35.) \n10. The Motion has been fully briefed and is now ripe for resolution.   \nII. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nA. Applicable Law \n11. “[I]t is incumbent upon a trial court when considering a motion to compel \narbitration to ‘ address whether the Federal Arbitration Act ( “FAA”) or the North \nCarolina Revised Uniform Arbitration Act [( “NCRUAA”)] applies’ to any agreement \nto arbitrate.”  King v. Bryant , 225 N.C. App. 340, 344, 737 S.E.2d 802, 806 (2013)  \n(quoting Cornelius v. Lipscomb , 224 N.C. App. 14, 18, 734 S.E.2d 870, 872 (2012) ).  \n“Determining whether the FAA applies ‘ is critical because the FAA preempts \nconflicting state law[.]’ ”  Epic Games, Inc. v. Murphy-Johnson, 247 N.C. App. 54, 60, \n785 S.E.2d 137, 142 (2016)  (quoting Sillins v. Ness, 164 N.C. App. 755, 757 –58, 596 \nS.E.2d 874, 876 (2004)).  A “trial court should . . . address[ ] the issue of choice of law \nbefore addressing any other legal issue.”  Bailey v. Ford Motor Co., 244 N.C. App. 346, \n350, 780 S.E.2d 920, 924 (2015). \n12. The Agreement here provides that covered disputes will be resolved by \narbitration “AS PROVIDED BY NORTH CAROLINA & SOUTH CAROLINA LAW[,]”  \n(Class Action Compl. Ex. A ¶ 13), suggesting that the parties agreed that either the \nNCRUAA or the South Carolina Arbitration Act, as appropriate, should apply to the \napplication and interpretation of the arbitration provision in the Agreement.   \n \n \nDefendant argues, however, that the FAA should govern  the arbitration provision \ndespite the parties’ choice of law .  (Def.’s Brief Supp. Mot. Dismiss or , Alternative, \nCompel Bilateral Arbitration &  Stay Proceedings [hereinafter “Def.’s Brief ISO”] 6 –\n7, ECF No. 16.)  The Court agrees. \n13. The FAA applies to any “contract evidencing a transaction involving \ncommerce[.]”  9 U.S.C. § 2 (2012).  As used here, “the word ‘involving’ is broad and is \nindeed the functional equivalent of ‘affecting[,]’ ” which “signals an intent to exercise \nCongress’ commerce power to the full.”  Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 \nU.S. 265, 273–74, 277 (1995).  T he phrase “a contract evidencing a transaction \ninvolving commerce” requires only that the transaction involve interstate commerce; \nthe parties to the transaction need not “contemplate” an interstate commerce \nconnection.  Id. at 278–81.  Here , Plaintiffs are residents of North Carolina, and \nPower Home is a limited liability company organized in Delaware that operates from \nits North Carolina  principal place of business .  ( Def.’s Brief ISO 7 ; Class Action \nCompl. ¶ 14–16.)  According to Plaintiffs, Power Home “operates a sophisticated and \nfraudulent scheme throughout the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, \nOhio, and Michigan .”  (Def.’s Brief ISO 7 ; Class Action Compl. ¶ 1 .)  Plaintiffs’ \nproposed class consists of Power Home customers who reside in those states and “in \nother places throughout the United States and its territories” who purchased Power \nHome’s energy efficiency equipment in reliance on Power Home’s guarantee of \nsubstantial energy savings.  (Def.’s Brief ISO 7; Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 59–60.)   \n \n \n14. Although “the mere circumstance of diversity of citizenship between [the \nparties] is not sufficient to command the application of the [FAA],” Maxum Founds., \nInc. v. Salus Corp., 779 F.2d 974, 978 n.4 (4th Cir. 1985), Plaintiffs’ claims are based \non more, including Power Home’s sale and installation of its energy efficiency system \nto customers inside and outside North Carolina and its allegedly fraudulent scheme \nto deceive customers in at least five states.   Although denying Plaintiffs ’ claims, \nPower Home does not deny that its conduct at issue occurred both inside and outside \nNorth Carolina.  As such , the Court concludes that the arbitration provision here is \n“[a] written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving [interstate] \ncommerce” under 9 U.S.C. § 2  and thus that the FAA applies .  See, e.g.,  Martin & \nJones, PLLC v. Olson, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 87, at *5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 25, 2017) \n(“The FAA applies to ‘a written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction \ninvolving [ interstate] commerce  to settle by arbitration  a controversy thereafter \narising out of such contract or transaction.’ ”  (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 2)); see also Benezra \nv. Zacks Inv. Research, Inc., No. 1:11-CV-596, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47769, at *7 n.1 \n(M.D.N.C. Mar. 30, 2012) (“The parties reside in different states, and the transactions \n. . . were conducted across state lines through interstate commerce.”).   \n15. The parties’ choice of law provision in the Agreement does not change th is \nresult.  The Supreme Court of North Carolina has held that “where the FAA applies \nto a particular contract, the FAA supersedes conflicting state law even if the contract \nhas a choice of law provision.”  AP Atl., Inc. v. Crescent Univ. City Venture, LLC, 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 60, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 28, 2016); see also, e.g., Burke Co. Pub. \n \n \nSch. Bd. of Educ. v. Shaver P’ship, 303 N.C. 408, 424, 279 S.E.2d 816, 825 (1981)  \n(holding “the choice of law provision in the contract does not preclude application of \nthe [FAA]”).  Even so, “when [as here] the FAA governs a dispute, state law fills \nprocedural gaps in the FAA as it is applied in state courts.”  Worldwide Ins. Network \nv. Messer Fin. Grp. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 2, 2018) \n(quoting Gaylor, Inc. v. Vizor, LLC , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 102, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 30, 2015)). \nB. Arbitrability \n16. “Arbitration, in various aspects, is governed by both state and federal law.”  \nForshaw Indus. v. Insurco, Ltd., 2 F. Supp. 3d 772, 786 (W.D.N.C. 2014).  “[S]tate law \ngovern[s] the formation of contracts  [while] giving due regard to the federal policy \nfavoring arbitration.”  Local Soc., Inc. v. Stallings, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 94, at *13 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Oct. 9, 2017).  Disputes over arbitrability require a two-step inquiry: “First, \n[courts] determine who decides whether a particular dispute is arbitrable: the \narbitrator or the court.  Second, if [the court] concludes that the court is the proper \nforum in which to adjudicate arbitrability, [the court] then decides whether the \ndispute is, in fact, arbitrable.”  Gaylor , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 102, at *14 (emphasis \nomitted) (quoting Peabody Holding Co., LLC v. UMW, 665 F.3d 96, 101 (4th Cir. \n2012)).  “To determine if a particular dispute is subject to  arbitration, [a trial court] \nmust examine the language of the agreement, including the  arbitration clause in \nparticular, and determine if the dispute falls within its scope.”  Fontana v. S.E. \nAnesthesiology, 221 N.C. App. 582, 589, 729 S.E.2d 80, 86 (2012) (citation omitted).  \n \n \n“[C]ourts must enforce arbitration contracts according to their terms.”  Henry Schein, \nInc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 524, 529 (2019).   \n17. In determining whether a court or an arbitrator decides arbitrability, \n“[c]ourts distinguish between issues of procedural arbitrability, on the one hand, and \nissues of substantive arbitrability, on the other hand.”  Stallings, 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n94, at *14.  “[Q]uestions such as ‘whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration \nclause,’ or ‘whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to \na particular type of controversy’ ” are those of “substantive arbitrability.”  Bailey, 244 \nN.C. App. at 351, 780 S.E.2d at 925 (quoting BG Grp. PLC v. Republic of Argentina, \n572 U.S. 25, 34  (2014)).  T here is a presumption that “ issues of substantive \narbitrability . . . are for a court to decide[ .]”  Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, 537 \nU.S. 79, 85 (2002); see also Glass v. Kidder Peabody & Co., Inc. , 114 F.3d 446, 453–\n54 (4th Cir. 1997) (“It is clear from . . . over thirty years of Supreme Court and federal \ncircuit court precedent that  issues of ‘ substantive arbitrability’ are for the court to \ndecide, and questions of ‘ procedural arbitrability [ ]’  . . .  are for the arbitrator to \ndecide.”).   \n18. “But ‘parties can, and often do, delegate arbitrability to the arbitrator. ’ ”  \nCherokee South End, LLC v. PAP Invs. Scaleybark, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 106, at \n*7 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 12, 2018) (quoting Charlotte Student Hous. DST v. Choate \nConstr. Co., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 88, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 24, 2018) ).  “Just as \nthe arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed \nto arbitrate that dispute, . . . the question ‘ who has the primary power to decide \n \n \narbitrability’ turns upon what the parties agreed about that  matter.”  First Options  \nof Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995); see also Henry Schein, 139 S. Ct. \nat 527.  The presumption that a court will decide issues of substantive arbitrability \ncan be overcome if “there is ‘clear and unmistakable’ evidence that the parties agreed \nto ‘submit the question of arbitrability to arbitration.’ ”  Cold Springs Ventures, LLC \nv. Gilead Scis. , Inc., 2014 NCBC LEXIS 10, at *9 (N.C. Super.  Ct. Mar. 26, 2014) \n(quoting First Options, 514 U.S. at 944–47); see also Bailey, 244 N.C. App. at 352–53, \n780 S.E.2d at 925 (“A party can overcome this presumption if it shows that the parties \n‘clearly and unmistakably ’ intended for an arbitrator, instead of a court, to decide \nissues of substantive arbitrability.”). \n19. Under the FAA, “the parties’ express adoption of an arbitral body’s rules in \ntheir agreement, which delegate questions of substantive arbitrability to the \narbitrator, presents clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to \narbitrate questions of substantive arbitrability.”  Bailey , 244 N.C. App. at  353, 780 \nS.E.2d at 926.  “ ‘[V]irtually every [federal] circuit to have considered the issue ’ has \nheld that incorporation of the AAA Rules into an arbitration agreement serves as  \nclear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability. ”  \nWorldwide Ins. Network, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 103, at *8–9 (quoting Oracle Am., Inc. \nv. Myriad Grp. A.G., 724 F.3d 1069, 1074 (9th Cir. 2013) ); see also Petrofac, Inc. v. \nDynMcDermott Petro. Operations Co., 687 F.3d 671, 675 (5th Cir. 2012) (holding “the \nexpress adoption of [AAA]  rules presents clear and unmistakable evidence that the \nparties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability”); Fallo v. High-Tech Inst., 559 F.3d 874, 878 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2009) (same); Qualcomm Inc. v. Nokia Corp., 466 F.3d 1366, 1373 (Fed. Cir. \n2006) (same), abrogated on other grounds by Henry Schein, 139 S. Ct. 524; Terminix \nInt’l v. Palmer Ranch Ltd. P ’ship, 432 F.3d 1327, 1332– 33 (11th Cir. 2005)  (same); \nContec Corp. v. Remote Sol. Co., 398 F.3d 205, 208 (2d Cir. 2005) (same).   \n20. In this case, “the parties agree[d] that any dispute arising out of or relating \nto the negotiation, award, construction, performance or non -performance, of any \naspect of this agreement , shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with \nthe Construction Industry Rules of the American Arbitration Association [.]”  (Class \nAction Compl. Ex. A ¶ 13  (emphasis added).)  This provision and the AAA Rule it \nincorporates are nearly identical to the arbitration provision and incorporated AAA \nRule the Court of Appeals considered in Epic Games:  “Any disputes between \nEmployee and Epic in any way concerning . . . this Agreement . . . shall be submitted \n. . . to mandatory arbitration before a single arbitrator and conducted pursuant to the \nrules of the [AAA]  applicable to the  arbitration of employment disputes then in \neffect[.]”  247 N.C. App.  at 62–63, 785 S.E.2d at 143 ( emphasis added) .  The \nincorporated rule here (Rule 9(a) of the AAA Construction Rules) and the one in Epic \nGames (Rule 6(a) of the AAA Employment Rule s) both provide that “[t]he arbitrator \nshall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction , including any objections \nwith respect to the existence,  scope or validity of the arbitration agreement. ” \n(emphasis added). \n21. The Court of Appeals concl uded that the provision and incorporated AAA \nrule in Epic Games provided “clear and unmistakable evidence” that the parties had \n \n \nagreed that an arbitrator would determine issues of substantive arbitrabilit y.  247 \nN.C. App. at 64, 785 S.E.2d at 144.  The Court deems itself bound by that \ndetermination, given that the provision and incorporated AAA rule at issue now are \nnearly identical.  As in Epic Games, even if the broad language of the Agreement “by \nitself[ ] does not resolve the issue of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate [issues of \nsubstantive] arbitrability, the requirement for arbitration to be conducted pursuant \nto the AAA rules does.”  Id.; see also Bailey, 244 N.C. App. at 355 –56, 780 S.E.2d at \n927 (holding an agreement incorporating a sub stantially similar rule  indicated \nparties delegated issues of substantive arbitrability to the arbitrator); Hall v. Dancy, \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 63, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 27, 2018) (holding the same for an \nagreement incorporating a rule with the same language  as the AAA Construction \nRule); Cherokee South End, LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 106, at *8 (same); AP Atl., 2016 \nNCBC LEXIS 60, at *14 –15 (holding the same for an agreement incorporating the \nsame AAA Construction Rule).  \nC. Class Arbitration \n22. The issue for decision on this Motion thus becomes whether the availability \nof class arbitration is an issue of “ substantive arbitrability” the parties have agreed \nan arbitrator must decide or an issue that presumptively remains for the Court.  This \nquestion has been consistently left open by the United States Supreme Court, see \nLamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 139 S. Ct. 1407, 1417 n.4 (2019); Oxford Health Plans \nLLC v. Sutter , 569 U.S.  564, 569–70 n.2 (2013) ; Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds \nInt’l Corp., 559 U.S.  662, 678 (2010), although numerous federal circuit courts that \n \n \nhave addressed this question “ have concluded that class arbitrability is a gateway \nissue” that “presumptively must be decided by courts , not arbitrators[,]” 20/20 \nCommuns., Inc. v. Crawford, 930 F.3d 715, 718 (5th Cir. 2019) (listing cases); see also \nDel Webb Cmtys., Inc. v. Carlson, 817 F.3d 867, 875 (4th Cir. 2016) (“The evolution of \nthe [United States Supreme] Court ’s cases are but a short step away from the \nconclusion that whether an arbitration agreement authorizes class arbitration \npresents a question as to the arbitrator ’s inherent power, which requires judicial \nreview.”). \n23. In determining whether the availability of class arbitration is an issue of \nsubstantive arbitrability, courts have focused on the “significant distinctions between \nclass and bilateral arbitration[.]”  Del Webb Cmtys., 817 F.3d at 875; see also Lamps \nPlus, 139 S. Ct. at  1416 (“[I]t is important to recognize the ‘ fundamental’ difference \nbetween class arbitration and the individualized form of arbitration envisioned by \nthe FAA.”).  While “[i]n individual arbitration, ‘parties forgo the procedural rigor and \nappellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of priva te dispute \nresolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert \nadjudicators to resolve specialized disputes [,]’ ” Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at 1416 \n(quoting Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S.  at 685), class arbitration does not allow for those \nsame benefits.  “[Class arbitration] ‘sacrifices the principal advantage of arbitration—\nits informality —and makes the process slower, more costly, and more likely to \ngenerate procedural morass than final judgment.’ ”  Id. (quoting AT&T Mobility LLC \nv. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 348 (2011)); see also Del Webb Cmtys., 817 F.3d at 876 \n \n \n(observing that in class arbitration, “the arbitrator must determine, before ruling on \nthe merits, whether to certify the class, whether the named parties satisfy mandatory \nstandards of representation and commonality, how discovery will function, and how \nto bind absent class members”).  “Class arbitration not only ‘introduce[s] new risks \nand costs for both sides [ ] ’ . . . [but] also raises serious due process concerns by \nadjudicating the rights of absent members of the plaintiff class . . . with only limited \njudicial review.”  Lamps Plus, 139 S . Ct. at 1416 (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n138 S. Ct. 1612, 1623 (2018)); see also  Del Webb Cmtys., 817 F.3d at 875 (“The FAA, \nhowever, provides very limited grounds for vacating an arbitration award.  . . .  As a \nresult, ‘[t]he absence of multilayered review’ in arbitration ‘makes it more likely that \nerrors will go uncorrected.’ ” (quoting Concepcion, 563 U.S. at 350)).   \n24. Due to these fundamental differences, the United States Supreme Court has \nmade clear that “ a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class \narbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to \ndo so.”  Stolt -Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 684.  In particular, “[a]lthough parties are free to \nauthorize arbitrators to resolve [gateway] questions, [a court] will not conclude that \nthey have done so based on ‘silence or  ambiguity’ in their agreement, because ‘doing \nso might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would \nhave thought a judge, not an arbitrator, would decide. ’ ”  Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at \n1417 (quoting First Options, 514 U.S. at 945).  Moreover, “courts may not rely on state \ncontract principles to ‘reshape traditional individualized arbitration by mandating \n \n \nclasswide arbitration procedures without the parties’ consent.’ ”  Id. at 1418 (quoting \nEpic Sys. Corp., 138 S. Ct. at 1623).   \n25. Although recognizing that the Supreme Court has not address ed whether \nthe court or an arbitrator should determine the availability of class arbitration under \nan arbitration agreement, Defendant contends that “the threshold question involving \nan arbitrator’s inherent power to preside over an unknown and widespread class of \nparties . . . is such a fundamental and significant departure from individualized \narbitration that” an incorporation of the AAA Construction Rules in the parties’ \nAgreement, without more, cannot constitute clear an d unmistakable evidence that \nthe parties agreed for an arbitrator to decide the availability of class arbitra tion.  \n(Def.’s Suppl. Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss or, Alternative, Compel Bilateral Arbitration & \nStay Proceedings  14, ECF No. 26 .)  In contrast, Plaint iffs argue that  under Epic \nGames, the Court must conclude that the Agreement and its incorporation of the AAA \nConstruction Rules “clearly and unmistakably evidence [ ] the parties’ intention to \nhave the arbitrator . . . decide substantive issues, including class arbitrability.”  (Pls.’ \nSuppl. Br. Opp’n Def.’s Mot. Dismiss or, Alternative, Compel Bilateral Arbitration & \nStay Proceedings 3, ECF No. 27.)   \n26. The North Caroli na courts have not addressed whether a court or an \narbitrator should decide whether class arbitration is available under an arbitration \nagreement, and the federal circuit courts have split in answering that question.   \n27. The Second, Fifth, Tenth, and Elevent h Circuits have concluded that an \nagreement’s incorporation of AAA rules of the type in the Agreement here constitutes \n \n \n“clear and unmistakable evidence” of the parties’ intent to delegate the issue of the \navailability of class arbitration to the arbitrator : see Wells Fargo Advisors, LLC v. \nSappington, 884 F.3d 392, 397 (2d Cir. 2018) (holding that incorporation of AAA rules \nwithout more demonstrates “clear and unmistakable” intent for arbitrator to decide \narbitrability of class claims ); Reed v. Fl a. Metro. Univ., Inc. , 681 F.3d 630, 635– 36 \n(5th Cir. 2012) (holding that “agreement to AAA’s Commercial Rules also constitutes \n. . . a clear agreement to allow the arbitrator to decide whether the party’s agreement \nprovides for class arbitration ”), abrogated on other grounds by Sutter, 569 U.S.  564; \nDish Network L.L.C. v. Ray , 900 F.3d 1240, 1245 –48 (10th Cir. 2018)  (holding that \nan agreement incorporating AAA rules “ provides clear and unambiguous  evidence \nthat the parties intended to delegate all issues of arbitrability to the arbitrator [,]” \nincluding class arbitrability (emphasis in original)); JPay, Inc. v. Kobel, 904 F.3d 923, \n936–38 (11th Cir. 2018)  (holding incorporation of AAA rules “clearly and \nunmistakably give[s] the arbitrato r power to rule on his own jurisdiction, thus \ndelegating questions of arbitrability [of class claims] to the arbitrator”) .  In t hese \ncircuits, “if the arbitration agreement delegates  all questions of arbitrability to the \narbitrator, the issue [of class availability] is for the arbitrator, not the court.”  Fannie \nMae v. Prowant, 209 F. Supp. 3d 1295, 1311 (N.D. Ga. 2016) (emphasis in original).  \n28. The Third, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits have held otherwise, concluding that \nspecific contractual language, rather than broad AAA Rule incorporation, is \nnecessary to delegate a determination of the availability of class arbitration to an \narbitrator: see Chesapeake Appalachia, LLC v. Scout Petroleum, LLC, 809 F.3d 746, \n \n \n763 (3d Cir. 2016)  (declining to defer class arbitrability to arbitrator where \narbitration agreement lacked “ express contractual language unambiguously \ndelegating the question of class arbitrability to the arbitrators ” (citation omitted) ); \nReed Elsevier, Inc. v. Crockett, 734 F.3d 594, 599 (6th Cir. 2013) (declining to defer to \narbitrator where there was a “total absence of any reference to classwide arbitration \nin [the arbitration] clause” because “the agreement . . . can just as easily be read to \nspeak only to issues related to bilateral arbitration” and thus is “silent or ambiguous \nas to whether an arbitrator should determine the question of classwide arbitrability”); \nCatamaran Corp. v. Towncrest Pharmacy, 864 F.3d 966, 973 (8th Cir. 2017) (holding \nthat “a more particular delegation of the [class arbitration availability] issue than we \nmay otherwise deem sufficient in bilateral disputes” is necessary).  In these circuits, \n“to ‘clearly and unmistakably ’ delegate class availability to an arbitrator, the \nagreement must provide specific language to that effect, for example, ‘ all issues of \narbitrability, including whether the agreement provides for class claims, shall be \ndecided by the arbitrator.’ ”  Fannie Mae, 209 F. Supp. 3d at 1311.1 \n29. The fundamental issue for the Court, therefore, is whether there is clear and \nunmistakable evidence that the parties agreed that an arbitrator would decide \nwhether the parties agreed to class arbitration under the Agreement.   \n                                                 \n1 Although the parties each claim that the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Del Webb Cmtys. favors \ntheir preferred rule, the Court agrees with the Central District of California that “the Fourth \nCircuit in Dell [sic] Webb Communities . . . did not directly address th[e] issue” of “whether \nincorporation of the AAA’s model rules is sufficient to delegate the question of whether class-\nwide arbitration is permissible to an arbitrator.”  Guess?, Inc. v. Russell, No. 2:16-cv-00780-\nCAS(ASx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53765, at *15 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2016).  \n \n \n \n30. Here, t he part ies specifically agreed that “any dispute arising out of or \nrelating to the negotiation, award, construction, performance or non-performance, of \nany aspect of this agreement shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance \nwith the Construction Industry Rules of the American Arbitration Association[,]” \n(Class Action Compl. Ex. A ¶ 13) , and  Rule 9(a) of the AAA Construction Rules \nspecifically provides that “the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her \nown jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the . . . scope . . . of the \narbitration agreement[,]” (emphasis added).   \n31. “Although the AAA rules  do not contain class arbitration  procedures, such \nprocedures are provided for in the Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitration  \n[‘Supplementary Rules ’], which were enacted in October 2003.”  Chesapeake \nAppalachia, LLC v. Burkett , No. 3:13 -3073, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148442, at *16 \n(M.D. Pa. Oct. 17, 2014).  “By  their terms, the Supplementary Rules apply ‘to any \ndispute arising out of an agreement that provides for arbitration pursuant to any of \nthe rules of the [AAA] where a party submits a dispute to arbitration on behalf of or \nagainst a class or purported class, and shall supplement any other applicable AAA \nrules.’ ”  Id. (quoting AAA Supplementary Rule 1(a)) ; see also Reed, 681 F.3d at 635  \n(concluding that “the parties’ agreement to the AAA’s Commercial Rules also \nconstitutes consent to the Supplementary Rules”) .  Of particular relevance here, \nSupplementary Rule 3 states that “the arbitrator shall determine as a threshold \nmatter, in a reasoned, partial final award o n the construction of the arbitration \n \n \nclause, whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed \non behalf of or against a class[.]”   \n32. Epic Games and its progeny make clear that the parties’ incorporation of the \nAAA Rules into the Agreement constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the \nparties agreed to delegate issues of “substantive arbitrability ,” including issues of \nexistence, scope, or validity of the Agreement, to the arbitrator.  See, e.g., Hall, 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 63, at *6–7 (“Under either the FAA or the North Carolina Act, when \nthe parties ’ arbitration agreement specifically  incorporates the [AAA] rules, such  \nincorporation demonstrates that the parties clearly and unmistakably intended for \nthe arbitrator to resolve disputes [of substantive] arbitrability.”); see also Bailey, 244 \nN.C. App. at 355, 780 S.E.2d at 927 (concluding that the parties’ express adoption of \nan arbitral body’s rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties \nintended to arbitrate questions of substantive arbitrability). \n33. The question thus is whether the parties’ agreement, through the \nincorporation of the AAA Construction Rules  (and by that incorporation, the \nSupplementary Rules), that an arbitrator would decide the “scope” of the arbitration \nproceeding constitutes an agreement that the  arbitrator would determine whether \nclass arbitration is available  in that proceeding .  Giving the word “scope” its plain \nand ordinary meaning and considering it in the context in which it is used in the AAA \nRules, the Court concludes that it does.  Other courts have agreed.  See, e.g ., JPay, \n904 F.3d at 931  (“Formally, the question whether class arbitration is available will \ndetermine the scope of the arbitration proceedings.”); Reed, 681 F.3d at 635–36 (“The \n \n \nparties’ consent to the Supplementary Rules . . . constitutes a clear agreement to \nallow the arbitrato r to decide whether the party’s agreement provides  for class \narbitration.”); Burkett, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148442,  at *22 (holding that a rule \nvesting an arbitrator with authority to decide the scope of his or her own jurisdiction \nincludes “the issue of ‘who decides’ class arbitrability”).  \n34. Accordingly, since  the Court concludes that a determination of the \navailability of class arbitration necessarily involves a determination of the scope of \nthe arbitration, the Court  further concludes that the parties here clearly and \nunmistakably agreed in the Agreement that th is determination is for the arbitrator \nrather than the Court.  See, e.g., Awuah v. Coverall N. Am., Inc., 554 F.3d 7, 11 (1st \nCir. 2009) (holding that a rule providing that an ar bitrator may “ ‘rule on his or her \nown jurisdiction’ including any objection to the ‘existence, scope or validity of the \narbitration agreement[ ]’ . . . is about as ‘clear and unmistakable’ as language can \nget[.]”); Hedrick v. BNC Nat’l Bank , 186 F. Supp. 3d 1189, 1196 (D. Kan. 2016) \n(“These Rules state that ‘The Arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her \nown jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence,  scope or \nvalidity of the arbitration agreement.’  Thus, . . . the arbitrator must determine \nwhether class arbitration falls within the scope of the clause.” (emphasis added)).\n2    \n                                                 \n2 Although applying the FAA here, the Court concludes that the ruling on Defendant’s Motion \nwould be the same under either the FAA or the NCRUAA because, like in Epic Games, \n“[u]nder either law, the plain language of the  arbitration clause, properly interpreted, \ndelegates . . . threshold issue[s] of substantive arbitrability to the arbitrator - not to the trial \ncourt.”  247 N.C. App. at 61, 785 S.E.2d at 142.   \n \n \n \n35. In light of the foregoing, the Court does not address Defendant’s contention \nthat the arbitration agreement does not permit class arbitration.   See, e.g., Henry \nSchein, 139 S. Ct. at 531 (“When the parties’ contract delegates [a] question to an \narbitrator, the courts must respect the parties’ decision as embodied in the contract” \nand should not “confuse[ ] the question of who decides . . . with the separate question \nof who prevails[.]”); Robinson v. J & K Admin. Mgmt. Servs. , 817 F.3d 193, 198 (5th \nCir. 2016) (“[Defendant] may be right that the agreement does not allow class or \ncollective arbitration, but that is not the issue before the court.  The issue is who \ndecides if the arbitration agreement permits class or collective procedures.”).   \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n36. WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Court hereby DENIES \nDefendant’s Motion, and ORDERS as follows: \na. Plaintiffs’ claims asserted in this action are hereby ORDERED to \narbitration, the determination of whether class arbitration is available  \nis DEFERRED to a properly selected arbitrator, and the litigation of \nall claims in this civil action is hereby STAYED pending the outcome of \nthe arbitration proceedings between the parties. \nb. The parties shall notify the Court of the outcome of the arbitration \nproceedings within seven days after the arbitrator has issued his or her \ndecision.  Plaintiff shall submits to the Court a copy of the arbitrator ’s \n \n \ndecision accompanied by the parties ’ recommendations concerning \nfurther proceedings, if any, in this Court. \nSO ORDERED, this the 20th day of December, 2019. \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III    \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Chief Business Court Judge \n "
