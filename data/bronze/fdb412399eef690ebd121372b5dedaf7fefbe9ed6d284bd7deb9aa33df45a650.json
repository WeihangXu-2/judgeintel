Szulik, 2008 NCBC 2 \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \n SUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \nCOUNTY OF WAKE  FILE NO. 04 CVS 11746 \n \n \nANDREW EGELHOF, Derivatively on Behalf of \nRed Hat, Inc. \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nvs. \n \nMATTHEW J. SZULIK, KEVIN B. THOMPSON, \nPAUL J. CORMIER, TIMOTHY J. BUCKLEY, \nMARK H. WEBBINK, ALEX PINCHEV, \nROBERT F. YOUNG, EUGENE J. McDONALD, \nF. SELBY WELLMAN, MARYE A. FOX, \nWILLIAM S. KAISER, DR. STEVE ALBRECHT \nand H. HUGH SHELTON \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER ON MOTION FOR \nATTORNEY FEES \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION \n{1} This matter is before the Court on Defendants’ Motion for Attorneys’ \nFees filed after the Court granted Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  The Court \nhas concluded that it will not award attorney fees on the basis asserted by \nDefendants.  However, the Motion has brought to the Court’s attention \ncertain actions on the part of Mr. Egelhof, the shareholder representative, \nand his out-of-state counsel which are of sufficient concern to the Court that \nthe Court will enter non-monetary sanctions. \n \nRobbins Umeda & Fink, LLP by Brian J. Robbins, Jeffrey P. \nFink, and Steven R. Wedeking; Garlitz & Williamson, PLLC by \nF. Lane Williamson for Plaintiff Andrew Egelhof. \nWomble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice , PLLC by Pressly M. Millen \nand Christopher W. Jones; Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and \nDorr, LLP by Jeffrey B. Rudman, William H. Paine, and \nChristopher Davies for Defendants Matthew J. Szulik, Kevin B. \nThompson, Paul J. Cormier, Timothy J. Buckley, Mark H. \nWebbink, Alex Pinchev, Robert F. Young, Eugene J. McDonald, \nF. Selby Wellman, Marye A. Fox,  William S. Kaiser, Dr. W. \nSteve Albrecht, and H. Hugh Shelton. \n \nTennille, Judge. \n \n{2} This is a purported shareholder derivative action in which the \nfailure of counsel to communicate with their client in violation of the Rules of \nProfessional Conduct, the failure of the client to communicate with counsel in \ncontravention of his fiduciary duties, the needless rush to file a complaint, \nthe filing of defective pleadings, and the solicitation of a plaintiff unqualified \nto fulfill the significant duties of a plaintiff in a shareholder derivative action \nall converged to create a situation in which neither the firm nor the client \nfulfilled their duties and obligations. Confirming their slapdash approach to \nrepresentation, Plaintiff’s out of state counsel appeared and argued the \nmotion for sanctions without being admitted \npro hac vice (conduct \nconstituting the unauthorized practice of law in this state). \n{3} The above listing of Plaintiff’s counsel is problematic.  Mr. \nWilliamson signed the original and amended complaints as local counsel, but \ndid not draft the pleadings.  Mr. Robbins and Mr. Fink were listed as “of \ncounsel” along with their firm.1  Mr. Wedeking is the only lawyer in the firm \nto file a pro hac vice motion and be admitted to practice in North Carolina in \nthis case.  He appeared at the hearing on the motion to dismiss.  Mr. Fink \nappeared on behalf of Mr. Egelhof and actually argued the pending motion \nfor sanctions.  Mr. Robbins and Mr. Fink personally represented Mr. Egelhof \nin his deposition ordered by the Court which took place in Wichita, Kansas, \nwhere Mr. Egelhof then resided.  Mr. Fink and Mr. Robbins never filed \npro \nhac vice motions and were therefore never admitted to practice in North \nCarolina in this action.  Defendants have not moved for sanctions against Mr. \n                                                 \n1 References to the “firm” herein will refer to Robbins Umeda & Fink, LLP. \nWilliamson, and the conduct which concerns the Court is not attributable to \nhim.2  By appearing and arguing the sanctions motion, Mr. Fink has waived \nany defense that the Court does not have jurisdiction to sanction him.3  \nThrough the appearances of Mr. Wedeking and Mr. Fink, the firm has come \nunder the jurisdiction of the Court.  The Court can find no guidance on the \nissue of whether Mr. Robbins has appeared in this action by representing his \nclient in an out-of-state deposition of Plaintiff in a North Carolina action. The \nCourt concludes as a matter of law that he has made a sufficient appearance \nby signing as “of counsel” and defending Mr. Egelhof’s deposition.  Mr. \nWedeking and Mr. Fink both described Mr. Egelhof as Mr. Robbins’s client.  \nMessrs. Wedeking, Robbins, and Fink are all licensed to practice in \nCalifornia.\n4  \n                                                 \n2 The fact that sanctions have not been sought against Mr. Williamson, a member of the \nNorth Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission, does not mean that other North \nCarolina lawyers cannot learn from the position Mr. Williamson occupied in this matter.  \nHad Defendants’ counsel elected to do so, they could have pursued their remedies against \nlocal counsel, particularly in light of the failure to see that Mr. Fink was admitted pro hac \nvice.  Only local counsel signed the pleadings which are asserted to be in violation of Rule 11.  \nThe Court does not believe that it is the primary duty of local counsel to know and \ncommunicate with a client who has an established relationship with out-of-state counsel to \nthe same extent as the primary counsel.  The local lawyer’s role is more limited, and local \ncounsel should be able to rely on primary out-of-state counsel to communicate with the client.  \nWhere local counsel signs pleadings and briefs, they are representing to the Court that the \npositions taken therein have merit and that Rule 11 has been followed.  Local counsel would \nbe well advised to consider as a practical matter some of the things a court might consider in \nreviewing the pleadings.  Is there a real plaintiff capable of fulfilling his or her fiduciary \nduties?  Is the complaint being filed in a race to the courthouse?  Are the allegations based on \nknown facts or media stories?  Has there been any effort to review the books and records of \nthe company to support demand futility claims?  Are the claims meritorious, and are there \nallegations that would support a finding that red flags existed to warrant board action in a \nderivative case?  Is there clear precedent supporting or contrary to the positions taken? \n3 It is difficult for the Court to fault Mr. Williamson for permitting Mr. Fink to argue without \nbeing admitted pro hac vice when the Court failed to make any inquiry of his status when he \nrose to argue the motion for sanctions.  Nor did defense counsel raise any such issue. \n4 Information about the firm and its lawyers can be found at ruflaw.com. A fourth lawyer, \nMr. Louis A. Kerkhoff, apparently drafted the original complaint.  (Pl.’s Mem. Law Opp’n \nDefs.’ Mot. Att’ys’ Fees, Decl. Louis A. Kerkhoff Supp. Pl.’s Opp’n Defs.’Mot. Att’ys’ Fees ¶ 2.)  \nIn doing so it does not appear that he had any contact with Mr. Egelhof. (Pl.’s Mem. Law \nOpp’n Defs.’ Mot. Att’ys’ Fees, Decl. Louis A. Kerkhoff Supp. Pl.’s Opp’n Mot. Att’ys’ Fees ¶¶ \n2–3 (In listing the various tasks of organizing and analyzing information prior to drafting the \ncomplaint, Mr. Kerkhoff does not mention meeting or interviewing Mr. Egelhof.).)  Mr. \nKerkhoff was a third-year associate when he drafted the complaint, and Mr. Wedeking was a \nsecond-year associate when he came to argue the motion to dismiss.  Mr. Kerkhoff’s efforts in \n{4} The Robbins Umeda & Fink law firm has appeared in another \nrecent case before the Court captioned In Re Pozen Shareholders Litigation, \nOrange County,  04 CVS 1540 (hereinafter the “Pozen case”).  Mr. Williamson \nwas local counsel for the plaintiff in that case as well.  Mr. Wedeking \nappeared pro hac vice and argued the motion to dismiss.  Mr. Robbins and \nMr. Fink appeared as “of counsel.”  The Pozen case was also a shareholder \nderivative action.  Mr. Millen, counsel for Defendants in this case, also \nrepresented a different set of defendants in the Pozen case. The Pozen case \nwas dismissed for failure to adequately plead demand futility under \nDelaware law by Order dated November 10, 2005.  See In Re Pozen S’holders \nLitig., 2005 NCBC 7 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 10, 2005) \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2005%20NCBC%207.htm.  That \norder and its date have relevance to the issues in this case. \n{5} The original Complaint was a derivative action against Red Hat, \nInc. (“Red Hat”) and several of its officers and directors (“Defendants”).  \n(Compl. ¶ 1.)  The Complaint alleged that several of the named officers and \ndirectors engaged in insider trading, thereby breaching their fiduciary duty \nto Red Hat (Compl. ¶¶ 61–65) and that all Defendants breached their \nfiduciary duty to Red Hat (Compl. ¶¶ 66–71).  The Complaint alleged that the \nofficer and director Defendants abused their control of Red Hat (Compl. ¶¶ \n72–76), engaged in the “gross mismanagement” of Red Hat (Compl. ¶¶ 77–\n81), caused the waste of Red Hat’s corporate assets (Compl. ¶¶ 82–85), and \nwere unjustly enriched by those actions (Compl. ¶¶ 86–87).  In support of \nthese allegations, the Complaint cited heavily from press releases issued by \nRed Hat.  (Compl. ¶¶ 34–47.)  The Amended Complaint pled with more \nparticularity the actions of the officers and directors.  (Am. Compl.)  The \nAmended Complaint did not include any additional causes of action.  (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 124–51.)  Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended \n                                                                                                                                                 \ndrafting the complaint are detailed in his affidavit filed in support of Plaintiff’s opposition to \nthe motion for sanctions.  He has not been admitted pro hac vice. \nComplaint on September 29, 2005.  The motion was granted and the claims \ndismissed with prejudice by Order of Judge Tennille on March 13, 2006.  \n(Order ¶ 68.)  The Order dismissed the claims based on Mr. Egelhof’s loss of \nstanding as a shareholder and the Amended Complaint’s failure to establish \ndemand futility under Delaware law.  (Order ¶ 2.)   \n{6} According to statements made by Mr. Wedeking and Mr. Fink in \noral argument, the firm has a “shareholder relations department” which is \nevidently charged with communicating with clients who are serving as \nshareholder derivative or class action plaintiffs in lawsuits being handled by \nthe firm.  It is unclear if the shareholders relations department is populated \nby lawyers, legal assistants, or public relations personnel.  It was clear from \nstatements made by both Mr. Wedeking and Mr. Fink at oral argument that \nneither of them had ever met Mr. Egelhof nor knew anything about him.  Mr. \nWedeking did not know how many shares Mr. Egelfhof owned, and Mr. Fink \nerroneously represented to the Court that he owned hundreds of shares.  \n{7} When Mr. Wedeking appeared in this Court and knew absolutely \nnothing about his client, the Court requested that he at least find out how \nmany shares of Red Hat stock his client owned.  That request obviously \nprompted some inquiry  which produced the information that Mr. Egelhof \nwas no longer a shareholder, a fact communicated to the Court and counsel \nby e-mail.  When Mr. Fink appeared and argued the motion for sanctions, he \ndid not know much more than Mr. Wedeking about the client.  His excuse \nwas that Mr. Egelhof was originally Mr. Robbins’s client.  The Court ordered \nthat Mr. Egelhof’s deposition be taken. That deposition produced the facts \nwhich are of concern to the Court.  Mr. Robbins and Mr. Fink both defended \nMr. Egelhof’s deposition. \n{8} Defendants’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees has two possible grounds.  \nFirst, Defendants contend that both the original Complaint and the Amended \nComplaint defectively alleged demand futility and that the defect was known \nto Plaintiff before filing the Complaint or at the very least became \nabundantly clear with this Court’s ruling in Pozen.  For reasons set forth \nbelow, the Court declines to enter sanctions on the ground of defective \npleading of demand futility alone.  Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiff \nlost all standing to pursue this shareholder derivative action when he sold his \nstock on December 31, 2005, and that continuation of this lawsuit after that \ndate warrants the imposition of sanctions including attorney fees.5  \nDefendants are correct that some form of sanction is appropriate for the \nconduct of Plaintiff and his out-of-state counsel in connection with Mr. \nEgelhof’s failure to fulfill his fiduciary duties and his obligations to the Court.  \nHowever, the Court declines to award attorney fees as a part of the sanctions \nbecause of the timing involved. \n{9} With respect to the first basis for sanctions, the Court would decline \nto sanction Plaintiff and his counsel if defective pleading were the only \nground for concern in this action.  Demand futility under Delaware law has \ngenerated significant litigation and decisional law.  R. Franklin Balotti & \nJesse A. Finkelstein, \nThe Delaware Law of Corporations & Business \nOrganizations § 327.3 (6th ed. 2006).  It is an area fraught with difficulty and \nnot susceptible to bright-line tests.6   This Court’s opinion in Pozen \ndismissing the complaint for failure to adequately plead demand futility \nunder Delaware law did not plow new ground.  Pozen, 2005 NCBC 7 ¶ 2.  The \nCourt applied established Delaware principles.  Id. at ¶¶ 41–51.  It is true \nthat certain of the allegations in support of demand futility asserted on \n                                                 \n5 Defendants and Plaintiff both state that Mr. Egelhof sold his Red Hat shares on December \n31, 2005.  (Defs.’ Mem Law Supp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees 3; Pl.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. \nAtt’ys’ Fees 3.)  The Trade Confirmation from E*Trade Securities dated December 30, 2005, \nshows that Mr. Egelhof sold his shares on December 30, 2005.  (Egelhof Dep. Ex. 4, July 13, \n2006.)  The Court will refer to December 31, 2005, as the date of sale throughout the opinion. \n6 Unlike Delaware, North Carolina has elected to remove this additional layer of dispute \nfrom shareholder litigation by eliminating demand futility and requiring every shareholder \nto make demand upon the Board of Directors before filing a derivative action.  See N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 55-7-42 (statute no longer contains a demand futility exemption); see also Greene v. \nShoemaker, 1998 NCBC 4 ¶ 22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 24, 1998), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/1998%20NCBC%204.htm (“It is absolutely clear \nthat the legislature intended to adopt the universal demand requirement and eliminated the \nfutility exception . . . .”). \nbehalf of both the Pozen plaintiff and Mr. Egelhof by the Robbins Umeda & \nFink firm had been soundly rejected by the Delaware courts.  Id. at ¶¶ 41–81.  \nIt is further true that many of the allegations in this Complaint were not \ngrounded in fact but based on media reports or published analyst opinions \n(Compl. ¶¶ 36–60) and that the Delaware courts have frowned upon such \npleadings.  See Beam v. Stewart, 833 A.2d 961, 981–82 (Del. Ch. 2003) \n(noting with dissatisfaction the litigants’ reliance on media reports and \nmorning newspapers and failure to investigate records such as board \nminutes).  It is also true that this derivative action was filed in a needless \nrush to court, having been filed only thirty-one days after the restatement of \nincome by Red Hat7 and after a class action had already been filed on behalf \nof the shareholders.  (Defs.’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees 2 n.1.)  The \nComplaint in this action was also filed without any inspection of the books \nand records of the company that Delaware courts have repeatedly \nadmonished counsel to pursue.  See Beam, 833 A.2d at 981–82.  These \nshortcomings in the Complaint do raise red flags for the Court in connection \nwith the conduct of this litigation by Plaintiff’s counsel.  They demonstrate a \ndisregard for or lack of attention to the rules of procedure as well as court \ndecisions and admonitions.  However, the Court does not believe that the \ninitial pleadings in this case would, standing alone, support Rule 11 \nsanctions.  The test for demand futility under Delaware law is always fact \nspecific and contextual.  See Pozen, 2005 NCBC 7 ¶¶ 47–49 (discussing the \napplication of Delaware law to demand futility).  The application of the law is \ndone on a case-by-case basis.  It is, therefore, an area in which Rule 11 \nsanctions should be invoked sparingly and with caution.  \n{10} Timing is also a factor here.  The Complaint was filed August 18, \n2004.  The Amended Complaint was filed July 21, 2005.  Defendants’ Motion \n                                                 \n7 Red Hat restated earnings on July 19, 2004.  Carolyn Pritchard, Red Hat restates first-\nquarter earnings, CBS Marketwatch.com, July 19, 2004.  This complaint was filed August \n18, 2004.   \nto Dismiss was filed September 19, 2005.  Plaintiff’s response to the motion to \ndismiss was filed October 31, 2005.  The Order dismissing the Pozen case was \nentered November 10, 2005.  Defendants’ reply to Plaintiff’s response to the \nmotion to dismiss was filed November 15, 2005.  Mr. Egelhof sold his shares \nin Red Hat on December 31, 2005.  (Defs.’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees \n3; Pl.’s Mem. Law Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Att’ys’ Fees 3.)  Oral arguments on the \nmotion to dismiss were originally scheduled for December 20, 2005, but were \nheard February 2, 2006, upon Plaintiff’s motion.  The Order dismissing \nEgelhof was entered March 13, 2006. \n{11} The Court’s decision and order in Pozen was not entered until after \nthe original Egelhof Complaint and Amended Complaint were filed; therefore \nPlaintiff’s counsel did not have the benefit of that decision when drafting the \npleadings.  See supra ¶ 9.  What is significant for later analysis is that Mr. \nEgelhof was not informed of the decision which could have had a direct \nimpact on his case.  (Egelhof Dep. 84–85, July 13, 2006.)  That disregard is \nespecially important in light of the request by defense counsel that Plaintiff \nreconsider going forward with the litigation following the Pozen decision — a \nrequest that was not conveyed to Plaintiff.  (Egelhof Dep. 85–86, July 13, \n2006.)  It is also important in light of Mr. Wedeking’s admission at oral \nargument that there were no red flags to put the directors of Red Hat on \nnotice that they had any obligation to take any action with respect to the \nadvice provided by the company’s outside accountants.  (Defs.’ Mem. Law \nSupp. Mot. Att’ys’ Fees 3.)  The Court’s decision in Pozen focusing on the \nabsence of red flags as required by Delaware law and the admitted absence of \nsuch red flags in the case at bar were both clearly important information a \nfiduciary would need to know, especially in light of a formal request by \nDefendants to reconsider pursuing the lawsuit or face sanctions if it were \ndismissed.  Mr. Egelhof did not have that information, nor did the firm have \nthe information that Mr. Egelhof had sold his shares.  However, the firm \nshould have possessed that information and in all probability would have but \nfor its failure to inform Mr. Egelhof of the developments in his case.  The \ntiming has influenced the Court’s decision not to assess fees as a part of the \nsanctions.  The motion to dismiss was fully briefed when the Pozen decision \ncame out.  The time and effort that remained was the lawyers’ and the \nCourt’s time in preparing for and attending oral argument when the plaintiff \nhad lost standing. \n{12} It is significant that Mr. Egelhof possessed neither a significant \nownership interest in Red Hat nor any experience to prepare him to act as a \nfiduciary seeking recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of the \ncompany.  In 2004, Mr. Egelhof purchased twenty-eight shares of Red Hat \ncommon stock for which he paid $710.50.  (Egelhof Dep. Exs. 2, 3, July 13, \n2006.)  He sold those shares on December 31, 2005, for $756.98, earning a \nprofit of $46.48.  (Egelhof Dep. Ex. 4, July 13, 2006.)  His Red Hat holdings \nconstituted about 30% of his entire portfolio of $2,000 invested in his E-trade \naccount.  (Egelhof Dep. 91, July 13, 2006.)  Mr. Egelhof’s obvious concern was \nmaking a profit on his stock because he sold it as soon as he had a profit in \nit.8  In short, Mr. Egelhof did not have a significant financial interest in the \noutcome of this litigation.  While the size of ownership is not determinative of \nstanding, a potential plaintiff’s lack of a real financial stake in the litigation \nis a warning sign that he or she may not be willing or able to devote the time \nnecessary to fulfill the fiduciary obligations imposed by law on a shareholder \nderivative plaintiff.9  Even before the Complaint was filed, the firm had a \nlarger financial stake in the litigation than Mr. Egelhof. \n                                                 \n8 Mr. Egelhof testified that he was in debt, needed the money, and just forgot about the \nlawsuit when he sold his stock.  (Egelhof Dep. 41–42, July 13, 2006.)  He believes he signed \nsome letter saying he would hold on to his stock, but did not have a copy of it.  (Egelhof Dep. \n43–44, July 13, 2006.)   \n9 As Mr. Fink admitted in oral argument, those duties included supervising counsel.  The \nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”) created heightened pleading \nrequirements and more duties for the plaintiffs and their counsel in class action law suits.  \n15 USCS § 78u-4 (LEXIS through Jan. 7, 2008 legislation).  See Kafenbaum v. GTECH \nHoldings Corp., 217 F. Supp. 2d 238, 244–45 (R.I. 2002) (stating “a securities fraud complaint \nmust also satisfy the heightened pleading requirements contained in . . . the PSLRA”).  One \nof the purposes of the PSLRA is to ensure that class members’ interests are protected.  In re \n{13} Nor did Mr. Egelhof have the knowledge, background or experience \nto fulfill his fiduciary duties.  Although his testimony is somewhat ambiguous \non the point, it appears fairly clear that this Kansas resident responded to an \nInternet solicitation from a California law firm looking for a plaintiff in a \nNorth Carolina action.  (Egelhof Dep. 46–50, July 13, 2006.)  At the time, he \nwas twenty-four years old, had worked in various information technology \nroles at Kansas State University, and had a degree in business \nadministration.  (Egelhof Dep. 15–18, July 13, 2006.)  He had little investing \nexperience, no experience in litigation10, no prior connection with the San \nDiego law firm, no personal knowledge of Red Hat and its operations, and a \nminor criminal record.  (Egelhof Dep. 30–36, 20–22, 39–40, July 13, 2006.)  In \nshort, he lacked any credentials to act as a fiduciary for a company in multi-\nmillion dollar litigation.  The firm should have been aware of his holdings \nand inexperience. \n{14} Given his inexperience and miniscule financial interest in the \nlitigation, it should come as no surprise that Mr. Egelhof played no \nsignificant role in the litigation process.  He had never met Mr. Robbins or \nMr. Fink until the night before his deposition related to the sanctions \nmotion.11  He had received and reviewed the original Complaint and the \nAmended Complaint.  (Egelhof Dep. 53–56, July 13, 2006.)  In total he had \n                                                                                                                                                 \nRent-Way Secs. Litig., 305 F. Supp. 2d 491, 518 (W.D. Pa. 2003) (citation omitted).  The \nPSLRA instructed that the “most adequate plaintiff” is the one that has “(1) ‘the largest \nfinancial interest’ in the relief sought by the class and (2) satisfies the requirements set forth \nin Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  Bassin v. Decode Genetics, Inc., 230 \nF.R.D. 313, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (citations omitted).  Mr. Egelhof’s diminutive stake in the \nlitigation would most likely not qualify as making him the “most adequate plaintiff.”  \nHowever, the presumption of the most adequate plaintiff being the plaintiff with the largest \nfinancial stake does not apply in derivative actions.  \nIn re Comverse Tech., Inc. Derivative \nLitig. 06-CV-1849, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88261, at *10–11 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). \n10 He had received class action notices in the past but been too lazy to fill them out and send \nthem in.  (Egelhof Dep. 20–21, July 13, 2006.) \n11 Mr. Egelhof had a remote idea who Mr. Williamson was but had never met him (Egelhof \nDep. 62–63, July 13, 2006) and it appears had never met or talked to any other lawyers in \nthe Robbins Umeda & Fink law firm besides speaking to Mr. Robbins on the phone.  (Egelhof \nDep. 50–52, 55 July 13, 2006.)  He made no reference to any communication with the \nshareholder relations department.  (Egelhof Dep. 50–52, July 13, 2006.)  \ndevoted no more then five (5) hours to the litigation process.  (Egelhof Dep. \n58, July 13, 2006.)  There is no indication in the record that he ever received \ncopies of the correspondence from Defendants’ counsel requesting \nreconsideration of his pursuit of the lawsuit, nor was he informed of the \nCourt’s decision in Pozen or the fact that a prior action in Delaware had been \nvoluntarily dismissed.12  He was not informed of the hearing on the motion to \ndismiss or the hearing on the motion for sanctions against him.  (Egelhof \nDep. 86–88, July 13, 2006.)  He was not sent the order dismissing his case.  \n(Egelhof Dep. 83, July 13, 2006.)  Mr. Egelhof moved several times and failed \nto inform the law firm of his new address.  (Egelhof Dep. 79, July 13, 2006.)  \nThere were significant periods of time when the firm did not know where to \nfind him.  (Egelhof Dep. 79–80, July 13, 2006.)  It appears that neither the \nfirm nor the client communicated with each other in any professional \nmanner.  The firm never informed the Court that the shareholder derivative \nplaintiff was missing.  Mr. Egelhof did not even know how the firm had found \nout he sold his stock.  (Egelhof Dep. 45, July 13, 2006.)  Had the Court not \nsought the information, it appears likely that Mr. Egelhof’s lack of standing \nmight not ever have been discovered.  Clearly, no one at the firm was \nconcerned enough to even know how much stock he owned. \n{15} The record in this case supports a finding that the firm of Robbins \nUmeda & Fink failed to keep its client informed of significant developments \nin the lawsuit, including a motion for sanctions which could directly affect the \nclient.  The Rules of Professional Conduct of the North Carolina State Bar \nrequire: \nRule 1.4: Communication \n(a) A lawyer shall: \n(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or \ncircumstance with respect to which the client’s \n                                                 \n12 Defense counsel brought that dismissal to the attention of the firm along with a request to \nreconsider pursuit of the lawsuit. It does not appear that Mr. Egelhof was ever notified of \nthat development or request. \ninformed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required \nby these Rules; \n(2) reasonably consult with the client about the means by \nwhich the client’s objectives are to be accomplished; \n(3) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of \nthe matter; \n      . . . . \n(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably \nnecessary to permit the client to make informed decisions \nregarding the representation. \n \n{16} Mr. Egelhof’s out-of-state counsel failed to comply with these rules.  \nMr. Egelhof was only partially responsible for those failures. \n{17} The firm treated the lawsuit as its own, made all litigation decisions \nwithout input from the client, and failed to keep the client and the Court \ninformed of facts which were relevant to Mr. Egelhof’s standing to pursue the \nlitigation.  While there is no evidence that the firm knew that Mr. Egelhof \nhad sold his stock and hid that information, it is clear that they made no \neffort to stay in touch with him and discern whether anything had happened \nwhich would have affected his standing. \n{18} For his part, Mr. Egelhof failed to fulfill his acknowledged fiduciary \nduties.13  He never initiated any contact with the firm to find out what was \nhappening.  He took no action to manage his litigation and his counsel, a duty \nclearly recognized by Mr. Fink in oral argument.  He even failed to let \ncounsel know where he could be contacted.  Both Mr. Egelhof and the firm \nknew he was not fulfilling his obligations.  He sold his stock for his own \npersonal interests, without informing his counsel or the Court.  He had an \naffirmative duty to notify counsel and the Court before he sold his stock.  At \nthe very least he was required to do so afterward.  \n{19} Neither client nor counsel communicated with each other in a \nmanner required of two fiduciaries.  Mr. Egelhof owed a fiduciary duty to the \n                                                 \n13 In his deposition, he acknowledged knowing that he was to remain a long term shareholder \nand act in the best interest of the corporation.  (Egelhoff Dep. 58–59, July 13, 2006)  He was \nless clear on his understanding of fiduciary duties and the meaning of a verified complaint.  \n(Egelhoff Dep. 73–74, July 13, 2006). \ncorporation he sought to represent, and the firm owed a fiduciary duty to its \nclient.  The firm likewise had a duty to know its client and have confidence in \nthe client’s knowledge and ability to fulfill his or her fiduciary duties.  \nShareholders may not simply lend their name to a law firm to be used in \nlitigation, nor may lawyers borrow the name and pursue litigation in the \nfirm’s interest.  Nor may lawyers escape the responsibility for keeping clients \ninformed of developments in a case by delegating that responsibility to a \nshareholders relations department; the obligation is a personal one residing \nwith the lawyer handling the case. \n{20} In this case, when the combination of all the factors is considered, \nsanctions are warranted.  The plaintiff was a young novice investor with no \nlitigation experience and miniscule stock holdings who responded to an \nInternet solicitation.  The firm rushed to file a complaint on his behalf that \nwas defective in a number of ways and clearly ignored existing Delaware \ndecisions.  Thereafter, neither the firm nor Mr. Egelhof fulfilled their \nresponsibilities.  Mr. Egelhof moved without telling the firm where he could \nbe contacted, never took any affirmative action in connection with his \nlawsuit, and ultimately sold all of his stock, forgetting that he was even \ninvolved in the litigation.  The firm never met him, didn’t know much about \nhim, and lost touch with him for months at a time. The firm never \ncommunicated with him with respect to ongoing motions and activities \nsignificant to the case and failed to transmit requests directed to him by \ndefense counsel.  Until his deposition was ordered by the Court, he was not \neven aware of the pending motion seeking sanctions against him.  Mr. Fink \nmade an appearance without taking steps to be properly admitted.  Mr. \nEgelhof, the firm, and the individual lawyers have failed in their duties and \nresponsibilities to each other and to the Court. \n{21} Accordingly, the Court concludes that sanctions are appropriate. \nThose sanctions are directed to protecting the interests of parties whose \ninterests might be affected by representation by Mr. Egelhof, the firm or its \nindividual lawyers. \n{22} It  is, therefore, ORDERED: \n1. For a period of five years from the date of this order, Andrew \nEgelhof shall not act as a shareholder derivative plaintiff or a \nclass action representative in litigation pending in the state \ncourts of North Carolina; \n2. Within thirty days of this order, Jeffrey P. Fink shall pay to \nthe North Carolina State Bar and the Clerk of Court of  Wake \nCounty an amount equal to the amounts he would have been \nrequired to pay had he properly filed a \npro hac vice motion \nand been admitted to appear in this action.  \n3. For a period of five years from the date of this order, Brian J. \nRobbins, Jeffrey P. Fink, Steven R. Wedeking, and the law \nfirm of Robbins Umeda & Fink, LLP are prohibited from \nappearing \npro hac vice in the state courts of North Carolina. \n4. Defendants’ request for attorney fees and expenses is denied. \n5. Mr. Williamson will insure that Mr. Egelhof receives a copy of \nthis order. \n \nThis 4th day of February 2008. \n \n      \n "
