Black, 2019 NCBC 34. \n \n \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nTRANSYLVANIA COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n17 CVS 228 \n \nMATT BOHN and wife, LAURIE \nBOHN, \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nJUDITH BLACK; NANCY BLACK; \nSCOTT HATTER; JEANNE \nHATTER; BLACK FOREST FAMILY \nCAMPING RESORT, INC.; and a \ncertain unnamed De Facto North \nCarolina General Partnership, a/k/a \nthe BLACK FOREST \nPARTNERSHIP, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION  \nON MOTIONS FOR PARTIAL \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \n \n \n1. The Black family has operated a campground in the mountains of western \nNorth Carolina for over 20 years.  When family ties frayed in late 2016, Laurie Bohn \n(one of three Black daughters) and her husband , Matt Bohn, refused to support the \ncampground any longer.   Laurie’s mother, Judith Black, then threaten ed to cut off \nthe Bohns’ access to their home, which sits on the campground property.  This lawsuit \nfollowed. \n2. The Bohns, both plaintiffs here, allege that they worked at the campground \nwithout pay  for more than two decades, while also contributing substantial funds \nfrom outside jobs along the way.  They further allege that Judith induced them to do \nso with promises of home ownership and, for Laurie, co-ownership of the campground \nbusiness.  The amended complaint contains twelve claims against Judith, including \nclaims for de facto partnership, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and \n \n \nothers.  Laurie’s two sisters (Jeanne Hatter and Nancy Black) and her brother-in-law \n(Scott Hatter) are named as additional defendants on the theory that they, too, have \nan ownership interest in the campground business  that could be affected by the \nasserted claims. \n3. Discovery is complete .  Defendants have moved for summary judgment as \nto most but not all asserted claims , and the Bohns have cross-moved for summary \njudgment as to some of their own claims as well as Defendants’ affirmative defenses.  \nFor the following reasons, the Court  DENIES the Bohns’ motion and GRANTS in \npart and DENIES in part Defendants’ motion. \nWhitfield-Cargile Law, PLLC, by Davis A. Whitfield-Cargile, and \nRamsey & Pratt, PA, by Michael K. Pratt, for Plaintiffs Matt Bohn and \nLaurie Bohn.  \n \nFisher Stark, P.A., by W. Perry Fisher, II, Brad A.

The Court does not make findings of fact in ruling on motions for summary \njudgment.  The following background, describing the evidence and noting relevant \ndisputes, is therefore intended only to provide context for th e Court’s analysis and \nruling. \n \n \n5. In 1992, Judith and her late husband1 moved to North Carolina, where they \npurchased two tracts of land in Transylvania County.  (Dep. J. Black 9:5–7; J. Black \nAff. ¶ 2, ECF No. 17.1.)2  Their aim was to open a campground as a family business.  \n(See Dep. J. Black 11:4 –13; M. Bohn Aff. 1, ECF No. 67. 7.)  Campgrounds need \ncampsites, picnic tables, and fire pits, among other things—none of which existed at \nthe time the Blacks bought the property .  (Dep. J. Black 9:21–10:20.)  It was nearly \nthree years before they opened to the public.  (Dep. J. Black 15:12–13.)   \n6. Judith invited her daughters —Jeanne, Nancy, and Laurie —to join the  \nendeavor.  (Dep. L. Bohn 205:11 –206:1.)  Laurie contends, and Judith denies, that \nJudith did so with the promise that all three would co-own the business with her.  \n(See Dep. L. Bohn 18:10–17, 19:17–21:24; Dep. J. Black 103:1–11.)  Jeanne and Nancy \nhelped get the campground ready to open, and Jeanne’s husband, Scott, also decided \nto live and work at the campground.  (Dep. J. Black 14:25–16:3, 264:5–13.)  At the \ntime, Laurie was attending college in New York, where she met her future husband, \nMatt.  (Dep. M. Bohn 6:25–7:9.)  After earning their degrees, Laurie and Matt moved \nin with the rest of the family.  ( L. Bohn Aff. 2 , ECF No. 67.6 .)  By 1995, the whole \n                                                 \n1 John Black died in September 1996.  (Dep. J. Black 174:10.) \n2 The record includes excerpts of deposition testimony given by most of the parties.  These \nexcerpts are spread over several exhibits in support of and opposition to both motions.  \nExcerpts of Judith Black’s testimony appear at ECF Nos. 58.1, 65.1, 67.2, and 71.4.  Excerpts \nof Laurie Bohn’s testimony appear at ECF Nos. 57.1, 65.1, and 67.1.  Excerpts of Matt Bohn’s \ntestimony appear at ECF Nos. 57.2, 65.1, and 67.3.   Excerpts of Scott Hatter’s testimony \nappear at ECF Nos. 57.4, 65.1,  and 67.5.  Excerpts of Jeanne Hatter’s testimony appear at \nECF Nos. 57.3, 65.1, 67.4, and 71.5. \n \n \nfamily—including Matt and Scott—worked at the campground in some capacity.  (See \nDep. J. Black 16:13–17:6, 18:22–19:4, 264:14–23.)   \n7. The campground operated as an unincorporated business until 2004, when \nJudith incorporated it as Black Forest Family Camping Resort, Inc.  ( J. Black Aff. \n¶ 11.)  She is the corporation’s only officer and shareholder; no shares, stock \ncertificates, or other ownership documents have ever been issued to any other \nmember of the family.  (J. Black Aff. ¶ 11; Dep. J. Black 120:20–121:11; Dep. L. Bohn \n67:9–68:7; Dep. M. Bohn 115:2 –24.)  The corporation apparently owns some \ncampground assets, but the real property on which it sits remains in Judith’s name.  \n(See Dep. J. Black 329:11–20; J. Black Aff. ¶ 11; L. Bohn Aff. 2.)   \n8. It seems that money was tight in the years before and after the campground \nopened.  Early on, Matt lent Judith $20,000 from his own savings  to cover debts \nincurred in building the campground.  (Dep. M. Bohn 32:4–12; M. Bohn Aff. 1.)  And \nwhen Matt and Laurie married in 1995, they lent Judith another $15,000 from money \nreceived as wedding gifts.  (Dep. M. Bohn 42:10–15; M. Bohn Aff. 2.)  This second loan \nwent toward a swimming pool at the campground, all to attract more campers.  ( See \nM. Bohn Aff. 2.)  Judith admits that she never repaid either loan.  (See Dep. J. Black \n286:18–287:1.) \n9. During those lean years , the family also began  pooling their resources.   \nEveryone worked at the campground  without receiving wages.  ( See Dep. J. Black \n17:7–12, 172:14–20, 315:17–20.)  Laurie, Matt, Jeanne, Scott, and Nancy also handed \nover all income earned from outside jobs.  ( See Dep. J. Black  262:19–263:24.)  \n \n \nTogether with the campground’s revenue and Judith’s Social Security  benefits and \ninheritance money, these earnings were pooled in a common or  general fund \ncontrolled by Judith.  (Dep. J. Black 31:19–23, 39:7–24, 123:23–124:7.)  She used the \ngeneral fund to pay the campground’s bills and to pay for most, if not all, day -to-day \nexpenses of the Black family members.  (Dep. J. Black 20:14–21:24, 173:21–174:7; L. \nBohn Aff. 2; M. Bohn Aff. 1 –2.)  Judith also gave an allowance to each individual —\nincluding her grandchildren in later years—in an amount that she set and adjusted \nover time.  ( See Dep. J. Black 142:1–146:3; Dep. J. Hatter 1 16:2–117:4.)  Everyone \nknew that Judith controlled the family purse; they contributed without knowledge of \nhow the money was spen t or what amount was in the fund at any given time.  ( See \nDep. L. Bohn 95:2–4; Dep. J. Hatter 171:8–12, 183:24–184:5; Dep. J. Black 135:8–16.)   \n10. Tracking what went into and out of the general fund is difficult, perhaps \nimpossible.  No accounting ever seems to have been done.  (See Dep. J. Black 135:8–\n136:4.)  Jeanne denies knowing what she put in or received from it.  (See, e.g., Dep. J. \nHatter 45:13–46:23, 104:11–105:22.)  And the manner of collecting and distributing \nmoney appears to have changed over time.  (See Dep. J. Black 142:20–146:9, 168:14–\n171:16.)  Indeed, the fund itself is spread over Judith’s personal checking account, the \ncorporation’s checking account, and cash on hand at the campground.  (Dep. J. Black \n33:1–3, 51:15–53:20.) \n11. Over time, this communal arrangement would become a source of friction.  \nAfter a few years, the Bohns moved off the campground property to an apartment of \ntheir own, and each found new jobs .  (Dep. L. Bohn 44: 20–45:18.)  Laurie continued \n \n \nto give her paychecks to Judith, but Matt decided to keep his.  (Dep. L. Bohn 46:25–\n47:10; Dep. M. Bohn 50:5 –12.)  Both worked at the campground on nights and \nweekends, still without pay.  (Dep. L. Bohn 47: 9–13; L. Bohn Aff. 3.)  When marital \nstrain led to a brief separation, Laurie returned to the campground .  (Dep. L. Bohn \n44:3–44:12, 55:7–11; Dep. M. Bohn 54:11–25.)  The couple reconciled in late 2001, but \nas a condition of returning to the campground, Matt would not contribute his outside \nsalary to the general fund.  (M. Bohn Aff. 2, 4; J. Black Aff. ¶ 10.)  Matt believes the \nrest of the family resented him for it.  (M. Bohn Aff. 3–4.)  \n12. At some point around this time, the campground seems to have turned the \ncorner.  There was enough money to build a house for Jeanne and Scott in 2004.  (See \nM. Bohn Aff. 2 .)  A modular home  for Laurie and Matt , now with three children, \nfollowed in 2006.  (J. Black Aff. ¶ 14; Dep. M. Bohn 91:8–14; Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n Defs.’ \nMot. Partial Summ. J. Ex. K, ECF No. 67.11 .)  According to Laurie, having a home \non campground property was one of the promises that Judith made to induce her to \nlive and work there .  (L. Bohn Aff. 2–3; Dep. J. Black 173:4 –7.)  How the modular \nhome was paid for is unclear.  Laurie states that she used her income to obtain a line \nof credit, but did not make direct payments toward the house .  (L. Bohn Aff. 3 ; Dep. \nL. Bohn 213:11–16.)  Judith, on the other hand, claims the payments toward Laurie’s \nline of credit and to the building company came from either the campground’s \nbusiness funds  or Judith’s inheritance money .  ( J. Black Aff. ¶  15; Dep. J. Black \n68:15–21.) \n \n \n13. The next decade or so passed uneventfully.  Judith’s daughters and their \nhusbands continued to work for the campground without receiving wages.  (See Dep. \nJ. Black 34:18 –25, 315:4–20.)  At some point, Nancy and Scott decided to work \nexclusively at the campground, but Laurie and Jeanne continued to work other jobs \nand contribute their wages to the general fund.   (Dep. J. Black 35:1–11.)  Matt, too, \nworked an outside job but did not contribute his wages to the general fund.  (See Dep. \nM. Bohn 9:4–12; Dep. L. Bohn 58:5–17.) \n14. In late 2016, the Bohns had a sudden falling out with Judith and the rest of \nthe family.  As Laurie and Matt tell it, the family issued an ultimatum out of the blue: \neither Matt would agree to turn over his expected Social Security benefits to the \ngeneral fund  (apparently upon reaching retirement age some twenty years in the \nfuture), or the Bohns must leave the campground.  (See Dep. M. Bohn 127:23–128:15, \n131:12–133:25.)  They refused.  (See Dep. M. Bohn 133:21–25; M. Bohn Aff. 4.)  From \nthat point forward, they also stopped working at the campground, and Laurie ceased \ngiving her income to Judith.  (Dep. M. Bohn 134:16–24; Dep. J. Black 217:9–15.)   \n15. Despite the flare -up, the Bohns  continued to live in the modular home on \ncampground property.  (See J. Black Aff. ¶¶ 19, 21.)  In May 2017, Judith sent a letter \ndemanding rent and stating that she intended to block the Bohns from accessing their \nhome.  (Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. Partial Summ. J. Ex. M, ECF No. 67.13 .)  The \nBohns filed this lawsuit against Judith and Black Forest Family Camping Resort, \nInc. a few days later .  ( Compl., ECF No. 1.)   The Bohns sought and received  a \ntemporary restraining order to prevent Judith from blocking access to their house, \n \n \ncutting off water, or charging rent.  (TRO 4, ECF No. 2.)  This Court then granted the \nBohns’ motion for preliminary injunction and enjoined Judith under substantially the \nsame terms as the temporary restraining order .  (Order Granting Mot. Prelim. Inj . \n11, ECF No. 24.)   \n16. The Bohns later amended the complaint to add Nancy, Jeanne, and Scott as \ndefendants, alleging that each holds  a potential ownership interest  in the \ncampground business that could be affected by the asserted claims .  The amended \ncomplaint includes nine causes of action: breach of fiduciary duty, undue influence, \nunjust enrichment, equitable estoppel, two distinct breaches of contract, conversion, \nde facto partnership, and declaratory judgment.  It also includes another three claims \nfor various remedies, including an accounting, appointment of a receiver, constructive \ntrust, and injunctive relief .  Among other things, the Bohns allege that Judith \ninduced them to work at the campground without pay and to contribute additional \nfunds, all on the promise that they would receive a home and that Laurie would \nco-own the campground business with her mother and sisters.   On that basis, they \ncontend the campground is a de facto par tnership, that Judith breached a fiduciary \nduty she owed to them , and that Judith would be unjustly enriched if permitted to \nkeep the home and exclusive ownership of the campground business.   In recovery, \nthey seek ownership of the home, one -quarter of the campground business, and the \nreal estate associated with both through the imposition of a constructive trust.  (Am. \nCompl. p.9, ECF No. 26.)   \n \n \n17. Both sides moved for summary judgment on many but not all claims.  These \nmotions have been fully briefed, and th e Court held a hearing on January 11, 2019, \nat which all parties were represent ed by counsel.  (ECF No. 72.)  After the hearing, \nthe Bohns voluntarily dismissed their claim for wrongful taking and conversion.  \n(ECF No. 73.)  The motions are now ripe for decision. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n18. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that \nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and  that any party is entitled to a \njudgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In deciding a motion for summary \njudgment, the Court views the evidence “in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty,” taking the non-movant’s evidence as true and drawing inferences in its favor.  \nFurr v. K-Mart Corp., 142 N.C. App. 325, 327, 543 S.E.2d 166, 168 (2001)  (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted).  The moving party “bears the initial burden \nof demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. \nCo. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, 579, 573 S.E.2d 118, 124 (2002).   \n19. As to the Bohns’  motion for offensive summary judgment on their own \nclaims, “a greater burden must be met.”  Brooks v. Mt. Airy Rainbow Farms Ctr., Inc., \n48 N.C. App. 726, 728, 269 S.E.2d 704, 705 (1980); accord Almond Grading Co. v. \nShaver, 74 N.C. App. 576, 578, 329 S.E.2d 417, 418 (1985).  “[The movant] must show \nthat there are no genuine issues of fact, that there are no gaps in his proof, that no \ninferences inconsistent with his recovery arise from the evidence, and that there is \n \n \nno standard that must be applied to the facts by the jury.”  Parks Chevrolet, Inc. v. \nWatkins, 74 N.C. App. 719, 721, 329 S.E.2d 728, 729 (1985); see also Kidd v. Early, \n289 N.C. 343, 370, 222 S.E.2d 392, 410 (1976) (same).  For that reason, it is “rarely \n. . . proper to enter summary judgment in favor of the party having the burden of \nproof.”  Blackwell v. Massey, 69 N.C. App. 240, 243, 316 S.E.2d 350, 352 (1984).  \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n20. The Bohns allege that they lived and work ed under Judith’s “coercive” \ninfluence for years because of her promises of homeownership and shared ownership \nof the campground business.  (Am. Compl. p.2.)  They claim they are entitled to their \nshare of the campground and its land, along with the modular home they have lived \nin for the past decade.  Defendants argue that the Bohns voluntarily contributed to \nthe family business and are not entitled to any such relief.   \n21. The parties’ cross-motions overlap on many but not all claims.  For clarity, \nthe Court proceeds claim by claim, addressing the competing motions together rather \nthan in sequence. \nA. De Facto Partnership \n22. Though enumerated as Claim IX in the amended complaint, the claim for de \nfacto partnership looms over  this dispute.   Through this claim, Laurie seeks to \nestablish that the campground business is a partnership  and that she owns one -\nfourth of the campground business and the land on which it  sits.  Laurie bases the \nclaim on Judith’s alleged promise that each of her daughters would be co-owners of \nthe campground.  ( Am. Compl. p.11 .)  If Laurie is correct, she may be entitled  to \n \n \ndissolution of the partnership and a distribution of her share of its assets.3  Both sides \nmove for summary judgment on this claim. \n23. “A partnership is an association of two or more persons to carry on as \nco-owners a business for profit .”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  59-36(a).  In other words, a \npartnership arises when individuals “combine their property, effects, labor, or skill in \na common business or venture.”  Johnson v. Gill, 235 N.C. 40, 44, 68 S.E.2d 788, 792 \n(1952) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  No formal agreement is required —a \nde facto  partnership may exist if the parties’ cond uct demonstrates “a voluntary \nassociation of partners.”  Best Cartage, Inc. v. Stonewall Packaging, LLC , 219 N.C. \nApp. 429, 438, 727 S.E.2d 291, 299 (2012).  Our courts have emphasized, though, that \n“co-ownership and sharing of any actual profits are indispensable requisites for a \npartnership.”  Id. (quoting Wilder v. Hobson, 101 N.C. App. 199, 202, 398 S.E.2d 625, \n627 (1990)).   \n24. Laurie argues that she has satisfied both indispensable requiremen ts as a \nmatter of law.  Laurie contends that she, Jeanne, and Nancy all held themselves out \nas co-owners, with Judith’s encouragement and permission.  ( Pls.’ Br. in Supp. Mot. \nPartial Summ. J. 10, ECF No. 52 [“Pls.’ Br. in Supp.”], see also Dep. L. Bohn 42:22–\n43:10, 209:6 –15.)  In addition, Laurie points to evidence that she and her sisters \n                                                 \n3 Though not expressly identified as such, this claim appears to be one for an alleged breach \nof an implied partnership agreement, for judicial dissolution of the alleged partnership, or  \nfor both.  The Court refers to the claim as Laurie’s because the amended complaint does not \nallege that Matt is also a partner.  ( See Am. Compl. p.11 (identifying “the four general and \nequal partners” as Judith, Laurie, Nancy, and Jeanne).)  At the hearin g, counsel for the \nBohns conceded that Matt and Scott have no interest apart from the interests, if any, of their \nwives.  Thus, only Laurie asserts the partnership claim, and the Court analyzes the claim on \nthat basis. \n \n \nworked at the campground without pay and also contributed to the family’s general \nfund all wages from other jobs.  (Pls.’ Br. in Supp. 9; see also Dep. L. Bohn 208:5–17.)  \nAccording to Laurie, Judith was required to make payments out of the general fund \nequally for the benefit of all.  (Pls.’ Br. in Supp. 9.)   \n25. Defendants, on the other hand, highlight Laurie’s deposition testimony, in \nwhich she denied sharing in campgro und profits or receiving a share of income.  \n(Mem. in Supp. Defs.’ Mot. Partial Summ. J. 11 –12, ECF No. 54 [“Defs.’ Mem. in \nSupp.”]; see also Dep. L. Bohn 166:4–22.)  Defendants also contend that Laurie cannot \nshow co-ownership.  They point to evidence tha t Judith is the sole shareholder of \nBlack Forest Family Camping Resort, Inc.  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 13; see also Dep. L. \nBohn 67:9 –68:7; J. Black Aff. ¶¶ 11, 12 .)  They further argue that Laurie had no \ncontrol over campground property or ability to govern its operations.  (Defs.’ Mem. in \nSupp. 13.) \n26. After careful consideration, t he Court concludes that the undisputed \nevidence requires summary judgment in favor of Defendants.  Simply put, “the \nindispensable requisite of co-ownership of the business is lacking.”  McGurk v. Moore, \n234 N.C. 248, 252, 67 S.E.2d 53, 56 (1951). \n27. To start, it is undisputed that the campground business is formally \norganized as a corporation, not a partnership; that none of Judith’s daughters or their \nhusbands own stock in the corporation ; and that Judith is its sole shareholder.  ( J. \nBlack Aff. ¶ 11; Dep. J. Black 120:20–121:11; Dep. L. Bohn 67:9–68:7; Dep. M. Bohn \n115:2–24.)  By the time Judith incorporated the business in 2004, it had already been \n \n \nin operation for nearly a decade.  (See J. Black Aff. ¶¶ 3, 11.)  Laurie did not object to \nthe new corporate form, nor did she take any steps to preserve her alleged ownership \ninterest, through the issuance of stock or otherwise.  ( See Dep. L. Bohn  157:3–25.)  \nThere is also no evidence that any party , including Laurie, has ever filed a state or \nfederal income tax return identifying the campground as a partnership, either before \nor after the business was incorpor ated.  Indeed, it appears that Laurie has never \nreported income of any kind from the campground on her personal tax returns.  ( See \nDep. L. Bohn 166:1–3.)  This evidence, all undisputed, strongly suggests that no legal \npartnership existed.  See, e.g., Qubain v. Granberry, 2007 N.C. App. LEXIS 27, at *7–\n8 (N.C. Ct. App. Jan. 2, 2007) (unpublished); Wilder, 101 N.C. App. at 203, 398 S.E.2d \nat 628; G.R. Little Agency, Inc. v. Jennings , 88 N.C. App. 107, 110, 362 S.E.2d 807, \n810 (1987). \n28. At most, Laurie’s ev idence shows that she and her sisters sometimes \nreferred to themselves as co -owners when interacting with campers and on social \nmedia, all with Judith’s permission.  ( See Dep. J. Black 103:14 –25; Dep. L. Bohn \n209:10–18; Dep. J. Hatter 75:15–24, 86:5–87:10.)  Jeanne now den ies ever having \nbeen a co-owner of the campground , claiming that she said so only to boost her \ncredibility with customers .  ( See Dep. J. Hatter 65:16 –25, 75:25–76:24, 113:14–20.)  \nNancy was not deposed, and her views are unknown.  But even if Laurie and her \nsisters believed a partnership existed, that belief, standing alone, “cannot create a \nlegal partnership.”  Dealers Supply Co. v. Cheil Indus. , 348 F. Supp. 2d 579, 589  \n(M.D.N.C. 2004); see also Anderson v. Brokers Inc. (In re Brokers, Inc.), 363 B.R. 458, \n \n \n470 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2007) (“A general statement that parties are partners cannot \noutweigh the conduct of the parties.”).  There must be some other indicia of actual co-\nownership. \n29. Such i ndicia are lacking  here.  There is no evidence that Laurie (or her \nsisters) exercised independent managerial judgment over the campground.  See, e.g., \nG.R. Little Agency, 88 N.C. App. at 110, 362 S.E.2d at 810; Zickgraf Hardwood Co. v. \nSeay, 60 N.C. App. 128, 133 –34, 298 S.E.2d 208, 211 (1982) .  Rather, all of the \nevidence shows that Laurie did not, and could not, exercise independent judgment or \ncontrol of the campground business.  Laurie testified that she never felt as if she had \nan equal vote with her mother in running the campground and that her mo ther was \nthe one whose lead “we had to follow.”  (Dep. L. Bohn 219:3–11.)  Judith would always \nmake the final decision even if Laurie or the other family members dissented.  (Dep. \nL. Bohn 219:12 –16; Dep. J. Black  123:23–124:7; 236:14–237:23.)  Indeed, Laurie \nconsidered Judith the “boss,” assigning duties that others then executed.  (Dep. L. \nBohn 218:12 –20.)  It also bears noting that  the real property  that is home to the \ncampground is titled in Judith’s name, and Judith has absolute control over that \nproperty.  (See J. Black Aff. ¶¶ 11, 13; Dep. J. Black 329:12–15.)   \n30. In short, t he undisputed evidence shows that Judith controlled the money \ncoming into and going out of the campground business and made all major decisions \nrelated to the campground.  Laurie and her sisters had no “authority of any kind over \neach other” or over the campground business and its property.  Wilder, 101 N.C. App. \nat 203, 398 S.E.2d at 628;  see also Builder Mart of Am. v. First Union Corp. , 2003 \n \n \nN.C. App. LEXIS 517, at *14–15 (N.C. Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2003)  (unpublished) \n(affirming order granting summary judgment because no evidence indicated that \nplaintiff held equal right of control over alleged partnership property). \n31. Taking the evidence in a light most favorable to Laurie, the Court concludes \nthat the essential element of co -ownership is lacking.   Thus, the Court grants \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the claim for de facto partnership \nand denies the Bohns’ motion.   The Court need not address Defendants’ alternative \nargument that this claim is barred by the statute of limitations. \nB. Breach of Fiduciary Duty \n32. As alleged,  Judith held nearly despotic control over her family and the \ncampground business.  The Bohns claim that Judith owed them a fiduciary duty as a \nresult and that she breached that duty by, among other things, blocking access to \ntheir home and mismanaging the money they contributed to the family’s general \nfund.  (See Am. Compl. pp.6–7 (Claim I).)  Again, both sides seek summary judgment \nin their favor as to this claim.4 \n33. “For a breach of fiduciary duty to exist, there must first be a fiduciary \nrelationship between the parties .”  Dalton v. Camp , 353 N.C. 647, 651 , 548 S.E.2d \n704, 707 (2001).  A fiduciary relationship arise s when “there has been a special  \nconfidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good \nfaith and with due regard to the interests of one reposing confidence.”  Dallaire v. \n                                                 \n4 In their opening brief, Defendants express uncertainty over whether the amended complaint \nasserts a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against anyone other than Judith.  (See Mem. in \nSupp. 8–9.)  The Court reads the amended complaint to allege a fiduciary  relationship \nbetween the Bohns and Judith, but not any other defendant.  (See, e.g., Am. Compl. pp.6–7.) \n \n \nBank of Am., N.A. , 367 N.C. 363, 367 , 760 S.E.2d 263, 266  (2014) (quoting Green v. \nFreeman, 367 N.C. 136, 141, 749 S.E.2d 262, 268 (2013)).  This definition is expansive \nyet exacting: “only when one party figuratively holds all the cards —all the financial \npower or technical information, for example—have North Carolina courts found that \nthe special circumstance of a fiduciary relationship has arisen.”  Kaplan v. O.K. \nTechs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 475, 675 S.E.2d 133, 138 (2009) (citing Broussard \nv. Meineke Discount Muffler Shops, Inc., 155 F.3d 331, 348 (4th Cir. 1998)). \n34. To the extent this claim is based on the fiduciary duties that partners owe \nto one another, it must fail.  See, e.g., Casey v. Grantham, 239 N.C. 121, 124, 79 S.E.2d \n735, 738 (1954) (“It is elementary that the relationship of partners is fiduciary . . . .”).  \nAs discussed, the undisputed evidence is insufficient to establish a legal partnership \nbetween Judith and Laurie. \n35. Defendants argue that the only other alleged basis for a fiduciary \nrelationship is the parent-child relationship between Judith and Laurie.   (See Defs.’ \nMem. in Supp. 9.)  They cite case law holding that family relationships are generally \nnot fiduciary r elationships.  On that basis, Defendants contend that “[n]o further \nexplanation or analysis is needed.”  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 9.)  \n36. This argument is not persuasive.  It is true that  “[a]n allegation of a mere \nfamily relationship is not  particular enough to establish a confidential or fiduciary \nrelationship.”  Benfield v. Costner, 67 N.C. App. 444, 446, 313 S.E.2d 203, 205 (1984) \n(citations and quotation marks omitted) ; see also Davis v. Davis , 236 N.C. 208, 211, \n72 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1952) (noting that the parent-child relationship “is a family \n \n \nrelationship, not a fiduciary one, and such relationship does not raise a presumption \nof fraud or undue influence”).  But there are certainly circumstances in which a family \nrelationship can become a fiduciary relatio nship, particularly when one person \nassumes control or direction over the interests or affairs of another.  See Keister v. \nNat’l Council of the YMCA of the United States , 2013 NCBC LEXIS 32, at * 19 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. July 18, 2013)  (collecting cases  where a fiduciary duty arose based on  \n“special circumstances”).  In such cases, the existence of “a close family relationship \ncan serve as a factor for consideration” that weighs in favor of finding a fiduciary \nrelationship.  Hewitt v. Hewitt, 252 N.C. App. 437, 443, 798 S.E.2d 796, 800 (2017). \n37. That is what the  Bohns allege.  They do not argue that a fiduciary \nrelationship arose solely from the parent-child relationship (which, of course, Judith \nand Matt  do not share).   Rather, the Bohns  rely o n Judith’s management of the \nfamily’s general fund.  The evidence shows that Laurie and Matt, along with all other \nfamily members, contributed substantial sums to the general fund over the past two \ndecades.  (See, e.g., Dep. L. Bohn 213:3–10; Dep. M. Bohn 50:13–24.)  Judith wholly \ncontrolled this fund.  (See Dep. L. Bohn 95:8 –12; Dep. J. Black 236:14 –237:23.)  No \none in the family knew how much money was in the fund at any given point, and \ndecisions as to how the money would be spent were left to Judith’s discretion.  ( See \nDep. L. Bohn 95:2–4; Dep. J. Black 123:23–124:7; Dep. J. Hatter 183:24–184:5.)  From \nthis evidence, a jury could conclude that the Bohns entrusted Judith with control over \na significant part of their finances, such that she was required to manage the fund in \ntheir best interests. \n \n \n38. This does not mean the Bohns are entitled to summary judgment in their \nfavor, as they contend.  It is “rarely . . . proper to enter summary judgment in favor \nof the party having the burden of proof.”  Blackwell, 69 N.C. App. at 243, 316 S.E.2d \nat 352.  And whether a fiduciary relationship exists “is generally a question of fact \nfor the jury.”  Carcano v. JBSS, LLC, 200 N.C. App. 162, 178, 684 S.E.2d 41, 53 (2009).   \n39. This is not the rare circumstance in which offensive summary judgment \nwould be proper.  The relationship between Judith, her children, and the campground \ndefies easy definition.  Given the nature of the work performed by Laurie, Matt, and \nthe others, a neu tral observer might think they were unpaid employees in a family \nbusiness.  Some family members resisted that label in their depositions, (see Dep. S. \nHatter 10:7–25; Dep. J. Hatter 114:6–19), but the jury may find it apt.  If so, the jury \nmay have reason to conclude that a fiduciary relationship does not exist between \nJudith and the Bohns.  See Timbercreek Land & Timber Co., LLC v. Robbins , 2017 \nNCBC LEXIS 64, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 28, 2017)  (“In general, an employer -\nemployee relationship does not give rise to fiduciary duties.”). \n40. Moreover, Defendants have offered evidence that Laurie and Matt are \ncapable, college -educated adults; that  they freely left the campground at certain \npoints; and that Matt has not contributed his income to the general fund since 1999.  \n(See L. Bohn Aff. 1; Dep. M. Bohn 120:17 –19, 135:13–17; Dep. L. Bohn 44:14–45:3.)  \nTaken in a light most favorable to Judith, this evidence could suggest that the balance \nof power, financial intelligence, and business acumen was relatively level, not skewed \nin her favor.  See, e.g., White v. Consol. Planning, Inc. , 166 N.C. App. 283, 29 3–94, \n \n \n603 S.E.2d 147, 155  (2004); Kaplan, 196 N.C. App. at 476, 675 S.E.2d at 13 8–39.  \nWhether Judith in fact held “all the cards” in the relationship is a question for the \njury.  See Kaplan, 196 N.C. App. at 476, 675 S.E.2d at 139. \n41. There are at least two other reasons to deny the Bohns’ motion  as to this \nclaim.  The first has to do with damages.  One element of a claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty is  that the breach proximately caused injury to the plaintiffs .  See \nMiller v. Burlington Chem . Co., LLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 6, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJan. 27, 2017).  The evidence on this element is nebulous.  It is clear that the Bohns \ncontributed funds to the campground and that they received allowances, expenses, \nand other sums in return.  Yet the record does not reveal exactly how much they put \nin or took out over the years, much less how those sums compare  with the \ncontributions and withdrawals of other family members.  Whether the Bohns were \ninjured and whether that injury can be measured remain unresolved. \n42. Second, Defendants have asserted the statut e of limitations as a defense. \nThe statute of limitations for a claim for breach of fiduciary duty is three years.  See, \ne.g., Toomer v. Branch Banking & Tr. Co., 171 N.C. App. 58, 66, 614 S.E.2d 328, 335 \n(2005) ( citing N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1 -52(1)).  Having reviewed the record, the Court \nconcludes that there are genuine disputes of fact  as to whether the Bohns knew or \nshould have known of the facts giving rise to their claim more than three years before \nfiling this action.  See id. at 69, 614 S.E.2d at 336.  \n43. The Court therefore denies both motions for s ummary judgment as to the \nclaim for breach of fiduciary duty.  \n \n \nC. Undue Influence \n44. Undue influence is a  claim usually seen in will contests,  arising from \nallegations that someone induced the testator, in a weakened mental state, to revoke \nor alter a will.  The Bohns allege something rather different: that Judith used “her \nstrong will and intimidation”  to “coerce” them into paying her large sums of money \nover the past two decades.  (Am. Compl. p.7 (Cla im II) .)  Defendants move for \nsummary judgment, arguing that there is no evidence these “two grown professionals \nwith college degrees” were unduly influenced.  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 20.)  The Court \nagrees.   \n45. Our appellate courts have observed that undue influence “is usually difficult \nto prove.”  In re Will of Dunn, 129 N.C. App. 321, 328, 500 S.E.2d 99, 104 (1998).  It \n“is defined as ‘the exercise of an improper influence over the mind and will of another \nto such an extent that his professed act is not that of a free agent, but in reality is the \nact of the third person who procured the result.’”  Hayes v. Turner, 98 N.C. App. 451, \n456, 391 S.E.2d 513, 516 (1990) (quoting Lee v. Ledbetter, 229 N.C. 330, 332, 49 S.E.2d \n634, 636 (1948)).  Undue influence requires “more than mere influence or persuasion \nbecause a person can be influenced to perform an act that is nevertheless his \nvoluntary action.”  In re Will of Jones, 362 N.C. 569, 574, 669 S.E.2d 572, 577 (2008) \n(quoting In re Will of Andrews, 299 N.C. 52, 53 , 261 S.E.2d 198, 199 (1980)) .  “It is \nclose akin to coercion produced by importunity, or by a silent, resistless power, \nexercised by the strong over the weak, which could not be resisted, so that the end \n \n \nreached is tantamount to the effect produced by the use of fear or force.”  Id. (quoting \nIn re Will of Turnage, 208 N.C. 130, 132, 179 S.E. 332, 333 (1935)). \n46. That is a high bar and, of course, requires evidence that the victim is in a \nphysical or mental state that renders him or her subject to the coercive influence of \nanother.  Individuals who are of sound mind and body are generally not susceptible \nto undue influence.  The undisputed evidence shows that Laurie and Matt are college \ngraduates, have held multiple jobs outside the campground, and are currently raising \nthree children of their own.  No evidence suggests that either suffers from an illness \nor other form of  “physical and mental weakness .”  In re Will of Campbell , 155 N.C. \nApp. 441, 455, 573 S.E.2d 550, 561 (2002).  Nor are they of advanced age; both joined \nthe campground in their twenties and are now in their forties.  Put simply, the facts \nof this case have nothing in common with those of other cases in which courts have \nfound undue influence.  See, e.g., Tortorgul v. Abayhan (In re Will of Biatschora), 207 \nN.C. App. 174, 187 , 700 S.E.2d 50, 59 (2010)  (discussing undue influence over 76-\nyear-old with terminal cancer); In re Will of McDonald , 156 N.C. App. 220, 2 29–30, \n577 S.E.2d 131, 138 (2003) (discussing undue influence over 87-year-old who “became \neasily confused by her medications”).   \n47. The Bohns have not marshalled evidence sufficient to permit a jury to \nconclude that they were “susceptible to fraud or undue influence.”  In re Will of \nCampbell, 155 N.C. App. at 457, 573 S.E. 2d at 562.  Thus, t he Court grants \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the claim for undue influence.  The \nclaim is dismissed with prejudice.  \n \n \nD. Equitable Estoppel \n48. The Court also grants Defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the \nclaim for equitable estoppel .  The Bohns claim that Judith should be estopped from \ndenying having promised  that the  couple would own their home and  that Laurie \nwould own part of the campground business .  (Am. Compl. pp.8–9 (Claim IV).)  But \n“North Carolina does not recognize equitable estoppel as an affirmative cause of \naction.”  Regency Ctrs. Acquisition, LLC v. Crescent Acquisitions, LLC , 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 7, at *16–17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 24, 2018) (listing cases); see also Chapel \nH.O.M. Assocs., LLC, 808 S.E.2d 576, 579 (N.C. Ct. App. 2017) .  Equitable estoppel \nis instead  “a defense which can only be considered when set out in [an] answer.”  \nAldridge Motors, Inc. v. Alexander, 217 N.C. 750, 756, 9 S.E.2d 469, 473 (1940).  This \nclaim is dismissed with prejudice.  \nE. Unjust Enrichment \n49. The claim for unjust enrichment is based on the work that Laurie and Matt \nperformed at the campground without pay and the additional monetary contributions \nthey’ve made to the business.  They claim that these contributions benefitted Judith \nand that she would be unjustly enriched if permitted to keep the modular home and \nthe surroun ding land and  to maintain exclusive ownership of the campground \nbusiness.  ( See Am. Compl. pp.7–8 (Claim III) .)  Defendants move for summary \njudgment in their favor as to this claim.  \n50. “The doctrine of unjust enrichment was devised by equity to exact the return \nof, or payment for, benefits received under circumstances where it would be unfair \n \n \nfor the recipient to retain them without the contributor being repaid or compensated.”  \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Browning , 230 N.C. App. 537, 542 , 750 S.E.2d 555, \n559–60 (2013).  There are five elements: (1) “one party must confer a benefit upon the \nother party;” (2) “the benefit must not have been conferred officiously;” (3) “the benefit \nmust not be gratuitous;” (4) “the benefit must be measurable;” and (5) “the defendant \nmust have consciously accepted the benefit.”  Butler v. Butler, 239 N.C. App. 1, 7, 768 \nS.E.2d 332, 336  (2015) (quoting JPMorgan Chase , 230 N.C. App.  at 541–42, 750 \nS.E.2d at 559).  In other words, the facts must demonstrate that “property or benefits \nwere conferred on a defendant under circumstances which give rise to a legal o r \nequitable obligation on the part of the defendant to account for the benefits received.”  \nNorman v. Nash Johnson & Sons’ Farms, Inc. , 140 N.C. App. 390, 417, 537 S.E.2d \n248, 266 (2000).   \n51. In support of their motion, Defendants make a narrow argument.  According \nto Defendants, Laurie and Matt received a great deal in return for their contributions: \n“shelter, an allowance, food and groceries, child care and even access to a swimming \npool and other recreational areas.”  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 16.)  This, Defendants \ncontend, “was a fair t rade,” such that there could be no unjust enrichment.   (Defs.’ \nMem. in Supp. 16.)  \n52. Things are not so tidy.  Some evidence suggests that Judith induced Laurie \nand Matt to contribute their time and money to the campground based on the promise \nthat they would receive a home and  that Laurie would co -own the campground \nbusiness.  ( See Dep. L. Bohn  207:11–15, 228:10 –17; L. Bohn Aff. 2 –3.)  Whether \n \n \nJudith actually made those promises is disputed, but the Court must accept them as \ntrue at this stage, and Laurie and Matt assert that they contributed their labor and \nmoney in reliance on them.  ( See Dep. L. Bohn  207:16–208:22, 214:20–24; L. Bohn  \nAff. 2.)  Laurie and Matt have also pointed to evidence that they built their modular \nhome, at least in part, using their own money.  ( See M. Bohn Aff. 2 –3; L. Bohn Aff. \n3.)  If the  jury credits the Bohns’ view of the facts, it  could conclude that Judith \ninduced them to improve her land and business based on promises she failed to keep.  \nThe jury could also conclude that Judith would be unjustly enriched if allowed to keep \nthe benefit of those improvements .  See, e.g., Graham v. Martin, 149 N.C. App. 831, \n834, 561 S.E.2d 583, 585–86 (2002) (affirming finding of unjust enrichment based on \nevidence that plaintiffs had improved defendants’ land but were ejected from it) ; see \nalso Hall v. Mabe , 77 N.C. App. 758, 761, 336 S.E.2d 427, 429 (1985)  (affirming \nsubmission of unjust enrichment claim to the jury when plaintiff improved in-laws’ \nproperty).5 \n                                                 \n5 One other observation bears note.  Unjust enrichment “is an equitable claim.”  Primerica \nLife Ins. Co. v. James Massengill & Sons Constr. Co., 211 N.C. App. 252, 264, 712 S.E.2d 670, \n679 (2011).  In the event the Bohns prevail, the Court will need to fashion an equitable \nremedy, bearing in mind the conduct of all parties and the need to achieve an equitable result.  \nSee, e.g., Sara Lee Corp. v. Carter, 351 N.C. 27, 36, 519 S.E.2d 308, 314 (1999) (“It is a long-\nstanding principle that when equitable relief is sought, courts claim the power to grant, deny, \nlimit, or shape that relief as a matter of discretion.” (citation and quotation marks omitted)); \nLoving v. Webb, 2014 N.C. App. LEXIS 840, at *12 (N.C. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2014) (unpublished).  \nOne factor the Court may consider is whether and how the parties have paid taxes on the \nfunds and property in dispute.  The deposition testimony of several witnesse s suggests that \nthe corporation has paid some form of income tax but that personal income taxes or property \ntaxes on certain assets may have gone unpaid.  (See, e.g., Dep. L. Bohn 166:1–3; Dep. M. Bohn \n58:12–14, 101:11–13, 140:5–8; Dep. J. Black 54:10 –12, 135:17–21.)  Whether this approach \nruns afoul of state or federal tax laws is unclear.   If, after all the evidence is received, it \nappears that the parties have coll ectively shirked their tax obligations for more than 20 \nyears, the Court may consider that fact in fashioning an appropriate equitable remedy. \n \n \n53. The Court denies Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the claim \nfor unjust enrichment.   \nF. Remedial Claims \n \n54. The Bohns assert claims for a constructive trust, a permanent injunction, \nan accounting of all moneys paid to Judith, and appointment of a receiver to take over \nBlack Forest Family Camping Resort, Inc.  ( See Am. Compl. p.9 (Claim V); p.12 \n(Claim X); pp.12–13 (Claim XII).)  All are potential remedies, not independent causes \nof action.  See Weatherford v. Keenan, 128 N.C. App. 178, 179 , 493 S.E.2d 812, 813  \n(1997) (constructive trust); Brewster v. Powell Bail Bonding, Inc., 2018 NCBC LEXIS \n76, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 26, 2018)  (injunction); Hampton v. Hanzel , 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 66, at *69 –70 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 29, 2018) (accounting); Johnston \nv. Johnston Props., Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 119, at *42 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 15, \n2018) (receiver).   \n55. In seeking and opposing summary judgment as to these remedies, the \nparties largely rely on their arguments about the merits of the underlying causes of \naction, including the claims for de facto partnership, breach of fiduciary duty, and \nunjust enrichment.  Defendants argue, for example, that the Bohns are not entitled \nto an accounting or to the appointment of a receiver because their claims for de facto \npartnership and breach of fiduciary duty are defective.  (See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 23–\n24.)  The Bohns, on the other hand, argue that they are entitled to an accounting as \na matter of law “by virtue of the fiduciary status of Judith Black.”  (Pls.’ Br. in Supp. \nat 7–8.)  The Court has concluded that the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and \n \n \nunjust enrichment must be decided by a jury.  Accordingly, the Court denies both \nsides’ motions to the extent they seek summary judgment as to the remedies of \naccounting and receivership.   \n56. It would also be premature to address the Bohns’ requests for a constructive \ntrust and  permanent injunction .  In the Order granting the Bohns’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction, the Court concluded that they had shown a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of the claim for unjust enrichment and that a constructive trust \nis an available remedy for that claim.  ( See Order Granting Mot. Prelim. Inj . 7–9.)  \nDefendants have not moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction, which remains in \nforce, and the claim for unjust enrichment will proceed to trial.  The Court believes it \nwould be more appropriate to resolve the disputed facts underlying the claim for \nunjust enrichment before imposing or denying remedies based on that claim.  Each \nside’s motion for summary judgment is therefore denied.  \nG. Declaratory Judgment  \n57. The Bohns’ claim for declaratory judgment is actually a request for three \nseparate declarations.  They ask the Court to declare the parties’ ownership interests \nin the modular home, the campground  business, and the land associate d with each.  \n(See Am. Compl. p.12 (Claim XI).)  The claim for declaratory judgment is predicated \non the underlying claims for de facto partnership and unjust enrichment.   \n58. Defendants move for summary judgment  solely on the  ground that the se \nunderlying “substantive claims fail as a matter of law .”  (Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 24.)   \nAlthough the Court has granted summary judgment as to Laurie’s claim for de facto \n \n \npartnership, the underlying claim for unjust enrichment remains for t rial.  Thus, i t \nwould be premature to declare the parties’ rights.  The Court denies Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment as to the claim for declaratory judgment.   \n59. The Bohns also listed this claim in their motion for summary judgment, but \nthey did not address the claim in their briefing or at the hearing .  In the absence of \nany supporting argument, the Court denies the Bohns’ motion for summary judgment \nas to the claim for declaratory judgment. \nH. Contract Claims \n60. The amended complaint also includes two distinct claims for breach of \ncontract.  (Am. Compl. pp.9–10 (Claims VI, VII).)  “The elements of a claim for breach \nof contract are (1) existence of a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms of that \ncontract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000). \n1.  Breach of Contract for Money Owed   \n \n61. The Bohns  allege that they lent Judith $35,000 in two separate loans, \nneither of which ha s been repaid.  Matt lent Judith $20,000 around the time the  \ncampground first opened to help defray some of its start-up costs.  ( Dep. M. Bohn  \n33:17–20; M. Bohn Aff. 1.)  Shortly thereafter, the Bohns lent Judith another $15,000 \nfrom money they received as wedding gifts .  (Dep. M. Bohn 42:10–20; M. Bohn Aff. \n2.)  During her deposition, Judith admitted that she received both loans but has not \nrepaid either.  (Dep. J. Black 286: 18–287:1.)  Based on these undisputed facts, the \nBohns seek summary judgment in their favor. \n \n \n62. As noted, though, it is rarely appropriate to grant summary judgment in \nfavor of the party with the burden of proof.  To carry their burden, the Bohns must \nshow “that there is no standard that must be applied to the facts by the jury.”  Parks \nChevrolet, 74 N.C. App. at 721, 329 S.E.2d at 729.  It appears, however, that both \nloans were given without specifying a time for repayment.  The rule in North Carolina \nis that “money lent pursuant to a verbal agreement, which fails to specify a time for \nrepayment, is payable within a reasonable time.”  Helms v. Prikopa, 51 N.C. App. 50, \n54, 275 S.E.2d 516, 518 (1981) (reversing grant of offensive summary judgment).  The \nlength of time deemed “reasonable” to demand repayment is a “material issue of fact \nto be answered by the jury.”  Phillips & Jordan Inv. Corp. v. Ashblue Co. , 86 N.C. \nApp. 186, 188, 357 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1987).  As a result, even if the jury credits Laurie and \nMatt’s version of the facts, it must apply a reasonableness standard to the time and \nmanner of repayment.  See 759 Ventures, LLC v. GCP Apt. Inv ’rs, LLC, 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 82, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 13, 2018) (denying offensive summary \njudgment due to need for jury to “apply a reasonableness standard” in claim for \nbreach of contract). \n63. It is also undisputed that Laurie and Matt waited to demand repayment of \nthe loans until after the parties’ relationship began to deteriorate in October 2016 —\nnearly twenty years after the loans were made.  (Dep. M. Bohn 44:3–24; Dep. J. Black \n177:7–12.)  The jury may consider this conduct as well in determining what \nrepayment period is reasonable under the circumstances.  See Helms, 51 N.C. at 55, \n275 S.E.2d at 519 (“It would hardly seem reasonable, in the context of a verbal loan, \n \n \nwhere the parties have not reached an agreement as to the length of the credit period, \nto infer a term whereby large sums of cash are repayable upon demand as a matter \nof law.”). \n64. The Court therefore denies the Bohns’ motion for summary judgment as to \nthis claim.  \n2.  Breach of Contract for Vehicles   \n65. The second claim for breach of contract is based on Judith’s alleged promise \nto provide two vehicles for Laurie and Matt  in exchange for their contributions of \nlabor and money to the campground.  As alleged, Judith promised to buy a van for \nthe Bohns and also to transfer title to a camper trailer.  (See Am. Compl. p.10.)  Judith \nmoves for summary judgment, arguing that these alleged contracts run afoul of the \nstatute of frauds and the statute of limitations.  (See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 5–6.) \n66. In evaluating this claim, the Court is hampered by the dearth of evidence as \nto the terms of the contracts and how they were formed.  Take the alleged contract to \nbuy a van.  In her deposition testimony, Laurie could not recall when Judith made \nthe promise to purchase the van or if anyone else was present at the time.  (Dep. L. \nBohn 176:15–22.)  No particular make and model of van were discussed.  ( Dep. L. \nBohn 176:3–14.)  The time for performance is also unclear: Matt testified that the van \nwas promised “some day” in the future, (Dep. M. Bohn 77:9–21), and Laurie testified \nthat it was to be purchased “when my current van died,” (Dep. L. Bohn 178:8–20).   \n67. The circumstances surrounding the  camper are even less clear .  Laurie \ndenied that she is entitled to a camper.  (Dep. L. Bohn 178:21–179:3.)  Matt, on the \n \n \nother hand, testified that there is a camper already titled in his name.  (Dep. M. Bohn \n137:6–12.)  But he does not have the title, does not know if it was ever recorded, and \nhas never tried to find it .  (Dep. M. Bohn 137:13–19.)  Based on this testimony, it is \nunclear what Judith is supposed to have promised but failed to do.   \n68. Given the deep uncertainty as to the timing and nature of these contracts, \na reader may wonder  whether there was ever “a meeting of the minds of the \ncontracting parties upo n all essential terms and conditions.”  Se. Caissons, LLC v. \nChoate Constr. Co., 247 N.C. App. 104, 112, 784 S.E.2d 650, 655–56 (2016) (quoting \nQuantum Corp. Funding, Ltd. v. B.H. Bryan Bldg. Co., Inc., 175 N.C. App. 483, 490, \n623 S.E.2d 793, 798 (2006)).  Judith did not raise this issue in her brief, however.  The \nCourt therefore assumes, for purposes of summary judgment, that valid and \nenforceable contracts exist. \n69. The record also provides no basis for summary judgment on the two grounds \nraised by Judith: the statute of frauds and the statute of limitations.  Taking them in \nreverse order, the key issue for the statute of limitations is when the limitations \nperiod began to run.  On that point, the Court is left to guess.  There is no evidence \nestablishing wh en either alleged contract was made, much less when either was \nbreached.  Judith contends in her brief that Laurie placed the contract for the van in \nor around 2006, but the cited pages from Laurie’s deposition do not support that  \ncontention.  ( Compare Defs.’ Mem. in Supp.  5–6, with Dep. L. Bohn 176:15 –19.)  \nJudith has not carried her burden to show, as a matter of law, that the Bohns brought \ntheir claim outside the three-year limitations period.  \n \n \n70. So too for the statute of frauds, which requires a  “contract for the sale of \ngoods” over $500 to be in writing.  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  25-2-201(1).  It is by no means \nclear that either of the alleged cont racts is the type of “sale of goods” covered by the \nstatute.  As best the Court can tell, the camper contract wasn’t a sale at all ; it was \nperhaps a contract to transfer  a misplaced or unrecorded title .  Likewise, Judith’s \nalleged promise to purchase a van for the Bohns does not appear to be a sale of a van \nfrom Judith to the Bohns.  “Without a sale between the parties, as expressly provided \nby the statute, the statute of frauds is inapplicable and cannot be asserted as a \ndefense to the plaintiffs’ claim.”  Hering v. Haun (In re Hering), 2010 Bankr. LEXIS \n3855, at *16–17 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Oct. 28, 2010). \n71. The Court denies Judith’s motion for summary judgment as to the claim for \nbreach of contracts related to vehicles.  \nI. Affirmative Defenses \n72. Defendants assert several affirmative defenses, including waiver and \nrelease, equitable estoppel, laches, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, failure to \nmitigate damages, and standing.  In a single paragraph, the Bohns move for summary \njudgment on all of these varied defenses, asserting broadly and without citation that \n“[t]here has been no evidence to support any of these affirmative defenses.”  (Pls.’ Br. \nin Supp. 14.)  This conclusory, shotgun assertion was insufficient to carry the Bohns’ \ninitial burden to show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, to give  \nDefendants adequate notice of the supposed flaws in their defenses, or to inform the \nCourt of what issues are actually in dispute.   It is not the Court’s role to fill in the \n \n \nblanks, and as a result, the Bohns’ motion for summary judgment as to Defendants’ \naffirmative defenses is denied.  Cf. State v. Henderson , 180 N.C. 735, 736, 105 S.E. \n339, 339 (1920) (“We do not consider any matter of sufficient importance for us to \nconsider which is not of sufficient importance to be discussed in the brief.”). \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n73. For these reasons, the Court DENIES the Bohns’ motion for partial \nsummary judgment. \n74. The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Defendants’ motion for \npartial summary judgment as follows: \na. The Court GRANTS the motion as to the claims for de facto partnership, \nundue influence, and equitable estoppel.  These claims are DISMISSED \nwith prejudice. \nb. The Court DENIES the motion as to the  claims for breach of fiduciary \nduty, declaratory judgment, accounting and receiver, breach of contract \nfor money owed,  breach of contract for vehicles,  unjust enrichment, \nconstructive trust, and permanent in junction.  These claims shall \nproceed to trial. \n75. As stated in the Case Management Order, the parties shall hold a final \nmediation within 60 days of this Order and Opinion.  (ECF No. 25.)  On or before \nJune 24, 2019, the parties shall advise the Court, via e-mail to the law clerk assigned \nto this case, of their selected date for holding the mediation. \n \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 3rd day of June, 2019.   \n/s/ Adam M.
