The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion for \nsummary judgment.  The following background, drawn from the evidence submitted \nby the parties, provides context for the Court’s analysis and ruling only. \n3. This litigation has its roots in earlier litigation between Terri Crider and her \nbrother Joey. 1  Some time ago, t he siblings jointly inherited property  in Maggie \nValley, North Carolina, with a two-thirds interest going to Terri and the other third \nto Joey.  Th e property is home to several  cabins and sites for recreational vehicles , \nwhich Terri and Joey rented to vacationers under the name Smoky View Cottages & \nRV Resort.  For reasons not revealed in the record, the siblings’ relationship took an \nantagonistic turn, and a lawsuit ensued.  To settle their disputes , Terri tentatively \nagreed in early 2020 to buy Joey’s one -third interest for over half a million dollars .  \n(See, e.g., Dep. T. Crider 23:1 7–21, 25:22 –26:62; Dep. J. Kersten 13: 2–5, ECF No. \n127.4; Aff. H. Cope ¶ 4, ECF No. 127.1.) \n4. Needing help coming up with the money , Terri consulted Jorge Cure, a \nlong-time friend and licensed real estate agent.  Jorge proposed a business deal.  He \nwould find investors to supply the cash to buy Joey’s interest , and with Joey out of \nthe picture, the investors would also pay  to develop part of the resort property  as a \nPlanned Unit Development, converting the cabins and RV sites into individual units \n \n1 Throughout this opinion, the Court will refer to Terri Crider, Joey Crider, Jorge Cure, Dana \nCure, Michael Washburn, and Christine Sheffield by their first names.  The Court will also \nrefer to Mary Annette, LLC as Mary Annette, Mountain Girl Ventures, LLC as Mountain \nGirl, Twilight Developments, Inc. as Twilight, and Ozzie 1, LLC as Ozzie. \n2 Excerpts of Terri’s deposition transcript can be found at ECF Nos. 126.1, 127.3, and 129. \nfor sale and tacking on a common area with a pool and other amenities.  Terri, Jorge, \nand the investors would  then sell the units and split the income.  (See, e.g., Dep. T. \nCrider 26:7–27:20; Dep. M. Washburn 44:13–18, ECF No. 127.2.) \n5. Terri accepted Jorge’s deal.  But the devil is in the details.  She claims that \nJorge promised her two -thirds of the proceeds from all unit sales.  She also claims \nthat Jorge promised to let her continue to rent the units until they were sold, making \nher responsible for all business expenses but entitl ing her  to keep all the rental \nincome.  And she claims that Jorge promised that she would own outright four of the \nfive tracts that make up  the resort property, excepting only the area designated for \nthe Planned Unit Development.  These claims are now points of contention: Terri and \nJorge did not document their agreement , and he  disputes much of her recollection .  \n(See, e.g., Dep. T. Crider 52:24–54:11, 67:4–68:16, 106:2–7; Dep. J. Cure 136:9–137:22, \nECF No. 126.7.) \n6. Not much seems to have happened through the end of 2020.  At some point, \nJorge invited Michael to participate in the project , and  Jorge’s wife, Dana , and \nMichael’s wife, Christine, also joined .  In early 2021, Terri, Jorge, and the others  \nformed Mary Annette for the purpose of developing the individual units for sale.  They \nnamed Mountain Girl (owned by Terri), Twilight (owned by Jorge and Dana), and \nOzzie (owned by Michael and Christine) as the company’s three members.  Soon after \nits formation, Mary Annette applied for and received approval from local authorities \nfor the Planned Unit Development.  ( See, e.g., Dep. T. Crider 27:21 –28:15; Dep. J. \nKersten 18:2–8; Mary Annette Art. of Org’n , ECF No. 20 ; Zoning Bd. Application , \nECF No. 35.1.)   \n7. It was a few weeks later that the parties finalized Mary Annette’s operating \nagreement.  According to Terri, Jorge sent her a copy of the agreement, told her to \n“[f]lip through there,” and urged her to sign it “immediately.”  She  signed it without \nreading it.  (See Dep. T. Crider 95:23–96:1; see also Op. Agrmt., ECF No. 31.) \n8. Around this time, Michael brought a lender named Hunter Paschall to the \nresort property.  Michael had contacted Paschall to gauge his interest in lending the \nfunds needed to buy out Joey.  According to Paschall, the site visit was part of the \n“preliminary gatherings of why we would even loan the money on the project ,” and \nhe told Terri and Michael that t he loan would need “to be done on [tracts] C -1, C-2 \nand C-4 . . . or I won’t do the loan.”  Terri acknowledges having given Paschall a tour \nof the resort but denies having had any conversation about using tracts C-1 and C-2 \nto secure a loan .  She says that  her understanding was that  Michael was the \n“moneyman” who would “purchase Joey out” and that Paschall was Michael’s lender, \nnothing more.  (Dep. T. Crider 51:6–52:23; Dep. H. Paschall 10:7–11:2, 11:24–12:11, \nECF No. 126.5.) \n9. The closing for the purchase of Joey’s interest was set to take place on 1 \nApril 2021.  A  few days before the closing , Michael sent Terri a copy of the nearly \nfinal loan documentation from Paschall .  (See, e.g., Pls.’ Reply Br.  Ex. D, ECF No. \n132; see also Pls.’ Br. in Supp. Ex. D, ECF No. 126.4.) \n10. By all accounts, the closing was a hectic and disorderly affair.   Terri says \nthat she became aware for the first time  that Jorge, Michael, and their wives were \nnot contributing money toward the purchase of Joey’s interest and that, instead, \nMary Annette would borrow the money .  She  also learned that, to secure the loan, \nshe would have to transfer tracts C-1 and C-2 to Mary Annette.  Jorge assured Terri \nthat both tracts would be hers once the loan was repaid.  Although upset, Terri went \nthrough with the closing.  The closing documents included a Contract for Deed stating \nthat Mary Annette “shall immediately deed” tracts C-1 and C-2 back to Terri “[u]pon \npayment and satisfaction” of the mortgage.  ( See Dep. D. Cure 38:6 –39:12, ECF No. \n127.6; Dep. J. Kersten 28:12–31:12, 32:2–33:3; Contract for Deed, ECF No. 35.2; Aff. \nH. Cope, ¶¶ 14–17.) \n11. After the closing, the parties’ relationship deteriorated.  Terri confronted the \nothers after reading  Mary Annette ’s operating agreement and learn ing that \nMountain Girl, Twilight, and Ozzie were granted  equal one -third interests in the \nLLC, which she says is contrary to her understanding that Mountain Girl would own \na two-thirds interest.  More  disputes about Mary Annette’s management and about \nTerri’s rentals of the individual units followed.   Eventually, Plaintiffs sued Terri.  \n(See, e.g., Dep. T. Crider 93:2–12, 96:10–23; Dep. D. Cure Ex. 2 & 59:11–23; see also \nCompl., ECF No. 2; Am. Compl., ECF No. 53.) \n12. Terri and Mountain Girl counterclaimed, alleging that Plaintiffs schemed to \ntake Terri’s rental  business and her property .  Terri and Mountain Girl assert \ncounterclaims for fraud, breach of contract, and conversion.  They also seek to reform \nthe operating agreement to give Mountain Girl a two-thirds membership interest in \nMary Annette.  And they seek to quiet title to the individual units , alleging that \nneither Terri nor Joey transferred their interests in the individual units  as part of  \nthe closing.  (See Am. Countercl., ECF No. 55.) \n13. Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment.  (ECF No. 125 .)  The motion \nis fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing on 12 July 2024.  The motion is ripe for \ndecision. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n14. Summary judgment is appropriate when “the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In ruling on a motion \nfor summary judgment, the Court must consider the evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party, drawing all inferences in the nonmoving party’s \nfavor.  See, e.g., Morrell v. Hardin Creek, Inc., 371 N.C. 672, 680 (2018).   \n15. The moving party “bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of \na genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pennington, 356 N.C. 571, \n579 (2002).  The moving party meets its burden “by proving that an essential element \nof the opposing party’s claim is nonexistent, or by showing through discovery that the \nopposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his claim.”  \nDeWitt v. Eveready Battery Co. , 355 N.C. 672, 681 (2002) (citations and quotation \nmarks omitted).  If the moving party makes that showing, “the burden shifts to the \nnonmoving party to ‘produce a forecast of evidence demonstrating that the nonmoving \nparty will be able to make out at least a prima facie case at trial.’  ”  Cummings v. \nCarroll, 379 N.C. 347, 358 (2021) (quoting DeWitt, 355 N.C. at 682).  The nonmoving \nparty “may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his \nresponse, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific \nfacts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n16. As the Court noted in an earlier order, the allegations in the counterclaim  \ncomplaint are often confusing , especially when referring to the parties .  See Mary \nAnnette, LLC v. Crider, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 28 , at *7 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 23, 202 3) \n(discussing vague references to “Plaintiff” and “Defendant” that do not “identify[] \nwhich Plaintiff or Defendant is intended” as well as confusing references to “  ‘Third \nParty Defendants’ even though no third-party claims exist”).  The briefs in support of \nand in opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment are also confusing at \ntimes for similar reasons .  Defendants’ brief exacerbates these issues because, with \nrare exception s, it lacks supporting citations to record evidence, as required by \nBusiness Court Rule 7.5 and the case management order .  (See Case Management \nOrder ¶ 28, ECF No. 52.) \n17. The Court has aimed to understand the counterclaim complaint and to \nconstrue it accurately without expanding Defendants’ counterclaims beyond what \nthey fairly allege.  Likewise, the Court has done its best to read each side’s arguments \nfairly while confining its analysis to arguments raised in a timely and procedurally \nappropriate manner.  \nA. Intentional Misrepresentation and Fraud \n18. Fraud has five “essential elements”: (a) a false representation or \nconcealment of a material fact, (b) calculated to deceive, (c) made with intent to \ndeceive, (d) that did in fact deceive, and (e) that resulted in damage to the injured \nparty.  Rowan Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. U.S. Gypsum Co. , 332 N.C. 1, 17 (1992).   The \nclaimant must show not only that s he actually relied on the misrepresentation but \nalso that her reliance was reasonable.  See Forbis v. Neal, 361 N.C. 519, 527 (2007).   \nReasonableness is a matter to b e determined by the factfinder “unless the facts are \nso clear that they support only one conclusion.”  Id.  \n19. Defendants claim to have been the victims of a fraudulent scheme to deprive \nthem of their interest in the resort property and their vacation rental business.  Based \non a fair reading of the counterclaim complaint , there are two misrepresentations \nthat make up the fraud claim. \n20. The first alleged misrepresentation concerns the source of the funds used to \nbuy Joey’s interest and pay for the Planned Unit Development .  As alleged,  Jorge, \nMichael, and their spouses falsely promised to contribute the needed funds when, in \nfact, they intended to have Mary Annette borrow the money from a third-party lender.  \nThe result , according to the counterclaim complaint , is that t hey obtained  t heir \nmembership interests in Mary Annette  and their right to share in the  potential \nprofits from the Planned Unit Development  at no cost to themselves.   (See Am. \nCountercl. ¶¶ 7, 14(a)–(d).) \n21. The second alleged misrepresentation occurred during the closing for the \npurchase of Joey’s interest.  Defendants allege that they learned for the first time at \nthe closing that Mary Annette could not obtain the loan to buy Joey’s interest unless \nTerri conveyed tracts C-1 and C-2 to the company to be used as  collateral.  Though \nupset, Defendants allege, Terri acquiesced because Jorge and t he others pressured \nher to approve the loan documents while falsely promising “that she would be alright \nand that they would make things right.”  (Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 9, 14(e), 15.)   \n22. Plaintiffs contend that the undisputed evidence, including Terri’s deposition \ntestimony, shows that she knowingly assented to  all the material terms of the  \npurchase of Joey’s interest at the time of closing and therefore could not have \nreasonably relied on earlier, contrary representations.  The Court agrees. \n23. There’s no getting around the fact that Terri signed the closing documents \nfully aware of what they said.  Th ose documents “plainly contradicted” any alleged \nmisrepresentations about the source of the funds used to buy Joey’s interest .  \nAtkinson v. Lackey , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 21, at *40 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, 2015)  \n(granting summary judgment).  Knowing  that Mary Annette was borrowing money \nto buy Joey’s interest and that tracts C -1 and C -2 would serve as collateral for the \nloan, Terri and Mountain Girl  went through with the closing anyway.   Simply put,  \nTerri “could not have been deceived as to a material fact of which she was already \naware,” and no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.  Watts v. Cumberland Cnty. \nHosp. Sys., Inc. , 317 N.C. 110, 117 (1986) ; see also Sullivan v. Mebane Packaging \nGroup, Inc. , 158 N.C. App. 19, 27 (2003) ( affirming summary judgment when \n“plaintiff conceded [defendant] had provided him with that information”); Jay Group, \nLtd. v. Glasgow , 139 N.C. App. 595 , 601 (2000) (concluding that “plaintiffs’ \nknowledge” of truth “in advance of” transaction was “fatal to their claims”). \n24. Plaintiffs also contend that any alleged representation that “they would \nmake things right” is not sufficiently specific and definite to support a claim for fraud.  \nAgain, the Court agrees.   \n25. At best, the alleged statement is  a vague promise lacking  “clear terms”  \nrather than  the kind of “definite and specific” representation of an existing fact \nneeded to support a fraud claim .  Batten v. Welch, 2023 N.C. App. LEXIS 307, at * 9 \n(N.C. Ct. App. 2023) (unpublished) (citing Charlotte Motor Speedway, LLC v. Cnty. of \nCabarrus, 230 N.C. App. 1, 10 (2013)); cf. Knowles v. Conerly, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 131, \nat *35 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 3, 2024) (concluding that allegation that one party \npromised the other “would be taken care of” did not amount to allegation of fraud).  \nMoreover, even if the statement were sufficiently definite, the failure to fulfill the \npromise, standing alone, is not actionable fraud. 3  The evidence must show that the \nperson making the promise did so with no intent to c arry it out.  See, e.g., Whitley v. \nO’Neal, 5 N.C. App. 136, 139 (1969). \n \n3 Neither Defendants’ pleading nor their brief clarifies what concrete action they believe the \nalleged promise to “make things right” would have entailed.  The only arguable candidate, as \nbest the Court can tell, is that Defendants believe it to have been a promise to restore Terri’s \nownership of tracts C-1 and C-2 once the development was complete and the loans had been \npaid.  If so, that promise was fulfilled a t the closing when Washburn signed a Contract for \nDeed on Mary Annette’s behalf stating that the company “shall immediately deed” tracts C-1 \nand C-2 to Terri “[u]pon payment and satisfaction” of the mortgage.  (Contract for Deed.) \n26. Defendants needed “to come forth with evidence”  on these points  “or \notherwise suffer entry of summary judgment .”  Econo -Travel Motor Hotel Corp. v. \nTaylor, 301 N.C. 200, 205 (1980).   Yet they do not address this alleged \nmisrepresentation at all in their opposition brief.  “Having offered no argument about \nor evidence of the [alleged] misrepresentation,” Defendants  have “abandoned it.”  \nBucci v. Burns, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 79, at *17 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 30, 2020). \n27. There appear to be two other arguments in  the opposition brief.  First, \nDefendants argue that Terri felt pressured and confused at the closing.  This \nargument is facially insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact because Defendants \ncite no law or evidence to support their position.  Moreover, the undisputed evidence \nshows that Terri knew that a lender would be involved as early as February 2021 and \nthat she received a copy of the loan terms and conditions several days before the \nclosing.  (See Dep. T. Crider 51:16–17, 52:1–5; Pls.’ Reply Br. Ex. D.)  Terri had ample \ntime to ask questions, raise objections, or call off the closing  if she believed the loan \nterms were too unpalatable or confusing.   \n28. Defendants also argue that Jorge and the others  defrauded them by \nreneging on their agreement to let Terri rent the individual units in the Planned Unit \nDevelopment until they were developed and sold.  This theory comes too late.   \nAlthough Defendants allege a breach of contract  related to the unit rentals , the \ngeneral rule is that “an unfilled promise cannot be made the basis for an action for \nfraud.”  Pierce v. Am. Fidelity Fire Ins. Co. , 240 N.C. 567, 571 (1954).   To be \nfraudulent, the promise must be “made with no intention to carry it out. ”  Id.  Here, \nDefendants have not alleged a false promise of that kind or any other \nmisrepresentation related to unit rentals, certainly not with the particularity needed \nfor fraud claims.  See N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(a).  “This unasserted theory of liability is no \ndefense to summary judgment.”  Brown v. Secor, 2020 NCBC LEXIS 134, at *20 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Nov. 13, 2020); see also Atkinson, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 21, at *42–43 n.15. \n29. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion for summary judgment as to the \ncounterclaim for fraud. \nB. Reformation \n30. Courts have equitable authority “to reframe written instruments where, \nthrough mutual mistake or the unilateral mistake of one party induced by the fraud \nof the other, the written instrument fails to embody the parties’ actual, original \nagreement.”  Metropolitan Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co. v. Dillard , 126 N.C. App. 795, 798 \n(1997) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  But there is “a strong presumption in \nfavor of the correctness of the instrument as written and executed, for it must be \nassumed that the partie s knew what they agreed and have chosen fit and proper \nwords to express that agreement in its entirety.”  Hice v. Hi- Mil, Inc., 301 N.C. 647, \n651 (1981) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, “where no trick or device \nhad prevented a person from reading the paper which he has signed or has accepted \nas the contract prepared by the other party, his failure to read when he had an \nopportunity to do so will bar his right to reformation.”  Setzer v. Old Republic Life Ins. \nCo., 257 N.C. 396, 401 (1962). \n31. The counterclaim complaint includes a demand to reform Mary Annette’s  \noperating agreement.  Section III(A) of t he operating agreement states that the \ncompany’s members are Mountain Girl, Twilight, and Ozzie, and grants to each a \none-third membership interest.  As alleged, though, this allocation i s inconsistent \nwith the parties’ true agreement that Mountain Girl would hold a two-thirds interest \nand that Twilight and Ozzie would split the remaining one -third.  ( See Am. \nCountercls. ¶ 22.) \n32. Plaintiffs argue that  the evidence does not show fraud or mutual mistake \nand that the express terms of the operating agreement therefore control.  They are \ncorrect. \n33. The undisputed evidence shows that Terri received a copy of the operating \nagreement and signed it on Mountain Girl’s behalf without reading it .  (See Dep. T. \nCrider 95:3–5 (“I received the document on a DocuSign .  . . with Jorge calling me, \ntelling me to sign it.”), 96:1 (“So I just signed it and moved on.”).)  The agreement that \nshe signed states that all members “have been advised of their right to seek the advice \nof independent legal counsel before signing” and that they “have entered into this \nAgreement freely and voluntarily and without any coercion or duress.”  (Op. Agrmt. \nXIII.)  Defendants do not contend that Terri is infirm, uneducated, or suffering some \nother disability or special circumstance that might have excused her decision not to \nread the operating agreement.  Nor do they contend that anyone misrepresented the \ncontents of the document  or that Terri was denied the  opportunity to read it.  \nAlthough Terri says that Jorge urged her to sign the document “immediately,” she \nconcedes that he told her to “[f]lip through there” before signing.  ( Dep. T. Crider \n95:24–25.)   \n34. Without some evidence of a trick or device that prevented Terri from reading \nthe operating agreement, there is no genuine issue of material fact for a jury to decide.  \nHer “failure to read” the agreement on this record “bars [Mountain Girl] from contract \nreformation” as a matter of law.   Cobb v. Pa. Life Ins. Co. , 215 N.C. App. 268, 282 \n(2011) (affirming summary judgment);  see also W.B. Coppersmith & Sons, Inc. v. \nAetna Ins. Co., 222 N.C. 14, 17 (1942) (concluding that complaining parties were not \nentitled to reformation when they “had free and full opportunity to read the policy \nand discover its contents, and if found not in accord with their understanding to have \nhad it rewritten or to have declined to accept it, but failed to avail themselves of this \nopportunity”); Underwood v. Nw. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 2002 N.C. App. LEXIS 2035, at \n*7 (2002) (unpublished) (affirming dismissal of reformation claim given “no indication \nthat plaint iff lacked the capacity or the opportunity to discover any fraud or \nmisrepresentation made at the time” of contract); Richardson v. Webb, 119 N.C. App. \n782, 785 (1995) (affirming directed verdict  when complaining parties “failed to \nproduce evidence showing their failure to read the release was caused by a trick or \ndevice”). \n35. The Court grants the motion for summary judgment as to the reformation \nclaim. \nC. Breach of Contract \n36. To establish a breach of contract, the complaining party must show that \nthere is a valid contract and that a term of the contract was breached.  See Poor v. \nHill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26 (2000).   “A contract not required to be in writing may be \npartly written and partly oral.”  Neal v. Marrone, 239 N.C. 73, 77 (1953).  But when \ncontracting parties reduce their agreement to a final writing, “all prior and \ncontemporaneous negotiations or agreements, whether oral or written, are merged \ninto the writing, which thus becomes the exclusive source of the parties ’ rights and \nobligations with respect to the particular transaction or the part thereof intended to \nbe covered by it.”  Borden, Inc. v. Brower, 284 N.C. 54, 60–61 (1973) (cleaned up); see \nalso Oak Island Southwind Realty, Inc. v. Pruitt, 89 N.C. App. 471, 473 (1988) (“When \na final writing is executed or ‘integrated’ all prior or contemporaneous negotiations \nor agreements, whether written or oral, are said to be ‘merged’ into the writing.”). \n37. Here, Terri and Mountain Girl  assert a counterclaim for breach of an oral \ncontract, alleging that “Third Party Defendants have breached the terms of  their \ncontract to provide capital in the formation of Mary Annette, LLC,  and have failed \nand refused to comply with the terms for developing the subject property .”  (Am. \nCountercl. ¶  20.)  Th ough confusing, the  reference to “Third Party Defendants”  \napparently is intended to mean all  Plaintiffs other than Mary Annette —in other \nwords, Jorge, Dana, Michael, Christine, Twilight, and Ozzie.\n4 \n38. Plaintiffs point to the merger clause in Mary Annette’s operating agreement.  \nThe clause states that the operating agreement “contains the entire understanding \namong the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes \nall prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings, inducements or \nconditions, express or implied, oral or written, except as he rein contained.”  (Op. \n \n4 At an earlier point in the case, the Court realigned the parties to simplify the pleadings and \nmore accurately reflect the claimants’ interests.  The reference to “Third Party Defendants” \nappears to be an artifact from the pleadings that were in place before the realignment.  (See \nScheduling Order, ECF No. 50.) \nAgrmt. § XIV(I).)  This language, Plaintiffs contend, extinguishes any preexisting oral \ncontract.5 \n39. “North Carolina recognizes the validity of merger clauses and has \nconsistently upheld them.”  Zinn v. Walker, 87 N.C. App. 325, 333 (1987).  A merger  \nclause works hand in hand with the parol evidence rule, which “excludes prior or \ncontemporaneous oral agreements which are inconsistent with a written contract if \nthe written contract contains the complete agreement of the parties.”  Phelps-Dickson \nBuilders, L.L.C. v. Amerimann Partners, 172 N.C. App. 427, 436 (2005).  A court may \nset the clause aside if it is  the product of f raud, bad faith, or  similarly unfair  \ncircumstances.  See Zinn, 87 N.C. App. at 333. \n40. In their opposition brief , Defendants argue that fraud negates the merger \nclause.  This is unpersuasive for the reasons discussed above.   Defendants have not \noffered evidence of circumstances that would  excuse Terri’s failure to read the \noperating agreement before signing it.  Likewise, it is undisputed that Terri was \naware of the closing documents’ terms when she signed them.  Thus, Defendants’ \ndeficient allegations of fraud furnish no reason to set aside the merger clause. \n41. Defendants also argue that parts of the alleged oral contract are  distinct \nfrom the subject matter of the operating agreement and, thus, outside the scope of its \n \n5 For the first time in the reply brief, Plaintiffs point to a second merger clause in one of the \nclosing documents.  A document titled “Deed of Trust Loan Guaranty” includes a provision  \nstating that it “represents the final agreement between the parties and may not be \ncontradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the \nparties” and that “[t]here are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.”  (Deed of \nTrust Loan Guaranty at 2, ECF No. 126.3.)  The Court will not address this belated argument.  \nSee BCR 7.7 (“the Court may decline to consider issues or arguments raised by the moving \nparty for the first time in a reply brief”). \nmerger clause.   It appears that Defendants are referring to  three aspects of the \nalleged oral contract: first, terms about how to  fund the Planned Unit Development \nand divide the proceeds; second, terms about Terri’s right to rent the individual units \nuntil they were sold; and third, terms about who would hold title to the real property. \n42. The funding of the development and the division of proceeds from unit sales \nare plainly within the subject matter of the operating agreement .  Mary Annette’s \nexpress purpose is “[t]o Purchase and renovate Smoky View Cottages and RV Spots \nand sell to individual owners.”  (Op. Agrmt. § II(A).)  Its operating agreement includes \nterms addressing the identity of the members and size of their interests, the form and \namount of the members’ capital contributions, and the timing and allocation of \ndistributions to members , along with other terms about  internal governance.  (See, \ne.g., Op. Agrmt. §§ III(A), III(B), IV(C).)  Even if the parties had orally agreed to fund \nthe development in a different way or to divide sale proceeds in different proportions, \nthat oral agreement would have merged into the written operating agreement.  As a \nresult, Defendants cannot maintain an action for breach of those terms .  See, e.g., \nCraig v. Kessing, 297 N.C. 32, 35 (1979) (holding that evidence of oral agreement as \nto “the purchase price and the expiration date” was “incompetent” because the terms \n“were terms on the written instrument”); Phelps-Dickson Builders, 172 N.C. App. at \n436 (concluding that “plaintiff’s attempt to enlarge or vary [defendant’s] duties from \nthose expressly undertaken in the contract is barred by the written terms of the \ncontract and the merger clause”). \n43. The alleged oral agreement concerning unit rentals is a different matter.  By \nits own terms, the  operating agreement’s  merger clause applies  only to “prior or \ncontemporaneous” oral agreements, not later agreements.  (Op. Agrmt. § XIV(I).)  Yet \nsome evidence t ends to show that the parties  maintained an oral agreement \nconcerning unit rentals after signing the written operating agreement that governed \nMary Annette’s operations.  (See, e.g., Dep. M. Washburn 40:16–22 (testifying that \nthe understanding, at the time of the closing, was that Terri  “was going to continue \nto operate her business”).)  In any event, Plaintiffs do not address this aspect of the \nalleged oral agreement in their opening brief and, as a result, have not shown that \nthey are entitled to summary judgment. \n44. The remaining issues concern title to the resort property.  Defendants allege \nan oral agreement in which Terri was to receive tracts C-1 and C-2 outright, following \nthe purchase of Joey’s interest, while maintaining a two -thirds interest in the \nindividual units.  ( See Am. Countercl. ¶ 5(a).)  These terms are outside the subject \nmatter of  the operating agreement, which does not address conveyances of real \nproperty.6 \n45. In sum, Defendants may not claim a breach of an alleged oral agreement \nconcerning the funding of the Planned Unit Development and division of proceeds .  \nBut the Court denies the motion for summary judgment as to the alleged oral \n \n6 Neither side addressed whether an oral contract to divide title to the resort property \nbetween Terri and Mary Annette runs afoul of the Statute of Frauds .  See  N.C.G.S. § 22-2 \n(requiring “[a]ll contracts to sell or convey any lands” to be in writing); see also Ludwig v. \nWalter, 75 N.C. App. 584, 586 (1985) (invalidating an oral promise to convey land).  The Court \nintends to address that issue during the pretrial process. \nagreement concerning Terri’s ability to rent the individual units and as to the alleged \noral agreement related to ownership of the resort property. \nD. Quiet Title \n46. “An action may be brought by any person against another who claims an \nestate or interest in real property adverse to him for the purpose of determining such \nadverse claims.”  N.C.G.S. §  41-10.  “The beneficial purpose of this section is to free \nthe land of the cloud resting upon it and make its title clear and indisputable, so that \nit may enter the channels of commerce and trade unfettered and without the \nhandicap of suspicion.”  Heath v. Turner, 309 N.C. 483, 488 (1983). \n47. The parties dispute the ownership of the individual units that make up the \nPlanned Unit Development.  Terri and her brother Joey executed deeds of transfer to \ngive Mary Annette their interests in tract “C -4” as it “appear[s] on that certain plat \nof survey titled, ‘Final Plat for Smokey View Cottages and RV Resort’ by L. Kevin \nEnsley.”  (Pls.’ Br. in Supp. Ex. D.)  But Terri claims that the reference to “C-4” means \nonly the common area and excludes  the individual units located within the tract’s \nperimeter.  She  asks for a declaration that she  remains the owner of a two- thirds \ninterest in the individual units  and that Joey remain s the owner of  the other \none-third.  (See Am. Countercls. ¶¶ 28, 29.) \n48. In briefing their disputes about this claim, the parties essentially rehash old \narguments that they previously made in connection with Terri’s motion for summary \njudgment.  Having thoroughly addressed these arguments once, the Court need not \ndiscuss them in depth here.  In short, the Court concludes that the ownership of the \nindividual units is a live issue in this case and has not been fully and finally litigated \nat any point, as Plaintiffs contend.  The Court also concludes that a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact exists because the deeds at issue are ambiguous and the extrinsic \nevidence is disputed.  See Mary Annette, LLC v. Crider, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 126, at \n*5–10 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 11, 2023)  (addressing nearly identical evidence and \narguments in denying Terri’s motion for summary judgment). \n49. Accordingly, the Court denies the motion as to the quiet title counterclaim. \nE. Conversion \n50. Conversion is the “unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of \nownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of \ntheir condition or the exclusion of an owner’s rights.”  Peed v. Burleson’s, Inc. , 244 \nN.C. 437, 439 (1956) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  “Where there has been \nno wrongful taking or disposal of the goods, and the defendant has merely come \nrightfully into possession and then refused to surrender them, demand and refusal \nare necessary to the existence of the tort.”  White v. Consol. Planning, Inc., 166 N.C. \nApp. 283, 310–11 (2004) (citation and quotation marks omitted).   \n51. The counterclaim complaint alleges conversion of the personal property that \nTerri used in her vacation rental business.  This property includes “trailer cabins, \npark models, maintenance equipment, [and] tools ,” among other things.   (Am. \nCountercls. ¶ 31.) \n52. Although Plaintiffs seek summary judgment as to this claim, the basis for \ntheir motion is unclear.  They appear to concede that the alleged personal property \nbelongs to Terri.  And they do not point to evidence to show either that they have not \nexercised the right of ownership over that property or that they rightfully came into \npossession of it.  This means that Plaintiffs have not carried their “initial burden of \ndemonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., \n356 N.C. at 579.   \n53. The Court therefore denies the motion as to the conversion claim. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n54. For these reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part  \nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as follows: \na. The Court GRANTS the motion as to the counterclaims for  fraud and \nreformation.  The Court enters summary judgment in Plaintiffs’ favor \nas to these claims and DISMISSES them with prejudice. \nb. The Court DENIES  the motion as to the counterclaims for  quiet title \nand conversion.  These claims shall proceed to trial. \nc. The Court GRANTS  the motion as to the counterclaim for breach of \ncontract to the extent  that it is  based on an alleged oral agreement \nconcerning the funding of the Planned Unit Development and division \nof proceeds  and DISMISSES this aspect of the breach of contract \ncounterclaim with prejudice.  The Court DENIES  the motion as to the \nalleged oral agreement concerning Terri’s ability to rent the individual \nunits and as to the alleged oral agreement related to ownership of the \nresort property.   The claim shall proceed to trial subject to this \nlimitation. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 13th day of December, 2024. \n \n \n         /s/ Adam M. Conrad    \n      Adam M.
