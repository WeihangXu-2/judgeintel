  "raw_text": "STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE\nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n12 CVS 20909 \n \nTAIDOC TECHNOLOGY \nCORPORATION, \n \nPlaintiff, \n \nv. \n \nOK BIOTECH CO., LTD., \n \nDefendant. \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION \n \n \n \n \n{1} THIS MATTER  is before the Court upon Defendant OK Biotech Co., \nLtd.’s (“Defendant” or “OK Biotech”) Motion for Summary Judgment on its Twelfth \nAffirmative Defense of Release (“Summary Judgment Motion” or “Motion”) in the \nabove-captioned case.  After considering OK Biotech’s Motion, briefs in support of \nand opposition to the Motion, the appropriate evidence of record, and the arguments \nof counsel at the May 15, 2015 hearing he ld in this matter, the Court hereby \nDENIES OK Biotech’s Motion. \nErwin, Bishop, Capitano & Moss, P.A., by Joseph W. Moss, Jr. and J. Daniel \nBishop, for Plaintiff TaiDoc Technology Corporation. \n \nFoley & Lardner LLP, by George C. Be ck, Michael J. Lockerby, and Brian J. \nKapatkin, and Clements Bernard PLLC, by Christopher L. Bernard and \nLawrence A. Baratta, Jr., for Defendant OK Biotech Co., Ltd. \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY AND RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n{2} While findings of fact are not necessary or proper on a motion for \nsummary judgment, “it is helpful to the parties and the courts for the trial judge to \narticulate a summary of the material facts which he considers are not at issue and \nwhich justify entry of judgment.” Collier v. Collier, 204 N.C. App. 160, 161–62, 693 \nS.E.2d 250, 252 (2010) (quotations and cita tion omitted).  Therefore, the Court \nTaiDoc Tech. Corp. v. OK Biotech Co., Ltd., 2015 NCBC 71.\n \n \nlimits its factual recitation to the undispute d material facts necessary to decide the \nMotion, and not to resolve issues of material fact. \nA. The Prior Action Involving DDI \n{3} Plaintiff TaiDoc Technology Corporatio n (“TaiDoc”) has been involved in \nprior litigation with non-party Diagnostic Devices, Inc. (“DDI”), and has brought the \ncurrent action against Defendant OK Biotec h, all primarily arising out of DDI’s \npurchase of blood glucose meters and test strips from TaiDoc for resale in the \nUnited States between 2005 and 2008 and DDI’s decision in 2008 to terminate its \nrelationship with TaiDoc and purchase these products instead from OK Biotech.   \n{4} The first lawsuit was filed by DDI in Mecklenburg County Superior \nCourt against several of TaiDoc’s customer s, alleging that these customers were \ninterfering with DDI’s Sales Exclusive Agreement with TaiDoc (the “149-Pharma” \ncase).\n1  On April 4, 2008, the 149-Pharma ca se was removed to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Western District of North Carolina and assigned case number \n3:08CV-149. \n{5} On December 5, 2008, DDI filed another complaint, this time against \nTaiDoc in the United States District Court for the Western District of North \nCarolina (case number 3:08CV-559) (the “2008 Case”), alleging breach of the Sales \nExclusive Agreement, libel, tortious inte rference with prospective advantage, \nviolation of the federal Lanham Act, and un fair competition.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., \nEx. 1-1C.)   \n{6} On June 18, 2010, the 149-Pharma case and the 2008 Case were \nconsolidated for trial.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 1, n.3.) \n                                                 \n1 On March 1, 2006, DDI and TaiDoc entered into th e Sales Exclusive Agreement.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. \nMot., Ex. 1-1C at p. 3.)  The Sales Exclusive Agreement “prohibited DDI from selling any competing \nproducts within the defined ‘territory’ of the United States and provided for confidentiality of \ninformation exchanged in the course of the relationship.” (Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot., pp. 3–4 (citing Def.’s \nBr. Supp. Mot., Ex. 1-1C at pp. 3–6).)  The Sa les Exclusive Agreement was amended October 19, \n2006 and December 3, 2007, expanding the product list and territory, extending the original term by \nfive years to March 1, 2015, and reaffirming the part ies’ confidentiality obligation.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. \nMot., Ex. 1-1C at pp. 3–4.) \n \n \n \n{7} On September 7, 2011, Prodigy Diabetes Care, LLC (“Prodigy”), 2 Mr. \nRichard Admani (“Admani”), and Mr. Ramzi Abulhaj (“Abulhaj”)3 (collectively with \nDDI, the “DDI Parties”) were joined in th e 2008 Case as third-party defendants by \nTaiDoc. (Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot., p. 5; see Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Exs. 1-1F, 1-1G, 1-1I.)  \nTaiDoc asserted in its counterclaims that beginning in 2009, DDI, while aware of its \ndebts and obligations to TaiDoc, transferre d TaiDoc’s trade secrets to affiliates, \nsubsidiaries, and or related companies, including Prodigy.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., \nEx. 1-1E.)  TaiDoc’s claims ag ainst the DDI Parties included, \ninter alia , \nmisappropriation of trade secrets, unjust enrichment, fraud, fraudulent conveyance, \nand unfair and deceptive trade practices.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 1-1E.)   \n{8} DDI and one of TaiDoc’s customers, Pharma Supply, settled and filed a \nstipulation of dismissal in the 149-Pharma  case on March 12, 2012.  (Pl.’s Resp. \nOpp. Mot., p. 5.)  TaiDoc then stipulated to a voluntary dismissal of its counterclaim \nfor misappropriation of trade secrets agai nst the DDI Parties, pursuant to which \nthe federal court entered an order dismissing the misappropriation of trade secrets \nclaim with prejudice.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Exs. 1-1F, 1-1G.)  \n{9} The 2008 Case was then tried in federal court before the Honorable Max \nO. Cogburn, Jr., and on March 23, 2012, the jury returned a verdict that was not \ndecisively in favor of either TaiDoc or the DDI Parties.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 1; \nsee Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot., Ex. 13, Verdict Form.)  On TaiDoc’s counterclaims, the \njury found that DDI had breached the Sales Exclusive Agreement, Abulhaj, \nAdmani, and DDI had not engaged in ac ts constituting fraud, and DDI had \ncommitted an unfair trade practice.  (Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot., Ex. 13, Verdict Form.)  \nSpecifically, the jury found that DDI misrepresented its intent to be bound by the \nconfidentiality provisions of the Sales Ex clusive Agreement, DDI delivered TaiDoc’s \nconfidential information to OK Biotech, DDI asked TaiDoc to file a 510K application \n                                                 \n2 Prodigy at all relevant times was and currently is an affiliate, subsidiary, and/or related company \nof DDI.  (Compl. ¶ 6; see Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 5, fn. 6.) \n \n3 It appears undisputed that Admani and Abul haj were the dominating members, managers, \nshareholders, officers, and directors of DDI and Prodigy. (Compl. ¶ 9.) \n \n \nwith the intent to use TaiDoc’s competitors to develop identical products using \nTaiDoc’s confidential information,4 “DDI falsely represented to TaiDoc that it would \nuse a 510K filed in DDI’s name in furthe rance of TaiDoc’s business and/or to \ncontinue its business relationship with TaiDoc,” and “DDI failed to disclose to \nTaiDoc that it had entered into discussions with OK Biotech . . . prior to requesting \n[that] TaiDoc file a 510K in DDI’s name.”  (Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot., Ex. 13, Verdict \nForm.) \n{10} After the verdict, the parties to the 2008 Case agreed to settle the case by \na written agreement, and on March 30, 2012, before entry of final judgment, \nTaiDoc, DDI, Prodigy, Admani, and Abul haj executed a Settlement Agreement and \nRelease (“Release Agreement”), (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 2), and a stipulation of \ndismissal with prejudice, pursuant to which the federal court entered an order \ndismissing the 2008 Case, (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 1-1I).  Defendant OK Biotech \nwas not a signatory to the Release Agreement.  (\nSee Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 2.)  \nB. The Prior Federal Court Action Involving OK Biotech \n{11} On May 10, 2012, approximately six weeks after executing the Release \nAgreement, TaiDoc sued OK Biotech an d John Does 1–5 in the United States \nDistrict Court for the East ern District of Pennsylvania, Case No. 2:12–cv–02566.  \nThe case was later transferred to the Western District of North Carolina and \ndesignated as Case No. 3:12-cv-00654 (the “2012 Trade Secret Litigation”). \n{12} TaiDoc’s claims against OK Biotech in the 2012 Trade Secret Litigation \nare similar to its claims against OK Biotech in the current action, excluding a claim \nfor violation of Section 43(a) of the federal Lanham Act. \n                                                 \n4 Medical devices such as the blood glucose meters and test strips TaiDoc sold to DDI are required to \nbe registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) by submitting a 510K \nRegistration (“510K(s)”).  (Compl. ¶ 40; \nsee Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 1-1C.)  While portions of the \n510Ks are available to the public, confidential and pr oprietary information is kept private.  (Compl. \n¶ 41; see Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 1-1C.)   \n \n \n \n{13} On October 30, 2012, OK Biotech filed a motion to dismiss the 2012 \nTrade Secret Litigation in federal court in Charlotte, and TaiDoc voluntarily \ndismissed its claims without prejudice on November 16, 2012.  \nC. The Current Action Involving OK Biotech \n{14} Later on the same day that TaiDoc voluntarily dismissed its claims in the \n2012 Trade Secret Litigation, TaiDoc commenced the current action in this Court \nagainst OK Biotech by filing a Rule 3 Summons and Application and Order \nExtending Time to File Complaint. \n{15} On December 6, 2012, TaiDoc filed its Complaint in this action, generally \nalleging that OK Biotech was involved in  an unlawful scheme and conspiracy with \nDDI and Prodigy “to obtain and use TaiDoc’s confidential and proprietary \ninformation and trade secrets to unfairly compete with TaiDoc” and that “OK \nBiotech independently interfered with TaiDoc’s contract with DDI and with \nprospective business opportunities, misappropriated trade secrets and engaged in \nunfair and deceptive acts and practices and unfair competition.”  (Compl. ¶ 10.)   \n{16} TaiDoc brought claims against OK Bi otech for fraud (as an alleged co-\nconspirator with DDI), facilitating fr aud, aiding and abetting fraud, \nmisappropriation of trade secrets under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-152 \net seq. , unfair \ntrade practices and unfair competition  under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 et seq. , \ntortious interference with contract, tortio us interference with prospective economic \nadvantage, unjust enrichment, and injunctive relief.  (See Compl., pp. 14, 16, 17, 19, \n22, 24–26.) \n{17} On December 24, 2012, Prodigy transf erred and assigned ownership and \nregistration of several 510Ks to OK Biotech by written document (the “Transfer and \nAssignment of 510Ks”).  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 6.)  \n{18} On February 6, 2013, DDI and Pr odigy merged, and Prodigy became \nDDI’s successor entity.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 5, fn. 6.) \n{19} On February 14, 2013, OK Biotech designated this action as a mandatory \ncomplex business case, and on February 20, 2013 the case was assigned to this \nCourt (Murphy, J.) and subsequently assigned to the undersigned on July 1, 2014. \n \n \n{20} On March 19, 2013, OK Biotech acquired a forty-five percent (45%) \nminority membership interest in Prodigy from Admani and Abulhaj.  (Def.’s Br. \nSupp. Mot., Ex. 5.) \n{21} On April 29, 2014, OK Biotech entered into an Assignment and \nDesignation of Settlement Agreement and Contingent Release of Indemnity \n(“Designation of Release Agreement”) with Prodigy.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 9.)  \n{22}  On November 17, 2014, OK Biotec h filed a Rule 12(c) Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleadings, which this Court converted into a motion for summary \njudgment by Order and Opinion dated March 16, 2015. \n{23} OK Biotech refiled its Rule 12(c) Motion as the Summary Judgment \nMotion on March 20, 2015; TaiDoc filed its Response on May 1, 2015; and OK \nBiotech filed its Reply on May 6, 2015.  Th is Court held a hearing on OK Biotech’s \nSummary Judgment Motion on May 15, 2015. \n{24} The time for briefing, submissions, and arguments has now passed, and \nthe Motion is ripe for resolution. \nII.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{25} “Summary judgment is appropriate ‘if the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if \nany, show that there is no genuine issue as  to any material fact and that any party \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’”  Variety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem \nLogistics Traffic Servs., LLC, 365 N.C. 520, 523, 723 S.E.2d 744, 747 (2012) (quoting \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (2011)).  A fact is “material” if its “resolution . . . is so essential \nthat the party against whom it is resolved may not prevail.”  McNair v. Boyette, 282 \nN.C. 230, 235, 192 S.E. 2d 457, 460 (1972) (quotations and citations omitted).  The \nmoving party bears “‘the burden of clearly establishing lack of a triable issue’ to the \ntrial court,” N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sadler , 365 N.C. 178, 182, 711 \nS.E.2d 114, 116 (2011) (quoting N.C. Nat’l Bank v. Gillespie, 291 N.C. 303, 310, 230 \nS.E.2d 375, 379 (1976)), and may meet this burden by proving the opposing party’s \nclaims are “barred by an affirmative defense.”  Variety Wholesalers , 365 N.C. at \n \n \n523, 723 S.E.2d at 747 (quoting Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83, 530 S.E.2d 829, \n835 (2000)).  \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n{26} OK Biotech bases its Motion on the Mutual Release provision of the \nMarch 30, 2012 Release Agreement between  TaiDoc, DDI, Prodigy, Admani, and \nAbulhaj.  Although acknowledging that it is neither a party to nor an intended \nbeneficiary of the Release Ag reement, OK Biotech contends that it is nonetheless a \n“successor,” “member,” and “designee” under the Release Agreement, and thus is \nreleased from TaiDoc’s claims in this action, by virtue of certain transactions OK \nBiotech entered after the Release Agreement was executed.  As explained below, the \nCourt disagrees with OK Biotech’s contentions and concludes that OK Biotech’s \nMotion for Summary Judgment on its Tw elfth Affirmative Defense of Release \nshould be denied. \n{27} The Release Agreement provides in relevant part as follows: \n4.  Mutual Releases . Each Party, defined in this Agreement as \nincluding the Party’s predecessors, successors, directors, officers, \nmanagers, members, and their re spective heirs, executors and \ndesignees, hereby releases, remises, quitclaims, and forever discharges \nthe other Parties (including that party’s predecessors, successors, \ndirectors, officers, managers, me mbers, and their attorneys and \nexperts retained in this Action fo r acts within the scope of their \nretention), and their respective heirs, executors and designees, from \nany and all claims whatsoever brought in, or that could have been \nbrought in, the Action, or that in any way relate to the claims brought \nin, or that could have been brought in, the Action, whether in law or in \nequity, whether known or unknown, except solely for claims to \nenforcement of the terms of this Agreement. \n((Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 2, ¶ 4) (underline emphasis added).)   \n{28} OK Biotech argues that it became a “successor” under the Release \nAgreement because on March 19, 2013, OK Biotech purchased a forty-five percent \n(45%) membership interest in Prodigy from Admani and Abulhaj and thereby \nsucceeded to the rights Admani and Abulha j had obtained as parties released from \nTaiDoc’s claims under the Release Agreemen t.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 16–17.)  \n \n \nOK Biotech contends that it became a “member” under the Release Agreement \nbecause its purchase of a membership inte rest in Prodigy caused OK Biotech to \nbecome a member of Prodigy under Prod igy’s Amended and Restated Operating \nAgreement and thereby a released “member” under the Release Agreement.  (Def.’s \nBr. Supp. Mot., pp. 7–8, 14, Ex. 2.)  OK Biotech contends that it became a “designee” \nunder the Release Agreement because on December 24, 2012, Prodigy transferred \nand assigned ownership and registration of several 510Ks to OK Biotech in the \nTransfer and Assignment of 510Ks document between Prodigy and OK Biotech, \n(Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., Ex. 6), and therea fter, on April 29, 2014, Prodigy appointed \nOK Biotech as its “designee” in the Design ation of Release Agreement, (Def.’s Br. \nSupp. Mot., pp. 15–16, Ex. 9), thereby ex tending the benefits of the Release \nAgreement to OK Biotech. (\nSee, e.g., Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 11.) \n{29} The Court will address each of OK Biotech’s contentions in turn. \n{30} As an initial matter, our courts have recognized that the affirmative \ndefense of release is proven by showing that the parties entered into a private \nagreement “which gives up or abandons a claim or right to the person against whom \nthe claim exists or the right is to be enforced or exercised.”  \nFin. Servs. of Raleigh, \nInc. v. Barefoot , 163 N.C. App. 387, 392,  594 S.E.2d 37, 41 (2004) (quotations and \ncitation omitted);  Adder v. Holman & Moody, Inc ., 288 N.C. 484, 492, 219 S.E.2d \n190, 195 (1975) (“A release is the giving up or abandoning of a claim or right to the \nperson against whom the claim exists or the right is to be exercised.”).   \n{31} “Releases are contractual in nature and their interpretation is governed by \nthe same rules governing interpretation of contracts.”  Chemimetals Processing, Inc. \nv. Schrimsher , 140 N.C. App. 135, 138, 535 S.E. 2d 594, 596 (2000) (citation \nomitted); Fin Servs. Of Raleigh , 163 N.C. App. at 395, 594 S.E.2d at 42 (“Since \nreleases are contractual in nature, we appl y the principles governing interpretation \nof contracts when construing a release.”) (citation omitted).  As a result, “[w]hen the \nlanguage of the contract is clear and unamb iguous, construction of the agreement is \na matter of law for the court[,] and the court cannot look beyond the terms of the \ncontract to determine the intentions of the parties.”  \nPiedmont Bank & Trust Co. v. \n \n \nStevenson, 79 N.C. App. 236, 240, 339 S.E.2d 49, 52 (internal citations omitted), \naff’d per curiam, 317 N.C. 330, 344 S.E.2d 788 (1986).  Thus, “[i]t must be presumed \nthe parties intended what the language used clearly expresses, and the contract \nmust be construed to mean what on its face it purports to mean.”  Hartford Accident \n& Indem. Co. v. Hood , 226 N.C. 706, 710, 40 S.E.2d 198, 201 (1946) (internal \ncitations omitted). \n{32} Here, TaiDoc and OK Biotech both contend that the Release Agreement is \nan unambiguous, fully integrated written contract and that the resolution of \nmaterial factual issues is unnecessary to interpret the parties’ intent in entering the \nRelease Agreement.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 10; Def.’s Reply Supp. Mot., pp. 2, 10, \n19; Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot., pp. 9–10.)  The Court agrees.  See Piedmont Bank & Trust \nCo., 79 N.C. App. at 240, 339 S.E.2d at 52. \nA. Successor \n{33} OK Biotech’s “successor” argument is premised on its claim that OK \nBiotech became a “successor” to Admani and Abulhaj under the Release Agreement \nby purchasing from them a membership intere st in Prodigy.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., \npp. 16–17.)   \n{34} North Carolina courts have “defined the term ‘successor’ to mean [o]ne \nthat succeeds or follows; one who takes the place that another has left, and sustains \nthe like part or character; one who take s the part of another by succession.”  Terres \nBend Homeowners Assoc. v. Overcash , 185 N.C. App. 45, 51, 647 S.E.2d 465, 470 \n(2007) (alteration in original) (quoting Rosi v. McCoy, 319 N.C. 589, 593, 356 S.E.2d \n568, 570 (1987)).5  In construing the term “successor,” the Court should consider the \n“nature of the part or character to be taken” and the “natural meaning of the term” \nas used in context of the parties’ agreement.  Id. at 51–52, 647 S.E.2d at 470 \n(citation and quotations omitted).   \n                                                 \n5 Similarly, Black’s Law Dictionary  defines “successor” as “1. A pe rson who succeeds to the office, \nrights, responsibilities, or place of another; one who replaces or follows a predecessor.  2. A \ncorporation that, through amalgamation, consolidation,  or other assumption of  interests, is vested \nwith the rights and duties of an earlier corporation.”  \nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1473 (8th ed. 2004).   \n \n \n{35} Applying these principles here, the Court is persuaded that the term \n“successors,” as used in the co ntext of the Release Agreement – i.e., as one of \n“predecessors, successors, directors, o fficers, managers, members, and their \nrespective heirs, executors and designees ” – contemplates either a successor legal \nentity, which stands in the shoes of a party typically through merger, acquisition, or \nother legal means of succession, or a successor to a person in the testamentary \nsense, which typically involves a successor standing in the shoes of a predecessor \nupon a predecessor’s incapacity or death.  Neither type of “successor” is created in \nthese circumstances where OK Biotech purchased a portion of Admani’s and \nAbulhaj’s interests in Prodigy.  Indeed, OK Biotech did not become a successor to \nDDI or Prodigy through its purchase – ther e was no merger, acquisition, or other \nlegal form of succession to either DDI’s or Prodigy’s rights under the Release \nAgreement – and OK Biotech did not become  a successor to either Admani or \nAbulhaj in a testamentary sense, a result obviously not contemplated or compelled \nby OK Biotech’s purchase.   \n{36} Moreover, because a “successor” by definition stands in the shoes of his \npredecessor, a “successor” cannot succeed to rights that his predecessor did not \nhave.  \nSee Black’s Law Dictionary at 1473 (“A successor in interest retains the same \nrights as the original owner, with no change in substance.”)  As applied here, even if \nOK Biotech became a legal “successor” to  the release that Admani and Abulhaj \nobtained under the Release Agreement, that release was only a release of the claims \nthat TaiDoc had against Admani and Abulha j – not a release of any claims TaiDoc \nhad against OK Biotech at the time of the Release Agreement, or, in particular, of \nthe claims TaiDoc has asserted against OK Biotech in this action.  Indeed, the \nRelease Agreement specifically defines “P arties” to include only DDI, Prodigy, \nAdmani, Abulhaj, and TaiDoc – the signat ories to the Agreement – and the only \nother persons or entities released in the Release Agreement are those who are \nreleased through their specific, identified legal relationship to the Parties.  OK \nBiotech was not identified or contemplated as a released party at the time the \n“Parties” entered the Release Agreement,  and North Carolina law is clear that \n \n \n“[w]hen a release . . . is given in good fait h to one of two or more persons liable in \ntort for the same injury . . . [i]t does no t discharge any of the other tort-feasors from \nliability for the injury . . . unless its terms so provide.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1B-4 (2014) \n(emphasis added).   In short, OK Biotech’ s claim to be a “successor” to the Release \nAgreement, even if successful, cannot permit  OK Biotech to succeed to a release of \nTaiDoc’s claims against OK Biotech in this litigation because those claims were not \nreleased in the Release Agreement.  See, e.g., Chemimetals, 140 N.C. App. at 138, \n535 S.E.2d at 596 (holding “the plain terms of the release indicate its scope does not \nbar the second action” because the “defendan ts in the second action do not fall \nwithin any of those persons or entities denominated within the release” even though \nthe factual allegations are nearly identical).  Cf. Sword v. DOT, 121 N.C. App. 213, \n464 S.E.2d 715 (1995), disc. rev. denied , 342 N.C. 664, 467 S.E.2d 734 (1996) \n(settlement releasing “‘all other persons, firms, corporations, associations or \npartnerships’” released the North Carolina Department of Transportation from \nliability because it was a “person” within the release); Sykes v. Keiltex Indus ., 123 \nN.C. App. 482, 485, 473 S.E.2d 341, 343 ( 1996) (settlement releasing “all other \npersons, firms, corporations, associations or partnerships” held to release all claims, \nincluding claims against the manufacturer of the machinery) (emphasis omitted).  \nB. Member \n{37} OK Biotech’s “member” argument is premised on its contention that OK \nBiotech’s March 19, 2013 purchase of a fo rty-five percent (45%) membership \ninterest in Prodigy qualifies OK Biotech as a “member” released by TaiDoc under \nthe March 30, 2012 Release Agreement.  (Def.’ s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 14, Exs. 1-2, 5.)  \nOK Biotech argues that at the time the Release Agreement was executed, the only \nmembers of Prodigy were Admani and Abulhaj, each of whom were parties to the \nRelease Agreement, and that it would ha ve been unnecessary to include the word \n“members” in the Mutual Release if that term was intended to cover only them.  \n(Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., pp. 14–15.)  As a result, OK Biotech contends that “members” \nmust necessarily mean “future members” in order to give effect to all the terms of \nthe Mutual Release.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., p. 15.) \n \n \n{38} The Court finds OK Biotech’s argument unpersuasive.  First, OK Biotech’s \nconstruction is inconsistent with the Release Agreement’s language effecting a \npresent release of liability among the parties.  See Hood, 226 N.C. at 710, 40 S.E.2d \nat 201.  Indeed, the operative language  – TaiDoc “hereby releases, remises, \nquitclaims, and forever discharges” – unambiguously contemplates a present \ndischarge effecting an immediate release of  claims upon execution of the Release \nAgreement on March 30, 2012, and it is  undisputed that OK Biotech was not a \nmember of Prodigy when the Release Agreement was executed.   \n{39} Moreover, under North Carolina law, absent explicit language not present \nhere, a release agreement does not apply to claims arising contemporaneously with \nor after the release is given.  Fin. Servs. of Raleigh, Inc. , 163 N.C. App. at 393, 594 \nS.E.2d at 41–42 (citation omitted).  Even “a  general release cannot be held to bar a \nclaim which did not exist when it was signed.”  Id. (citing 76 C.J.S. Release § 67, at \n619 (1994)). \n{40} Furthermore, as discussed above, even if OK Biotech could obtain the \nbenefit of TaiDoc’s release under the Rele ase Agreement as a member of Prodigy, \nthe release OK Biotech would obtain would simply be TaiDoc’s release of its claims \nagainst Prodigy – not a release of TaiDoc’s  claims against OK Biotech.  Again, \nTaiDoc’s claims against OK Biotech were not the subject of TaiDoc’s release of \nclaims against Prodigy and cannot now be the object of the release OK Biotech \ncontends it has obtained by becoming a member of Prodigy. \n{41} Finally, OK Biotech’s contention that “members” must mean “future \nmembers” in this context, combined with its argument that the release obtained is \nof TaiDoc’s claims against OK Biotech, leads to the implausible and fully absurd \nconstruction that the parties intended that any non-party to the Release Agreement \ncould purchase a release of its liability to TaiDoc – on any claim whatsoever – by \npurchasing a membership interest in DDI  or Prodigy, without TaiDoc having \nbargained for or contemplated that party’s release from liability. \n \n   \n \n \nC. Designee \n{42} OK Biotech’s “designee” argument is premised on its contention that OK \nBiotech became a “designee” under the Re lease Agreement by virtue of Prodigy’s \nassignment to OK Biotech of its “rights, obligations, duties, title and ownership” \nrelated to certain 510Ks and its formal designation of OK Biotech as Prodigy’s \n“designee” by execution of the Designatio n of Release Agreement in April 2014.  \n(Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot., pp. 15–16.)  In short, OK Biotech argues that Prodigy had the \nunfettered right to designate any person or entity in the world as its designee for \npurposes of receiving the benefits of the Mutual Release in the Release Agreement, \nand it chose OK Biotech as its “designee” for these purposes.  Again, the Court finds \nOK Biotech’s argument without merit. \n{43} OK Biotech’s legal argument relies on  a broad definition of the word \n“designee” that includes any “person who has been designated to perform some duty \nor carry out some specific role.”  Black’s Law Dictionary 478 (8th ed. 2004).  OK \nBiotech completely ignores, however, the context in which the term is used in the \nRelease Agreement, and the directive from our appellate courts that “[a]n excerpt \nfrom a contract must be interpreted in context with the rest of the agreement.”  \nWeyerhaeuser Co. v. Carolina Power & Light Co. , 257 N.C. 717, 719, 127 S.E.2d \n539, 541 (1962) (citation omitted).   \n{44} The term “designees” appears as one of  three terms expressed together in \nthe Release Agreement – “heirs, executors and designees” – and it is clear that, in \ncontext, these three words are intended as  similar and related legal terms used to \ndescribe types of representatives or successors to a natural person after death.  See, \ne.g., Gardner v. Reidsville , 269 N.C. 581, 591, 15 3 S.E.2d 139, 148 (1967)  ( “the \nmeaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of \nwords with which it is associated.”) (quotations and citations omitted); see also N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 28A-1-1(3) (2013) (“‘Heir’ means any person entitled to take real or \npersonal property upon intestacy . . . .”);  Black’s Law Dictionary at 740 (defining \nexecutor as “[o]ne who performs or carries out some act” and “[a] person named by a \ntestator to carry out the provisions in the testator’s will”).  As such, the Court is \n \n \npersuaded that the plain meaning of the term “designees” in the Release Agreement \nis one who is “named or designated” as th e executor in a valid will with statutory \nauthority to receive letters of authority for the administration of the testator’s \nestate.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 28A-4-1(a) (2014) (discussing persons “designated” as \nexecutor in a will who has not yet been gr anted letters testamentary by a probate \ncourt); see also, e.g. , So. Furniture Co. of Conover, Inc. v. DOT , 133 N.C. App. 400, \n403–04, 516 S.E.2d 383, 386 (1999) (“When terms with special meanings or terms of \nart appear in an instrument, they are to be given their technical meaning; whereas, \nordinary terms are to be given their meaning in ordinary speech.”) (citing Woods v. \nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 295 N.C. 500, 246 S.E.2d 773 (1978)). \n{45} In any event, as discussed above, even if OK Biotech could obtain the \nbenefit of TaiDoc’s release under the Re lease Agreement as Prodigy’s purported \ndesignee, OK Biotech would obtain only TaiDoc’s release of its claims against \nProdigy – not TaiDoc’s claims against OK Biotech.  As stated above, TaiDoc’s claims \nagainst OK Biotech were not the subject of TaiDoc’s release of claims against \nProdigy and cannot be released by virtue of OK Biotech becoming Prodigy’s \ndesignee under the Release Agreement. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{46} WHEREFORE, for each of the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that \nDefendant has failed to show that Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw on Defendant’s Twelfth Affirmative Defe nse of Release, and, accordingly, the \nCourt hereby DENIES Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment on its Twelfth \nAffirmative Defense of Release. \nSO ORDERED, this the 17th day of July, 2015. \n \n      / s /  L o u i s  A .
