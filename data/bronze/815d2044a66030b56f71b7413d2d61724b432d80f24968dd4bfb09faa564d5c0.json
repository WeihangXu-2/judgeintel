This dispute arises out of Defendant Jayesh Patel ’s (“ Jayesh Patel ”) \nresignation from ACI,2 and his alleged access to, and downloading and transmitting \nof, ACI’s confidential and/or trade secret information to the Bayatronics Defendants.  \nACI contends that the Bayatronics Defendants conspired to , and did,  use the \nconfidential information and  alleged trade secrets to gain a  competitive advantage \nover it. \n4. The issue now before the Court is whether summary judgment is \nappropriately granted in the Bayatronics Defendants’ favor as to all five claims raised \nby ACI against them.  \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on a motion for \nsummary judgment.  “[T]o provide context for its ruling , the court may state either \nthose facts that it believes are not in material dispute or those facts on which a \nmaterial dispute forecloses summary adjudication.”  Ehmann v. Medflow, Inc. , 2017 \n \n2 Jayesh Patel did not join in the Motion or file a separate motion for summary judgment. \nNCBC LEXIS 88, at *6 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 26, 2017);  see also Hyde Ins. Agency, \nInc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142 (1975) (encouraging the trial court \nto articulate a summary of the relevant evidence of record to provide context for the \nclaims and motion(s)).   \nA. The Parties \n6. ACI is a North Carolina corporation that provides electronics products, \nparts, and engineering services, and specifically manufactures over 250 types of \ncircuit boards.  (First Am. Verified Compl. ¶¶  1, 15, 17, ECF No. 19 [“Verified \nCompl.”].)\n3  \n7. Bayatronics is a North Carolina limited liability company that produce s \nand assembles circuit boards.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 2, 43.) \n8. Jayesh Patel is a resident of Mecklenburg County, a former employee of \nACI, and a founding member of Bayatronics.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 3, 9.) \n9. Mr. Warriner and Mr. Patel are founding members of Bayatronics and are \nNorth Carolina residents.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 4, 8, 9.) \n10. Mr. Koladia and Mr. Gajera are also founding members of Bayatronics and \nare Texas residents.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6, 9.) \n11. Mr. Sangani is also a founding member of Bayatronics and is a resident of \nIndiana.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 7, 9.) \n \n3 Although a “trial court may not consider an unverified pleading when ruling on a motion \nfor summary judgment, ” verified complaints may be treated as affidavits for that \npurpose.  Rankin v. Food Lion, 210 N.C. App. 213, 220 (2011) (citation omitted).  \nB. Jayesh Patel’s Employment at ACI \n12. Jayesh Patel began working for ACI in 2016 as its Operations Manager, \nwhere he led a production and manufacturing team consisting of  twenty producers, \nin connection with overseeing the inventory of materials to produce circuit boards.  \n(Verified Compl. ¶  28.)  As ACI’s Operations Manager, Jayesh Patel  was allowed \nhigh-level access to the company’s database server .  (Bookmarked Dep. Excerpts at  \nKetul Gondha 159:12–20, ECF No. 103.9 [“K. Gondha Dep.”].)4  The database server \nhoused ACI’s  company records involving sales opportunities, key customer \ninformation, inventory, production data and equipment maintenance procedu res, \nhistorical job data, and ACI’s future business plans.  (Verified Compl. ¶ 30.) \n13. To ensure protection of its potentially confidential information, ACI  \nrequested Jayesh Patel sign two documents when he accepted the role of Operations \nManager: (1) a written offer of employment, (Verified Compl. Ex. A [“Offer Ltr.”]), and \n(2) a Noncompetition, Nonsolicitation and Confidentiality Agreement  (the \n“Confidentiality Agreement”), (Verified Compl. Ex. B [“Confidentiality Agt.”]).  \n14. The Confidentiality Agreement provided that Jayesh Patel would protect \nACI’s confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information, including:  \ninformation about the Company’s Business, its products, services, data, \ndocumentation, sales, vendors, suppliers, financial and business \noperations, business methods and processes, capabilities and \nweaknesses, its pricing, strategic and marketing plans, ac counts, \ncustomer lists, data and information provided by customers or business \n \n4 Rather than filing the deposition transcripts in their entirety, the parties have filed excerpts \nof deposition transcripts.  For ease of citation, the Court cites to deposition excerpts located \nat ECF No. 103.9 as  follows: ([First Name initial, Last Name] Dep. [  ]–[ ]), but cites to the \ndeposition testimony excluded from ECF No. 103.9 as follows: ([Last Name] Dep. [ ]–[ ], ECF \nNo. [ ].) \npartners (including personally identifiable information), the Company’s \ndealings and relationships with its prospective and actual customers \nand its employees (employee data), processes, methods, work -product \nand all other information not generally known or readily ascertainable \nthat has commercial value to the Company and that gives the Company \nan advantage over competition. \n \n(Confidentiality Agt. ¶ 3(a).)  \n \n15. The Confidentiality Agreement further provides that Jayesh Patel would \n“use the Confidential Information only for performance of [his] role with and \nobligations owed to [ACI],” and would “not disclose, transfer, duplicate, or reproduce \nthe Confidential Information in any form . . . .”  (Confidentiality Agt. ¶ 3(c).)  \nC. Jayesh Patel Leaves ACI for Bayatronics \n16. Prior to his employment with AC I, Jayesh Patel  worked at electronic \nmanufacturing company Solectron with Mr. Warriner, Mr. Patel5, and Mr. Sangani, \nwhere Mr. Warriner, Jayesh Patel, and Mr. Patel worked on the assembly line and \nMr. Sangani worked as a repair technician.  ( D. Warriner Dep. 15:6–8, 27:25–28:5; \nA. Sangani Dep. 11:11 –13; S. Patel Dep. 37:18–38:2; J. Patel Dep. 71:11–17, 76:2–\n79:3.)   \n17. Mr. Warriner and Mr. Sangani remained in touch following the conclusion \nof their employment at Solectron, and later discussed starting a business together. \n(D. Warriner Dep. 28:19–29:7.)  Mr. Sangani  knew of Mr. Gajera and Mr. Koladia’s \ninterest in investing in an electronic s manufacturing business.  ( D. Warriner Dep. \n30:22–31:2, 31:10–18; A. Sangani Dep. 13:5–24.)   \n \n5 Jayesh Patel and Samir Patel share no relation.  \n18. In August 2020, Mr. Sangani , Mr. Warriner, and Jayesh Patel began   \nemailing to discuss whether Jayesh Patel would be able to provide a list of potential \ncustomers.  (August 2020 Email Chain, ECF No. 110.7 [“Aug. 2020 Emails”].)  After \nMr. Warriner and Mr. Sangani  discovered that Jayesh  Patel and Mr. Patel  were \nattempting to start their own electronic manufacturing business , Mr. Warriner and \nMr. Sangani pitched the idea of  the four going into business together.   ( A. Sangani \nDep. 12:6–19.) \n19. In November 2020, Defendants met in San Antonio, Texas to discuss \nforming Bayatronics, where they discussed each person’s role and  prior professional \nexperience.  (A. Sangani Dep. 13:14–18; D. Gajera Dep. 28:23–29:9; D. Warriner Dep. \n33:4–9; J. Patel Dep. 68:24–69:5; S. Patel Dep. 25:12–24; K. Koladia Dep. 31:12–23, \n36:15–21, ECF No.  110.8 (stating that their experience was a compelling factor for \nMr. Koladia and Mr. Gajera’s investment in Bayatronics) .)  At this meeting, Jayesh \nPatel was asked if he signed a non -compete while employed at ACI , to which he \nresponded that he did not.  (D. Warriner Dep. 33:10–14.)  Mr. Warriner later testified \nthat, based on industry standards, he expected Jayesh Patel to be subject to a \nnondisclosure agreement.  (D. Warriner Dep. 110:4–11.) \n20. Defendants filed Bayatronics’s Articles of Organization on 13 January \n2021, (see Verified Compl. Ex. C [“Arts. Org.”]) and signed the Bayatronics Operating \nAgreement between late October through early November 2021, thereby making the \nindividual defendants members of Bayatronics , (see Index Br. Supp. Ex. 1, ECF \nNo. 103.1 [“Opt. Agt.”]).  Jayesh Patel was still working for ACI at this time.  (Verified \nCompl. ¶¶ 44, 50; see Opt. Agt. at PATEL 02220.)  Throughout 2021 , Defendants \ninternally circulated business plans, draft agreements, loan documents, real estate \noptions, and financial projections.  (Verified Compl. ¶ 49.) \n21. In 2021, in an effort to  obtain financing, the members of Bayatronics \ndrafted a business plan (the “Business Pl an”), as required by its bank .  (Br. Supp. 6 \nn.3; see generally Index Br. Opp. Ex. 1.1,  ECF No. 110.2 [“Business Plan”]. )  The \nBusiness Plan includes a list of Bayatronics’s competitors, which includes ACI, and \nstates that Bayatronics’s competitive advantages are making “high-quality electronic \ncomponents at a fair and reasonable price” and providing “repair services with fast \nturnaround times .”  (Business Plan at PATEL 02640.)   The Business Plan also \nincludes Jayesh Patel’s resume, which  lists ACI as his current employer , (Business \nPlan at PATEL 02658), and a chart that lists the initials of customers and their \npotential revenue projections , (Business Plan at PATEL 02679 ; D. Warriner \nDep. 134:4–18, ECF No. 111.1). \n22. On 11 January 2022, Jayesh Patel notified ACI that he was resigning from \nthe company effective 25 January 2022, and that he would be joining  former \ncolleagues in a new business venture.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 62–63.)   \n23. ACI’s Chief Executive Officer, Ketul V. Gondha (“Mr. Gondha”), confronted \nJayesh Patel  after discovering that the new business venture, Bayatronics, was a \ndirect competitor of ACI.  (Verified Compl. ¶ 67.)  Mr. Gondha informed Jayesh Patel \nthat he was in direct violation of his  Confidentiality Agreement.  Jayesh Patel \nresponded by denying having signed an agreement as claimed by Gondha.6  (Verified \nCompl. ¶ 69.) \nD. ACI Documents Transferred via Two USB Devices \n24. After discovering that Jayesh Patel  was working for a direct competitor, \nACI began investigating whether Jayesh Patel  violated any terms of the  \nConfidentiality Agreement .  ( Verified Compl.  ¶ 87.)  ACI  hired Clark C. Walton \n(“Mr. Walton”) of Reliance Forens ics, LLC to conduct a digital forensic analysis of \nJayesh Patel’s ACI computer, and to summarize his findings in a report (the “Walton \nReport”).  ( Verified Compl. ¶  88; see Digital Forensic Expert Report of Clark C. \nWalton, Esq., ECF No. 110.12 [“Walton Report”].)   \n25. Mr. Walton determined that Jayesh Patel accessed several files on ACI’s \nservers on several dates between 1 December 2021 and 28 January 2022,  including \nACI_Quality_Manual-Rev.K.pdf., Process Flow documents,  SMT Logs, \nCompany_Name_Alternatives.xlsx, Quotes_Orders.doc, and PCBC_2019_Attendees \n_Opt_In_List_Max_Edit.xlsx.  ( Verified Compl.  ¶¶ 93, 97 ; Aff. Anatoly Streletsky \n¶¶ 9, 12(b), ECF No. 4 [“Streletsky  Aff.”].)7  In addition to those documents , Mr. \nWalton determined that, on 7 September 2021, Jayesh Patel  accessed ten of ACI’s \nvendor nondisclosure agreements (“NDAs”).  ( Verified Compl. ¶ 98; Streletsky Aff. \n¶ 12(a).)  F urther, it appears that  Jayesh Patel  accessed the following broad \n \n6 Jayesh Patel maintains that he did not  sign the Confidentiality Agreement.  (Aff. Jayesh \nPatel ¶ 10, ECF No. 40 [“Patel Aff.”].) \n \n7 Anatoly Streletsky is ACI’s  Assistant Vice President of Operations and Information \nTechnology Manager.  (Streletsky Aff. ¶ 2.) \ncategories of files just before his departure on 28 January 2022: machine maintenance \nprocedures; job notes; project lists; inventory files; and historic employee activity .  \n(Verified Compl. ¶ 96; Streletsky Aff. ¶ 11.)  \n26. In his forensic analysis, Mr. Walton used the forensic tool EnCase to obtain \nthe USB device history of Jayesh Patel’s ACI computer.  (Aff. Clark Walton ¶ 10, ECF \nNo. 5 [“Walton Aff.”].)  The Walton Report provides that three different USB devices \nwere plugged into Jayesh Patel’s ACI computer on 26–27 January 2022.  (Walton Aff. \n¶ 12(b).)  Further, the Walton Report provides that Jayesh Patel transferred ACI files \nfrom his computer onto two USB devices on 28 January 2022 prior to his departure.  \n(Walton Report ¶ 28(a).)   \n27. Following the initiation of this action, Mr.  Walton conducted a similar \ndigital forensic analysis  on Mr. Warriner’s personal laptop.  ( Walton Report ¶  16.)  \nMr. Walton found that, of the two USB devices Jayesh Patel used, one was plugged \ninto Mr. Warriner’s personal laptop on at least five different occasions between \nNovember 2021 and January 2022, and the other was plugged in at least on ce in \nJanuary 2022.  (Walton Report ¶ 18(f).)   \n28. Mr. Walton used the forensic method of “hashing,” which generates a \nunique identifier for every file on a device.8  (Walton Report ¶ 21.)  Once the files on \nJayesh Patel’s USB devices were given a “hash” value, Mr.  Walton ran a report  to \ncompare those documents with the documents found on Mr. Warriner’s computer.  \n \n8 The Walton Report explains that if two electronic files have the same “hash” value, they are \ngenerally identical files.  (Walton Report ¶ 21.) \n \n(Walton Report ¶ 22.)  Mr. Walton determined that over ninety files on Jayesh Patel’s \nUSB devices were “exact matches” to those found on Mr. Warriner’s computer.  \n(Walton Report ¶ 23.)  Additionally, it was later discovered that, prior to submitting \nthe computer for forensic analysis,  Mr. Warriner deleted two folders from his \ncomputer that contained ACI files.  (D. Warriner Dep. 51:2–9.) \n29. Defendants hired forensic expert John Akerman  (“Mr. Akerman”) to \nevaluate whether any of the ACI data described by Mr.  Walton existed on \nBayatronics’s server.  (Report & Aff. John W . Akerman, ECF No. 103.6 [“Akerman \nReport”].)  Mr.  Akerman utilized several forensic methods, including: (1) reviewing \nthe “Author” on all files; (2) running searches of key terms, such as American, Circuit, \nSok,9 Ketul, Gondha, and Streletsky; and (3) conducting a hash comparison, like that \nconducted by Mr.  Walton.  ( Akerman Report ¶  9.)  Mr. Akerman ultimately \ndetermined that three documents on Bayatronics’s server shared a hash value with \nthe documents found on Jayesh Patel’s  USB devices : \n(1) Paste_NC258_6337_AIM.pdf; (2) Paste _RoHS_NC_258_SACE305_AIM.pdf; and \n(3) Customer_List_Flex.xlsx.  (Akerman Report ¶¶ 10(a)–(c).)   \nIII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n30. The Court sets forth herein  only those portions of the procedural history \nrelevant to its determination of the Motion. \n31. This action was initiated on 22 February 2022 on the filing of ACI’s Verified \nComplaint.  On 15 March 2022, ACI  filed its First Amended Motion for Injunctive \n \n9 Peter Sok was ACI’s Inventory Manager during the relevant period.  (Verified Compl. ¶ 47.) \nRelief and Verified Complaint (“Verified Complaint”), thereby adding the Bayatronics \nDefendants to this suit.  (See generally Verified Compl.)   \n32. ACI alleges five claims for relief against the Bayatronics Defendants in the \nVerified Complaint: (1) misappropriation of trade secrets , (Verified Compl. ¶ ¶ 137–\n50); (2) unfair and deceptive trade practices under the  Unfair and Deceptive Trade \nPractices Act , (Verified Compl. ¶ ¶ 151–56); (3) civil conspiracy , (Verified Compl. \n¶¶ 157–61); (4) unjust enrichment , (Verified Compl. ¶¶  162–65); and (5) punitive \ndamages, (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 166–68). \n33. On 15 April 2022,  the Bayatronics Defendants  filed their Answer to the \nVerified Complaint.  (ECF No. 49.) \n34. All discovery was completed on 1 May 2023.  (See ECF No. 90.) \n35. On 31 May 2023, the Bayatronics Defendants filed the Motion.  Following \nfull briefing on the Motion, the Court held a hearing on the Motion on 22 August 2023 \n(the “Hearing”) at which all parties were represented through counsel .  ( See ECF \nNo. 114.) \n36. The Motion is ripe for resolution. \nIV. LEGAL STANDARD \n37. Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers \nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show \nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C.G.S. § 1A-1, Rule 56(c).  “A ‘genuine issue’ is \none that can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, \n83 (2000).   \n38. The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine \nissue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  \nHensley v. Nat’l Freight Transp., Inc. , 193 N.C. App. 561, 563 (2008).   The movant \nmay make the required showing by proving that “an essential element of the opposing \nparty’s clai m does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by an \naffirmative defense, or by showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot \nproduce evidence to support an essential element of her claim.”  Dobson, 352 N.C. at \n83 (citations omitted).  \n39. “Once the party seeking summary judgment makes the required showing, \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784−85 \n(2000).  The Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nnonmovant.  Dobson, 352 N.C. at 83.  However, the nonmovant “may not rest upon \nthe mere allegations or denials of [its] pleading, but [its] response, by affidavits or as \notherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a \ngenuine issue for trial.  If [the nonmovant] does not so respond, summary judgment, \nif appropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovan t].”  N.C.G.S. §  1A-1, \nRule 56(e). \nV. ANALYSIS \n40. The Bayatronics Defendants contend that summary judgment is \nappropriate on all claims raised against them .  As set forth above, ACI alleged five \nclaims for relief against the Bayatronics Defendants .  The Court ad dresses each of \nthe five claim s set forth in the Verified Complaint  in turn .  ( See Verified Compl. \n¶¶ 137–68.) \nA. Misappropriation of Trade Secrets \n41. ACI alleges that the Bayatronics Defendants misappropriated its trade \nsecrets in violation of the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act, N.C.G.S. § 66-\n152 et seq. (the “NCTSPA”).  ACI alleges that Jayesh Patel accessed, downloaded, and \ntransferred ACI’s files to the Bayatronics Defendants, in violation of the NCTSPA, to \ngain an advantage over , and directly compete with ACI.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶  141–\n47.)   \n42. The Bayatronics Defendants now seek dismissal of  ACI’s claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets, contending that ACI has identified no protectable \ntrade secrets and that, even if it does , ACI has not presented evidence of  the \nBayatronics Defendants’ alleged misappropriation.  ( Br. Supp. Bayatronics Defs.’ \nMot. 15, 19, 24, ECF No. 102 [“Br. Supp.”].)  \n43. “A threshold question in any action involving allegations of \nmisappropriation of trade secrets is whether the information in question constitutes \na trade secret under the [NCTSPA] . . . .”  Koch Measurement Devices, Inc. v. Armke, \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *10 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 1, 2015) (citing Combs & Assocs. \nv. Kennedy, 147 N.C. App. 362, 369 (2001)). \n44. Under the NCTSPA, a trade secret is defined as: \nbusiness or technical information, including but not limited to a formula, \npattern, program, device, compila tion of information, method, \ntechnique, or process that:  \n \na. Derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not \nbeing generally known or readily ascertainable through independent \ndevelopment or reverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic \nvalue from its disclosure or use; and  \n \nb. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances \nto maintain its secrecy. \n \nN.C.G.S. § 66-152(3). \n45. Our courts have identified six factors that should be considered when \ndetermining whether information is a trade secret:  \n(1) the extent to which the information is known outside the business; \n(2) the extent to which it is known to employees and others involved in \nthe business; (3) the extent of measures taken to guard the secrecy of \nthe information; (4) the value of [the] informa tion to [the] business and \nits competitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended in developing \nthe information; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information \ncould properly be acquired or duplicated by others.  \n \nCombs, 147 N.C. App. at 369–70 (citations omitted).  \n46. “[A] plaintiff must identify a trade secret with sufficient particularity so as \nto enable a defendant to delineate that which he is accused of misappropriating and \na court to determine whether misappropriation has or is threatene d to occur.”  \nKrawiec v. Manly , 370 N.C. 602, 609 (2018)  (citation omitted).  A plaintiff may not \nsimply make “general allegations in sweeping and conclusory statements, without \nspecifically identifying the trade secrets allegedly misappropriated.”  Washburn v. \nYadkin Valley Bank & Tr. Co., 190 N.C. App. 315, 327 (2008). \n47. The Bayatronics Defendants contend that ACI has failed to identify which \ndocuments it contends constitute trade secrets with sufficient particularity .  (Br. \nSupp. 15.)   More specifically, the Bayatronics Defendants contend that it is an \n“impossible task” to parse through the two USB  drives at issue to determine which \ndocuments ACI considers trade secrets.  (Br. Supp. 18.) \n48. There appear to be three distinct groups of alleged trade secrets: (1) the file \ntitled Customer_List_Flex.xlsx; (2) all other broad ly defined  categories of \ninformation; and (3)  the specifically identified files and documents  \nACI_Quality_Manual-Rev.K.pdf, SMT Assembly Logs , Quotes_Orders.doc, \nCompany_Name_Alternatives.xlsx, specific Process Flow documents, and \nPCBC_2019_Attendees_Opt_In_List_Max_Edit.xlsx (together, the “Specifically \nIdentified Trade Secrets”).  The Court addresses these three groups in turn. \n1. The Customer_List_Flex.xlsx File \n49. First, the Bayatronics Defendants contend that the three files identified by \nMr. Akerman to be on both the USB devices and the Bayatronics server are not trade \nsecrets: (1) Customer_List_Flex.xlsx, (2) Paste_NC258_6337_AIM.pdf, and \n(3) Paste_RoHS_NC_258_SACE305_AIM.pdf.  (Index Ex. Reply, Ex.  8, 11, 12, ECF \nNos. 111.8, 111.11–.12.)  The spreadsheet titled Customer_List_Flex.xlsx is the only \nalleged trade secret that was filed with the Motion for the Court’s review.10 \n \n10 ACI represented to the Court at the hearing that the files Paste_NC258_6337_AIM.pdf and \nPaste_RoHS_NC_258_SACE305_AIM.pdf do not contain trade secret information. \n50. To survive summary judgment, a plainti ff “must allege facts that would \nallow a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that the information [at issue] was not \n‘generally known or readily ascertainable .’ ”  Area Landscaping, L.L.C. v. Glaxo -\nWellcome, Inc., 160 N.C. App. 520, 525 (2003) (citation omitted).   \n51. The Bayatronics Defendants argue that the information contained in \nCustomer_List_Flex.xlsx is “openly available to the public” and that “anyone with \naccess to the internet” could ascertain the information therein.  (Reply Supp. Mot. 7, \nECF No. 113 [“Reply”].)  ACI disagrees, contending that this list was created by Peter \nSok while he was employed by ACI , (see supra n ote 9), and that it contains \ninformation about ACI’s customers, prospective customers, and projected revenue for \nsuch customers, (Pl.’s Br. Opp. Mot. 21, ECF No. 109 [“Br. Opp.”] ; see Second Aff. \nAnatoly Streletsky ¶ 6, ECF No. 108 [“Second Streletsky Aff.”]). \n52. The Court, having reviewed the Customer_List_Flex.xlsx. file, determines \nthat the file arguably contains information that is or may qualify for protection under \nthe NCTSPA.  The file contains a number of entities identified as customers.  For \neach entity listed, the document provides the  customer’s name, address, and phone \nnumber, as well as a  description and photo of the customer’s product  manufactured \nby ACI, with a potential whole number revenue figure.  (See ECF No. 111.8.)   \n53. While c ustomer lists, when compiled with pricing and bidding formulas, \nqualify as a trade secret  under the NCTSPA, the Court ’s prior decisions  do not \nconsider a customer list “containing only information that is easily accessible through \na telephone book or other readily available sources to be a trade secret.”   Bldg. Ctr., \nInc. v. Carter Lumber of the North, Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 85, at *19–20 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Sept. 21, 2017) .  The Court concludes that, for purposes of determination of \nDefendants’ request for summary judgment, the record before the Court does not \ndefinitively disclose that  the qualitative information found within  the \nCustomer_List_Flex.xlsx file can be acquired by searching each company online.   \n54. First, there is no showing how a competitor, without ACI’s information, \ncould readily determine what products ACI was manufacturing for each of its \ncustomers.  Further, t he revenue figure presented in the file  appears from the \nevidence to be ACI’s opinion about possible sales to each of the listed entities.  Based \non this evidence , the Court concludes that the Customer_List_Flex.xlsx can be  a \nprotectable trade secret under the NCTSPA. \n55. Therefore, there Court hereby DENIES in part the Motion as to ACI’s claim \nfor misappropriation of trade secrets as it relates to the Customer_List_Flex.xlsx file. \n2. The Other Broadly Defined Categories of Information \n56. ACI alleges that the  \nfiles containing Machine Maintenance Procedures, Job Notes, Project \nLists, Inventory Files, Historic Employee Activity . . . NDAs, [and] those \nfiles (and any such similar files containing similar types of data) \nidentified as Exhibits A through E of the Affidavit of Mr. Streletsky, and \nExhibit B to the Affidavit of Mr. Walton \n \ncontain trade secret information protected under the NCTSPA.   (Verified Compl. \n¶ 102.)  Within this extensive list, ACI has failed to identify any specific files that \nmight contain trade secret information. \n57. For example, ACI makes the general assertion that the files listed in \n“Exhibits A through E of the Affidavit of Mr. Streletsky” contain trade secrets that \nthe Bayatronics Defendants have misappropriated.  (Verified Compl. ¶  102.)  \nHowever, those Exhibits contain hundreds of files, with names that range in \ndescriptiveness from “forklift _training.pdf” to “Book1.xlsx .”  (Streletsky  Aff. Exs. \nA, C.)  Without identifying the specific files and documents that purportedly contain \ntrade secret information, and t he specific information within each document that \nwarrants protection under the NCTSPA, it is nearly impossible for the Bayatronics \nDefendants to know  which files conta in trade secret  information that they are \naccused of misappropriating. \n58. “[S]weeping and conclusory statements, without specifically identifying the \ntrade secrets allegedly misappropriated,” will not suffice.  Washburn, 190 N.C. App. \nat 327. \n59. Therefore, the Court hereby GRANTS in part the Motion as to ACI’s claim \nfor misappropriation of trade secrets  as it relates to  the following broadly defined \ncategories of files containing information on: Machine Maintenance Procedures, Job \nNotes, Project Lists, Inventory Files, Historic Employee Activity, Exhibits A through \nE of Mr. Streletsky ’s Affida vit, and Exhibit B to Mr. Walton ’s Affidavit .  This \nexplicitly excludes the Customer_List_Flex.xlsx file as discussed above, ( see supra \nPart V.A.1), and the Specifically Identified Trade Secrets addressed below (see infra \nPart V.A.3). \n3. Specifically Identified Files and Documents \n60. As to the third category of documents, ACI has  sufficiently identified the \nSpecifically Identified Trade Secrets  that it contends are worthy of  trade secret \nprotection.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 93, 97.)    \n61. The Verified Complaint specifically provides the name of each file; detailed \ninformation about the content of each file, including how it is utilized by ACI; how \nACI developed this information; and whether each file would be valuable to a \ncompetitor.  (Verified Compl. ¶ 97.)  For example, Quote_Orders.doc is alleged to be \na “confidential file” that “lists [ACI’s] circuitry board suppliers, their contact \ninformation, [and] guidance on which circuit boards to order from which suppliers.”  \n(Verified Compl. ¶ 97(a)(i).)  ACI alleges that this list “took [it] years to develop” and \nthat it would be “of significant value to a competitive company.”  (Verified Compl. \n¶ 97(a)(i).)   \n62. Further, ACI specifically states that the files beginning with “SMT \nAssembly Logs” fol lowed by the relevant date, were developed by ACI,  and contain \ntrade secrets.  (Verified Compl. ¶ 93.)  ACI claims that each of “[t]hese logs represent \na different week of performance on [its] robotic machines that maximize [its] \nefficiency” and that they contain “certain details of the run or job for a particular \ncustomer[,]” including information like the customer’s name, quantity, number of \ncomponents, number of feeders, number of producers, and amount of time to \nmanufacture.  ( Verified Compl. ¶  93.)  ACI affirms that if a competitor had this \ninformation, the  competing company  could provide a more accurate quote to a \ncustomer and better compete in terms of production and quality.  ( Verified Compl. \n¶ 93.) \n63. The Bayatronics Defendants raise no argument or reb uttal in the briefing \nto negate the se specific verified allegations relating to each file, leaving them \nseemingly uncontested.  The Bayatronics Defendants simply state that, as to this \ncategory of information, there is “nothing remotely of value to any of [ACI] ’s \ncompetitors.”  (Br. Supp. 20.) \n64. No party has submitted the  Specifically Identified Trade Secrets for the \nCourt’s review.  Without access to each Specifically Identified Trade Secret, the Court \nmust rely on ACI’s allegations within the Verified Complaint and each party’s \narguments within their respective briefs.   \n65. On the record before the Court, it appears that ACI has sufficiently \nidentified its Specifically Identified  Trade Secrets, as defined above, such that the \nBayatronics Defendants have notice of what they allegedly misappropriated.   \n66. The Court therefore proceeds to the remaining analysis to determine \nwhether the misappropriation of trade secrets claim  survives sum mary judgment \nbased on the Specifically Identified Trade Secrets and the Customer_List_Flex.xlsx \nfile (together, the “Alleged Trade Secrets”).   \n4. Reasonable Efforts to Maintain Secrecy \n67. Even if a Court determines that specifically described information may \notherwise qualify as a protectable trade secret, the Court must also evaluate whether \nthe Alleged Trade Secrets were subject to reasonable efforts to maintain their secrecy. \n68. “No trade secret will be found if . . . there is no evidence indicating that the \nplaintiff undertook efforts to ensure the information’s secrecy.”  Safety Test & Equip. \nCo. v. Am. Safety Util. Corp., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *26 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 23, \n2015) (citing Bank Travel Bank v. McCoy , 802 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (E.D .N.C. 1992) \n(indicating that, absent reasonable security measures, a trade secret cannot exist)) ; \nsee N.C.G.S. § 66–152(3).  “[T]he [NCTSPA] calls for a fact-specific inquiry regarding \nwhether efforts were ‘reasonable.’  ”  RoundPoint Mortg. Co. v. Florez , 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 18, at **36 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 18, 2016). \n69. The Court begins by examining ACI’s corporate policies.  See Edgewater \nServs., Inc. v. Epic Logistics, Inc., 2009 NCBC LEXIS 21, at *12–14 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nAug. 11, 2009)  (reviewing a company ’s safeguards, protocols, and procedures to \ndetermine whether the company has made reasonable efforts to safeguard its trade \nsecrets).   \n70. First, Jayesh Patel’s employment with ACI was contingent upon the signing \nof the Confidentiality Agreement.  The Confidentiality Agreement explicitly included \na nondisclosure and confidentiality provision that  required each employee to use \nACI’s confidential information “only for performance of his/her role with and \nobligations owed to [ACI],” and to “not disclose, transfer, duplicate, or reproduce the \nConfidential Information in any form[.]”  (Confidentiality Agt. at ¶ 3(c).)   \n71. Second, ACI requires a username and password to gain access to servers \nthat contain the Alleged Trade Secrets, with different employees having more or less \nrestricted access depending on their roles  and responsibilities.  As the  Operations \nManager, which was a pos ition that enjoyed high- level access to ACI’s confidential \ninformation, (Verified Compl. ¶  30), Jayesh Patel  had a username and password \nwhich provided him access to that server.   \n72. Password protection of trade secrets kept in computerized databases is one \nmeasure our courts have considered reasonable, with other demonstrated efforts, to \nmeet the obligations of maintaining secrecy.  Safety Test & Equip. Co. , 2015 NCBC \nLEXIS 40, at *27–28.  Further, our Court of Appeals has suggested that a password-\nprotected database should limit access to top- level employees.  TSG Finishing, LLC \nv. Bollinger, 238 N.C. App. 586,  589 (2014) (noting that plaintiff's computers were \npassword-protected with additional passwords required to access production \ninformation). \n73. Given that ACI required all employees to sign employment agreements that \ncontain a confidentiality provision, and ACI maintained its Alleged Trade Secrets on \na password-protected server, the Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that ACI \nfailed to take reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the Alleged Trade Secrets.  \nEven if ACI allowed Jayesh Patel to maintain access to the server after he gave notice \nof his resignation, his employment agreement remained in effect and limited his \nability to share ACI’s information with those outside of the company.   \n5. Misappropriation of ACI’s Alleged Trade Secrets \n74. The Bayatronics Defendants argue that the facts surrounding Jayesh \nPatel’s access to ACI’s Alleged Trade Secrets  and the subsequent transfer of those \nfiles, establish that Defendants did not acquire or use that information .  (Br. Supp. \n24.) \n75. Misappropriation is the “acquisition, disclosure, or use of a trade secret of \nanother without express or implied authority or consent, unless such trade secret was \narrived at by independent development, reverse engineering, or was obtained from \nanother person with a righ t to disclose the trade secret.”  N.C.G.S. §  66-152(1).  A \nplaintiff can establish a prima facie case of trade secret misappropriation by \n“introducing substantial evidence that the person against whom relief is sought both: \n(1) knows or should have known o f the trade secret; and (2) has had a specific \nopportunity to acquire it for disclosure or use or has acquired, disclosed, or used it \nwithout the express or implied consent or authority of the owner.”  N.C.G.S. § 66-155.   \n76. This Court has held that  \nevidence that a former employee had access to, and therefore an \n“opportunity to acquire,” an employer’s trade secrets, without more, is \nnot sufficient to establish a prima facie case of misappropriation.  \nRather, the employer must establish either that the former  employee \naccessed its trade secrets without authorization  or provide other \nsufficient evidence of misappropriation to raise an inference of actual \nacquisition or use of its trade secrets.  \n \nAm. Air Filter Co. v. Price, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 9, at *22 (N.C. Super Ct. Feb. 3, 2017).  \n77. The Bayatronics Defendants do not deny that Jayesh Patel took the \ninformation in question with him either before or at the time of his resignation.  \nRather, they contend that, even if Jayesh Patel misappropriated the information, ACI \nhas provided no evidence that any files on the two USB devices  have been used by \nBayatronics, LLC, or that Defendants Mr. Koladia, Mr. Gajera, Mr. Sangani,  or Mr. \nPatel ever knew of, knowingly viewed, or obtained any benefit from any document on \neither of the two USB drives.  (Br. Supp. 24.)  Further, the Bayatronics Defendants \ncontend that there is no evidence that Bayatronics or Mr. Warriner ever knew or had \nreason to know that any document uploaded to Mr. Warriner’s laptop contained trade \nsecret information belonging to ACI.  (Br. Supp. 24.)  Finally, the Bayatronics \nDefendants argue there is no evidence that Mr. Patel has purposely shared any \ninformation belonging to ACI with them.  (Br. Supp. 24.) \n78. ACI, however, relies on inferences to be drawn from the facts surrounding \nthe development of Bayatronics , Jayesh Patel’s transferring of files and documents \nto Mr. Warriner, and the Bayatronics Defendants ’ continued access to Jayesh Patel \nwhile employed by ACI as evidence of the Bayatronics Defendants’ actual \nmisappropriation of trade secrets.  ACI also points to evidence indicating that  \nMr. Warriner attempted to delete the information downloaded by him from Jayesh \nPatel as circumstantial evidence of his wrongdoing.   \n79. ACI must identify the actual acts of misappropriation with adequate \nspecificity to enable the Court to determine whether misappropriation has occurred.  \nWashburn, 190 N.C. App. at 327 (dismissing misappropriation of trade secret claim \nbecause plaintiff did not “identify with sufficient specificity either the trade secrets \n. . . or the acts by which the alleged misappropriations were accomplished”). \n80. Circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets.  See Med. Staffing Network, Inc. v. Ridgeway, 194 \nN.C. App. 649, 658 (2009) (“[ d]irect evidence … is not necessary to establish a claim \nfor misappropriation of trade secrets; rather, such a claim may be proven through  \ncircumstantial evidence”).  While a plaintiff may rely on circumstantial evidence to \nprove its misappropriation claim, there must be “ substantial evidence (1) that the \nwrongdoer accessed the trade secret without consent, or (2) of misappropriation \nresulting in an inference of actual acquisition or use of the trade secret.”   Addison \nWhitney, LLC v. Cashion , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 23, at * *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 15, \n2017). \n81. ACI contends that its circumstantial evidence is sufficient to show, at least \nat this stage, that the Bayatronics Defendants knew Jayesh Patel had access to ACI’s \nserver containing the Alleged Trade Secrets , and that the Bayatronics Defendants \nhad continued access to the ACI materials Jayesh Patel transferred to Mr. Warriner.  \n(Br. Opp. 21.)   \n82. The evidence in the record, specifically the forensic findings of Mr. Walton, \nis sufficient to show that Mr. Warriner viewed, possessed, and had continued access \nto the Alleged Trade Secre ts as they were uploaded onto his computer by Jayesh \nPatel.  Further, there is sufficient evidence provided by Mr. Akerman,  to show that \nfiles belonging to ACI were found on Bayatronics’ s server, without any justification \nfor how this came to be.   \n83. This evidence, paired with the knowledge of Jayesh Patel’s role at ACI and \nthe continuous development of Bayatronics, supports the Court’s determination that \nACI has produced sufficient evidence to permit an inference of misappropriation  by \nBayatronics and Mr. Warriner, and genuine issues of material fact remain regarding \nwhether Bayatronics and Mr. Warriner’s  access to Jayesh Patel  and ACI’s Alleged \nTrade Secrets resulted in the acquisition and/or using of ACI’s Alleged Trade Secrets. \n84. Therefore, the Court hereby DENIES the Motion for Defendants \nBayatronics, LLC and Dirk A . Warriner as it relates to ACI’s claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets , to the extent it requests dismissal as to ACI’s \nAlleged Trade Secrets.  \n85. However, ACI has failed to produce sufficient evidence that Mr. Gajera, Mr. \nKoladia, Mr. Sangani, or Mr. Patel viewed, utilized, or even had knowledge of the \nAlleged Trade Secrets.  The only evidence related to these Defendants and the Alleged \nTrade Secrets is the August 2020 email chain be tween Mr. Warriner, Mr. Sangani , \nand Jayesh Patel .  (Br. Opp. 19.)  In the email chain,  Mr. Warriner states that he \nneeds to “see if Jay can give me a list of potential customers ,” to which Mr. Sangani \nresponded by asking for Jayesh Patel to “share the potential customer . . . .”  However, \nthere is no evidence that Mr. Sangani asked for a list of ACI customers, and even if \nhe had, there is no evidence that Mr. Sangani ever viewed, utilized, or knew of  any \nsuch list.   \n86. This is simply not enough.  See Safety Test & Equip. Co., 2015 NCBC LEXIS \n40, at *28– 29 (noting that a trade secret claimant must “identify the actual acts of \nmisappropriation with adequate specificity”); see also Addison Whitney, 2017 NCBC \nLEXIS 23, at *18 (holding that “a wrongdoer’s access to and opportunity to acquire a \ntrade secret–without more–is insufficient”).   \n87. As such , there is insufficient evidence to permit an inference of \nmisappropriation by Mr. Gajera, Mr. Koladia, Mr. Sangani, and Mr. Patel.  Therefore, \nthe Court hereby GRANTS  the Motion for Defendants Kishor Koladia , Dahyalal \nGajera, Ashwin J. Sangani , and Samir Patel as it relates to ACI’s claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets, and that claim is DISMISSED to that extent.   \nB. Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \n88. A claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices under the UDTPA requires \nproof of “(1) an unfair or deceptive trade practice, (2) in or affecting commerce, which \n(3) proximately caused actual injury to the [plaintiff].”  Nucor Corp. v. Prudential \nEquity Grp., LLC, 189 N.C. App. 731, 738 (2008).   \n89. In alleging its claim  for violations of the UDTPA, ACI relies on the same \nfacts underlying its misappropriation of trade secrets claim.  A claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets may support a claim for violation of the UDTPA if \nthe misappropriation satisfies the three required elements for an unfair  trade \npractice claim.  Drouillard v. Keister Williams Newspaper Servs., Inc., 108 N.C. App. \n169, 172 (1992).   \n90. The Bayatronics Defendants’ sole argument in support of the Motion is that \nthe claims for misappropriation of trade secrets, unjust enrichment , and civil \nconspiracy are “inseparably intertwined” with ACI’s claim under the UDTPA, and as \na result of  ACI failing to present substantial evidence required to support those \nclaims, the UDTPA claim fails as well.  (Br. Supp. 30.)   \n91. The Court has dismissed ACI’s claims for misappropriation of trade secrets, \ncivil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment (see supra Part V.A. and infra Parts V.C. and \nV.D.), as to Defendants Kishor Koladia, Dahyalal Gajera, Ashwin J. Sangani , and \nSamir Patel.  Therefore, the Court hereby GRANTS the Motion as to ACI’s unfair \nand deceptive trade practices claim for Defendants Kishor Koladia, Dahyalal Gajera, \nAshwin J. Sangani, and Samir Patel.   \n92. However, ACI’s misappropriation of trade secrets claim survives summary \njudgment as to Bayatronics and Mr. Warriner to the extent expressed earlier (see \nsupra ¶ 84 ), and as such, that claim, and the conduct alleged therein , serves as \nsupport for ACI’s unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.   \n93. Therefore, the Court hereby DENIES  the Motion  for Defendants \nBayatronics and Dirk A.  Warriner as to ACI’s unfair and deceptive trade practices  \nclaim. \nC. Civil Conspiracy \n94. The Bayatronics Defendants request summary judgment on ACI’s claim for \ncivil conspiracy, arguing that ACI has not provided sufficient evidence of an \nagreement between any of the Bayatronics Defendants that would support such a \nclaim.  (Br. Supp. 28.)   \n95. Civil conspiracy requires a showing of “(1) an agreement between two or \nmore individuals; (2) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act in an unlawful way; \n(3) resulting in injury to plaintiff inflicted by one or more of the conspirators; and (4) \npursuant to a common sch eme.”  Strickland v. Hedrick , 194 N.C. App. 1, 19 (2008)  \n(citations omitted).   \n96. It is well established that  \n[t]here is no independent cause of action for civil conspiracy.  Only where \nthere is an underlying claim for unlawful conduct can a plaintiff state a \nclaim for civil conspiracy by also alleging the agreement of two or more \nparties to carry out the conduct and injury resulting from that \nagreement.  \n \nToomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. App. 462, 483 (2002) (citations omitted). \n \n97. The Court has determined that AC I’s claim for misappropriation of trade \nsecrets survives summary judgment  for Defendants Bayatronics and Mr. Warriner \nas to the Alleged Trade Secrets because a genuine issue of material fact remains for \na jury.  As such, ACI’s claim for misappropriation of  trade secrets may serve as the \nrequisite underlying tort to support ACI’s claim for civil conspiracy against the \nBayatronics Defendants.  See Am. Air Filter Co.,  2017 NCBC LEXIS at *32 (“ Since \n[Plaintiff’s] claims for misappropriation and unfair trade practices survive dismissal, \nthese claims can serve as the requisite underlying torts for a civil conspiracy claim.” \n(cleaned up)); see also Koch Measurement Devices, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *26 (“To \nestablish a claim for civil conspiracy, a plaintiff  must show an ‘overt act’ committed \nby at least one conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy.” (quoting Dove v. Harvey, \n168 N.C. App. 687, 690 (2006) (emphasis added))).    \n98. ACI must offer “proof of an agreement between two or more persons”  to \nestablish a civil conspiracy claim.   Sellers v. Morton , 191 N.C App. 75, 83 (2008)  \n(quoting Dove, 168 N.C. App. at 690–91).  “Although civil liability for conspiracy may \nbe established by circumstantial evidence, the evidence of the agreement must be \nsufficient to create more than a suspicion or conjecture[.]”  Cameron v. New Hanover \nMem’l Hosp., Inc. , 58 N.C. App. 414, 438 (1982)  (citation omitted).   A motion for \nsummary judgment “triggers the plaintiff’s responsibility to produce \nfacts, . . . sufficient to show that he will be able to prove his claim at trial.”  Morrison-\nTiffin v. Hampton, 117 N.C. App. 494, 505 (1995).   \n99. ACI contends that the Defendants “entered into an agreement to act \npursuant to a common scheme to unlawfully and tortiously compete with ACI” and \nthat the conspiracy “was successful” by Defendants utilizing ACI’s resources to \ndevelop a competing venture.  ( Verified Compl. ¶ 159.)  The unlawful act alleged by \nACI is the misappropriation by Jayesh Patel of ACI’s confidential business \ninformation a nd trade secrets, for the benefit of the Bayatronics Defendants.  \n(Verified Compl. ¶ 159.) \n100. The Bayatronics Defendants have challenged ACI’s evidentiary showing of \nan agreement amongst the Defendants, and ACI must come forward with a forecast \nof evidence in support of its civil conspiracy theory.  After a thorough review of the \nrecord in this case, the Court, construing the evidence in ACI’s favor, concludes that \ncircumstantial evidence of an unlawful agreement between the Defendants does not \nrise above mere suspicion or conjecture.  At most, ACI has shown that Defendants \nwere actively working together to start a business, which included meeting with all \nmembers, signing an Operating Agreement, and drafting a Business Plan.  Following \nthe inception of Bayatronics, Jayesh Patel informed ACI of his resignation, after \nwhich he accessed and downloaded files on ACI’s server and transferred those files to \nMr. Warriner via two USB devices.  However, this is not evidence of an agreement  \nbetween Defendants that one or more of them would misappropriate ACI’s Alleged \nTrade Secrets for the purpose of forming and furthering a competing venture.  \n101. There is no justifiable basis to conclude that these acts were in pursuit of \nan agreement or common scheme, even though they all relate to the formation and \ndevelopment of Bayatronics.   \n102. Therefore, the Court hereby GRANTS the Motion as it relates to ACI’s civil \nconspiracy claim, and it is DISMISSED with prejudice.  \nD. Unjust Enrichment \n103. A claim for unjust enrichment “is neither in tort nor contract but described \nas a claim in quasi contract or a contract implied in law.”  Booe v. Shadrick, 322 N.C. \n567, 570 (1988).   To establish a claim for unjust enrichment, “a party must have \nconferred a benefit on the other party,” and “[t]he benefit must not be gratuitous and \nit must be measurable.”  Id. at 570.   \n104. The Bayatronics Defendants first argue that a claim for unjust enrichment \nis “an alternative claim for breach of contract,” that ACI has failed to bring a breach \nof contract claim against the  Bayatronics Defendants, and that therefore summary \njudgment is appropriate.  In this respect, Defendants misapprehend the law.  \n105. While a claim for unjust enrichment cannot stand where an express \ncontract exists covering the same subject, Vetco Concrete Co. v. Troy Lumber Co., 256 \nN.C. 709, 714 (1962), a party is permitted to plead a claim for unjust enrichment in \nthe alternative to a claim for breach of contract, Bandy v. Gibson, 2017 NCBC LEXIS \n66, at *11 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 16, 2017).  Therefore, ACI is not required to assert a \nbreach of contract claim against the Bayatronics Defendants in order to assert a claim \nfor unjust enrichment. \n106. The Bayatronics Defendants further argue that ACI has provided no \nevidence that it actually conferred any benefit on Defendants, or that there is any \ncontract implied in law between ACI and the Bayatronics Defendants.  (Br. Supp. 29.)  \nThey contend that ACI ’s unjust enrichment claim focuses on the Bayatronics \nDefendants having conferred a benefit upon themselves, given that it is alleged that \nMr. Patel—a member of Bayatronics—retained trade secret information when he left \nACI and allegedly shared that information with the Bayatronics Defendants .  (Br. \nSupp. 29.)   \n107. ACI, however, contends that it conferred “the benefit of access to its \nconfidential information upon [ Jayesh] Patel,” because he and ACI entered into the \nConfidentiality Agreement , and that through the Defendants ’ conspiracy, all \nDefendants obtained the benefit  of that confidential information, and it would be \ninequitable for them to retain that benefit.  (Br. Opp. 28.)   \n108. However, ACI has alleged a taking  of information in violation of Jayesh \nPatel’s Confidentiality Agreement, not a willing transfer of that info rmation to the \nBayatronics Defendants.  See, e.g.,  Albritton v. Albritton, 2021 NCBC LEXIS 53, at \n**33–36 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 7, 2021)  (“Neither the allegations nor the facts in \nevidence support a  claim for unjust enrichment.  Movants have not alleged that \n[Plaintiffs] conferred benefits upon Defendants, but, rather, that Defendants took \nassets belonging to [Plaintiff]. ” (emphasis in original)); Klos Constr., Inc. v. Premier \nHomes & Props., LLC , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 85, at *48 –51 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 21, \n2020) (dismissing a claim for  unjust enrichment where “it is undisputed that the [ ] \nDefendants took any benefit of Plaintiff ’s good will”);  KNC Techs., LLC v. Tutton , \n2019 NCBC LEXIS 72, at *36–37 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, 2019) (stating that “a claim \nfor unjust enrichment must be based on a contract implied in law in which one party \nhas provided a benefit to another, such as goods or services, for which the first party \nshould rightfully be compensated”).   \n109. The access granted to  Jayesh Patel as a benefit of his Confidentiality \nAgreement, and his alleged wrongful taking and disseminating of that information to \nthe Bayatronics Defendants, does not support a claim for unjust enrichment against \nthe Bayatronics Defendants.   ACI did no t voluntarily confer a benefit on the \nBayatronics Defendants.  Rather, the evidence is clear that , at most,  Jayesh Patel \nwrongly misappropriated or retained trade secret information which the Bayatronics \nDefendants ultimately received. \n110. Accordingly, the Court hereby  GRANTS the Motion  as to ACI’s unjust \nenrichment claim, and the claim is DISMISSED with prejudice.   \nE. Punitive Damages \n111. North Carolina General Statutes § 1D-15 specifically sets forth the \ncircumstances appropriate for awarding punitive damages.  “While punitive damages \nshall not be awarded  against a person solely for breach of contract, they may be \nawarded if the claimant proves liability for compensatory damages, as well as one of \nthe following aggravating factors: (1) fraud; (2) malice ; or, (3) willful or wanton \nconduct.”  BluSky Restoration Contrs., LLC v. Brown , 2022 NCBC LEXIS 124, \nat **41–42 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 20, 2022) (quoting N.C.G.S. § 1D-15(a), (d) (cleaned \nup)).  “North Carolina courts have repeatedly held that ‘a claim for punitive damages \nis not a stand -alone claim.’ ”  Beam v. Sunset Fin. Servs. , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 56, at \n**29–30 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 3, 2019) (internal citations omitted).   “A claim for \npunitive damages may succeed only if plaintiffs prove . . . [liability] for compensatory \ndamages and [that] their injury was the result of fraud, malice, or willful or wanton \nconduct” under N.C.G.S §  1D-15.  Funderburk v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 241 \nN.C. App. 415, 425 (2015). \n112. Accordingly, the Motion is hereby GRANTED for punitive damages and \nthat claim is hereby DISMISSED.  This holding does not impair ACI’s ability to seek \npunitive damages for conduct which may later be found to meet the statutory \nrequirements of N.C.G.S. § 1D-15, et seq. \nVI. CONCLUSION \n113.
