Rogers and \nAlexandra Davidson, for Defendant Hound Ears Club, Inc.  \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge.  \n \nI. \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure; rather, the Court \nrecites only those facts from the Complaint that are relevant and necessary to the \nCourt’s determination of the motion.  See Aldridge v. Metro Life Ins. Co., 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 53, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 15, 2019).  \n4. Defendant is a non-profit corporation organized under North Carolina law, \nwhich owns and operates a private club named Hound Ears Club ( the “Club”) in \nWatauga County, North Carolina.  (Compl. ¶ 17, ECF No. 3 .)  The Club operates a \ngated residential subdivision that includes various communal amenities, including a \nswimming pool, a restaurant, tennis courts, and other facilities.  (Compl. ¶ 18.)  \n5. The Club sells and transfers equity memberships, up to a membership cap \nset by the Club’s bylaws.   (Compl. ¶¶ 20–21; Compl. Ex. A at 8 , ECF No. 3. )  The \nbylaws establish six categories of membership.   (Compl. Ex. A at 17– 21.)  Equity \nmembers in five of the six categories hold the right to one vote each during votes held \non Club business, including the election of the Club’s Board of Directors.  (Compl. ¶¶ \n25, 29.)  The Club does not require ownership of property in the Club’s subdivision as \na condition of equity membership.  (Compl. ¶ 30.)  \n6. As of 11 September 2021, the Club’s equity membership was filled up to its \ncurrent cap of 355 members.  Of the equity members, 276 owned property within the \nsubdivision, while the other 79 did not.   (Compl. ¶ 31.)  The Club’s bylaws make no \nexplicit distinction between property -owning equity members and non -property-\nowning equity members.  (Compl. Ex. A at 17–21.)  \n7. All equity members are subject to assessments by the Club .  The Club ’s \nauthority to assess payments from equity members is under the Club’s bylaws, which \nauthorize the Club’s Board of Directors to compute and levy dues and fees on equity \nmembers.  (Compl. Ex. A at 11.)  The Club collects fees from property owners within \nthe subdivision to fund the subdivision’s various amenities  pursuant to the Club’s \ndeclaration of restrictions.  (Compl. ¶¶ 37–38).1  \n8. The Club’s bylaws further authorize the Board to “issue and make available \n[the six membership categories] and other categories of membership as long  as the \nmaximum number of voting memberships does not exceed three hundred fifty -five \n(355) . . . .”  (Compl. Ex. A at 17.)  \n9. The bylaws also empower the B oard to “determine . . . the amount of dues, \nfees, . . . and other charges to be paid for each category of membership.”  (Compl. Ex. \nA at 11.)  \n \n1 See Second Amendment to Declarations of Restrictions for Hound Ears Club, recorded on \nOctober 14, 2003 in Watauga County, North Carolina Record Book 900, Page 225.  (Compl. ¶ \n36.) \n10. The Club bylaws establish a detailed set of procedures to amend the bylaws.  \n(Compl. Ex. A at 15.)  These procedures provide that the Board may amend the bylaws \nso long as the membership receives advance notice of the B oard’s vote, the B oard \napproves the amendment by a two-thirds supermajority, and the amendment is not \n“materially adverse” to the rights of the Club’s members.  (Compl. Ex. A at 15.)  \n11. Several categories of amendment are placed explicitly beyond the powers of \nthe Board, and require an affirmative vote of a majority of all members for passage.   \n(Compl. Ex. A at 15–16.)  The five such categories are any amendment that would : \n(1) increase t he cap on memberships, (2) change restrictions on memberships, (3) \nchange membership eligibility, (4) change the number of directors needed to \nconstitute the full B oard, or (5) which would alter the amendment procedures \nthemselves.  (Compl. Ex. A at 16.)  \n12. At the Board’s 11 September 2021 annual meeting, the Board adopted a new \nfee structure to fund the subdivision’s amenities .  (Compl. ¶ 39.)   This change \nincluded the assessment of fees against non-property-owning equity members, and it \nwas memorialized to the Club members in a 17 September 2021 letter from the \nPresident of the Board.  (Compl. Ex. B, ECF No. 3.)  \n13. Plaintiffs initiated the instant action on 22 March 2022, asserting claims \nagainst the Club for breach of the bylaws and seekin g a declaratory judgment.  (See \nCompl. ¶¶ 46–55.)  Defendant filed its Answer on 25 April 2022.  (See Answer, ECF \nNo. 5.) \n14. The parties filed the instant Motions on 30 June 2022.  (See Def.’s Mot. J. \nPleadings, ECF No. 14; Pls.’ Mot. J. Pleadings, ECF No. 16.)   After full briefing, the \nCourt held a hearing on the Motions on 17 August 2022 (the “Hearing”), at which all \nparties were represented by counsel.  The Motions are now ripe for resolution. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n15. Rule 12(c) is intended “ to dispose of baseless claims or defenses when the \nformal pleadings reveal their lack of merit and is appropriately employed where all \nthe material allegations of fact are admitted in the pleadings and only questions of \nlaw remain.”  Dicesare v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth., 376 N.C. 63, 70 (2020) \n(cleaned up).  In deciding a Rule 12(c) motion, “the trial court is required to view the \nfacts and permissible inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, \nwith all well- pleaded factual allegations in the nonmoving party ’s pleadings being \ntaken as true and all contravening assertions in the movant’s pleadings being taken \nas false.”  Id.  “ All allegations in the nonmovant’s pleadings, except conclusions of \nlaw, legally impossible facts, and matters not admissible in evidence at the trial, are \ndeemed admitted by the movant for purposes of the motion.”  Ragsdale v. Kennedy , \n286 N.C. 130, 137 (1974). \n16. “An exhibit, attached to and made a part of the [complaint],” Wilson v. Crab \nOrchard Dev. Co., 276 N.C. 198, 206 (1970), and documents that are “the subject of \nthe action and specifically referenced in the complaint,” Erie Ins. Exch. v. Builders \nMut. Ins. Co., 227 N.C. App. 238, 242 (2013), are properly considered on a Rule 12(c) \nmotion.  Where a document is attached, “[t]he terms of such exhibit control other \nallegations of the pleading attempting to paraphrase or construe the exhibit, insofar \nas these are inconsistent with its terms.”  Wilson , 276 N.C. at 206.  Before a Rule \n12(c) motion may be granted, however, “ [t]he party moving for judgment on the \npleadings must show that no material issue of fact exists and that he is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.”  Daniels v. Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co., 320 N.C. 669, \n682 (1987).  In the contract context, if it is clear from the plain language of a contract \nthat a breach has or has not occurred, judgment on the pleadings may be appropriate.  \nSee DeTorre v. Shell Oil Co., 84 N.C. App. 501, 504 (1987).  \nIII. \nANALYSIS \nA. The Board’s Authority to Create New Classes of Membership \n17. Plaintiffs’ central contention  is that the  Defendant’s Board of Directors’ \nadoption of the new fee structure creat ed new classes of membership beyond the six \ncategories established in the bylaws, which constituted an amendment to the bylaws \nand was therefore procedurally defective.  (See Pls.’ Br. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. J. Pleadings \n7 [hereinafter “Pls.’ Br. Supp.”], ECF No. 17.)  Defendants contend that the Board did \nnot create any new classes of membership or, in the alternative, that , if it did,  the \nBoard possessed the power to do so.  In either case, Defendant argues that the Board \nhad the power to assess the fees at issue in this case.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Def.’s Mot. J. \nPleadings 11–16 [hereinafter Def.’s Br. Supp.”], ECF No. 15.) \n18. As explained below, the Court concludes that, even assuming that the Board \ncreated a new non-property-owning equity membership class as Plaintiffs plead, the \nBoard nonetheless had the authority to do so under the bylaws, necessitating \ndismissal of Plaintiffs’ claims. \n19. To begin, the bylaws of a voluntary association ar e a contract between the \nentity and its members, over which traditional rules of contract interpretation \ngovern.  See Master v. Country Club of Landfall , 263 N.C.  App. 181, 187 (2018) \n(quoting Gaston Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Harrison, 311 N.C. 230, 237 (1984)).  “[I]f the \ncontract is clearly expressed, it must be enforced as it is written.”   Parks v. Venters \nOil Co., 255 N.C. 498, 501 (1961) (quoting Brock v. Porter, 220 N.C. 28, 28 (1941)).   \n20. Plaintiffs are correct that, prior to the Board’s creation of what Plaintiffs \ncontend is a new non- property-owning equity membership class, only six classes \nexisted.  ( See Pls.’ Br. Supp. 7 –8.)  But this observation is immaterial.  The Club’s \nbylaws expressly empower the Board to create membership classes beyond the six \nnamed classes.  (See Compl. Ex. A at 17 (“The Board reserves the right to issue and \nmake available these and other categories of membership . . . .” (emphasis added)).)  \nThe Board’s power to create new membership classes is subject only to the specified \nmembership cap and not to any limitation on the number of classes.  (See Compl. Ex. \nA at 17.)   Plaintiffs agree that the Board’s challenged action did not affect the \nmembership cap.  That there happened to be six classes at the time of the decisions \nat issue in this case is legally irrelevant.  \n21. Further, t he membership cap and the bylaws’ amendment procedures \ndemonstrate that the drafters of the bylaws knew how to constrain the Board’s \npowers when they wished.  For example, the bylaws prohibit the Board from altering \neligibility requirements for memberships without member approval .  The same is \ntrue for the membership cap.  (See Compl. Ex. A at 15–22.)  In contrast, the creation \nof new membership classes is not one of the categories of bylaws amendments that \nrequires member approval, so it  is not subject to the procedural requirements for a \nBoard-initiated amendment.  (See Compl. Ex. A 15–16.)   \n22. It is a central princi ple of contract interpretation that the various terms of \na contract are to be harmoniously construed, so that every provision is given effect if \npossible.  WakeMed v. Surgical Care Affiliates, LLC , 243 N.C. App. 820, 824 (2015) \n(quoting In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust , 210 N.C. App. 409, 415 (2011)).  The \nbylaw drafters chose to restrict some powers of the B oard, while leaving others \nunfettered.  Observing this distinction therefore provides for a more harmonious \nreading of the bylaws as a whole that better effectuates the intent of the drafters.    \n23. The Court’s interpretation is reinforced by t he use of the verb “ to issue,” \n(Compl. Ex. A at 17), which implies a unilateral power of the B oard to promulgate  \nmemberships without input from the members or any other entity.   See, e.g., Issue, \nBlack's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (“ to issue” means, among other things, “[t]o \nbe put forth officially” or “[t]o send out or distribute officially”); see also, e.g. , Mining \nEnergy, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs, 391 F.3d 571, 575 (4th  Cir. \n2004) (collecting dictionary definitions); Griswold v. United States, 59 F.3d 1571, 1580 \n(11th Cir. 1995) (“To ‘ issue’ means to send out, put into circulation, distribute or \npublish”); Religious Emps. Ass’n, Inc. v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 746 F.2d 1478, 1478 (6th \nCir. 1984) (“to issue” means for the issuer to relinquish control).  \n24. The Board’s creation of new classes of membership is therefore not a \ncontravention or amendment of the bylaws ; rather, it is  the exercise of a power \nexpressly granted to the Board by the bylaws.   Plaintiffs’ contention that the Board \nfailed to comply with procedural requirements to amend the bylaws is  therefore \ninapposite.  (See Pls’ Br. Supp. 7 (arguing that the change is an amendment adverse \nto the membership, and therefore that member approval is required for passage).)  \n25. The creation of new membership classes is a proper exercise of the Board’s \npowers under the bylaws , not an amendment of the bylaws .  T he Court therefore \nconcludes that, even if the Board created a new class  of non-property-owning equity \nmembership, Plaintiffs’ contention that the Board failed to comply with procedural \nrequirements to amend the bylaws is without merit. \nB. The Board’s Authority to Assess Fees on New Membership Classes \n26. The Court next  examines whether the Board acted properly to assess fees \nagainst th e new membership class  Plaintiff alleges the Board created .  Plaintiff \ncontends that the assessment of the fees at issue violates the North Carolina \nNonprofit Corporation Act.  (Pls.’ Br. Supp. 8–9.)  Defendant argues that the bylaws \nconfer the authority to assess fees as the Board sees fit, and that the fees here are \ntherefore proper.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. 13–16.) \n27. Because bylaws of a voluntary association are treated as a contract between \nthe entity and its members, see Master, 263 N.C. App. at 187, the Court must enforce \nthe unambiguous terms of the bylaws  as written.  See, e.g., Renfro v. Meacham, 50 \nN.C. App. 491, 496 (1981) (citing Root v. Allstate Ins. Co., 272 N.C. 580, 583 (1968)).  \n28. The Club’s bylaws state that the Board will “determine . . . the amount of \ndues, fees, . . . and other charges to be paid for each category of membership.”  (Compl. \nEx. A at 11.)  The bylaws therefore unambiguously empower the Board to assess fees \nin an amount it determines against “each” membership class.   (Compl. Ex. A at 11.)  \nThis authority is unrestricted and does not limit the assessment power to the original \nsix classes or to one class in particular.  (See Compl. Ex A at 11.) \n29. Based on the plain language of the bylaws, the Court agrees with Defendant \nthat the assessment of fees o n any new membership class of non -property-owning \nequity members was properly enacted .  The Board has the power to assess fees \nagainst each membership class, and here, it chose to assess a fee schedule against a \nparticular purported class.  (Compl. Ex. B.)   This action was within the Board’s \nexpress powers under the bylaws.  \n30. In addition, the assessment does not violate the North Carolina Nonprofit \nCorporation Act (the “Act”).  The Act provides, in relevant part, that all members of \na nonprofit corporation  shall have the same qualifications, rights, and obligations, \nexcept as authorized in the bylaws.  N.C.G.S. § 55A-6-20.  The Club’s bylaws expressly \nprovide for multiple categories of membership.  (See Compl. Ex. A at 17 (“The Board \nreserves the right to i ssue and make available these and other categories of \nmembership . . . .”) (emphasis added).)  Therefore, the classification of members into \nvarious classes of membership does not violate the statute because the bylaws  \nauthorize multiple classes.  \n31. Nor is there any allegation that individual members within the same class \nare subject to unequal treatment .  The non -property-owning equity members are \nobliged, as a class, to pay an assessment of $1,500 per year, and the property-owning \nequity members are obliged, as a class,  to pay $4,500 per year.  (See Compl. Ex. B.)  \nThe bylaws do not authorize unequal treatment, but the respective obligations of each \nclass are consistent within each class, and therefore do not violate the Act’s \nproscription against unequal treatment without bylaws authorization.   \n32. The Court therefore finds that if the Board’s action created a new \nmembership class of non-property-owning equity members, the Board’s assessment \nof fees against th is alleged new membership class was properly enacted under the \nClub’s bylaws.  \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n33. WHEREFORE, the Court, for the foregoing reasons, hereby ORDERS  as \nfollows:  \na. Plaintiffs’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, (ECF No. 16), is DENIED. \nb. Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings , (ECF No. 14),  is \nGRANTED and this action is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice.  \nSO ORDERED, this, the 31st day of August, 2022.  \n \n       /s/ Louis A.
