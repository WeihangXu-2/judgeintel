After considering the Motion, the briefs in support of and \nin opposition to the Motion, and  the appropriate evidence of record, the Court \nGRANTS the Motion and DISMISSES Plaintiff David J. deGorter’s ( “deGorter”) \nclaims with prejudice.   \nBrooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard, LLP, by Jeffery E. Oleynik, \nClint S. Morse, and Benjamin R. Norman, and Jennifer K. Van Zant , for \nPlaintiff David J. deGorter. \nSmith Moore Leatherwood LLP, by Neale T. Johnson, Jonathan P. Heyl, and \nWilliam R. Forstner, for Defendant Ca pitol Wealth, Inc. d/b/a Capit ol Wealth \nAdvisors.  \nBledsoe, Judge. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{2} This Motion is ripe for decision after a lengthy procedural history .  \nDeGorter initiated this lawsuit in 2010, originally asserting claims for (i) breach of \nfiduciary duty against Capitol Bancorp Ltd. (“Capitol Bancorp”) and Capitol Wealth; \n(ii) constructive fraud against Capitol Bancorp, Capitol Wealth, and Capitol National \nBank, N.A. (“Capitol National”  and, collectively with Capitol Bancorp and Capitol \n \n \n \nWealth, the “Capitol Defendants”); (iii) negligent misrepresentation against all three \nCapitol Defendants; and (iv) unfair and deceptive trade practices under N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 75 -1.1 also against all three Capitol Defendants .  This Court (Murphy, J.) \ngranted the Capitol Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss deGorter’s section 75-1.1 claim on \nJuly 29, 2011, leaving deGorter’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive \nfraud, and negligent misrepresentation to proceed to discovery.   \n{3} On January 19, 2012, the Capitol Defendants moved for summary judgment \non deGorter’s remaining claims, and Capitol National moved for summary judgment \non its counterclaim against deGorter.   \n{4} On August 9, 2012,  before the Court ru led on the Capit ol Defendants’ \nmotion, Capitol Bancorp filed a Chapter 11 petition in the United States Bankruptcy \nCourt for the Eastern District of Michigan (the “Bankruptcy Case”).  As a result, all \nfurther proceedings in this case against Capitol Bancorp were stayed pursuant to the \nautomatic stay in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. § 362.   \n{5} On October 15, 2012,  deGorter filed Proof of Claim No. 731 in the \nBankruptcy Case in the amount of $1.5 million (the “Proof of Claim”), attaching the \nComplaint in this case  as evidence of Capitol Bancorp’s alleged indebtedness.  On \nJanuary 24, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court granted relief from the automatic stay to \nallow deGorter to liquidate his Proof of Claim in this action.   \n{6} On January 17, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court confirme d Capitol Bancorp’s \nChapter 11 Plan  (the “Plan”) and, pursuant to the Plan,  appointed a liquidating \ntrustee over all of Capitol Bancorp’s assets.  The Plan enjoined all creditors, including \ndeGorter, from pursuing any claims against Capitol Bancorp; thus, under the terms \nof the confirmed Plan,  deGorter could not proceed against Capitol Bancorp  in this \nCourt, even though he had previously been granted relief from the automatic stay.   \nThe Plan also established a deadline of July 31, 2014 for creditors and any  party in \ninterest to object to deGorter’s Proof of Claim.   \n{7} On June 26, 2014, th e Court (Murphy, J.) ruled, in part, on the Capitol \nDefendants’ outstanding motion for summary judgment.  Judge Murphy  granted \nsummary judgment in favor of Capitol National on deGorter’s claims against Capitol \n \n \n \nNational, dismissing those claims with prejudice, and entered judgment on Capitol \nNational’s counterclaim against deGorter.  Judge Murphy withheld ruling, however, \non deGorter’s claims against Capitol Bancorp and Capitol Wealth pending final \ndisposition of the Bankruptcy Case.   \n{8} Neither the liquidating trustee  in the Bankruptcy Case , nor any of the \nCapitol Defendants, filed an objection to deGorter’s Proof of Claim  by the July 31, \n2014 deadline for objections.   \n{9} On November 9, 2015, Capitol Bancorp filed a motion in the Bankruptcy \nCase to enforce the Plan injunction, requesting the Bankruptcy Court to enter an \norder requiring deGorter to dismiss his claims against Capitol Bancorp in this case \nand allow ing his claims against Capitol Wealth to proceed  before this Court .  On \nNovember 16, 2015, deGorter filed a motion for declaration of approved claim and a \nrequest for relief from the post -confirmation injunction in the Bankruptcy Case, \nrequesting the Bankrupt cy Court to enter an order deeming his Proof of Claim as \nallowed in the Bankruptcy Case and permitting deGorter to proceed against Capitol \nWealth in this current action.    \n{10} The matter came on for hearing before the Bankruptcy Court on December \n15, 2015.  At the hearing, the parties announced their agreement to a consent order.  \nThe consent order, which was entered by the Bankruptcy Court on December 18, 2015 \n(the “Consent Order”) , ordered that: (1) “Proof of Claim No. 731 for $1.5 million is \nhereby allowed”; (2) “deGorter shall dismiss his claims against [Capitol Bancorp] in \n[the Business Court action ]”; (3) “[t]he assets of Capitol Wealth, Inc. are hereby \nabandoned by the above bankruptcy estate”; and (4) Capitol Wealth is not covered by \nthe post-confirmation injunction contained in the confirmed plan.”  (Capitol Wealth’s \nSuppl. Br. Ex. D.)   \n{11} Thereafter, on December 22, 2015, this Court held a telephonic status \nconference to discuss a plan for proce eding with adjudication of the present Motion  \nas brought by Capitol Wealth.  As discussed at the December 22 status conference,  \ndeGorter filed his Notice of Intent to Raise Res Judicata in connection with Capitol \nWealth’s Motion on January 15, 2016, and the Court permitted the parties to brief \n \n \n \nthe issue.  DeGorter dismissed his claims against Capitol Bancorp on January 25, \n2016.    \n{12} All briefing on the Motion has been completed.  The Court held a hearing \non the Motion on March 1, 2016, and the Motion is now ripe for resolution.   \nII. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n{13} The Court does not make findings of fact on motions for summary judgment \nunder Rule 56.  See Hyde Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, \n142, 215 S.E.2d 162, 164–65 (1975).  Rather, the Court summarizes facts, noting both \nthe facts that it believes are undisputed and others that it believes are contested, in \norder to provide context for the claims and the motion.  Id.  In ruling on a motion \nunder Rule 56, “the trial court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to \nthe non-movant, accepting the latter's asserted facts as true, and drawing all \nreasonable inferences in its favor.”  Anderson v. Demolition Dynamics, Inc., 136 N.C. \nApp. 603, 605, 525 S.E.2d 471, 472 (2000). \n{14} DeGorter is the sole and managing member of deGorter Capital Partners, \nLLC (“DCP”), an investment firm in the business of providing and securing funding \nfor start-up or purchased businesses.  Capitol Wealth is in the business of selling \nwealth management services and products and is owned, in part, by Capitol Bancorp.   \n{15} In August 2007, through a business contact at Forethought Financial \nGroup, Inc. (“FFG”), deGorter learned that FFG was seeking a buyer for Forethought \nFederal Savings Bank (“FFSB”) , a national trust savings bank that FFG owned .  \n(Hogan Dep. 19:7–19:25.)  DeGorter contacted his friend and business associate, Bob \nHogan (“Hogan”), who was President and CEO of Capitol Wealth at the time, about \nthe possib ility of  a Capitol Bancorp entity  acquiring FFSB  (the “Proposed \nForethought Acquisition”).  (Hogan Dep. 22:3–22:6.)   \n{16} On November 19, 2007, Capitol Bancorp and Capitol Wealth entered into a \nLetter of Intent with FFG and FFSB relating to the Proposed Forethought \nAcquisition (the “First LOI”) .  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 126.)   The transaction wa s to be \nstructured such that Capitol Bancorp, Capitol Wealth, FFG, and certain other \n \n \n \nshareholders of FFSB would form a new corporation, which would then acquire and \ncontrol FFSB.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 126.)   Neither deGorter nor DCP was a party to the \nFirst LOI.  The closing of the Proposed Forethought Acquisition was subject to several \nconditions, including the parties’ obtaining all regulatory approvals required to \nconsummate the deal.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 126.)   \n{17} On December 18, 2007, Capitol Bancorp and Capito l Wealth executed a \nsecond Letter of Intent with FFG and FFSB ; this time DCP was also a party (the \n“Second LOI”).  The Second LOI set forth conditions whereby DCP would contribute \ncash to the proposed new corporation and receive in exchange shares of the proposed \nnew corporation.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 127.)  As with the First LOI, the Second LOI \nconditioned the consummation of the Prop osed Forethought Acquisition on, among \nother things, obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 127.)   \n{18} Over the next couple of months, the parties further negotiated the structure \nand terms of the Proposed Forethought Acquisition, and deGorter reviewed financial, \nlegal, and structural information regarding the deal and Capitol Bancorp.  (DeGorter \nDep. 32:23–37:3.)   \n{19} On March 18, 2008, Capitol Wealth, DCP, FFSB, and FFG executed a \nContribution Agreement that set forth the material terms of the Proposed \nForethought Acquisition (the “Contribution Agreement”).  Although Capitol Bancorp \nwas not originally a party t o the Contribution Agreement, the parties executed an \nAssignment and Assumption Agreement in May 2008  whereby Capitol Bancorp \nreceived all of Capitol Wealth’s rights, interests, obligations, and liabilities under the \nContribution Agreement.   \n{20} Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, DCP was to invest approximately \n$2 million in exchange for a 24.6 percent interest in the new corporation.  (Defs.’ Br. \nSupp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. A. , hereafter “Contr. Agmt.”, § 2.3. )  DeGorter, acting on \nbehalf of DCP, submitted an application to the federal Office of Thrift Supervision for \nDCP’s proposed acquisition of shares in the new entity.  (DeGorter Dep. 50:11–50:17; \nDefs.’ Dep. Ex. 129.)  Capitol Bancorp also submitted an application to its regulators.  \n(DeGorter Dep. 53:8–53:10.)  According to deGorter, regulatory approval was the final \n \n \n \nstep needed before the Proposed Forethought Acquisition could be consummated.  \n(DeGorter Dep. 41:19–42:3.)   \n{21} On June 2, 2008, Capitol Bancorp responded to a Federal Reserve request \nfor information relating to the Proposed Forethought Acquisition and other proposed \ninvestments.  In this letter, Capitol Bancorp indicated that  it had decided, in \nDecember 2007, to suspend future development activity for the time being, but would \ncomplete planned transactions, including the Proposed Forethought Acquisition.  \n(Pl.’s Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J.  Ex. 7.)  Later that month, Capitol Bancorp withdrew \nits application to the Federal Reserve, although, on June 19, Hogan advised FFG that \nCapitol Bancorp continued to be committed to the Proposed Forethought Acquisition.   \n{22} DeGorter contends that in late June 2008, while regulatory approvals were \nstill pending, he learned from Hogan that federal regulators would approve the \nProposed Forethought Acquis ition only if Capitol Bancorp successfully raised \nadditional capital through a securities offering (the “Securities Offering”).  (DeGorter \nDep. 56:5–58:2.)  DeGorter further alleges that Hogan told him that the Securities \nOffering was undersubscribed and a sked him to purchase shares in the Securities \nOffering (“Trust Preferred Securities” or “Securities”) to help Capitol Bancorp obtain \nthe requisite regulatory approval for the Proposed Forethought Acquisition.  \n(DeGorter Dep. 56 :5–58:14.)  According to deGo rter, Hogan offered , on behalf of  \nCapitol Bancorp , to finance the full purchase price of deGorter’s purchase of \nSecurities, (deGorter Dep. 87 :23–88:5), and to “buy them back” after the Proposed \nForethought Acquisition was completed,  (deGorter Dep. 95:2–95:20).   \n{23} During these discussions, Hogan provided deGorter a copy of the \npreliminary prospectus for the offering of Trust Preferred Securities (the \n“Prospectus”), which deGorter acknowledged that he reviewed.  ( DeGorter Dep. \n58:15–58:23.)  The Prospectus included multiple warnings and risk factors, including \nthat loan loss allowances may prove inadequate to absorb actual losses, reliance on \ncommercial real estate for collateral could cause substantial credit losses, loan \norigination activities involve d collateral evaluations risks, there existed the \npossibility of an additional need for capital raising, and federal regulatory activities \n \n \n \ncould impact or limit operations.  (Defs. Dep. Ex. 134 S-13–S-22.)  Moreover, Capitol \nBancorp limited the guarantees associated with the Securities by only guaranteeing \ndistributions or redemptions under certain circumstances.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 134 S-20.)  \nCapitol Bancorp further disclosed that deferral of interest payments could affect the \nmarket price of the Securities.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 134 S-21.)   \n{24} The Prospectus also state d that “[t]here can be no assurance as to the \nmarket prices for the Trust Preferred Securities . . . ; therefore, the holders of the \nTrust Preferred Securities may suffer a loss.”  Further, the Prospectus warned that \nthe secondary market could be illiquid, and that there was no guarantee that a \npurchaser would be able to sell the Securities at the price originally paid for them.   \n(Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 134 S-22.) \n{25} In addition to reviewing the Prospectus, deGorter discussed the Securities \nOffering with his personal investment advisor.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. \nB.)   \n{26} On July 8, 2008,  deGorter purchased 150,000 shares of Trust Preferred \nSecurities for a total investment of $1.5 million .  (DeGorter Dep. 87:20–87:22; Defs.’ \nDep. Ex. 135.)   DeGorter used existing funds in his brokerage account to purchase \nthe Securities.  (DeGorter Dep. 92:8–92:14.)   \n{27} The week before, o n July 2, 2008, Capitol National had approved two \nseparate lines of credit for deGorter: (i) a $1,050,000 line of credit to be secured by \ndeGorter’s 150,000 shares of Trust Preferred Securities, and (ii) a $450,000 unsecured \nline of credit.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 141.)  The loan documents were signed by deGorter \nand dated July 3, 2008.  ( Defs.’ Dep. Exs. 142, 144.)  It is undisputed, however, that \ndeGorter did not draw on either line of credit until September 5, 2008, two months \nafter his purchase of Securities.  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 148.)  At the time deGorter drew on \nthe lines of credit, the Proposed Forethought Acquisition had not been finalized, and \ndeGorter had no obligation to contribute any capital to the Proposed Forethought \nAcquisition.  (DeGorter Dep. 134:7–134:11.)   \n{28} Ultimately, federal regulators did not approve the Proposed Forethought \nAcquisition.    \n \n \n \n{29} Under the terms of the loan agreements, each line of credit was to mature \non July 3, 2009.  (Defs.’ Dep. Exs. 142, 144.)  It is undisputed that deGorter renewed \neach line of credit, and, at the time deGorter renewed the lines of credit, the Proposed \nForethought Acquisition had  been terminated, (deGorter Dep. 80 :17–80:24), and \ndeGorter had not asked Capitol Bancorp to buy back his Securities ,  (deGorter Dep. \n97:7–97:19).   \n{30} FFG formally terminated the Second LOI on January 9, 2009.  DeGorter \ndid not ask Capitol Bancorp to “buy back” his Trust Preferred Securities at the time \nthe transaction was terminated and only first inquired about a possible buy back of \nhis now substantially devalued Securities in late 2009 or early 2010.   \n{31} Under the terms of the renewals for each loan, the $1,050,000 line of credit \nmatured on April 3, 2010, and the $450,000 line of credit matured on January 3, 2010.  \n(Defs.’ Dep. Exs. 134, 155.)  DeGorter eventually fully satisfied the $450,000 \nobligation to Capitol National; he never repaid the $1,050,000 loan.   \nIII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n{32} Summary judgment is appropriate when the “pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  The moving party \nhas “the burden of showing there is no triable is sue of material fact.”  Farrelly v. \nHamilton Square, 199 N.C. App 541, 543, 459 S.E.2d 23, 25 –26 (1995).  The movant \nmay meet this burden “by showing either that: (1) an essential element of the non -\nmovant’s case is nonexistent; or (2) based upon discovery , the non -movant cannot \nproduce evidence to support an essential element of its claim; or (3) the movant \ncannot surmount an affirmative defense which would bar the claim.”  McKinnon v. \nCV Indus., 213 N.C. App. 328, 332, 713 S.E.2d 495, 499 (2011) (citation omitted.)  In \ndetermining whether this burden has been met, the Court must view the evidence in \nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences \nin its favor.  Whitley v. Cubberly , 24 N.C. App. 204, 206 –07, 210 S.E.2d 28 9, 291 \n \n \n \n(1974).  Our Supreme Court has observed that “s ummary judgment is particularly \ninappropriate where issues such as motive, intent, and other subjective feelings and \nreactions are material and where the evidence is subject to conflicting \ninterpretations.”  Creech v. Melnik , 347 N.C. 520, 530, 495 S.E.2d 907, 913 (1998); \nsee generally McKee v. James, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 74, at *13–14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. \n31, 2014) (discussing standard). \nIV. \nANALYSIS \nA. Issue Preclusion \n{33} The Court first addresses deGorter’s arg ument, raised in supplemental \nbriefing, that the Bankruptcy Court’s Consent Order allowing deGorter’s Proof of \nClaim against Capitol Bancorp bars Capitol Wealth from re -litigating issues that \nwere decided by the Bankruptcy Court.   \n{34} Issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, bars “successive litigation of an \nissue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination \nessential to the prior judgment, even if the issue recurs in the context of a different \nclaim.”  Taylor v. Sturgell , 553 U.S. 880, 89 2 (2008) (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).1   The party invoking issue preclusion must, under federal common \nlaw, establish the following elements: \n(1) the issue to be precluded is identical to the issue already litigated, \n(2) the issue was actua lly determined in the prior proceeding, (3) the \ndetermination of the issue was an essential part of the decision in the \nprior proceeding, (4) the prior judgment was final and valid, and (5) the \nparty against whom estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity \nto litigate the issue. \nColeman v. Cmty. Trust Bank (In re Coleman), 426 F.3d 719, 729 (4th Cir. 2005).   \n{35} DeGorter has not met his burden to establish that the Proof of Claim was \n“actually litigated” in the Bankruptcy Case.  “In the case of a judg ment entered by \n                                                 \n1 Federal common law determines the preclusive effect of prior federal bankruptcy court orders in \nNorth Carolina state court proceedings.  See United States ex rel. May v. Purdue Pharma L.P. , 737 \nF.3d 908, 912 (4th Cir. 2013) (“The preclusive effect of a judg ment issued by a federal court is a legal \nquestion governed by federal common law[.]”).   \n \n \n \nconfession, consent, or default, none of the issues is actually litigated.”  Arizona v. \nCalifornia, 530 U.S. 392, 414 (2000)  (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § \n27 cmt. e (1982)) .  Indeed, “consent agreements ordinarily are intende d to preclude \nany further litigation on the claim presented but are not intended to preclude further \nlitigation on any of the issues presented.”  Id. (emphasis added) (quoting 18 C. Wright, \nA. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4443 (198 1)).  The reason \nfor such a rule is that “a party may choose not to litigate issues for reasons that have \nnothing to do with the merits of the case.”  In re O’Quinn, 401 B.R. 739, 743 (Bankr. \nM.D.N.C. 2009).  Here, the Consent Order entered by the Bankruptcy Court was \nstipulated to by both deGorter and Capitol Wealth and contemplated continuation of \nthe action against Capitol Wealth in this Court.  Accordingly, the Court concludes \nthat Capitol Wealth’s liability in this action was not “actually liti gated” in the \nBankruptcy Court and thus that collateral estoppel does not apply to bar Capitol \nWealth’s defense.      \nB. Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Constructive Fraud \n{36} DeGorter’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud both \nrequire the ex istence of a fiduciary duty.  See, e.g., Dalton v. Camp , 353 N.C. 647, \n651, 548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001) (“For a breach of fiduciary duty to exist, there must \nfirst be a fiduciary relationship between the parties.”); Keener Lumber Co. v. Perry, \n149 N.C. App. 19, 28, 560 S.E.2d 817, 823 (2002) (stating that to prove a constructive \nfraud claim, “a plaintiff must show (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty”).  A fiduciary \nduty arises when “there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity \nand good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests \nof the one reposing confidence.”  Curl v. Key, 311 N.C. 259, 264, 316 S.E.2d 272, 275 \n(1984) (citation omitted).   \n{37} DeGorter argues that  Capitol Wealth owed fiduciary duties to  deGorter \nbecause the execution of the Contribution Agreement  allegedly created a joint \nventure between them.  Capitol Wealth contends in opposition that no fiduciary duty \nruns from Capitol Wealth to deGorter because (i) deGorter was not one of the alleged \njoint venturers, (ii) the Contribution Agreement created no fiduciary duty, and (iii) in \n \n \n \nany event, no joint venture was ever consummated because the transaction \ncontemplated by the Contribution Agreement never closed.   \n{38} DeGorter’s breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims hinge on \nhis claim that a joint venture existed between d eGorter and Capitol Wealth arising \nout of the Contribution Agreement.  DeGorter, however,  did not enter the \nContribution Agreement in his individual capacity , but rathe r on behalf of DCP.  \nGiven that deGorter has not offered any evidence suggesting that DCP’s corporate \nform should be disregarded for any reason , to the extent that Capitol Wealth owed \nany duties under the Contribution Agreement, those duties were owed to DCP, not to \ndeGorter individually , and deGorter’s fiduciary duty -based claims should be \ndismissed as a result.  See Silverman v. Miller , 155 B.R. 362, 375 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. \n1993) (applying North Carolina law and holding that individuals who are not actual \npartners in a partnership do not owe fiduciary duties based on their agreement to \nenter into a partnership in the future).   \n{39} Moreover, our Court of Appeals has explained that: \nthe essential elements of a joint venture are (1) an agreement to engage \nin a single business venture with the joint sharing of profits,  Edwards \nv. Bank, 39 N.C. App. 261, 275, 250 S.E.2d 651, 661 (1979), (2) with each \nparty to the joint venture having a right in some measure to direct the \nconduct of the other “through a necessary fidu ciary relationship .”  \nCheape v. Town of Chapel Hill , 320 N.C. 549, 562, 359 S.E.2d 792, 799 \n(1987) (emphasis in original).  The second element requires that the \nparties to the agreement stand in the relation of principal, as well as \nagent, as to one another.  Id. at 562, 359 S.E.2d 799–800. \nSe. Shelter Corp. v. Btu, Inc., 154 N.C. App. 321, 327, 572 S.E.2d 200, 204–05 (2002).   \n{40} Although in his effort to satisfy the second element deGorter argues in \nconclusory fashion that “each party [to the Contribution Agreement] ha[d] a right in \nsome measure to direct the conduct of the other ,” (Pl.’s Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. 16),  \ndeGorter has not brought forward any evidence showing that he and Capitol Wealth \nstood in the relation of principal and agent to one another  at any time.  As a result, \nbecause deGorter has failed to offer evidence on the second element necessary to \ncreate a joint venture, the Court concludes that a joint venture was never formed \n \n \n \nbetween deGorter and Capitol Wealth as a matter of North Carolina law, providing a \nfurther basis for di smissal of deGorter’s breach of fiduciary duty and constructive \nfraud claims.  Se. Shelter Corp. , 154 N.C. App. at 327, 572 S.E.2d at 204 –05 \n(dismissing breach of fiduciary duty claim where plaintiff failed to show agency  \nrelationship, and hence a joint venture, between plaintiff and defendant); see also \nCheape, 320 N.C. at 562, 359 S.E.2d at 299 (finding joint venture did not exist because \nplaintiff failed to show agency relationship). \n{41} Last, it is undisputed that the transactions contemplated by the \nContribution Agreement did not occur because the required regulatory approvals \nwere never obtained.  As a result, by the Contribution Agreement’s own express \nterms, the parties’ obligations t o each other under the Agreement never became \neffective.  (Contr. Agmt. § 9.1) (“[t]he respective obligations of each Party under this \nAgreement shall be subject to the fulfillment at or prior to the Closing Date of . . . all \nRegulatory Approvals”).  Accordingly, even if the Contribution Agreement somehow \ncould be read to create a joint venture between Capitol Wealth and non -party \ndeGorter, that joint venture never came to fruition.  Again, deGorter’s lack of evidence \nof a joint venture is fatal to his breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud claims. \nSee, e.g., Crockett Capital Corp . v. Inland Am . Winston Hotels , Inc., 2011 NCBC \nLEXIS 7, at *59 –61 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 28, 2011 ) (dismissing con structive fraud \nclaim for failure to show fiduciary duty where implementing documents required to \nform joint venture under parties’ agreement were never executed).  \n{42} The fact that it was represented in two industry publications that Capitol \nWealth and Capitol Bancorp described the proposed transaction as a “joint venture” \ndoes not alter the Court’s analysis.  Indeed, both publications identified DCP, not \ndeGorter individually, as the contracting party with Capitol Bancorp , and neither \narticle suggests in any way that Capitol Wealth and deGorter were in an agency \nrelationship with one another at any time.  \n{43} Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that \ndeGorter’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud should be \ndismissed with prejudice. \n \n \n \nC. Negligent Misrepresentation \n{44} A claim for negligent misrepresentation is stated as follows: \nOne who in the course of his business or profession supplies information \nfor the guidance of others in their business transactions is subject to \nliability for harm caused to them by their reliance upon information if \n \n(a) he fails to exercise that care and competence in obtaining and \ncommunicating the information which its recipient is justified in \nexpecting, and  \n \n(b) the harm is suffered  \n \n(i) by the person or one of the class of persons for whose guidance \nthe information was supplied, and  \n \n(ii) because of his justifiable reliance upon it in a transaction in \nwhich it was intended to influence his conduct or in a transaction \nsubstantially identical therewith. \nHelms v. Holland, 124 N.C. App. 629, 635, 478 S.E.2d 513, 517 (1996) (citing Powell \nv. Wold, 88 N.C. App. 61, 67, 362 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1987)).  In sum, “the action lies \nwhere pecuniary loss results from the supplying of false information to others for the \npurpose of guiding them in their business transactions.”  Howard v. Cnty. of Durham, \n227 N.C. App. 46, 55, 748 S.E.2d 1, 7 (2013) (citation omitted).   \n{45} DeGorter relies on three alleged misrepresentations to support his claim \nagainst Capitol Wealth: (i) that a “successful Trust Preferred Securities offering was \nrequired—and sufficient—for Federal Reserve approval of the [Proposed Forethought \nAcquisition],” (Compl. ¶ 82); (ii) that “if Mr. deGorter just wanted [to] own the Trust \nPreferred Securities for a short while, [Capitol Bancorp] would buy the shares back \nfrom Mr. deGorter after the [Proposed Forethought Acquisition] was completed,” \n(Compl. ¶ 32); and (iii) that Capitol Bancorp was a viable, strong entity.  ( See, e.g., \ndeGorter Dep. 68:17–69:16.)   \n{46} Capitol Wealth  first contends that deGorter’s reliance on each alleged \nmisrepresentation was unreasonable as a matter of law because he had access to the \nProspectus and failed to conduct his own reasonable due diligence.  The Court agrees \nin these circumstances. \n \n \n \n{47} “[R]easonable reliance is . . . a required element of negligent \nmisrepresentation.”  L’Heureux Enters. v. Port City Java, Inc. , 2009 NCBC LEXIS \n26, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sep. 4, 2009) (citing MacFadden v. Louf , 182 N.C.  App. \n745, 749, 643 S.E.2d 432 (2007)).  “Reliance is reasonable if the plaintiff has made an \nindependent investigation . . . .  Reliance is not reasonable where the plaintiff could \nhave discovered the truth of the matter through reasonable diligence, but failed to \ninvestigate[.]”  Id. at *12 (citing Calloway v. Wyatt , 246 N.C. 129, 97 S.E.2d 881 \n(1957)).  “The reasonableness of a party’s reliance is a question for the jury, unless \nthe facts are so clear that they support only one conclusion.”  Id. (citing Marcus Bros. \nTextiles, Inc. v. Price Waterhouse, LLP , 350 N.C. 214, 513 S.E.2d 320 (1999) and \nState Props., LLC v. Ray , 155 N.C. App. 65, 73, 574 S.E.2d 180 (2002)) (concluding \nthat plaintiff’s reliance on alleged misrepresentations was unreasonable as a matter \nof law); see also Angell v. Kelly, No. 1:01CV00435, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87567, at \n*27 n.7 (M.D.N.C. Nov. 30, 2006) (applying North Carolina law  and holding that \n“[r]easonableness is usually a jury question, except when ‘the facts are so clear that \nthey support only one conclusion,’ which is usually the case when a ‘plaintiff fails to \nmake any independent investigation ’”) (quoting State Props., 155 N.C. App. at 73, \n574 S.E.2d at 186). \n{48} It is undisputed that Capitol Wealth provided the Prospectus to deGorter \nin connection with the Securities Offering.  It is also undisputed that deGorter \nreviewed the Prospectus prior to purchasing the Securities .  (DeGorter Dep. 58:18–\n58:23.)  The Prospectus did not contain any provision suggesting that the successful \nplacement of the Securities Offering was a requirement for Federal Reserve approval \nof the Proposed Forethought Acquisition or that Capitol Bancorp would buy back \ndeGorter’s Securities at any time or at any specific price.   \n{49} Moreover, the Prospectus contained plain warnings that deGorter “should \nrely only on the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this \n[Prospectus],” that “[n] o one is authorized to give information other than that \ncontained in this [Prospectus] ,” and that “[i]f anyone provides you with different or \ninconsistent information, you should not rely on it.”   (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 134.)  The \n \n \n \nProspectus also identified specific risk factors, including that “[d]eferral of interest \npayments could adversely affect the market price of the [Securities],” “[c]laims would \nbe limited upon bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership,” “[t]here can be no assurance \nas to the market prices for the [ Securities] . . . ; therefore, the holders of the \n[Securities] may suffer a loss,” and “[ t]he secondary market for the [ Securities] may \nbe illiquid.”  (Defs.’ Dep. Ex. 134.)   \n{50} Numerous Business Court decisions have found a plaintiff’s purported \nreliance to be unreasonable as a matter of law in similar circumstances.  See, e.g., \nL’Heureux, 2009  NCBC LEXIS 26 , at * 13 (“Plaintiffs’ reliance on any alleged \nmisrepresentations [contrary to offering and contract documents] . . . as a matter of \nlaw was unreasonable.”); JDH Capital, LLC v. Flowers, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 8, at *32–\n33 (N.C. Super. Ct.  Mar. 13, 2009) (plaintiff’s reliance on oral representations \ncontrary to letter of intent the parties executed was unreasonable as a matter of law); \nCrockett, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *74 (plaintiff’s reliance unreasonable as a matter \nof law where plaintiff failed to inspect documents in its possession that would have \ncured alleged omission); Nelson v. Alliance Hospitality Mgmt., LLC , 2011 NCBC \nLEXIS 43, at *30–31 (N.C. Super. Ct.  Nov. 22, 2011 ) (expressing doubt at the Rule \n12(b)(6) stage that plaintiff could prove re asonable reliance where clear language of \ndisclosed document provided accurate information). \n{51} In addition, although deGorter alleges that Hogan represented that a \nsuccessful Securities Offering was necessary to obtain Federal Reserve approval of \nthe Proposed Forethought Acquisition, he also has acknowledged that Joe Reid, not \nHogan, was the executive who directed Capitol Wealth’s communications with federal \nregulators, including the Federal Reserve,  (deGorter Dep. 37 :2–37:16), and further \nthat he never contacted Reid to confirm or explain Hogan’s alleged misrepresentation. \n{52} It is also undisputed that none of the loan documents executed by deGorter \nincluded any representation that Capitol Bancorp or Capitol Wealth was obligated to \nbuy back the Securities that served as collateral for the loans, ( Defs.’ Dep. Exs. 142, \n143, 144, 154, 155).  Similarly, deGorter has offered no evidence that Capitol Wealth \n \n \n \nmade any representations about the price at which Capitol Bancorp would \npurportedly “buy back” deGorter’s Securities.  (DeGorter Dep. 95:14–95:16.)   \n{53} Finally, as to Capitol Bancorp ’s financial health, deGorter has offered no \nevidence that deGorter sought any information about Capitol Bancorp from any \nsource, and Capitol Worth has proffered undisputed evidence from the public record \nreflecting Capitol Wealth’s declining financial performance as of January 2008 , \ninformation the Court concludes was rea dily available to deGorter through the \nexercise of reasonable diligence .  Furthermore, deGorter admitted that he had no \nevidence that Hogan knew of any specific financial trouble at Capitol Bancorp prior \nto the Securities Offering.  (DeGorter Dep. 65:11–65:15.)   \n{54} Accordingly, based on the above, the Court concludes that deGorter has \nfailed to offer evidence that he reasonably relied on any alleged misrepresentations, \nand therefore that Capitol Wealth’s Motion seeking dismissal of deGorter’s claim for \nnegligent misrepresentation should be granted.2   \nV. \nCONCLUSION \n{55}   For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS Capitol Wealth’s \nMotion and DISMISSES all of deGorter’s remaining claims in this action with \nprejudice. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Capitol Wealth also contends that the alleged misrepresentations deGorter relies upon to support \nhis claim are in fact negligent omissions, a basis for a negligent misrepresentation claim not recognized \nin North Carolina.  For clarity, the Court concludes that deGorter’s claim for negligent \nmisrepresentation is likewise dismiss ed with prejudice to the extent the claim is based on negligent \nomissions.  See, e.g. , Bonham v. Wolf Creek Acad. , 767 F. Supp. 2d 558, 570 (W.D.N.C. 2011) \n(“[N]egligent omissions . . . as opposed to negligent misrepresentations cannot form the basis of a claim \nfor negligent misrepresentation under North Carolina law.”); see also Volumetrics Med. Imaging, Inc. \nv. ATL Ultrasound, Inc., 243 F. Supp. 2d  386, 415 n.13 (M.D.N.C. 2003) (“[U]nder North Carolina law, \nomissions cannot form the basis for the tort of  negligent misrepresentation.”).  Based on the Court’s \nconclusions concerning deGorter’s negligent misrepresentation claim, the Court declines to specifically \naddress Capitol Wealth’s additional contention that deGorter’s losses in connection with any alle ged \nmisrepresentation were  proximately caused by his  own investment strategy, and not by Capitol \nWealth, and thus that his claim is subject to dismissal on this additional, independent basis.  \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 31st day of May, 2016. \n \n/s/ Louis A.
