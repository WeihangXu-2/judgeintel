William Moody served as president and CEO of Vanguard Pai Lung, LLC \n(“Vanguard”) for nearly a decade.  Claiming that  Moody had siphoned money and \nassets, the company fired him .  Then it sued him, three members of his family, and \ntwo entities that he owns.  Moody  denies the allegations.  He has also demanded \nadvancement of his legal fees and expenses , citing the indemnification and \nadvancement rights given to Vanguard’s managers in its operating agreement .  \nVanguard has refused. \n2. This decision a ddresses a single issue : whether Moody  is entitled to \njudgment on the pleadings for his advancement counterclaim .  As to liability, the \nVanguard Pai Lung, LLC v. Moody, 2020 NCBC 56. \nanswer is yes.  The amount due for expenses incurred by Moody to date and the \nmanner in which Vanguard must pay his expenses going forward will require further \nproceedings.  \nWomble Bond Dickson (US) LLP, by Matthew F.

Vanguard, a North Carolina limited liability company , makes and sells \nhigh-speed circular knitting machines.  When the company was formed in 2009 , \nMoody became president, CEO, and one of five managers.  He is still a manager but \nno longer an officer, having been fired in 2018 as a prelude to this suit. \n4. Vanguard’s complaint describes a typical, if wide-ranging, case of abuse of \nexecutive authority.  If the complaint is to be believed, Moody “used his positions as \nPresident, CEO, and manager . . . to misappropriate and embezzle funds and property \nfrom [Vanguard], and to otherwise enrich himself, his family, [and] friends through \nnumerous self-dealing and illegal activities .  . . .”  (Compl. ¶  23, ECF No. 3 .)  That \nincludes installing six of his children in high-ranking jobs, complete with costly perks \nand inflated salaries.  ( See Compl. ¶¶  62, 63, 68, 70, 74, 77, 81, 90, 170.)  It also \nincludes allegations that he stole  Vanguard’s tax refunds, ruined its relatio nships \nwith clients and lenders, and cooked up a sweetheart deal to have it rent property \nfrom one of his own companies .  (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 26, 29, 38, 39, 48, 52, 74–76.)  \nVanguard presses sixteen claims in all—including fraud, conversion, embezzlement, \nbreach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. \n5. Moody not only denies these allegations but contends, by counterclaim, that \nVanguard must pay for his legal defense.  Vanguard’s operating agreement gives its \nmanagers broad indemnification and advancement rights.  The company  must \nindemnify “to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law” any manager who \nbecomes a party to a civil action “by reason of the fact that such person  is or was an \nauthorized representative of” the LLC.  (Operating Agrmt. §  3.7(a), ECF No. 63.1.)  \nLikewise, it must pay the manager’s expenses, including attorney’s fees, “in advance \nof the final disposition” so long as the manager provides an undertaking to repay \nthose sums if not entitled to indemnification when all is said and done.  (Operating \nAgrmt. § 3.7(b).)  These rights endure  even when Vanguard itself sues and accuses \nthe manager of bad acts .  ( See Operating Agrmt. §  3.7(f).)  Moody demanded \nadvancement and provided the required undertaking, yet Vanguard refused.  (See \nDefs.’ Am. Countercl. Ex. A, ECF No. 59.)   \n6. The advancement counterclaim is one of twelve being pursued by Moody and \nhis fellow defendants.  An earlier opinion describes them in detail.  See Vanguard Pai \nLung, LLC v. Moody , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *2 –7, 25 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 19, \n2019) (denying Vanguard’s motion to dismiss eight counterclaims, not including the \nadvancement counterclaim) .  The other counterclaims are relevant here because \nMoody believes the right to advancement extends to his affirmative claims for relief \nas well as his defense of the claims against him.  Vanguard has asserted affirmative \ndefenses, including unclean hands and Moody’s own alleged  breach of the operating \nagreement.  (See Pls.’ Answer 15, ECF No. 77.) \n7. Now that the pleadings are closed, Moody  argues that his advancement \ncounterclaim is ripe for adjudication.   He asks the Court to  enter judgment on the \npleadings under Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.  (See ECF \nNo. 78.)  The Court decides the motion with the benefit of full briefing and argument \nfrom counsel at a hearing in September 2019. \nII. \nANALYSIS \n8. In some respects, this dispute prese nts questions of first impression.  Our \nappellate courts have  not addressed advancement beyond a token mention or two.   \nSee Russell M. Robinson , II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporation Law  § 18.06 \n(7th ed. 2019) [“Robinson”] .  The most thorough —perhaps the only —discussion of \nNorth Carolina law on advancement appears in a recent decision of this Court  and \ndraws heavily from Delaware’s deep body of law  in the area.  See generally Wheeler \nv. Wheeler, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 156 (N.C. Sup er. Ct. Nov. 15, 2018).   With so little \nguidance, it is best  to start with an explanation of what advancement is and what \npurpose it serves.   \n9. In short, indemnification and advancement are tools used to allocate risk \nbetween a corporation or LLC and its leaders.  Corporate service can be risky.  Deals \nand decisions made in good faith sometimes go south and, when they do, could result \nin legal claims against corporate officials.  A zealous legal defense isn’t cheap, so the \nbest and brightest might not gamb le on corporate service knowing that they would \nhave to bear the cost of any lawsuit arising from that service. \n10. Indemnification can alleviate that concern.  It is the company’s promise to  \nreimburse an official—such as an officer, director, or manager—“for all out of pocket \nexpenses and losses caused by an underlying claim .”  Id. at *26 (quoting Majkowski \nv. Am. Imaging Mgmt. Servs., LLC , 913 A.2d 572, 586 (Del. Ch. 2006)).   Of course,  \ncompanies usually do not—and often by law cannot—indemnify officials for bad-faith \nconduct.  See, e.g. , N.C.G.S. §  55-8-51(d).  As a result, the right to indemnification \nmay not kick in until the official mounts a successful defense, demonstrating that she \nacted in good faith .  Anyone familiar with complex civil litigation  knows that could \ntake a while.  For officials who do not have the financial wherewithal to go the \ndistance, indemnification might look like an empty assurance. \n11. Advancement provides the immediate relief that indemnification does not.  \nAn agreement to advan ce expenses obligates  the company to pay them  during the \nlitigation—in other words, before the right to indemnification is established .  See \nWheeler, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 156, at *27.  The official, in turn, must agree to pay back \nwhat she has received if it later turns out that she is not entitled to indemnification.  \nSee id.  This arrangement “provides corporate officials with immediate interim relief \nfrom the personal out -of-pocket financial burden of paying the significant on- going \nexpenses inevitably involved with investigations and legal proceedings.”  Homestore, \nInc. v. Tafeen, 888 A.2d 204, 211 (Del. 2005).   \n12. Long ago, t he General Assembly  gave North Carolina corporations  the \npower to advance litigation expenses to directors, all to further the public policy of \nenabling corporations to attract talented leaders .  See N.C.G.S. §§ 55-8-50, 55-8-53.  \nAlthough there is no analogous statute for LLCs, silence should not be mistaken for \ndisapproval.  Members of LLCs have great leeway to arrange their affairs by contract.  \nSee id. § 57D-10-01.  Without question, “[a]dvances of expenses may . . . be addressed \nin an operating agreement ,” just as the members of Vanguard chose to do here.   \nRobinson § 34.04[4]. \n13. When it works as designed, advancement ensures  that company officials \nhave the resources to resist unjustified lawsuits without relieving them of ultimate \nresponsibility for any  bad-faith conduct.  But for all its virtues, advancement is a \ntinderbox for  ancillary litigation .  Few companies,  having sued an official for bad \nbehavior, are willing to fund both sides of the lawsuit, even when they’ve contracted \nto do so.   That often prompts early and accelerat ed motions practice in which the \nofficial seeks summary relief before reaching the merits of the underlying claims.  See, \ne.g., Radiancy, Inc. v. Azar, 2006 Del. Ch. LEXIS 13, at *1–4 (Del. Ch. Jan. 23, 2006).  \n14. This dispute is a good example.  Vanguard, after  accusing Moody of \npervasive disloyalty, has refused to advance his litigation expenses.  Moody contends \nthat the Court need not look beyond the pleadings to decide the advancement dispute \nin his favor.  In this posture, the Court must take Vanguard’s allegations as true and \ndisregard Moody’s contrary allegations.  See Ragsdale v. Kennedy, 286 N.C. 130, 137, \n209 S.E.2d 494, 499 (1974) .  Moody can succeed only if t he pleadings “clearly \nestablish[] that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that he is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.”  Carpenter v. Carpenter, 189 N.C. App. 755, 761, 659 \nS.E.2d 762, 767 (2008). \nA. “By Reason of the Fact” \n15. The operating agreement confers a broad, mandatory right to advancement \non Vanguard’s managers, including Moody.  Read together, sections 3.7(a) and (b) put \ntwo conditions on advancement: that Moody  must have been sued “by reason of the \nfact” that he was an authorized representative of Vanguard; and that he must provide \nan undertaking to repay advanced expenses if “ultimately determined ” not to be  \nentitled to indemnification.  (Operating Agrmt. §§ 3.7(a), (b).)  Vanguard disputes the \nfirst but not the second. \n16. The phrase “by reason of the fact” commonly appears in corporate \nadvancement and indemnification provisions, including th ose at issue  in Wheeler.  \nThere, the Court found  Delaware law “ instructive” when interpreting its meaning.   \nWheeler, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 1 56, at *34.   Moody opposes looking to Delaware law , \nclaiming that it conflicts with North Carolina law.  But the only North Carolina case \nthat Moody cites has nothing to do with advancement, comes from a context other \nthan corporate law, and deal s with different contract language .  See CSX Transp., \nInc. v. City of Fayetteville, 247 N.C. App. 517, 525–27, 785 S.E.2d 760, 765–66 (2016).  \nThere is no conflict , and Wheeler’s approach is sound.  I f the Court is wrong about \nthat, Moody will suffer no harm  because he meets the “by reason of the fact” \nrequirement even as it has been interpreted by Delaware’s courts. \n17. All that the phrase “by reason of the fact” requires is a “nexus” between the \nunderlying claim and the official’s corporate capacity.  Wheeler, 2018 NCBC LEXIS \n156, at *34 (quoting Homestore, 888 A.2d at 213 ).  For close calls, “the line between \nbeing sued in one’s personal capacity and one’s corporate capacity generally is drawn \nin favor of advancement . . . .”  Holley v. Nipro Diagnostics, Inc., 2014 Del. Ch. LEXIS \n268, at *26 (Del. Ch. Dec. 23, 2014).  It is enough to show that “the corporate powers \nwere used or necessary for the commission of the alleged misconduct,” Paolino v. Mace \nSec. Int’l, Inc. , 985 A.2d 392, 406 (Del. Ch. 2009), or that “the claim depends on a \nshowing that the official breached duties, quintessentially f iduciary duties, he owed \nto the corporation in that capacity,” Zaman v. Am edeo Holdings, Inc., 2008 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 60, at *55 (Del. Ch. May 23, 2008); see also  NAMS Holdings, LLC v. Reece, \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 32, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 16, 2018).   \n18. In some cases, artful pleading might obscure the  nature of the claims and \nunderlying conduct .  Not so here.   Vanguard ’s complaint is blunt:  it alleges that \nMoody “used his positions” as manager and officer to  favor his family and friends, \nsteal from the company, and hide his wrongdoing.  (Compl. ¶¶ 23, 24; see also Compl. \n¶¶ 27, 29, 37, 62.)  By doing so, it claims, Moody  breached his fiduciary duties.  (See \nCompl. ¶ 120.)  The nexus is plain as day .  See Wheeler, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 156, at \n*36–37 (concluding that “alleged conduct as President” in “breach of officer’s and \ndirector’s duties” met nexus requirement). \n19. Vanguard barely mentions its claim for breach of fiduciary duty, apparently \nrecognizing that it is a lost cause.  (See Opp’n 15, ECF No. 84.)  Advocating “a claim-\nby-claim analysis,” it argues that the other claims lack the required nexus .  (Opp’n \n13.)  It is certainly possible for some claims to meet the nexus requirement and others \nnot.  If so , the right to advancement is limited to the qualifyi ng claims.  See, e.g., \nWeaver v. ZeniMax Media, Inc., 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 10, at *11–14 (Del. Ch. Jan. 30, \n2014).   \n20. But when all the claims rest on the same factual allegations, as they do here, \nthere is no reason to treat one claim differently than any other .  Vanguard concedes \nthat its claims for conversion, constructive fraud, embezzlement, unfair or deceptive \ntrade practices, unjust enrichment, claim and delivery, and civil conspiracy depend \non the same conduct that underlies its claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  (See Opp’n \n14–18.)  The complaint makes clear that the other claims do too , (see Compl. ¶ 120), \nand that Moody “used his positions” to accomplish all of the alleged misconduct, \n(Compl. ¶¶ 23, 24).  In other words, though different legal theories may be at play, \nall sixteen claims are intertwined and involve “the charge that a senior managerial \nemployee failed to live up to his duties of loyalty and care to the” company.  Reddy v. \nElec. Data Sys. Corp., 2002 Del. Ch. LEXIS 69, at *20 (Del. Ch. June 18, 2002), aff’d, \n820 A.2d 371 (Del. 2003).   \n21. The Court therefore concludes that all  claims against Moody arise “by \nreason of the fact” that he was a manager and officer of Vanguard.  See, e.g. , Doran \nJones, Inc. v. Per Scholas, Inc. , 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67828, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. May \n2, 2017) (addressing claims together when based on “the same fact ual allegations”); \nsee also Wheeler, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 1 56, at *36 –37 (same); Zaman, 2008 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 60, at *104–05 (same).   \n22. As a result, Moody has met the requirements for advancement.  He does not \nhave to show that he also has a right to indemnification, as Vanguard contends.  (See \nOpp’n 10–13.)  A dvancement “is not dependent on the right to indemnification ”; it \nserves the distinct purpose of providing immediate, interim relief.   Homestore, 888 \nA.2d at 212; accord Wheeler, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 156, at *26.   The operating \nagreement drives home that difference by requiring an  undertaking to repay \nadvanced expenses if indemnification is later denied .  That requirement would be \nsuperfluous if advancement depended on the manager’s right to indemnification.   \n23. It is undisputed that Moody provided the required undertaking.  (See Defs.’ \nAm. Countercl. Ex. A.)  And he is a party here “by reason of the fact” of his service to \nVanguard.  He has therefore met all the requirements for advancement imposed by \nthe operating agreement. \nB. Affirmative Defenses  \n24. Next, the Court addresses whether Moody forfeited his  right to \nadvancement.  Vanguard relies on the general rule of contract law “that if either party \nto the contract commits a material breach of the contract , the other party should be \nexcused from the obligation to perform further.”  Col eman v. Shirlen, 53 N.C. App. \n573, 577–78, 281 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1981) .  According to Vanguard , Moody breached \nthe operating agreement as early as 2009, thus  excusing it from having to advance \nexpenses.  ( See Opp’n 6 –10.)  And because this is a motion for j udgment on the \npleadings, Vanguard contends, the Court must accept its allegations of Moody’s \nbreach—and, thus, its affirmative defense—as true.  (See Opp’n 6.) \n25. This is not persuasive.  Contracts vary in form and substance.  Some  \npromises may be independent of other promises in the same contract.  When they are, \nthe “[f]ailure to perform an independent promise does not excuse nonperformance on \nthe part of the other party.”  Coleman , 53 N.C. App. at  578, 281 S.E.2d at 434.  \nWhether promises are dep endent or independent turns on the language of the \ncontract, its nature, and the relationship between the parties.  See Williams v. Habul, \n219 N.C. App. 281, 294, 724 S.E.2d 104, 112–13 (2012). \n26. Take, for example, forum selection clauses.  The promise to su e in a given \nforum ordinarily does not depend upon performance of the other contract terms.  \nRather, by c hoosing a venue for resolving contract disputes, the parties imp licitly \nacknowledge that one or the other might not live up to its end of the bargain.  It would \nbe nonsensical to say that the choice of forum becomes unenforceable when a breach \noccurs.  See, e.g., Monster Daddy, LLC v. Monster Cable Prods., Inc. , 483 Fed. App’x \n831, 835 (4th Cir. 2012) (unpublished) (concluding that forum selection clause was \nindependent and would be “meaningless” if prior breach could render it \nunenforceable).  \n27. For similar reasons, Vanguard’s obligation to advance expenses to a \nmanager does not depend on faithful performance of the manager’s duties.  The very \npurpose of advancement is to allow the manager to defend against allegations of \nmisconduct, even those leveled by  Vanguard.  ( See Operating Agrmt. §  3.7(f).)  The \nobligation is mandatory (Vanguard “shall pay all expenses”) and due before a decision \non the underlying claims  (“in advance of the final disposition of such action”) .  \n(Operating Agrmt. §  3.7(b).)  To say that the right to advancement depends on an \nultimate determination of the manager’s faithful performance, as Vanguard argu es, \nwould eliminate the right altogether, upsetting the parties’ allocation of risk. \n28. In a footnote, Vanguard points to its allegation that Moody covered up his \nwrongdoing and argues that his advancement claim is therefore barred by his own  \nunclean hands .  ( See Opp’n 8 n.3.)  This argument is equally unpersuasive.  The \ndoctrine of unclean hands bar s recovery only when  the wrongful conduct relates to \nthe requested relief.  See Collins v. Davis, 68 N.C. App. 588, 592–93, 315 S.E.2d 759, \n762 (1984); Shaw v. Gee , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 109, at *17 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, \n2018).  Moody’s alleged coverup relates to Vanguard’s claims of disloyalty, not to his \nrequest for advancement.  If an official’s alleged misconduct amounted to  unclean \nhands, it  “would turn every advancement case into a trial on the merits of the \nunderlying claims,” contrary to the nature and purpose of advancement.  Reddy, 2002 \nDel. Ch. LEXIS 69, at *28–29. \n29. Vanguard may well prove that Moody  breached the operating agreement \nand his duties to the company.  For purposes of this motion, the Court assumes that \nhe did.  Taking those allegations as true, the upshot is that Moody might  not be \nentitled to indemnifica tion at the end of the case and that he might  have to repay \nexpenses advanced to him just as he said he would in the undertaking.  But it is no t \na defense to the obligation to advance expenses in the first place.   \nC. Advancement and Moody’s Counterclaims \n30. The pleadings establish Moody’s right to advancement, and Vanguard has \nnot put forward any defense germane to that issue.  The operating agreement \ntherefore requires Vanguard to advance all expenses incurred “in defending” this \naction.  (See Operating Agrmt. § 3.7(b).)  Moody argues, and Vanguard disagrees, that \nthis includes expenses incurred to litigate his counterclaims.  ( See Br. in Supp. 20 , \nECF No. 79.) \n31. Citing the same Delaware case law, b oth sides agree that “defending” can \ninclude asserting counterclaims.  Few counterclaims are truly defensive in character, \nthough.  The Delaware Supreme Court opened the door to advancement for \ncompulsory counterclaims, observing that they arise out of the same transaction as \nthe original claims, are nat urally “part of the same dispute ,” and might  “defeat, or \noffset,” the original claims.  Citadel Holding Corp. v. Roven , 603 A.2d 818, 824 (Del. \n1992).  “In other words, a counterclaim fits within the ‘in defending’ language if it \ndefends the corporate official by directly responding to and negating the affirmative \nclaim.”  Zaman , 2008 Del. Ch. LEXIS 60, at *122; see also Sun -Times Media Grp., \nInc. v. Black, 954 A.2d 380, 397 (Del. Ch. 2008). \n32. Most of Moody’s counterclaims do not directly respond to the claims asserted \nagainst him.  He alleges, for example, that Vanguard refused to pay him for accrued \nvacation days as required by his employment agreement.  (See Defs.’ Am. Countercl. \n¶¶ 140–41.)  That claim has nothing to do with the self-dealing and disloyalty alleged \nagainst Moody.  At the hearing, his counsel agreed as much.   \n33. Moody’s other counterclaims also appear to be unrelated to the original \nclaims.  He alleges that Vanguard denied his request to inspect its books, breached a \nprofit-sharing agreement, and breached implied covenants of good faith and fair \ndealing in his various employment -related agreements.  ( See Defs.’ Am. Countercl. \n¶¶ 115, 132, 147.)   These claims do not directly respond to any of the allegations \nagainst Moo dy.  And if he is successful, they would not  “operate to defeat the \naffirmative claims against” him.  Zaman, 2008 Del. Ch. LEXIS 60, at *122.   \n34. Moody makes no serious attempt to show otherwise.  Rather, he seems to \ncontend that it will be hard to disentang le expenses for any given claim because of \nthe all-encompassing, “scorched-earth litigation strategy” taken by Vanguard .  (Br. \nin Supp. 20.)  How to treat specific invoices and line entries—that is, whether they go \nto advanceable or nonadvanceable claims, or to a bit of both—is a question for another \nday.  For now, limited to the pleadings, the Could decides only whether the \ncounterclaims are advanceable.  The counterclaims based on Moody’s informational \nrights, vacation days, and profit -sharing are not adv anceable under any reasonable \ninterpretation of “defending” in section 3.7(b).   \n35. That leaves  the indemnification and advancement counterclaims, which \nneither side directly addresse s.  Officials “who successfully prosecute an \nadvancement suit are generally entitled to an appropriate award of fees for the \nexpenses incurred in litigating the suit, unless the parties have agreed otherwise.”  \nThompson v. ORIX USA Corp. , 2016 Del. Ch. LEXIS 84, at *19  (Del. Ch. June 3, \n2016); accord Nielsen v. EBTH, Inc., 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 1291, at *38 (Del. Ch. Sept. \n30, 2019).  The rationale for this rule, at least in the LLC context, is based on the \nfreedom of contract.  Members of an LLC can tailor the operating agreement as \ndesired, including by allocating the risk of a dispute about advancement to the official \nrather than the company.  When the members agree to advance expenses to the outer \nlimit, the risk goes to the company, and relief would be less than compl ete if the \nofficial had to bear the  expense of holding the company to its promise .  See, e.g. , \nTulum Mgmt. USA LLC v. Casten , 2015 Del. Ch. LEXIS 308, at * 8–9 (Del. Ch. Dec. \n23, 2015) (allowing fees for advancement when operating agreement required \nadvancement “to the fullest extent provided or permitted by” law). \n36. Vanguard’s operating agreement  does not exclude fees for pursuing \nadvancement.  It requires advancement of “all expenses” and  “[t]o the maximum \nextent permitted by law.”  (Operating Agrmt. §§ 3.7(a), (i).)  The Court is not aware \nof any law that would limit Moody’s right “to recover his legal fees incurred in seeking \nadvancement” and therefore concludes that he is entitled to do so.  Tulum Mgmt. \nUSA, 2015 Del. Ch. LEXIS 308, at *9. \nD. Procedural Matters \n37. Finally, Vanguard lodges a procedural objection.   In Wheeler, an aggrieved \ncompany official sought advancement through a motion for preliminary injunction , \nwhich the Court denied because he had not shown a threat of irreparable harm.  See \nWheeler, 2018  NCBC LEXIS 156, at *42–52.  Vanguard  contends that  Moody’s \nrequest for immediate advancement is a disguised motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  (See Opp’n 20–21.)   \n38. This misunderstands the distinction between temporary and final relief and \ndraws the wrong lessons from Wheeler.  The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to \npreserve the status quo pending  a final resolution of the merits.  See A.E.P. Indus., \nInc. v. McClure, 308 N.C. 393, 400, 302 S.E.2d 754, 759 (1983).  It is ext raordinary \nrelief, requiring litigants to take action or refrain from action, under penalty of \ncontempt, before liability is established and judgment entered.  The risk of error is \nhigher in that prejudgment posture, dealing as it does with probabilities rather than \nestablished fact.  Wheeler’s denial of temporary, prejudgment relief faithfully applied \nthese settled principles. \n39. By contrast, entry of judgment on the pleadings is a final decision on  the \nmerits.  Its  purpose is to allow early and efficient resolution of disputes when \ndiscovery would be of no use.   Most cases turn on contested facts and are not suited \nto early relief.  But there is no reason to delay judgment when, giving every advantage \nto the nonmoving party, the pleadings establish all the pertinent facts and leave room \nfor only one outcome.  Wheeler does not address, much less caution against, summary \nadjudication of advancement claims, which the Court has shown a willingness to do \nwhen applying the law of other States.  See Islet Scis., Inc. v. Brighthaven Ventures, \nLLC, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 3, at *16 –22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 12, 2017) (applying \nNevada law and granting Rule 12(c) motion in advancement dispute).   \n40. Vanguard correctly observes that the pleadings do not establish the amount \nof its obligation.  But all that is at issue at this moment is whether Vanguard has an \nobligation to advance expenses.  It does, for all the reasons discussed above.  The onus \nis now on the parties and their counsel to confer in good faith about the expenses that \nMoody has incurred.  If they cannot agree, the Court will have to decide those disputes \nwith a more complete record.  The potential for future disputes, though, is no reason \nto postpone a decision on the merits. \n41. Indeed, Vanguard’s position, if accepted, would make North Carolina an \noutlier.  Courts around the country routinely decide a dvancement disputes in \nsummary fashion.  This is because “[a]dvancement cases are particularly appropriate \nfor resolution on a paper record . . . .”  DeLucca v. KKAT Mgmt., LLC , 2006 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 19, at *20 (Del. Ch. Jan. 23, 2006).  With rare exception, the right to \nadvancement depends only on the pleadings that allege misconduct by the official and \nthe contract that defines the right.  Delay would serve no useful end but would \nthreaten to “render the right meaningless .”  United States v. Stein, 452 F. Supp. 2d \n230, 272 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).  In Delaware and elsewhere, courts apply ordinary rules of \ncivil procedure —most commonly summary judgment but also judgment on the \npleadings—to expedite decisions when appropriate.  See, e.g., Mitchell Co. v. Campus, \n2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16694, at *2 (S.D. Ala. Mar. 3, 2009) (summary judgment); \nMorgan v. Grace, 2003 Del. Ch. LEXIS 113, at *3– 4 (Del. Ch. Oct. 29, 2003) (same); \nsee also Freeman Family LLC v. Park Ave. Landing LLC , 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 149, \nat *2 –3 (Del. Ch. Apr. 30, 2019) (judgment on the pleadings) .  The Court sees no \nreason to take a novel and different approach here. \n42. Although advancement has been the subject of few North Carolina cases, \nthis will not be the last.  To ensure that an advancement dispute receives a full, fair, \nand expeditious hearing, litigants should bring it to the Court’s attention in their case \nmanagement report and at the case management conference.   That would allow the \nCourt to create a case management schedule that accounts for early motions practice \nwhile giving each side an opportunity to address, among other things, the need for \nlimited discovery and other matters that might cause delay. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n \n43. For all these reasons, the Court GRANTS in part  Moody’s motion for \njudgment on the pleadings.  Moody is entitled to advancement for all claims asserted \nagainst him and for his own counterclaims for advancement and indemnification.  He \nis not entitled to advancement for his other counterclaims. \n44. No later than August 25, 2020, counsel shall meet and confer  in good faith \nto determine the amount of advanceable expenses incurred by Moody to date and to \nestablish a procedure for ongoing advancement.  If disputes arise, Moody may file a \nmotion for payment of advanceable expenses  with appropriate supporting materials \non or before September 8, 2020, and Vanguard may file objections within fourteen \ndays of any motion.  These briefs shall be limited to 2,500 words. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 4th day of August, 2020.   \n/s/ Adam M. Conrad  \nAdam M.
