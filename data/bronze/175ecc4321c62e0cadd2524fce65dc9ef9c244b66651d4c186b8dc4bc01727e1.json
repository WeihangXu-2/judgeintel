The Motions have been fully briefed and argued, and are ripe for \ndetermination. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n6. Beginning in the 1980s, Campbell operated a propane gas and fuel oil business \nin eastern North Carolina. The propane business was a tank installation and gas delivery \nbusiness that delivered propane via truck to Campbell's residential and commercial propane \ncustomers from more than ten facilities in the area.  \n7. AmeriGas is a national propane company that serves residential, commercial, \nagricultural, and industrial customers througho ut the United States. To grow its business, \nAmeriGas occasionally acquires propane oper ations from regional and local propane \ncompanies. \n8. On October 2, 2007, Campbell and AmeriGas 1 executed an Agreement for \nPurchase and Sale of Assets (\"APA\").2  The APA was entered into between various Campbell \nOil companies (\"Sellers\"), AmeriGas, and indi vidual Campbell family members and family \ntrusts (\"Owners). 3  In the APA, Campbell agreed to sell its entire propane operations, \nincluding its customers, the propane storage tanks located on the customers' property, \ninterests in real property, tank leases, go odwill, and trade names, including \"Campbell \n                                                 \n1 The purchaser under the APA was Titan Propane, LLC (\"Titan\"). Titan is a predecessor to AmeriGas, \nas is Heritage Propane, LLC. As used in this opin ion, \"AmeriGas\" will refer to AmeriGas, Titan, and \nHeritage Propane. \n2 The specific provisions of the APA at issue in this case are set out below, in the Court's discussion of \nthe Motions. \n3 For purposes of this Opinion and Order, Plaintiffs, including Sellers and Owners, will be collectively \nreferred to as \"Campbell.\" \nPropane.\"4 Campbell sold AmeriGas its offices and operations in in Elizabethtown, Clinton, \nSupply, Whiteville, Nashville, Macclesfield, Burgaw, Lumberton, and Youngsville, North \nCarolina.  In exchange for Campbell's propane business, AmeriGas agreed to pay a cash sum \nat closing, minus a specific holdback amount intended to cover future claims that might arise \nunder the APA.\n5 \n9. The APA also addressed three terms that are at issue in this case: (a) the sale \nof certain of Campbell's propane accounts rece ivable to AmeriGas; (b) representations and \nwarranties regarding the condition and regula tory compliance of customer propane tanks \nCampbell sold to AmeriGas; and (c) a non-comp etition agreement that prohibited Campbell \nfrom engaging in the propane and other competitive businesses within 100 miles of any plant \nfacility sold by Campbell to AmeriGas.6 \nAccounts Receivable \n10. As part of the purchase, AmeriGas acquired Campbell's propane accounts \nreceivable (\"AR\") that were outstanding for ninety days or less at the time of closing (\"Current \nAR\").7 Campbell retained the accounts receivable that were outstanding for more than ninety \ndays at the time of closing (\"Old AR\"), but provided AmeriGas the right, for a period of twelve \nmonths, to collect Old AR for Campbell.  AmeriGas was to remit any Old AR that it collected, \nless a five percent collection fee, to Campbell on a monthly basis 8 Under this arrangement, \nAmeriGas was obligated to use its \"best efforts\" to collect this AR.9 \n11. Campbell provided AmeriGas with a ccess to its electronically stored AR \nrecords for the purpose of extracting account balances for commercial customers.  AmeriGas \n                                                 \n4 Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 3, § 1. Hereinafter, citations to the APA will be simply to \"APA.\"  \n5 APA § 4. \n6 Id. § 8.5(a)(1). \n7 Id. § 3.1. \n8 Id. § 3.2. \n9 Id.  \nwas to load the AR data into AmeriGas' own account-management system. 10 AmeriGas, \nhowever, failed to load at least some of the extracted information into the AmeriGas system.11 \nShortly after closing, a dispute arose regardin g the proper collection of AR. For example, \nsome of Campbell's customers erroneously pa id Campbell for Current AR that should have \nbeen paid to AmeriGas. Other customers misd irected payments to AmeriGas for fuel-oil \npurchased from Campbell, and which was not part of the sale of Campbell's propane business. \nThe parties engaged in significant discussions in as effort to resolve these issues. AmeriGas \nrequested, and Campbell twice provided in  April 2008 and May 2009, the list of the \ncommercial customer accounts that were purchased by AmeriGas with the balances owed by \neach customer.\n12 These lists clearly showed that, as of the date of closing, CM Lindsay & Sons \n(\"CM Lindsay\") and Antioch Baptist Medical Center (\"Antioch Baptist\"), the two AR accounts \nat issue in this litigation, owed a total of $111,107.83 in Current AR.\n13 Campbell also \nrepeatedly communicated with AmeriGas empl oyees to review the commercial accounts.  \nAfter Campbell refused to bear further burden for researching all commercial accounts and \nreporting the results to AmeriGas, 14 it appears that the parties' general practice was for \nAmeriGas to request information from Campbe ll regarding specific customer accounts, and \nthat information would then be provided and those accounts settled.15 \n12. On May 18, 2009, AmeriGas asked Campbell for account histories for the \ncommercial accounts in the Lumb erton, North Carolina district. 16 CM Lindsay and Antioch \nBaptist were accounts in the Lumberton distri ct.  In response, Campbell forwarded account \n                                                 \n10 See Hughes Dep. 11, 25-30. \n11 Hatley Dep. 54-55. \n12 Dep. Exs. 68, 73. \n13 Id. \n14 See Dep.

Ex. 52. \nhistories reflecting Current AR for Lumb erton commercial accounts AmeriGas had \npurchased, but did not include information on the CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist \naccounts.\n17 CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist had paid the Current AR to Campbell in the \namount of $111,107.83, but Campbell did not notify AmeriGas about the payments. 18  Tracy \nHardin, Campbell's Operations Manager, testifie d that in response to the May 18 request, \nCampbell only provided the account information for specific Lumberton district accounts for \nwhich AmeriGas had requested information prior to May 18, 2009. 19  It is undisputed that \nAmeriGas had never previously asked for spec ific information regarding CM Lindsay and \nAntioch Baptist.20 The record evidence also shows that AmeriGas never contacted either CM \nLindsay or Antioch Baptist to inquire about th e status of those accounts prior to November \n2009.21 \n13. In the fall of 2009, the parties negotiated a resolution of the outstanding AR \ndisputes between them. On October 22, 2009, AmeriGas sent a letter to Campbell requesting \nthat Campbell pay AmeriGas the sum of $156,286.46, upon the receipt of which AmeriGas \nwould \"acknowledge[ ] no further claims agai nst [Campbell] regarding Accounts Receivable \nissues.\"\n22 By letter dated October 28, 2009, Campbell accepted the offer, tendering a check in \nthat amount \"to fully settle the Accounts Receiv able issue\" (the two letters collectively are \nhereinafter referred to as the \"AR Agreement\"). 23  AmeriGas accepted and subsequently \nnegotiated the check. \n                                                 \n17 Dep. Ex. 53. \n18 See Dep. Ex. 53; see also Campbell's 2d Supp. Resps. To 3d Interrogs. At 2, Nos. 21 & 22 (Ex. F).  \n19 Hardin Dep. 142-43. \n20 Hardin Dep. 143-44. \n21 Hatley Dep. 97. \n22 Compl. Ex. A. \n23 Id. Ex. B. \n14. After entering into the AR Agreement, AmeriGas learned that Campbell had \ncollected the Current AR on the CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist accounts. 24 On August 3, \n2010, AmeriGas notified Campbell that it intend ed to \"enforce [its] right of setoff'\" and \nwithhold $111,107.83 from future payments owed to Campbell under the parties' non-\ncompetition agreement (\"August 3, 2010 Letter\"). 25 AmeriGas subsequently withheld this \nsum from the 2010 and 2011 payments it made to Campbell. \n15. Campbell contends that AmeriGas was not entitled to withhold from the \npayments because the APA only granted AmeriGas the right to collect Current AR from \ncustomers, and not directly from Campbell by way of withholding, and because the APA did \nnot impose a duty to disclose to AmeriGas the Current AR payments Campbell had received \nfrom CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist. 26 Campbell also argues that AmeriGas released any \nclaim to outstanding accounts receivable in the AR Agreement.27 \nCustomer Storage Tanks \n16. Among the assets Campbell sold to Amer iGas were customer propane storage \ntanks owned by Campbell but locate d on the customers' property. 28  After the closing of the \nsale, AmeriGas discovered that in May 2007 the North Carolina Department of Agriculture \nhad issued notices to Campbell that eight of its customer tanks were not installed in full \ncompliance with state regulations.29 The notices were sent to the local office of Campbell Oil \nfor the district in which the violations were discovered, and came to the attention of a district \nlevel manager.30 It is undisputed, however, that none of the Owners had actual knowledge of \n                                                 \n24 Julian Dep. 152-53. \n25 Compl.

J. p. 28. \neither the reports or the existence of non-compliant tanks. 31 The notices of violations were \nnot disclosed to AmeriGas prior to the closing of the sale. 32 After learning about the notices, \nAmeriGas conducted further investigation and discovered that 319 cu stomer storage tanks \nwere not compliant with regulations and needed to be remediated.33 \n17. In the August 3, 2010 Letter, AmeriGas notified Campbell that the failure to \ndisclose the non-compliant customer tank s breached Campbell's representations and \nwarranties in section 7.5 of the APA.  AmeriGas asserted that it was entitled \"to full \nindemnification under the\" APA.\n34 In the same letter, AmeriGas informed Campbell that it \nhad received a bid to perform the remediation work for $353,000.00.35 AmeriGas stated that \nit would exercise its right to setoff and with hold the costs for the tank remediation from \nfuture payments owed to Campbell under the parties' non-competition agreement. \n18. Campbell does not dispute that there we re tanks that were not in compliance \nwith State regulations.  Instead, Campbell contends that the sale of the non-compliant tanks \ndid not violate the representations in section 7.5 of the APA because that section applies only \nto the real property Campbell sold to Am eriGas.  Campbell argues that the only \nrepresentations or warranties regarding the customer tanks in the APA were in section 7.3, \nand that section 7.3 only warranted that the Owners had no actual knowledge of non-\ncompliant tanks.\n 36  It is undisputed that the Owners had no actual knowledge of the tank \ncompliance issue. \nNon-Competition Agreement \n                                                 \n31 Campbell Dep. pp. 46-47. \n32 Dep.

Summ. J. 12-16. \n19. The APA also contained a \"Covenant No t to Compete\" that barred Campbell, \nand the individual owners of Campbell, for a period of ten years from the closing of the sale \nfrom \"engag[ing] in the business of propane or  propane-related products, natural gas, or \nelectric distribution within a 100 mile radius of any of the Plant Facilities\" (\"Restricted Area\") \nsold by Campbell to AmeriGas.\n37 The non-competition agreement contained a severability \nprovision that permitted amendment of its restrictions as follows: \nIf the terms of this Section 8.5 are held by any court or agency to be \nunenforceable because of the period of time in which those terms remain in \neffect, the breadth of the activities restricted, or the breadth of the geographical \narea of the limitations, then, nevertheless, this section shall be deemed to have \nbeen amended to limit that time period, those activities, or that area to the \nlongest time period, the broadest activi ties and the largest geographical area \n(not to exceed those set forth in this section) as will be enforceable.\n38 \n \n20. AmeriGas agreed to pay $2,000,000.00 above the amount paid for the purchase \nof Campbell's assets as consideration for the no n-competition agreement, to be made in five \nequal, annual payments of $400,000.00. 39  The non-competition agreement gave AmeriGas \nthe right offset against the annual payments for \"any claim or breach arising under [the \nAPA], including any Damages as defined in Se ction 10.1\" regardless of whom the claim or \nbreach is against.\n40 \n21. AmeriGas made the five annual payments but withheld from the 2010 and \n2011 payments a total of $388,065.83 as offsets for the CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist ARs \nand for the net cost of reme diating the customer tanks. 41 AmeriGas made the last of the \npayments in October 2012. \n                                                 \n37 APA § 8.5(a). \n38 Id. § 8.5(e). \n39 Defendant notes that, in total, the purchase of Campbell's propane business was a \"$23 million \nacquisition.\" Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. p. 1.  \n40 Id. § 8.5(f). \n41 AmeriGas apparently paid Campbell $1,611,934.17 of the $2,000,000. \n22. In 2013, Campbell purchased the operations of Brooks Oil Company (\"Brooks\") \nin Whiteville, North Carolina and Parnell O il Company (\"Parnell\") in Parkton, North \nCarolina. On August 20, 2013, Campbell set up Fi ve Star Propane, LLC (\"Five Star\").  Five \nStar then acquired Brooks on August 30, 2013, and Parnell on October 31, 2013.  Five Star \ncurrently distributes propane out of offices in Whiteville and Parkton. Five Star's Whiteville \nlocation is approximately one mile from one of the facilities Campbell sold to AmeriGas.42  \n23. Campbell, apparently conceding that  operating Brooks' propane business \nwould violate the terms of the non-competition agreement, argues that the non-compete is \nunenforceable and seeks a declaratory judgment to that effect. AmeriGas, however, contends \nthat the non-compete is enforceable under North Carolina law and that the Brooks purchase \nwas in violation of that provision. Alternat ively, if the non-compete is found to be \nunenforceable, AmeriGas seeks an order requiri ng Campbell to return payments made as \nconsideration for the non-compete under an unjust enrichment theory. \nDISCUSSION \n24. Campbell moves, pursuant to Rule 56(a), for summary judgment in its favor on \nall of its claims against AmeriGas and, pursuant to Rule 56(b), for summary judgment in \ntheir favor on AmeriGas' counterclaims. Pu rsuant to Rule 56(b), AmeriGas moves for \nsummary judgment in its favor on Campbell's claims. \n25.  \"Summary judgment is appropriate 'if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there \nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter of law.'\" \nVariety Wholesalers, Inc. v. Salem Logistics Traffic Servs., LLC , 365 N.C. \n520, 523 (2012) (quoting Rule 56(c)). An issue is \"material\" if its \"resolution . . . is so essential \n                                                 \n42 Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. pp. 4-5. \nthat the party against whom it is resolved may not prevail.\" McNair v. Boyette, 282 N.C. 230, \n235 (1972) (quotations omitted). The moving party  bears \"the burden of clearly establishing \nlack of a triable issue\" to the trial court. N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sadler, 365 N.C. \n178, 182 (2011) (quoting N.C. Nat'l Bank v. Gillespie, 291 N.C. 303, 310 (1976)). The moving \nparty may meet this burden by \"proving an e ssential element of the opposing party's claim \ndoes not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or  would be barred by an affirmative defense.\"  \nVariety Wholesalers, Inc., 365 N.C. at 523 (quoting Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83 (2000)). \n26. The Court will first address claims related to the AR issue, followed by the \ntank remediation claims, and, finally, the parties' claims concerning the validity of the non-\ncompete contained in the APA. \nAccounts Receivable Claims \n27. In its First and Second Claims for Relie f, Campbell contends that AmeriGas \nwrongfully withheld $111,107.83 in payments for the CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist ARs \nin violation of the APA and the AR Agreement. The parties have cross-moved for summary \njudgment on these claims. \n28. As an initial matter, the parties disagree as to which party bears the burden \nof proof on the propriety of withholding payments based on the accounts receivable issue. \nCampbell contends that AmeriGas has the burden of proving that Campbell breached the \nAPA entitling AmeriGas to the offset becaus e section 8.5(f) of the APA is a \"condition \nsubsequent.\" AmeriGas argues that section 8.5(f) does not create a condition subsequent, \nbut rather is an affirmative covenant giving Am eriGas the right to offset the payments.  \nAccordingly, it is Campbell's burden to prove that AmeriGas' breached the APA by \nwithholding the payments. \n29. As our court of appeals has noted, \"a condition subsequent is any event the \nexistence of which, by agreement of the parties, operates to discharge a duty of performance \nthat has arisen.\" Henderson & Corbin, Inc. v. West Carteret Water Corp ., 107 N.C. App. \n740, 743-44 (1992) (internal citations omitted); 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 464 (2014) (\"A \ncondition subsequent to an enforceable contract is a term of the contract, within the intent \nof the parties, that the happening or nonoccurrence of an event after the contract becomes \nbinding upon the parties . . . causes the contract to terminate without further duties and \nobligations on any party.\"). The significance of a contractual provision being a condition \nsubsequent is that the burden of proving the occurrence of the condition rests on the party \nasserting the condition. \nSee Yale v. Nat'l Indem. Co., 664 F.2d 406, 410 (4th Cir. 1981).  \n30. The Court is not persuaded that section 8.5(f), which provides that AmeriGas \n\"shall be entitled  to offset any claim or breach arising under [the APA],\" 43 creates a \ncondition subsequent. Rather, by its plai n terms section 8.5(f) grants AmeriGas the \nunilateral right to offset against its payments for any claim against, or breach by, AmeriGas \nunder the APA. It does not require AmeriGas  to prove such claim or breach before \nexercising its right.  The language also does not expressly or impliedly state that a breach \nor claim against Campbell discharges a duty of  performance by AmeriGas or terminates \nthe parties' mutual obligations under the APA.  Henderson & Corbin, Inc. , 107 N.C. App. \nat 743-44; 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 464. To re quire AmeriGas to take steps to initiate \nlitigation and prove a claim or breach by Camp bell before being entitled to offset would \nrender section 8.5(f) meaningless. Rather, that section gives AmeriGas the unilateral right \nto deduct the amount of such claims from the payments it is obligated to make, the exercise \nof which Campbell can challenge, as it has done in this lawsuit.  \n31. Additionally, even if the language were ambiguous, the Court would feel \nconstrained to interpret section 8.5(f) as an affirmative covenant granting AmeriGas a right \n                                                 \n43 APA § 8.5(f). \nunder the APA, and not a condition subsequent. 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 464 (\"Where \nthe language used is ambiguous and may import either a condition subsequent or a \ncovenant, it will be construed to be the latter in preference of the former.\").  Ultimately, the \nCourt concludes that section 8.5(f) does not create a condition subsequent, but instead is a \ncovenant that provides AmeriGas with the affi rmative right to offset any claim or breach \nunder the APA.  \n32. Campbell argues that AmeriGas wrongfully withheld from its payments under \nthe non-competition agreement for the amount s of Current AR retained by Campbell for \nthe CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist accounts. Campbell's position is that it was under no \nobligation to provide to AmeriGas the misdirected payments it collected from CM Lindsay \nand Antioch Baptist because the APA conveyed  to AmeriGas only the \"right to collect\" \nCurrent AR from its customer and did not impose an obligation on Campbell to remit \nmisdirected payments to AmeriGas. \n33. While the APA does not expressly provide that Current AR collected by \nCampbell must be remitted to AmeriGas, North Carolina courts have recognized that the \nterms of a contract are not limited to the express terms agreed upon by the parties. Instead, \n\"[t]here is implied in every contract a covenant by each party not to do anything which will \ndeprive the other parties thereto of the benefits of the contract.\" \nBicycle Transit Auth. v. \nBell, 314 N.C. 219, 228 (1985) (internal citations omitted). Moreover, \"[i]t is a basic principle \nof contract law that a party who enters into an enforceable contract is  required to act in \ngood faith and to make reasonable efforts to perform his obligations under the agreement.\" \nWeyerhaeuser Co. v. Godwin Bldg. Supply Co., 40 N.C. App. 743, 746 (1979).  \n34. AmeriGas argues that Campbell's collection and retention of the CM Lindsay \nand Antioch Baptist payments deprives AmeriGas of one of the benefits of the APA, and \ntherefore breaches Campbell's obligations under  that agreement. The Court agrees. First \nand foremost, the APA does not state that Campbell is selling AmeriGas only the \"right to \ncollect\" Current AR.  Rather, the APA states t hat AmeriGas in purchasing \"all of Sellers' \npropane only accounts receivable that are outs tanding for ninety (90) days or less\" and \ndefines such accounts as the \"Purchased Accounts Receivable.\" 44  Section 3.1 does not \ncontain any reference to AmeriGas merely having a right to collect or attempt to collect the \nCurrent AR.  The only use of the term \"right to collect\" is contained in Section 3.2 of the \nAPA regarding AmeriGas' right to collect Old AR and to keep a 5% collection fee if it \ncollected any Old AR.  Campbell's continued collection and retention of Current AR is \ninconsistent with the sale of the Current AR to AmeriGas. \n35. Campbell argues that a conclusion that the APA required it to cease collecting \nCurrent AR and to provide to AmeriGas misdirected payments for Current AR imposes new \nobligations on Campbell that are not explicitly contained in the APA.45 To the contrary, the \nobligation to cease collection of Current AR t hat it sold to AmeriGas and account for any \nmisdirected payments simply constituted the reasonable, good faith efforts necessary to \nperform its obligation under the APA. See Weyerhaeuser Co., 40 N.C. App. at 746.  \n36. Our court of appeals has found that sim ilar conduct not only was a breach of \nthe agreement between the parties, but also the tort of conversion. In Lake Mary, L.P. v. \nJohnston, the defendant, Hugh Johnston, sold a shopping center to the plaintiff and, as \npart of the sale, specifically sold his \"right, title and interest in and to all leases . . . affecting \nthe [p]roperty,\" which, noted the court, \"wou ld necessarily include the right to all tenant \nrent checks received after the closing date.\" 145 N.C. App 525, 532 (2001). Notwithstanding \nthis transfer, Johnston continued to collect and deposit rent checks from his former tenants \nafter he sold the shopping center. As here, it was the continued collection of rents by \n                                                 \n44 APA § 3.1. \n45 See Pls.' Br. Opp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. p. 9. \nJohnston after he transferred his right to collect those rents that the court found wrongful. \nSee id.46  \n37. For the reasons discussed above, the Co urt concludes that the collection and \nretention of Current AR, specifically the CM Lindsey and Antioch Baptist Accounts, \nconstitutes a \"claim or breach arising under\" the APA upon which AmeriGas was entitled \nto offset the amounts of payments received on those accounts under section 8.5(f). This \nconclusion, however, does not end the Court's inquiry. Instead, even if the collection and \nretention of the CM Lindsey and Antioch Bapt ist accounts constitutes a claim or breach \nunder the APA, Campbell contends that Amer iGas released any such claim in the AR \nAgreement. \n38. \"A release is a private agreement amongst parties which gives up or abandons \na claim or right to the person against whom th e claim exists or the right is to be enforced \nor exercised.\" \nFin. Servs. of Raleigh, Inc. v. Barefoot, 163 N.C. App. 387, 392 (2004) (internal \ncitations omitted). Such an agreement \"operates as a merger of, and bars all right to recover \non, the claim or right of action\" covered by the release. Id. (citing Jenkins v. Fields , 240 \nN.C. 776, 778 (1954). The scope of a release generally covers  \nthe matters expressed therein which are already in existence at the time of the \ngiving of the release. Accordingly, demands originating at the time a release is \ngiven or subsequently, and demands subs equently maturing or accruing, are \nnot as a rule discharged by the release unless expressly embraced therein or \nfalling within the fair import of the terms employed.  \n \n                                                 \n46 The court in Johnston did note, in determining that directed verdict against Johnston on the \nplaintiff's conversion claim was proper, that \"[t]he  evidence . . . shows that Hugh Johnston had an \nobligation to forward these checks to Lake Mary.\" Johnston, 145 N.C. App. at 532. The origin of such \nan obligation, whether contractual or otherwise,  is unclear. However, as discussed above, the \ncontractual promise that Campbell would transfer the Current AR would necessarily impose an \nobligation on Campbell's part to cease collecting that  AR as part of a reasonable effort necessary to \nperform its obligation to transfer Current AR to AmeriGas. See Weyerhaeuser Co. , 40 N.C. App. at \n746. \nId. at 394 (citing Travis v. Know Creek, Inc., 321 N.C. 279, 282 (1987). As noted in Barefoot, \nhowever, North Carolina courts have \"long recognized that parties may release existing but \nunknown claims.\" 163 N.C. App. at 394-95. \n39. On October 22, 2009, AmeriGas wrote to Campbell offering that, \"[u]pon \nreceipt of the agreed amount of $156,286.46, Titan Propane LLC acknowledges no further \nclaims against Campbell Oil & Gas Company regarding Accounts Receivable.\"47 By return \nletter dated October 28, 2009, Campbell enclosed a check in the same amount \"to fully settle \nthe Accounts Receivable issue that we ha ve been working on since Titan/Heritage \npurchased our propane business in October 2007.\" 48 Campbell further noted that they \nwould not provide any more details relating  to the accounts receivable and that, by \naccepting the check, AmeriGas was agreeing and understanding that fact. 49 AmeriGas \nsubsequently negotiated the check.50 The Court concludes that the offer and acceptance of \nthese terms, along with the consideration prov ided by both parties, created a binding and \nenforceable release. \n40. AmeriGas contends that the CM Lindsa y and Antioch Baptist accounts were \nnot part of the release in the AR Agreement because Campbell did not disclose the fact that \nit had received the payment of those accounts. 51 It is undisputed, however, that Campbell \nprovided to AmeriGas information regarding the Current AR it was purchasing at or \naround the time of the closing of the asset sale, and provided additional information \n                                                 \n47 Compl., Ex. A. \n48 Compl., Ex. B. \n49 Id.  \n50 Ans. ¶ 41 (admitting that the check for $156,286.46 was negotiated). \n51 See Def.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 12. As a final note, while AmeriGas has relied on theories of \nfraud and conversion to show that it had a valid claim under the APA such that withholding was \nproper, AmeriGas has not argued that the AR Agreement was fraudulently induced or is otherwise \ninvalid. AmeriGas' sole argument against the releas e appears, as noted above, to be that the CM \nLindsay and Antioch Baptist accounts were not part of the settlement reflected in the AR Agreement. \nregarding those accounts for two years following the sale.  It is undisputed that CM Lindsay \nand Antioch Baptist were identified to Amer iGas as Current AR accounts that it was \npurchasing, and that the balance owed on thos e accounts was provided to AmeriGas on at \nleast two occasions.52  AmeriGas made no efforts to collect those accounts.  \n41. Even if AmeriGas did not know that CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist had paid \nthe Current AR to Campbell and this constitute d an \"unknown\" claim, by agreeing that it \nhad \"no further claims\" and \"fully settle[d]\" the AR issues, AmeriGas released both its \nknown and unknown claims in the AR Agreement. Merrimon v. Postal Telegraph-Cable \nCo., 207 N.C. 101, 105-06 (1934) (recognizing that \"[t]he language in a release may be broad \nenough to cover all demands and rights to demand or possible causes of action . . . whether \nor not the various demands or claims have been  discussed or mentioned, and whether or \nnot the possible claims are all known\"). Accord Talton v. Mac Tools, Inc., 118 N.C. App. 87, \n90-91 (1995) (\"Since this language was broad enough to cover all possible causes of action, \nwhether or not the possible claims are all know n, plaintiffs cannot rely on their ignorance \nof facts giving rise to a claim for fraud as a basis for avoiding the release.\"). The Court also \nconcludes that plain and broad language used  by the parties, and the background facts \nsurrounding the information provided to AmeriGas about the Current AR, establishes that \nthe release covered any existing claims related to the accounts receivable issue between the \nparties including the CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist accounts.   \n42. To summarize, although Campbell's failure to forward the payments for \nCurrent AR made by CM Lindsay and Antioch Baptist created a claim pursuant to section \n8.5(f) of the APA, AmeriGas released the cl aim by entering into the AR Agreement.  \nAccordingly, AmeriGas breached the APA when it withheld $111,107.83 from the 2010 and \n                                                 \n52 Dep. Ex. 68, 73. \n2011 payments to Campbell. Therefore, for th e reasons stated above, the Court concludes \nthat with regard to Plaintiffs' First and Second Claims Relief for breach of contract,53 to the \nextent that those claims are premised on AmeriGas' withholding of $111,107.83, Campbell's \nmotion for summary judgment should be GR ANTED, and AmeriGas' motion for summary \njudgment should be DENIED. \nTank Remediation \n43. In its First Claim, Campbell also contends that AmeriGas breached the APA \nby withholding the cost of the tank remediat ion work. AmeriGas did so pursuant to section \n8.5(f) of the APA, alleging that Campbell breach ed the representations in sections 7.3, 7.4, \nand 7.5. Campbell contends that it did no t breach any representations and warranties \nregarding the customer storage tanks and, even if it had, AmeriGas was not entitled to offset \nthe first $250,000.00 of the cost because the deductible provision in section 10.1 of the APA.  \n44. In support of its position Campbell makes two arguments. First, it contends \nthat AmeriGas has not introduced any evidence  that the 319 non-compliant customer tanks \nwere actually owned by Campbell and part of th e assets sold to AmeriGas, as opposed to \nbeing customer-owned tanks that were not pa rt of the sale of assets. Second, Campbell \ncontends that section 7.3 of the APA is the exclusive provision that  warrants that storage \ntanks were in compliance, and that section only represents that the Owners did not have \n                                                 \n53 As to Claim Two, the Court concludes that this claim is not barred by the statute of limitations. \nWhile AmeriGas contends that its letter of August 3, 2010, denies the existence of the AR Agreement \nand thus triggers the statute of limitations, see Henlajon, Inc. v. Branch Highways, Inc., 149 N.C. App. \n329, 335 (2002), the Court disagrees. Instead, that  document simply threatens a breach of the AR \nAgreement and does not, as AmeriGas suggests, contai n the sort of express denial of the existence of \nan agreement as in Henlajon, Inc. See Dep. Ex. 6 (August 3, 2010 letter). Accordingly, the Court \nconcludes that the statute of limitations was triggered on the date of the breach of the AR Agreement, \nin October 2010. See Abram v. Charter Med. Corp., 100 N.C. App. 718, 720 (1990) (noting that \"with \na breach of contract action, the claim accrues upon breach\"). Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on August \n6, 2013, within the statute of limitations. \nactual knowledge of non-compliant tanks. Sinc e it is undisputed that the Owners did not \nhave actual knowledge, there can be no violation of section 7.3. \n45. In support of its motion for summary judgment, AmeriGas argues that tank \ncompliance is governed not only by section 7.3, but also by sections 7.4 and 7.5 of the APA.  \nSince sections 7.4 and 7.5 are specifically ex cluded from the deductible in section 10.1, \nAmeriGas was entitled to offset the entire cost of remediation. AmeriGas also contends that \neven if only section 7.3 applies, they still were  entitled to withhold the cost of remediation \nbecause (a) by its plain language, the deductible in section 10.1, discussed below, applies only \nto Sellers, and not to Owners, and (b) Campbell had knowledge that there were non-compliant \ntanks. \n46. As an initial matter, the Court is not persuaded by Campbell's position that \nAmeriGas failed to prove that the storage tanks were part of the assets actually sold by \nCampbell. In the Complaint, Campbell specifically alleged that the \"tanks were the property \nof Campbell\" and were \"[a]mong the propane gas assets Campbell sold to AmeriGas.\" 54  \nCampbell is bound by this allegation. Woods v. Smith, 297 N.C. 363, 368 (1979) (\"A party is \nbound by his pleadings and, unless withdr awn, amended, or, otherwise altered, \nthe allegations contained in all pleadings ordinarily are conclusive as against the pleader.\").  \nAccordingly, the Court now turns to the disa greement between the parties regarding which \nprovisions of the APA govern the tank remedi ation issue and, then, to the applicability of \nsection 10.1. \n47. As noted above, the parties disagree as to which APA provisions govern the \ntank compliance dispute at issue here. Campbe ll contends only section 7.3 governs tank \ncompliance, while AmeriGas argues that sections 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 can all be read to address \n                                                 \n54 Compl. ¶ 48. \nthe specific compliance concerns with the tank s at issue. The Court will address all three \nprovisions. \n48. First, in section 7.4 of the APA Campbell represented and warranted that \n\"[t]here is no suit, action, arbitration, or le gal, administrative, or other proceeding, or \ngovernmental investigation pending\" affecting  the Operations except for those expressly \ndisclosed, and that \"[n]o Seller has received any  notice that it is under investigation with \nrespect to any alleged violation of any provision of federal, state, local law or administrative \nregulations with respect to the Operations.\"  AmeriGas argues that Campbell's failure to \ndisclose the May 2007 notices regarding the non- compliant storage tanks was a violation of \nsection 7.4.  There is no record evidence, howe ver, that at the time of the closing Campbell \nwas under any ongoing investigation related to the tank compliance issue, or that the tank \ncompliance issue had resulted in other then-pending legal or administrative issue. Instead, \nthe notices simply note the existence of a violation and instruct Campbell to repair the \nproblem before the inspector's next visit.55 No additional action on the part of the Department \nof Agriculture is taken or even threatened . The Court concludes that the State notices \nregarding the non-compliant tanks do not cons titute a \"legal, administrative, or other \nproceeding, or governmental investigation\" with in the meaning of section 7.4.  Accordingly, \nthe failure to disclose the notices was not a violation of section 7.4 that would entitle \nAmeriGas to an offset. \n49. Section 7.5 is titled \"No Violation of Governmental Regulations.\"  In section \n7.5, Campbell states in pertinent part that \"[t]he Operations and the Property have not been, \nand were not prior to the day of the Closing,  conducted in any material violation of any \nstatute, law, ordinance, or regulation of any governmental entity.\" The remainder of section \n                                                 \n55 See id.  \n7.5 contains additional representations regard ing real property transferred from Campbell \nto AmeriGas, including representations about zoning, environmental, and other compliance. \n50. The parties strongly dispute the applicability of section 7.5 to the storage tank \ncompliance dispute. AmeriGas contends that the first sentence of section 7.5 broadly \nencompasses all property conveyed by Campbell,56 and is not limited to real property assets. \nCampbell contends that the first sentence of se ction 7.5 must be read in context with the \nremainder of the section which focuses primar ily, if not exclusively, on the regulatory \ncompliance of real property. Campbell argues t hat section 7.5 is limited to real property \ncompliance issues and would not govern the tank compliance dispute.  \n51. Campbell's reading, however, is incons istent with the plain language of the \nfirst sentence of section 7.5.  Lynn v. Lynn , 202 N.C. App. 423, 431 (2010) (\"When the \nlanguage of the contract is clear and unambiguous, construction of the agreement is a matter \nof law for the court . . . and the court cannot look beyond the terms of the contract to determine \nthe intentions of the parties.\"). That section st ates that the \"Property\" sold by Campbell to \nAmeriGas has not been \"conducted in any materi al violation of any statute, law, ordinance, \nor regulation of any governmental entity.\" 57 As noted above, the APA expressly defines \n\"Property\" as including the customer storage tanks.  The representation and warranty in the \nfirst sentence is not limited to  real property.  There is noth ing inconsistent about the broad \nrepresentation in the first sentence of section 7.5 and the more specific representations in the \nremainder of the section regarding complianc e with particular environmental and zoning \nlaws and regulations. For example, section 7.5 also warrants that the Real Property is not \nonly properly zoned, but that the real property  at which Plant Facilities are operated is not \n                                                 \n56 \"Property,\" as used in the APA is defined as al l assets listed in section 1 of the APA, including \ncustomer tanks and real property. APA § 1. \n57 APA § 7.5. \ngrandfathered under any previous zoning ordi nances. Similarly, section 7.5 also contains \nspecific representations regarding complianc e with environmental regulations. These \nadditional representations do not conflict with the general representation that begins section \n7.5, but simply supplement that general repr esentation to address issues related to \ncompliance with specific regulations and laws. \n52. Campbell contends that such an interpretation of section 7.5 renders section \n7.3 meaningless as violations of the latter section would necessarily be subsumed by the \nformer.\n58 The Court disagrees. By their plain language, sections 7.3 and 7.5 contain different \nrepresentations. Section 7.3 of the APA, titled  \"Tangible Personal Property,\" provides in \npertinent part as follows: \nAll tangible property transferred to [AmeriGas] hereunder is in good operating \ncondition and is suitable for its current use and, where appropriate, such \nproperty is in compliance with (i) the rules and regulations of the applicable \nauthorities for the storage and handling of propane, (ii) with the current \nNational Fire Protection Association Pamphlet No. 58 . . ., and (iii) the \nrequirements and standards as promulgated by the United States Department \nof Transportation for LP gas products . . . . To the knowledge of Sellers and \nOwners, all of the Property being transferred (including only the 18,873 \nCustomer Tanks and their installation  and the vehicles) complies with all \nrelevant governmental codes and g ood operating practices and safety \nstandards in the propane business and the State of North Carolina. \n \n53. As is clear from its plain language, section 7.3 warrants generally that the \ntangible personal property Campbell is trans ferring to AmeriGas \"is in good operating \ncondition and suitable for its current use,\" and more specifically that  the customer storage \ntanks are in compliance with three sets of re gulations or standards.  Section 7.5, which \napplies to all property and operations, warr ants that they are not in violation of any \ngovernmental law or regulation, but makes no representations regarding the working \ncondition or suitability for use of any perso nal property. While the two sections have some \n                                                 \n58 Pls. Br.. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 20 (\"Indeed, AmeriG as' interpretation of Section 7.4 and 7.5 would \nrender superfluous the entirety of Section 7.3.\") (emphasis in original).  \noverlap, that overlap falls far short of re ndering one provision meaningless as the two \nsections can be read together. See In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust , 210 N.C. App. 409, \n415 (2011) (\"[O]ur courts adhere to the central principle of contract interpretation that [t]he \nvarious terms of the [contract] are to be harmoniously construed, and if possible, every word \nand every provision is to be given effect.\"). \n54. Similarly, the Court also must reject Campbell's argument that \"the specific \nterms of [s]ection 7.3 supersede the general terms of\" section 7.5. 59 Generally, \"cannons of \ncontract construction hold that 'when general terms and specific statements included in the \nsame contract and there is a conflict, the general terms should give way to the specifics.\" Lail \nv. Cleveland Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 183 N.C. App. 554, 563 (2007) (internal citations omitted) \n(emphasis added). While there is room for overlap between these sections, as noted above, \nCampbell has not shown the existence of any co nflict between the provisions in sections 7.3 \nand 7.5 of the APA, and the Court concludes that no such conflict exists. \n55. As to whether the transfer of non-comp liant customer tanks constitutes an \nindependent violation of section 7.3, the Co urt first notes Campbell's contention that a \nviolation of section 7.3 requires the knowledge of the violation.\n60 Campbell bases this position \non the final sentence of section 7.3, which on ly represented that the storage tanks were in \ncompliance \"[t]o the knowledge of Sellers and Owners.\" As an initial matter, this \ninterpretation appears to ignore the preceding representations, which are not limited to the \nknowledge of Campbell, that all property tr ansferred was in good operating condition, \nsuitable for its current use, and in compliance with the enumerated regulations and \nstandards. However, even assuming Campbell's in terpretation of that section is correct, the \n                                                 \n59 Pls.' Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 19. \n60 Campbell also argues that, despite using the phrase \"knowledge of Sellers and Owners\" in section \n7.3, the knowledge requirement in this section is limited to the actual knowledge of the Owners, based \non the definition of knowledge in section 12.9 of the APA. \nCourt has already concluded that the transfer of noncompliant tanks constituted a violation \nof section 7.5, which contains no knowledge requirement. Because no conflict exists between \nsections 7.3 and 7.5, and because those provisions can be read in harmony, even if Campbell \ndid not breach section 7.3, the transfer of noncompliant tanks still constituted a breach of the \nAPA. Accordingly, the Court now turns to wh ether the deductible provided in section 10.1 \napplies to the financial cost of that violation. \n56. Section 10.1 provides that the Sellers and Owners will jointly and severally \nindemnify AmeriGas for any damage arising out of, among other things, \"the breach of any \ncovenant or agreement made by any Seller and/or the Owners\" in the APA. 61 That section, \nhowever, also provides that \"[s]ellers shall have no liability . . . with respect to claims under \nSection 10.1 until the total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds two hundred \nfifty thousand dollars . . . and then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed two \nhundred fifty thousand dollars.\"\n62 The deductible provision expressly states that it does not \napply to breaches of sections 7.2, 7.4, 7.5, or 7.8 \"or to any breach of any of Sellers' \nrepresentations and warranties of which th e Sellers had knowledge\" prior to the \nrepresentation.\n63 \n57. By its plain language, the deductible does not apply to breaches of section 7.5. \nThe Court has concluded that, in transferring the non-compliant tanks, Campbell breached \nsection 7.5 of the APA. Accordingly, AmeriGas properly withheld the entire cost of tank \nremediation, as the deductible in section 10.1 was inapplicable. \n58. The Court concludes that the sale of noncompliant tanks constituted a breach \nof section 7.5 and that AmeriGas was entitled to offset the entire cost of remediation. \n                                                 \n61 APA § 10.1.  \n62 Id. (emphasis added). \n63 Id.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that to the extent Campbell claims that AmeriGas breached \nthe APA by withholding from payments for the cost of tank remediation, AmeriGas' Motion \nfor Summary Judgment as to Claim One should  be GRANTED, and Campbell's Motion for \nSummary Judgment as to that claim should be DENIED. \nNon-compete Agreement \n59. In its Third Claim for Relief, Campbell seeks a declaratory judgment finding \nthat the non-competition restriction in the APA \"is not valid\" and is \"unenforceable.\"  \nCampbell and AmeriGas each have moved for su mmary judgment in their respective favor \non Campbell's claim for declaratory judgme nt. In addition, AmeriGas has alleged a \ncounterclaim for \"anticipatory breach\" of the non-competition agreement.64  Alternatively, in \nthe event the Court declares the non-competition agreement unenforceable, AmeriGas makes \na claim for unjust enrichment seeking return of the amounts it paid to Campbell as \nconsideration for the non-competition res trictions. Campbell has moved for summary \njudgment on AmeriGas' counterclaims. \nExcused Performance \n60. Campbell argues that the non-compet ition agreement cannot be enforced \nagainst them because AmeriGas breached the agreement by withholding from the 2010 and \n2011 payments.  At the time it filed the Complaint, Campbell alleged that despite AmeriGas' \nalleged breach of its obligations Campbell \"ha[s] continued to complied with the terms of the \nCovenant without exception.\" 65   Since the filing of the Complaint, however, Campbell has \nreentered the propane business in breach of the non-competition agreement, but contends \nthat AmeriGas' breach of its payment obligations excuses Campbell's performance under the \n                                                 \n64 AmeriGas filed its counterclaim for anticipatory  breach in September 2013, after Campbell had \nannounced the acquisition of Brooks, but before Campbell started operating the competing propane \nbusiness.  The Court will treat AmeriGas' current claim as one for breach of contract. \n65 Compl. ¶ 59. \nagreement.   AmeriGas contends that even if it improperly withheld payments, that breach \ndoes not excuse Campbell's performance beca use Campbell waived the right to terminate \ntheir own performance by accepting the partial payments from AmeriGas.   \n61. In North Carolina, a party may waive the breach of a contractual provision.  \nThe North Carolina Supreme Court has recognized that \nWhile the breach of a continuing con tract may justify a termination of the \ncontract by the innocent party, the mere fact a breach of one of the provisions \nof the contract has been committed by one party does not necessarily \naccomplish that result, as the party not in fault may elect to waive the breach \nand continue performance regardless of the breach.  \n \nWhere there is a breach of a contract or some provision there of which does not \ngo to the substance of the whole contract and indicate an intention to repudiate \nit, the breach may be waived by the innocent party. \nNon constat such breach, \nhe may elect to treat the contract as still subsisting and continue performance \non his part. \n \nWheeler v. Wheeler, 299 N.C. 633, 638 (1980) (citations omitted). Accordingly,  \n[A]fter one party has breached a contractual provision, the nonbreaching party \nhas a choice between alternate courses of conduct. He may terminate his \nfurther liability and recover damages or he may continue the contract, choosing \nto receive the promisee's defective pe rformance and regarding his right to \ndamages as adequate compensation. \n \nId. at 637. \n62.  In order to establish a waiver of a breach of contract, the party asserting \nwaiver must establish that:  \n(1) The waiving party is the innocent, or nonbreaching party, and  \n(2) The breach does not involve total repudiation of the contract so that the \nnonbreaching party continues to re ceive some of the bargained-for \nconsideration . . . ., and \n(3) The innocent party is aware of the breach, and \n(4) The innocent party intentionally waives his right to excuse or repudiate his \nown performance by continuing to perform or accept the partial \nperformance of the breaching party. \n \nId. at 639. \"The presumption is that a party's inte ntional election to continue performing or \nreceiving performance after knowledge of a breach is an indication that he does not consider \nthe contract totally repudiated and in fact pr obably still receives considerable benefit under \nit.\" Id. at 640. \n63. Here, Campbell alleges that it is the \"innocent\" or non-breaching party.66 It is \nundisputed that AmeriGas did not totally repudi ate the agreement. Rather, it made partial \npayments in 2010 and 2011, and paid over $1.6 million of the required $2 million in payments \nunder the non-competition agreement. Campbell clearly received the vast majority of the \nbargained-for consideration. Campbell became aware of AmeriGas' alleged breach when \nCampbell did not receive the full payments in 2010 and 2011.\n67 It is undisputed that \nCampbell continued to accept, and retained, the periodic payments, including the full \n$500,000 payment in 2012. 68 Nothing in the record indicates that Campbell qualified its \nacceptance of those payments, or otherwise a ttempted to reserve any right it may have had \nto terminate its own performance. 69 Instead, the evidence establishes that Campbell \nintentionally waived its right to excuse its own performance by accepting partial payments \nand failing to terminate the non-competition agreement, and instead choosing to pursue \nrecovery of damages in this lawsuit.\n70 Accordingly, the Court concludes that Campbell waived \nits right to terminate its own performance under the non-compete.71 \n                                                 \n66 See Compl. ¶ 59 (alleging that, \"[s]ince the closing, Plaintiffs have fully complied with the terms of \nthe Covenant without exception.\").  \n67 See Compl. ¶¶ 44 (alleging that \"AmeriGas informed Campbell that it was \nwithholding . . . payments . . . which were due under the non-compete portion of the APA.\"). \n68 See Dep.

QVC, Inc. , 129 F.Supp. 2d 856, 862-63 (M.D.N.C. 2000) (finding that acceptance \nof a check as partial payment while informing payor that recipient was specifically accepting as partial \npayment and still believed that deficiencies existed did not waive right to terminate performance). \n70 As AmeriGas recognizes, such waiver does not prevent Campbell from recovering damages from any \nbreach of the APA, but only waives Campbell's right to terminate its own performance based on any \nsuch breach. Def.'s Reply Br. 3; Wheeler, 299 N.C. at 637. \n71 Campbell appears to conflate AmeriGas' waiver argument in this case with the doctrine of \"accord \nand satisfaction.\" Pls.' Br. Opp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. p..20.  AmeriGas has not argued that Campbell \nagreed to and accepted partial payments in satisfaction of AmeriGas' full payment obligation, or that \nCampbell has waived its rights to pursue the remainder of those payments.  Rather, AmeriGas' \ncontends only that Campbell's acceptance of the partial payments without any reservation of rights \nValidity of the Non-compete \n64. Campbell also challenges the validity and enforceability of the non-competition \nrestriction on the grounds that it is unreaso nable because it (a) prohibits Campbell from \nengaging in the electric and natural gas busin esses, (b) restricts Campbell from competing \nfor a period of 10 years, and (c) prohibits Campbell from competing within a 100 mile radius \nof any former Campbell facility sold to AmeriGas. \n65. In North Carolina, covenants restricting competition generally are \"not viewed \nfavorably in modern law.\" \nHartman v. W.H. Odell & Assocs., 117 N.C. App. 307, 311 (1994). \nWhile these covenants are closely scrutinized when they are used to bar an employee from \ncompeting with a former employer, 72 restrictive covenants obtained as part of the sale of a \nbusiness are subject to less stringent analysis. Beverage Sys. of the Carolinas, LLC v. Assoc. \nBeverage Repair, LLC, __ N.C. App. __, __, 762 S.E.2d 316, 320 (2013); Seaboard Indus., Inc. \nv. Blair, 10 N.C. App. 322, 333 (1971).  Courts have recognized that covenants not-to-compete \nin connection with the sale of a business \"enable the seller . . . to sell his good-will and thereby \nreceive a higher price; and they also furnish a material inducement to the purchaser who \npurchases a business with the hope of retaining its customers.\" \nSeaboard Indus., Inc., 10 N.C. \nApp. at 333.  Accordingly, a covenant-not-to co mpete obtained as part of the purchase of a \nbusiness \"is valid and enforceable (1) if it is reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate \ninterest of the purchaser; (2) if it is reasonabl e with respect to both time and territory; and \n(3) if it does not interfere with the interest of the public.\" Jewel Box Stores Corp. v. Morrow, \n272 N.C. 659, 662-63 (1968); Beverage Sys., 762 S.E.2d at 320.  Whether a non-competition \n                                                 \nand without terminating the non-competition agreem ent waived its right to claim that it was not \nbound by the agreement. \n72 See A.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. McClure, 308 N.C. 393, 402 (1983).  \nagreement is reasonable is decided as a matter of law by the Court.  Outdoor Lighting \nPerspectives Franchising, Inc. v. Harders,  __ N.C. App. __, __, 747 S.E.2d 256, 264 (2013). \n66. Campbell does not argue that the non-comp ete at issue here interferes in any \nway with the interest of the public. Additionally, nothing in the record indicates that the non-\ncompete unduly limits access to propane in the territory covered by the non-compete, or \notherwise carries any significant public impact.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the \nnon-compete satisfies this requirement. \n67. Campbell contends that AmeriGas had no legitimate business interest in \nprohibiting Campbell from competing in the na tural gas and electric generation businesses. \nCampbell argues that these prohibitions cons titute an impermissible attempt to eliminate \ncompetition for AmeriGas' propane business.73 AmeriGas contends, however, that the natural \ngas and electric generation businesses compete directly with propane sales. 74  Plaintiff has \nnot offered any evidence to dispute this contention.  The Court concludes that AmeriGas had \na legitimate interest in res tricting Campbell from engaging in other businesses that are \ndirectly competitive with propane in order to protect the customers and operations purchased \nby AmeriGas, as well as the goodwill associated with Campbell's propane business.75 \n68. Campbell also challenges the ten year duration of the non-competition \nrestrictions in the agreement as unreasonable. Campbell argues that the 10 year restriction \nwas unnecessary to protect AmeriGas' interests,  particularly as the business involved here \nis the sale of a \"simple commodity.\" 76 Campbell also notes that AmeriGas has ceased using \nthe Campbell name in at least some locations it purchased from Campbell. AmeriGas \ncounters that \"the propane industry generally is comprise[d] of small businesses that have \n                                                 \n73 Pls.' Br. Supp. Mot. Summ.

J. pp. 26-27. \nstrong relationships within the community,\" and that it continues to use the Campbell name \nat some locations.77 \n69. As our court of appeals has recently noted, in the context of a sale of a business, \ntime restrictions \"of ten, fifteen and twenty years . . . have been upheld by the Supreme Court \nof North Carolina.\" Beverage Sys., 762 S.E.2d at 320-21 (citing Seaboard Indus., 10 N.C. App. \nat 335). See also Jewel Box Stores Corp., 272 N.C. App. at 663-64 (collecting cases in the sale \nof business context, including cases in which lifetime restrictions have been upheld in North \nCarolina). The restrictions here  were included in a large, negotiated transaction between \nrelatively sophisticated commercial busines s entities. The non-competition agreement \nacknowledges the value of the goodwill that Am eriGas is acquiring and that AmeriGas had \n\"legitimate business interest\" in seeking the \"special and unique\" restrictions.78  In exchange \nfor these restrictions, AmeriGas agreed to pay an additional two million dollars over a period \nof five years.79 Not only does the amount of this payment suggest the value to both parties of \nthis bargained-for provision, but the five year  payment schedule indicates that AmeriGas \nhad a strong, ongoing, interest in securing compliance by providing substantial consideration \nfor the restrictions over an extended period of time.     \n70. Ultimately, while the 10 year restriction appears to the Court to be at the outer \nlimits of reasonableness under the facts presen t here, the Court concludes that the 10 year \nrestriction serves a legitimate business purpose and is reasonable under the circumstances. \n71. Finally, Campbell challenges as unreas onably broad the geographic scope of \nthe non-competition covenant. Even in the sale of business context, our court of appeals has \nnoted that \"restriction as to territory is reasonable only to the extent it protects the legitimate \n                                                 \n77 Def.'s Br.

App. at 312), and \"the reasonableness of a geographic restriction \ndepends upon where the business' customers are located and [whether] the geographic scope \nof the covenant is necessary to maintain those customer relationships.\" Outdoor Lighting \nPerspectives, 747 S.E.2d at 264. Courts have found geographic restrictions unreasonable \nwhen they are not tied to the location of the customers of the buyer or the seller. Beverage \nSys., 762 S.E.2d at 321. \n72. It is undisputed that, at or around the time of the sale of its propane business, \nCampbell generally served customers with in a 25 mile radius of its facilities. 80 On occasion, \nCampbell had customers up to 40 miles away from its offices. 81 The non-competition \ncovenant, however, prohibits Campbell from competing within a 100 mile radius around any \nof the facilities sold to AmeriGas.82 The size of the Restricted Area would prohibit competition \nfrom the Sellers and Owners in a significant portion of North Carolina, and in portions of \nSouth Carolina, in which Campbell never had any propane customers.83  \n73. AmeriGas argues that the geographic area of a restrictive covenant \"may \nextend to the area where customers of the seller and buyer are located,\" 84 but provided no \nspecific evidence regarding where AmeriGas' fac ilities or customers were located.  Instead, \nAmeriGas asserts only that \"AmeriGas did business in North Carolina prior to the acquisition \n                                                 \n80 Campbell Dep. 100. \n81 Julian Dep. 79. \n82 APA § 8.5(a)(1). These Plant Facilities are located in Burgaw, Cerro Gordo, Clinton, Elizabethtown, \nLaurinburg, Lumberton, Macclesfield, McDonald, Nashville, Raleigh, Supply, Wallace, Whiteville, and \nZebulon, North Carolina. APA, Recitals ¶ A. \n83 At the hearing, Campbell provided the Court with maps illustrating the territory that would be \ncovered by drawing a 100 mile radius around the most central facility located in Clinton, North \nCarolina, and territory covered if one drew 25 mile radii around each of the 10 separate facilities \nCampbell sold to AmeriGas.  The 100 mile radius ar ound Clinton alone covere d significant territory \noutside of Campbell's general 25 mile service radius.  \n84 Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. p.. 18. \nof Campbell, and generally served customers up to fifty mile away from its offices.\" 85  There \nis no evidence demonstrating that the 100 mile  radius around Campbell's former facilities \nprotected any of AmeriGas' existing customers. \n74. In support of the reasonableness of the restriction, AmeriGas contends that \nthis restriction \"protects a 50-mile service radius because sales of propane outside the \nRestricted Area could result in the deliver y of propane inside the Restricted Area.\"\n86 \nAmeriGas notes that two hypothetical propane  businesses, each with a 50-mile service \nradius, located 50 miles apart will compete for customers within their overlapping service \nradii.87 Thus, argues AmeriGas, a 100-mile restriction was necessary to adequately protect \nits investment in its acquired propane busine ss. While the Court recognizes that the 100-\nmile restriction would resolve the issues raised  by overlapping service areas, imposing such \na restriction also drastically changes the character and scope of the restriction. In eliminating \nthe overlapping service area, the 100-mile re striction still bars Campbell from competing in \na substantial area where it had no former customers and AmeriGas has no operations.  \n75. The restriction in the non-competition goes beyond what is necessary to protect \nAmeriGas' interests in maintaining customer s and encompasses a significant area where \nneither Campbell nor AmeriGas had customers. See Beverage Sys. , 762 S.E.2d at 321.  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that the g eographic restriction in the non-compete is \nunreasonable, and therefore unenforceable.  \n76. The conclusion that the non-competitio n agreement is unreasonable does not, \nhowever, end the Court's analysis. Instead, AmeriGas urges the Court to enforce the \n                                                 \n85 Hamilton Aff. ¶ 10. \n86 Def.'s Br. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 19 (citing Hamilton Aff. ¶¶ 9-10).  \n87 Id.  \nprovision \"to the greatest extent reasonable,\" based on the language of the covenant itself. 88 \nThat language provides:  \nIf the terms of this Section 8.5 are held by any court or agency to be \nunenforceable because of the period of time in which those terms remain in \neffect, the breadth of the activities restricted, or the breadth of the geographical \narea of the limitations, then, nevertheless, this section shall be deemed to have \nbeen amended to limit that time period, those activities, or that area to the \nlongest time period, the broadest activi ties and the largest geographical area \n(not to exceed those set forth in this section) as will be enforceable.89 \n \n77. While North Carolina abides by the strict blue-pencil doctrine, which limits the \nability of a court to revise an unenforceable non-compete by choosing not to enforce divisible \nportions of the covenant, 90 the North Carolina Court of Appeals has recognized that a \ncovenant itself can provide authori ty to revise its terms. In Beverage Systems, the court of \nappeals found a covenant's geographic scope unreasonable based on the lack of customers in \na portion of the restricted area. 762 S.E.2d at  320. That covenant, however, specifically \nprovided \"that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions . . . to cover the maximum \nperiod, scope and area permitted by law.\"  Id. Based on that language, the court of appeals \nconcluded that \"the trial court's ability to re vise the non-compete is not subject to the \nrestrictions of the 'blue pencil doctrine'\" and should have revised the restrictions \"to make it \nreasonable on the evidence before it.\" Id. at 321-22. \n78. In support of its holding in Beverage Systems, the court of appeals concluded \nthat enforcing a provision permitting a court to revise a restrictive covenant \"makes good \nbusiness sense\" and better protects the interests of the seller and purchaser, noting that strict \nadherence to the \"blue pencil doctrine\" may no longer make sense in light of \"a rapidly \n                                                 \n88 Def.'s Reply Br. 9-10. \n89 APA § 8.5(e). \n90 Under North Carolina's traditional application of the blue-pencil doctrine, the Court would be \nwithout authority to revise the geographic scope of the noncompete as the entire geographic scope \nprovision is unreasonable and not comprised of di stinctly separa ble provisions, such as local \ngeographical or governmental units. \nCf. Welcome Wagon Int'l, Inc. v. Pender, 255 N.C. 244, 248 (1961). \nchanging economy.\"   Bev. Sys., 762 S.E.2d at 322.  Finally, the court of appeals opined that \npotential buyers may be unwilling to purchase a business if they feared a non-competition \nagreement \"could not be modified and enforced by the courts,\" noting the former owner of the \nbusinesses at issue \"agreed to sign the non-compete and was compensated for that \nagreement\" but was now \"ask[ing] the courts to hold the negotiated-for non-compete invalid.\" \nId. at 322-23. The factual scenario in Beverage Systems is highly similar to the case at bar, \nwhere it is undisputed that Campbell received and accepted the annual payments under the \nnon-compete totaling more than $1.6 million only to purchase a competing propane business \nin direct violation of the non-compete.  \n79. In this case then, the critical inquiry is whether section 8.5(e) manifests an \nintent to allow the Court to amend the non-competition agreement at issue here.  The Court \nrecognizes that the language in section 8.5(e) is not as explicit as that in Beverage Systems. \nThe plain language of section 8.5(e), however, es tablishes that the parties recognized that a \n\"court\" would be the entity charged with  determining whether the non-competition \nrestriction was enforceable, and that a court might find the agreed upon geographic scope of \nthe restrictions to be unenforceable.  The language used by the parties also establishes that \nthey intended for the geographic area to be revised to make the covenant legally enforceable. \nWhile the phrase \"deemed to have been amended\"  does not expressly place the authority to \namend with a court, providing that the geogra phic area is deemed amended to the largest \n\"enforceable\" area necessarily requires a determ ination of what geographic scope is legally \nenforceable.  Such a determination can only be  made by a court of competent jurisdiction. \nThe Court concludes that read as a whole, section  8.5(e) reflects that parties' intent that a \ncourt would make any amendment or revision to the geographic scope of the restrictive \ncovenant necessary for it to be \"deemed\" enforceable.   \n80. As noted above, the only provision of the non-compete that is unreasonable, \nand therefore unenforceable, is the geographic restriction. While, under the circumstances, a \n100-mile radius restriction is unreasonable, th e Court believes that a narrower restriction \nwould be reasonable. The record evidence refl ects that Campbell sold propane to customers \nlocated a maximum of 40 miles away from any of  its offices, and that AmeriGas generally \nserves customers up to 50 miles from their o ffice locations. AmeriG as, however, did not \nproduce evidence regarding the locations of any existing North Carolina propane operations \nor customers that it had prior to purchasing Campbell.  This Court has no factual basis upon \nwhich to determine whether AmeriGas had cu stomers in areas that require protection. See \nBeverage Sys., 762 S.E.2d at 321, n. 2.  Accordingly,  the Court concludes that a territorial \nlimitation of a 40 mile radius is reasonable, and the non-compete, pursuant to section 8.5(e), \nshould be revised to reflect that the Restricte d Area only includes an area within a 40-mile \nradius of any of the Plant Facilities. \n81. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion, to the extent it seeks entry of summary \njudgment in Plaintiffs' favor on Plaintiffs' Third Claim and Defendant's First Counterclaim, \nshould be DENIED, and Defendant's Motion, to  the extent it seeks summary judgment in \nDefendant's favor on Plaintiffs' Third Claim should be GRANTED. \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that: \n82. As to Plaintiffs' First Claim, to the extent that claim is premised on AmeriGas' \nwithholding of $111,107.83 related to the account s receivable dispute, Plaintiffs' Motion is \nGRANTED and Defendant's Motion is DENIED. \n83. As to Plaintiffs' First Claim, to the extent that claim is premised on AmeriGas' \nwithholding of the full cost of tank remediat ion work, Plaintiffs' Motion is DENIED and \nDefendant's Motion is GRANTED. \n84.
