Sovereign immunity is a doctrine  that bars suits against the State and its \nagencies absent waiver or consent.  The question presented here is whether the State \nwaived its sovereign immunity for claims of  misappropriation of trade secrets .  For \nthe following reasons, the answer is no.  \nJames, McElroy & Diehl, P.A., by John R. Buric and John R. Brickley, \nfor Plaintiff Eidogen-Sertanty, Inc. \n \nRobinson, Bradshaw  & Hinson,  P.A., by Cary B. Davis, Erik R. \nZimmerman, and Morgan P. Abbott, for Defendants University of North \nCarolina, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and University of \nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill d/b/a UNC Eshelman School of \nPharmacy.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n2. Plaintiff Eidogen -Sertanty, Inc. (“Eidogen”) gathers and categorizes  \nscientific information into databases designed for chemical, biological, and \n \n \npharmaceutical research.  ( Am. Compl. ¶ 10, ECF No. 17  [“Compl.”].)  One such  \ndatabase, the Kinase Knowledgebase, allows users to  access hand-drawn chemical \nstructures and associated biological annotations  from among a collection of \napproximately two million data points.  (Compl. ¶¶ 11, 12.)  Eidogen grants access to \nthe Kinase Knowledgebase to various organizations, including academic institutions, \nfor annual license fees.  (Compl. ¶¶ 19, 20.) \n3. This case arises out of a license agreement between Eidogen and the \nUniversity of North Carolina and its Eshelman School of Pharmacy  (together, the \n“University”).  (Compl. ¶  18.)  For $12,500 per year, certain University  personnel \nwere given user-specific, password-protected login credentials that allowed them to \naccess and download information from the Kinase Knowledgebase  for the limited \npurpose of using that information to conduct research .  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 20, 24, 25.)  The \nlicense agreement had an initial one-year term to be followed by automatic renewals \neach year unless the University provided written notice of cancellation at least ninety \ndays before expiration.  (Compl. ¶¶ 18, 21.)  According to the amended complaint, the \nagreement renewed automatically for a second year  and again for a third year, \nthrough December  22, 2018.   (Compl. ¶¶  26, 27.)  But on January 24, 2018, the \nUniversity informed Eidogen that, due to budget restrictions,  it no longer wished to \ncontinue the services .  (Compl. ¶ ¶ 28, 29.)  Eidogen now asserts  that the license \nagreement had already renewed and that the University is therefore obligated to pay \nthe annual fee.  (Compl. ¶¶ 27, 28, 30.)  To date, the University has not paid the fee.  \n(Compl. ¶ 30.) \n \n \n4. Believing the University’s non -payment to be in violation of the license \nagreement, Eidogen began to deactivate the University’s login access.  (Compl. ¶¶ 25, \n31.)  Eidogen claims to have discovered that the University improperly provided its \ncredentials to outside users, and as a result, that the Kinase Knowledgebase  was \naccessed beyond the scope of the agreement.  (Compl. ¶¶ 32, 33, 35, 36.)  Specifically, \nEidogen alleges that the login credentials were used to  enter other databases, to  \naccess information after the University indicated it did not want to renew, and to log \nin from unauthorized locations, not only in North Carolina but also elsewhere in the \nUnited States and abroad.  (Compl. ¶¶ 32, 33.)  The University allegedly continues to \nhave access to information in the Kinase Knowledgebase.  (Compl. ¶ 37.)  \n5. Eidogen filed this lawsuit  in April 2018,  claiming not only that the \nUniversity breached the license agreement but also that it  violated the North \nCarolina Trade Secrets Protection Act (“TSPA”).  (Compl. ¶¶ 44, 54.)  Eidogen alleges \nthat the Kinase Knowledgebase is subject to trade -secret protection and that the \nUniversity’s ongoing access to  and use of  that information amounts to \nmisappropriation.  (Compl. ¶¶ 13–17, 23.)  \n6. The University has not yet answered the amended complaint but has moved \nto dismiss Eidogen’s trade-secret claim, arguing that the claim is barred by sovereign \nimmunity.  (See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 1 , ECF No. 19  [“Mem. in Supp.”] .)  Eidogen \nresponds that the General Assembly waived sovereign immunity through the TSPA.  \n(See Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n 1, ECF No. 27 [“Opp’n”] ; see also Compl. ¶ 61.)  The Court \n \n \nheld a hearing on September 25, 2018, at which all parties were represented.   The \nmotion is ripe for determination.  \nII. \nANALYSIS \n \n7. Sovereign immunity protects the State and its agencies, including the \nUniversity, “from suit absent waiver or consent.”  Wood v. N.C. State Univ., 147 N.C. \nApp. 336, 338, 556 S.E.2d 38, 40 (2001).  A valid assertion of sovereign immunity is \nnot merely a de fense to liability; it is an  “absolute and unqualified” immunity from \nsuit altogether.  Guthrie v. N.C. State Ports Auth., 307 N.C. 522, 534, 299 S.E.2d 618, \n625 (1983) (emphasis omitted).  Thus, when a motion to dismiss is based on sovereign \nimmunity, it must be decided as a threshold jurisdictional issue (though whether it \n“is a matter of personal or subject matter jurisdiction” remains unsettled).  Teachy v. \nCoble Dairies, Inc., 306 N.C. 324, 327–28, 293 S.E.2d 182, 184 (1982). \n8. The University’s motion presents a single issue: whether the General \nAssembly waived sovereign immunity for claims of trade -secret misappropriation in \nthe TSPA.  That is a question of statutory interpretation and, therefore, a question of \nlaw for the Court to decide.  See, e.g., Lunsford v. Mills, 367 N.C. 618, 623, 766 S.E.2d \n297, 301 (2014).  It is also a question of first impression in North Carolina. \n9. Our Supreme Court has stressed that “[w]aiver of sovereign immunity may \nnot be lightly inferred and State statutes waiving this immunity, being in derogation \nof the sovereign right to immunity, must be strictly construed.”  Guthrie, 307 N.C. at \n537–38, 299 S.E.2d at 627.  “The concept of sovereign immunity is so firmly \nestablished that it should not and cannot be waived by indirection or by procedural \n \n \nrule.  Any such change should be by plain, unmistakable mandate of the lawmaking \nbody.”  Orange Co. v. Heath, 282 N.C. 292, 296, 192 S.E.2d 308, 310 (1972). \n10. Applying these interpretive principles to the TSPA, the Court finds no plain \nand unmistakable waiver of sovereign immunity.  The TSPA authorizes a private \nright of action for trade -secret misappropriation in just 18 words: “The owner of a \ntrade secret shall have remedy by civil action for misappropriation of his trade \nsecret.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 66-153.  This statute does not mention the State.  Nor does \nit expressly permit the owner of a trade secret to bring a civil acti on for \nmisappropriation against the State. \n11. Even so, Eidogen infers a waiver of sovereign immunity from other sections \nof the TSPA .  It points to s ection 66 -155, which  states that a prima facie case of \nmisappropriation exists if there is evidence that “the person against whom relief is \nsought” had knowledge of the trade secret and an opportunity to acquire it without \nthe owner’s consent.  Id. § 66-155.  The term “person” is defined elsewhere to mean  \n“an individual, corporation, government, governmental subdivision or agency , \nbusiness trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, or any other legal \nor commercial entity .”  Id. § 66-152(2) (emphas is added) .  Eidogen reads these \nstatutes to allow trade-secret owners to sue the State because it is a “government” \nand, therefore, potentially a “person against whom relief” may be sought.  (Opp’n 4–\n5.) \n12. It would be particularly odd, though, to find a waiver of sovereign immunity \nin section 66 -155.  That statute has nothing to do with authorizing civil actions for \n \n \nmisappropriation (which is section 66 -153’s function).  Its purpose is only to set out \nthe standard that a trade-secret owner must satisfy to establish a prima facie case of \nmisappropriation, along with the types of evidence a defendant may introduce  to \nrebut the prima facie case.  When section 66-155 refers to “the person against whom \nrelief is sought,” it does so in the context of allocating evidentiary burdens, not for the \npurpose of identifying who may be sued for misappropriation, as Eidogen contends. \n13. The final sentence of  section 66 -155, which Eidogen does not address, \nconfirms as much.  It states that section 66-155 “shall not be construed to deprive the \nperson against whom relief is sought of any other defenses provided under the law.”  \nN.C. Gen. Stat. §  66-155 (emphasis added) .  There is no obvious reason why this \nfacially broad language would exclude defenses that immunize a defendant from suit, \nsuch as sovereign immunity.  If so, then section 66 -155 could not waive sovereign \nimmunity because it preserves the defense.  Thus, even accepting Eidogen’s position \nthat the State is a person under the TSPA, section 66-155 does not say or imply that \nthe State may be sued for misappropriation. \n14. Eidogen’s argument also runs afoul of the usual rule that “the term person \ndoes not include the sovereign and statutes employing the word are ordinarily \nconstrued to exclude it.”  N.C. Dep’t of Transp. v. Davenport , 334 N.C. 428, 432, 432 \nS.E.2d 303, 305 (1993) (citation, quotation marks, and alterations omitted)  (holding \nthat the State is immune from the contempt power of the court) .  Eidogen makes \nmuch of section 66-152(2)’s definition of person to include government, but when the \nGeneral Assembly intends for the term government to include the State, it usually \n \n \nsays so expressly.  See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat. §  132-1(a) (“Agency of North Carolina \ngovernment or its subdivisions shall mean and include every public office , public \nofficer or official (State or local, elected or appointed) [.]”); id. § 53B-2(4) \n(“‘Government authority’ means an agency or department of the State or of any of its \npolitical subdivisions, including any officer, employee, or agent thereof.”) ; see also \nDavidson Co. v. City of High Point , 85 N.C. App. 26, 37, 354 S.E.2d 28 0, 286 (1987) \n(“Normally, general statutes do not apply to the State unless the State is specifically \nmentioned therein.”). \n15. The TSPA never mentions the State , either in its definition of person or \nanywhere else.  This is in sharp contrast to other statutes our courts have construed \nto waive sovereign immunity because they clearly and directly refer to the State.  See, \ne.g., Tort Claims Act, N.C. Gen. Stat.  § 143-291(a) ( permitting certain negligence \nclaims against “the State Board of Education, the Board of Transportation, and all \nother departments, institutions and agencies of the State”); N.C. Ins. Guar. Ass’n v. \nBd. of Trs. of Guilford Tech. Cmty. Coll., 364 N.C. 102, 108, 691 S.E.2d 694, 698 (2010) \n(finding waiver in Workers’ Compensation Act, which provides that “[n]either the \nState nor any municipal corporation within the State . . . shall have the right to reject \nthe provisions of this Article”);  Minneman v. Martin , 114 N.C. App. 616, 619, 442 \nS.E.2d 564, 566 (1994) (finding “clear statutory waiver” in Whistleblower Act, which \nrefers to “State department, agency or institution”) ; State v. Taylor , 322 N.C. 433, \n435, 368 S.E.2d 601, 602 (1988) (finding waiver in section 41-10.1, which provides \nthat “[an] individual . . . may bring an action . . . against the State”). \n \n \n16. Had the General Assembly intended to treat the State as a person within \nthe TSPA and also to permit claims for misappropriation against the State , it could \nhave said so expressly.  It did neither.  Thus, even if the General Assembly intended \nto authorize civil actions for misappropriation  against some governments or \ngovernmental bodies (which is not at all clear), that authorization does not extend to \nthe State. \n17. In short, the TSPA does not clearly or unmistakably waive sovereign \nimmunity for claims of trade-secret misappropriation.  The University, as an agency \nof the State, is therefore immune from Eidogen’s misappropriation claim, and that \nclaim must be dismissed.   \n18. To be sure, this is a harsh result—one that may seem distasteful.  It bears \nnoting, though, that Eidogen is not without a remedy.  The University concedes that \nEidogen’s claim for breach of contract is not barred by sovereign immunity because \nthe State “implicitly consents to be sued for damages” when it enters into a contract.  \nSmith v. State, 289 N.C. 303, 320, 222 S.E.2d 412, 423–24 (1976).  And in other cases, \nparties alleging trade -secret misappropriation by the State may have alternative \noptions for recovery.  See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1002–04 (1984) \n(holding that if a plaintiff had a trade-secret property right under state law, the right \nis protected by the Fifth Amendment ’s Takings Clause).  These may be imperfect \nsubstitutes for direct claims against the State for misappropriation , but in the \nabsence of further action by the General Assembly, they will have to do. \n \n \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n \n19. For these reasons, t he Court GRANTS the University’s motion to dismiss \nEidogen’s claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.  \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 11th day of December, 2018. \n /s/ Adam M.
