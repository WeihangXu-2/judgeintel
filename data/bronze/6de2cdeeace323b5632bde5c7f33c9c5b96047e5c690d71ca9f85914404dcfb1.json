Mineo. \n \n \n \nTennille, Judge. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n{1} This action was filed in Wake County Superior Court on June 8, 2006.  \nPlaintiffs Vernon and Williams filed the Notice of Designation simultaneously with \nthe Complaint on June 8, 2006.  This action was designated a mandatory complex \nbusiness case by Order of the Chief Justice on June 12, 2008, and subsequently \nassigned to the undersigned Chief Special Superior Court Judge for Complex \nBusiness Cases.   \n{2} This matter was bifurcated for trial.  The issues involving liability were \ntried without a jury in the North Carolina Business Court in Wake County from \nFebruary 2, 2009 to February 9, 2009.  Based upon the evidence presented at trial, \nthe Court makes the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and enters \nthe following Orders: \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nTriboFilm   \n{3} TriboFilm Research, Inc. (“TriboFilm” or “the Company”) was founded in \n1997 as a research and development company.  TriboFilm initially focused on \nvacuum deposited coatings for use on syringe stoppers and optical lenses.   All five \noriginal shareholders were scientists with connections to North Carolina State \nUniversity (“N.C. State”), and they were the only “employees” of the Company. \n{4} TriboFilm’s syringe coating was aimed at eliminating silicone as a \nlubricant in syringes.  The elimination of silicone as a lubricant in syringes was \ndesirable because silicone can migrate from the surfaces to which it is applied.  The \nmigration can have two harmful effects.  It can contaminate the fluid in the syringe, \nand it can cause friction that makes delivery of the fluid less consistent.  Almost all \nsyringes now use some form of silicone lubricant.  Using silicone makes it difficult \nfor the medical device industry to provide pre-filled syringes, especially for high \npriced medications.  A breakthrough that eliminates the use of silicone has great \n \n \ncommercial potential and will improve the administration of medications by syringe \nfrom a health standpoint. \n{5} The Company first applied its vacuum deposited coating to syringe \nstoppers, then to syringe plungers, and, later, to the interior barrel of the syringe.  \nTriboFilm had little success in coating the interior barrel of syringes until 2003, \nwhen it switched to the use of atmospheric plasma, rather than vacuum plasma, as \nthe application method.  This change spawned the development of TriboFilm’s \nsilicone-free syringe coating that is now known as the “TriboGlide” technology.    \nDevelopment of this technology was funded largely by grants from the National \nInstitute of Health (“NIH”), the last of which ended in late 2006.  TriboFilm \nachieved Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) 510k approval for TriboGlide in \n2007 and was awarded a patent for the TriboGlide technology in 2008.  Both Vernon \nand Williams were named as inventors on the TriboGlide patent.  While the \nTriboGlide technology has a promising future, it has not yet achieved acceptance or \nwidespread use by syringe manufacturers. \n{6} TriboFilm’s optical lens coating also developed over time from a vacuum \ndeposited coating to a “wet chemistry” coating known as “StaClear,” which offers \nsuperior scratch resistant and graffiti resistant properties to optical lenses as well \nas other types of plastics.  Like TriboGlide, the development of StaClear has been \nfunded largely by NIH grants, which grants have been successfully completed.  \nTriboFilm received a patent for its StaClear technology in 2007.  TriboFilm has not \nyet found a commercial market for StaClear. \n \nTriboFilm’s Shareholders \n{7} The initial idea for TriboFilm resulted from a conversation between Mr. \nVinay Sakhrani (“Sakhrani”), who was doing his graduate course work at N.C. \nState, and his graduate professor, Dr. Jerome Cuomo (“Cuomo”).  Mr. Paul Vernon \n(“Vernon”), who was working as Dr. Cuomo’s lab administrator at the time, was \nlater included in the conception of TriboFilm, as were the other founding \nshareholders, Dr. Charles Tomasino (“Tomasino”) and Dr. Charles Chiklis \n \n \n(“Chiklis”).  Drs. Tomasino and Chiklis were professors at N.C. State.  They have \nboth since retired from N.C. State.  \n{8} Sakhrani graduated with a Master’s Degree in Materials Science and \nEngineering from N.C. State in 1997.  He was the youngest and least experienced \nmember of the original group.  Mr. Sakhrani now serves as Vice President of \nTechnology for TriboFilm, and he has been a member of TriboFilm’s Board of \nDirectors since its inception.  Sakhrani performs research in TriboFilm’s lab on all \nareas of technology, with his major concentration in TriboGlide research.  He has \nserved as the primary investigator on the NIH grants for both the TriboGlide and \nStaClear technologies.  Sakhrani has had direct contact with potential TriboFilm \nclients and has prepared samples for their evaluation.  Since the termination of \nPlaintiffs’ employment with TriboFilm in 2005, Sakhrani has also assumed \nresponsibility for TriboGlide’s business development and grant drafting, and the \ncoordination of TriboFilm’s day-to-day business operations.  Sakhrani has been a \nfull-time employee at TriboFilm since 2002. \n{9} Cuomo is a Distinguished Research Professor at N.C. State, where he \nserves as Director of the Institute for Maintenance Science and Technology \n(“IMST”) and head of the Center for Advanced Materials Processes and Materials \n(“CAMP-M”).  Prior to joining N.C. State, Cuomo had a thirty (30)-year career at \nIBM.  While at IBM, Cuomo was charged with management of a large staff, and he \ndeveloped several coatings techniques.  Cuomo serves as President and Chairman of \nthe Board of Directors for TriboFilm, where he advises TriboFilm about new \ndevelopment opportunities relating to the application of plasma process, assists \nwith client presentations, and handles other business matters.   \n{10} The concept of creating entrepreneurial or intrapreneurial companies that \ncombine N.C. State faculty resources and equipment with startup companies was \nCuomo’s idea.  Premitec and TriboFilm were small research and development \ncompanies designed to create technology on a shoestring or through government \ngrants in the hope that the technology could then be licensed or sold commercially.   \nCuomo had the contacts and influence within N.C. State to foster these \n \n \nentrepreneurial efforts.  He was the creator of the TriboFilm group and its \nacknowledged leader.  He did not, however, contribute significantly to the day-to-\nday research and development work.  He functioned as a sounding board for \ntechnical issues, an idea generator, and, at times, a referee among the scientists. \n{11} Prior to becoming a professor at N.C. State and joining TriboFilm, \nTomasino had a career in the textile industry with Burlington Industries.  At \nBurlington Industries, Tomasino was involved with coatings processes and \natmospheric plasma.  Chiklis previously had a long career at Polaroid, where he \nserved as a senior manager and developed polymer coatings for Polaroid’s products.  \nAt TriboFilm, Tomasino and Chiklis are primarily responsible for the development \nof the StaClear product, interfacing with patent counsel regarding StaClear, and \nmarketing the StaClear technology.  In addition, Tomasino helped develop the \nTriboGlide technology.  He now assists with TriboGlide research and marketing.  \nTomasino also assists with the day-to-day business operations of TriboFilm.    \n{12} Tomasino and Chiklis are both retired professors from N.C. State.  Both \nhad experience in private industry before joining the N.C. State faculty.  They were \nnot the driving forces behind the creation of the Company, but they did a \nsubstantial amount of the day-to-day research and testing.  They were the technical \nworkhorses, especially on the StaClear project.  They were paid on an hourly basis \nas provided in the various grants awarded to TriboFilm. \n{13} While also working at TriboFilm, Vernon remained employed as a lab \nadministrator in Cuomo’s lab until 2002.  Vernon initially served as the Secretary of \nTriboFilm, with responsibility for corporate formation of the Company.  Vernon \nlater assumed the role of President of the Company.  Until his termination in \nNovember of 2005, Vernon handled the Company’s accounting and business \noperations and coordinated grant applications and grant administration.  While he \nhelped some with research and experiments, his primary contribution was securing \nthe grant money that supported the research.  He also kept the venture alive when \nno funds were available and he was not being paid.   \n{14} In August 1998, Mr. Robert Mineo (“Mineo”) became a five (5) percent \n \n \nshareholder in TriboFilm, primarily in exchange for providing legal services.   \nMineo is a lawyer licensed to practice in North Carolina.  He has a background in \nthe aerospace and mechanical engineering field.  Mineo now also assists with \nTriboFilm’s business operations and customer presentations and negotiations.  \nPrior to 2006, he did not play a substantial role in TriboFilm’s business operations \nor research and development. \n{15} Dr. Joel Williams (“Williams”) was not an original shareholder or employee \nof TriboFilm.  Williams provided consulting services to TriboFilm between 2000 and \n2003, primarily assisting Vernon with drafting NIH grant applications.  In \nDecember 2003, the Board of Directors voted to issue stock to Williams.  Williams, \nlike Cuomo, came from a business background.  He had a long and successful career \nat Becton Dickinson, one of the largest suppliers of medical devices in the United \nStates, before retiring from that company.  Like Cuomo, he knew and understood \nthe value and means of commercializing research and development projects, and as \na result of his work at Becton Dickinson, Williams had particular knowledge and \nexpertise with respect to syringe technology. \n{16} Each of the scientists has made some significant contribution to \nTriboFilm’s current success.  Mineo’s scientific contributions were not substantial; \nhe basically functioned as a lawyer who got his ownership interest in return for \nproviding legal services.  Vernon’s primary contributions were in securing funding \nfor research and managing the operation.  TriboFilm was the prototypical research \nand development company in which the owners contributed their time and \nindividual expertise in the hope of producing a breakthrough commercial technology \nthat could be licensed or sold for a large profit.   \n{17} Williams, Cuomo, Chiklis, and Tomasino were not participating in hopes of \nlong-term employment.  They were all at or near retirement age.  This was not, \nhowever, a hobby for them.  They were all seriously working to find a commercially \nviable technology.  Their efforts may yet prove financially rewarding and also \nbenefit the public health.  Vernon and Sakhrani were younger, and employment and \ncompensation were greater concerns to them. \n \n \nOwnership of TriboFilm \n{18} The following chart shows the ownership percentages of the individual \nshareholders at times relevant to this lawsuit. \n Original (%) 1998 (%) 2003 (%) 2006 (%) 2007 (%) \nCuomo 61.5 56.5 20.2 12.0 19.04 \nVernon 14.25 14.25 20.2 20.0 2.4 \nSakhrani 14.25 14.25 20.2 12.0 19.04 \nTomasino 5.0 5.0 8.1 12.0 19.04 \nChiklis 5.0 5.0 6.1 12.0 19.04 \nMineo 0.0 5.0 5.0 12.0 19.04 \nWilliams 0.0 0.0 20.2 20.0 2.4 \n  \n{19} Prior to the changes in 2007, all previous changes in ownership had been \naccomplished with the consent of all shareholders.  Often the changes resulted from \nCuomo’s reducing his ownership interest. \n \n2000 to 2005 \n{20} By January 2000, Sakhrani had left TriboFilm and was working for \nanother company called Premitec, and Defendants Cuomo, Tomasino and Chiklis \nwere not playing an active role in the affairs of the Company.  Vernon was the only \nshareholder still actively engaged with the Company.  Cuomo was also a \nshareholder in Premitec, which was one of his entrepreneurial startup research and \ndevelopment companies.  Like TriboFilm, Premitec used N.C. State faculty and \nstudents.  Premitec was working on implant devices and did not compete with \nTriboFilm.  Cuomo and Sakhrani remained as directors and shareholders of \nTriboFilm. \n \n \n{21} In 2000, Cuomo introduced Williams to Vernon.  Vernon arranged for \nWilliams to begin working as a consultant on an hourly basis for TriboFilm.  A few \nmonths earlier, Cuomo and Sakhrani had arranged for Williams to begin working \nas a consultant for Premitec.  Both companies sought to take advantage of Williams’ \nknowledge in the medical device area and his familiarity with NIH grant processes. \n{22} In connection with the request by Cuomo and Sakhrani that Williams \nserve as a consultant for Premitec, Williams told them that he was doing his own \nresearch and development work following his retirement from Becton Dickinson.  In \nfact, he had his own research and development startup that was working on projects \nthat did not compete with TriboFilm.  Williams operated under the name Brighton \nDevelopment LLC (“Brighton”), which also did work under the name Genomex.  He \napplied for NIH grants under both names.  Vernon helped Williams with the \nBrighton grant applications, so he knew of Williams’ other projects.  Neither Vernon \nnor Williams discussed those projects with anyone else at TriboFilm.  In March and \nJuly of 2002, Williams submitted grant applications on behalf of Brighton for a non-\nstick labware and for a self-sterilizing bag.  The non-stick labware and the self-\nsterilizing bag technologies did not compete with any of TriboFilm’s technologies. \n{23} Williams signed a mutual confidentiality agreement with Premitec on or \nabout June 15, 2000.  Sakhrani signed the mutual confidentiality agreement on \nbehalf of Premitec. \n{24} Williams signed a mutual confidentiality agreement with TriboFilm on \nAugust 15, 2000.  Vernon, acting as President of TriboFilm, signed the mutual \nconfidentiality agreement on behalf of TriboFilm.  Paragraph 8 of the mutual \nconfidentiality agreement stated that the agreement would terminate five (5) years \nfrom the date of the agreement.     \n{25} Williams requested that the confidentiality agreements with Premitec and \nTriboFilm be mutual in part because of the research and development work he was \ndoing on his own.  All parties were content with these confidentiality agreements at \nthe time. \n \n \n{26} Although the parties made much at trial of possible conflicts of interest on \nthe part of others, there was no substantial evidence presented that any conflict of \ninterest arose out of the work being done at Brighton, the work being done at \nPremitec, or the work being done at other companies in which Cuomo was involved.  \nThese were all research scientists who knew full well that the others had projects \nand employment other than TriboFilm.  TriboFilm was not structured to do \nanything other than the specific grant-supported research it was conducting.  No \nparty engaged in any serious conflict of interest or usurped any business \nopportunity belonging to TriboFilm.  \n{27} Later in 2000, TriboFilm obtained a Phase I grant from the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to explore certain medical coating \ntechnologies to replace silicone oil.  In April of 2002, TriboFilm was awarded a \nPhase II grant of $758,000 by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and \nBioengineering (NIBIB) to develop a coating to eliminate silicone oil in medical \nsyringes.  TriboFilm also obtained Phase I and Phase II grants to study lens coating \ntechnology, which led to the development of the Company’s StaClear lens coating \ntechnology.  Vernon carried the administrative burden of preparing the grant \napplications and dealing with the NIH.  The other shareholders gave technical \nassistance. \n{28} After TriboFilm was awarded the grants, all of the Individual Defendants1 \ndeveloped renewed interest in TriboFilm and returned to active participation in the \naffairs of the Company.  Cuomo was designated Chief Technical Officer, and \nSakhrani was elected as Vice President.  Sakhrani returned from Premitec to work \nfull time at TriboFilm.  The grants provided that the researchers could be paid by \nthe hour for their research work. \n{29} Williams’ medical device experience, polymer science expertise, \nbackground in syringe technology, and business contacts in the medical device \nindustry were valuable in the development of technologies at TriboFilm.  With \nnumerous patents on syringe technology, including plasma cross-linking of \n                                                           \n1 The Individual Defendants are Cuomo, Sakhrani, Tomasino, Chiklis, and Mineo. \n \n \nlubricants in syringes, he guided the research at TriboFilm in that area.  Cuomo \nalso contributed his expertise and valuable business contacts to TriboFilm.  \nSakhrani, Tomasino, Chiklis, and Williams all worked on various experiments, with \nSakhrani, Tomasino, and Chiklis doing more research than anyone else.  Vernon \nwas the administrative manager.  There were no employees other than the \nshareholders. \n{30} In discussions with Vernon and Cuomo in mid-2003, Williams promised to \ntake a more active role in TriboFilm and to provide the Company with his expertise \nand knowledge in the syringe technology field, including his expertise and \nknowledge relating to ionizing plasma cross-linking of lubricants in syringes.  In \nexchange for his more active role, Williams was given an ownership interest in \nTriboFilm equal to the percentage held by Vernon, Cuomo and Sakhrani.   \n{31} There was a discussion at that time concerning a twenty-five (25) percent \ncommission on new business brought in by Williams.  These discussions never \nreached a definitive agreement for a number of reasons.  At that time, TriboFilm \nhad only grant money and some minor payments from potential customers for \ntesting TriboFilm’s unproven technology.  It had no patents and no idea what its \nfinal product would be.  The grants did not provide for payment of commissions, and \nthe testing was not really for profit but to promote the development of technology.  \nThe agreement was never reduced to writing and was never approved by the Board \nof Directors.  Until the filing of this lawsuit, Williams never asked for any \ncommissions and none were ever paid to him or any other shareholder.  No product \nwas sold, and only contract work was performed.  In March 2004, Williams was \nissued TriboFilm stock that gave him a twenty (20) percent interest in TriboFilm, \nequal to that of Vernon, Cuomo and Sakhrani.  He did not pay anything for his \nstock.  Prior to the issuance of the stock, Williams provided consulting services and \nhelped develop business for TriboFilm, services for which he was not compensated.  \nHe was, however, compensated on an hourly basis for research done under the \nTriboGlide grant proposals. \n \n \n{32} None of the Individual Defendants or any other representative of \nTriboFilm asked Williams to discontinue his other work (such as his ongoing work \nat Brighton) when he became a consultant to TriboFilm, or later, when he became a \nshareholder.  Williams knew that they too had other business interests. \n{33}   Each of the shareholders, including Individual Plaintiffs,2 undertook the \nperformance of his duties at TriboFilm with the reasonable expectation that each \nwould share in the potential gain if one or more of the Company’s technologies \nproved commercially viable. \n{34}  By spring 2005, under the direction of Vernon, TriboFilm had significant \ngrants to work on promising technologies, including StaClear and TriboGlide. \n{35} Based on the work performed by Williams and the other scientists, the \nsyringe coating technology attracted significant interest from private firms \ninterested in acquiring or obtaining the right to apply and market the technology. \n{36} To aid in the commercialization of the plasma cross-linked lubricant \ntechnology, TriboFilm obtained a Phase II-Continuation Grant for $687,000 to \nreceive FDA regulatory approval.   Williams and Vernon contributed to the effort to \nobtain that grant.  During the interim proposal review period, both Williams and \nVernon, along with other TriboFilm shareholders, personally financed TriboFilm by \nlending it money while waiting for NIH grant funding.   \n{37} In 2005, Williams and Vernon successfully negotiated a license agreement \nfor plasma cross-linked syringe lubricant technology with a German company.  The \nGerman company was one of the largest pre-filled syringe companies in the world.  \nSubsequently, TriboFilm declined to go forward with that agreement.  Williams \ncontributed to the procurement of the agreement, and Vernon worked on the \nadministrative effort.   \n{38} Up until this point, this small band of researchers maintained productive \nworking relationships.  While there were some personality conflicts between Vernon \nand Sakhrani—Sakhrani was unhappy that he was not getting the full salary \nauthorized by the grants—no serious prob lem had arisen.  TriboFilm had a mutual \n                                                           \n2 Individual Plaintiffs are Vernon and Williams. \n \n \nnondisclosure agreement with Williams, but it had no other agreements with \nshareholders about disclosure or use of TriboFilm technology.  All the shareholders, \nhowever, owed fiduciary duties to the Company.  At this point, no patents had been \nissued.  \n \nThe Shareholders Divide into Two Camps \n{39} In the spring 2005, communication between the shareholders broke down, \nand they began to split into two (2) camps—Vernon and Williams on one side and \nthe remaining shareholders on the opposite side.  What followed was a classic \nexample of the loss of trust resulting from a failure to communicate. \n{40} In April 2005, Sakhrani delivered confidential documents belonging to \nWilliams to Vernon and demanded an explanation.  The confidential documents \nrelated to Williams’ 2002 grant applications on behalf of Brighton, not work related \nto TriboFilm.  Williams believed Sakhrani could only have gotten the documents by \nsearching Williams’ briefcase.  Sakhrani said, however, that he got the documents \nfrom a trash bin or places where they were openly laying around.  The documents \nshowed that Vernon had helped Williams with the Brighton grant applications. \n{41} Despite Williams’ and Vernon’s multiple requests that Sakhrani return \nWilliams’ confidential documents, Sakhrani did not return all of the confidential \ndocuments until after Williams filed a lawsuit against Sakhrani in September 2005 \nseeking return of the confidential documents.  Sakhrani consulted with other \nIndividual Defendants regarding Williams’ confidential documents.  None of the \nother Individual Defendants looked at the documents because they believed them to \nbe confidential.  The other Individual Defendants did not, however, require \nSakhrani to return the confidential documents to Williams. \n{42} During this same period, Sakhrani and Vernon were having a \ndisagreement over Sakhrani’s compensation. \n{43} In or about September 2005, Individual Defendants presented Williams \nand Vernon with non-compete and non-disclosure agreements.  The agreements \nwere drafted by Mineo using agreements prepared by an outside law firm as \n \n \ntemplates.  Mineo, as directed by a majority of the directors, added a provision to \nthe non-compete agreement making it retroactive in application.  In addition, the \nnon-compete agreement did not call for any consideration other than continued \nemployment.  Vernon, in his capacity as President of TriboFilm, contracted with an \noutside law firm to prepare employment agreements as an alternative to those \nprepared by Mineo.  The Board of Directors, however, cancelled the contract with \nthe outside law firm and set October 3, 2005 as the deadline for executing the \nagreements created by Mineo.  The non-disclosure agreement created by Mineo was \nnot to be mutually binding on TriboFilm.  Furthermore, the non-compete and non-\ndisclosure agreements did not contemplate that anyone would execute the \nagreements on behalf of TriboFilm. \n{44} The Individual Defendants’ request that Plaintiffs sign the retroactive \nnon-compete agreement was motivated by Williams’ work at Brighton that had pre-\ndated Williams becoming a shareholder in TriboFilm.  Williams was reasonably \nconcerned that the retroactive provision in the non-compete would expose him to \nlitigation regarding his pre-existing Brighton work, which did not conflict with the \nwork at TriboFilm.  Since Vernon had helped with the Brighton grant applications, \nhe was also concerned about the retroactive application of the proffered agreements. \n{45} Individual Defendants Cuomo, Sakhrani, Tomasino and Chiklis signed the \ntendered agreements with some minor modifications, but without change to the \nprovisions relating to consideration and retroactivity.  Individual Plaintiffs declined \nto sign the agreements as tendered.  The whole process was characterized by a \nfailure of the parties to communicate and adequately express their concerns.  The \nprocess, which could have eliminated some of the lack of trust, contributed to a \nfurther erosion of the relationship among the shareholders.   \n{46} At that time, Williams already had an existing employment agreement and \nmutual confidentiality agreement in place with TriboFilm—signed by Vernon in his \ncapacity as president and by Williams—whi ch the Board of Directors could have \nratified had it chosen to do so.  Except for the retroactive provisions, the terms of \nthe proposed agreement were not unreasonable. \n \n \n{47} Under all of the circumstances, Vernon’s and Williams’ decisions not to \nsign the retroactive non-competition agreement were reasonable.  All shareholders \nhad the right, however, to propose alternative provisions.  Some shareholders did \npropose revisions, and their changes were accepted.  Williams and Vernon did not \ncommunicate their problems in a way that the Company could address them.  Nor \ndid the Company make a great effort to solve the problem.  Each side foolishly \nadopted a “my way or the highway” approach, and the failure to communicate \nresulted in a further deterioration of trust among the parties.  The issues of \nlanguage, compensation, and retroactivity were not unsolvable.  They required \ncandid communication.  The shareholders had clearly separated into factions that \ndid not trust each other.  The lack of trust resulted from a number of factors, \nincluding: the personality problems between Vernon and Sakhrani, Sakhrani’s \nmishandling of what he mistakenly believed was a conflict of interest, Vernon’s \nfailure to disclose he had assisted Williams with the Brighton grants, all parties’ \nfailure to openly discuss what else they were doing, Sakhrani’s failure to return all \nof Williams’ confidential documents and the copies, the parties’ failure to sit down \nand discuss resolution of their differences, the differences of opinion over the \nGerman agreement, and the parties’ failure to agree on creation of an affiliated \ncompany to manufacture syringes using TriboFilm’s technology (“Jetcon”).  \nWilliams and Vernon had supported creation of Jetcon, and the Individual \nDefendants had opposed it. \n{48} In the midst of all the turmoil, the Board of Directors created an Executive \nCommittee in an effort to get control of the situation.  Cuomo and Tomasino were \nnamed to the Executive Committee.  They met with Vernon on several occasions, \nbut they were unable to obtain from him information to assess the condition of the \nCompany or information to assess his performance as President.   \n{49} To exacerbate the situation, Vernon conducted an employee evaluation of \nSakhrani without consulting with the other shareholders with whom Sakhrani \nworked.  The evaluation was Vernon’s personal assessment of Sakhrani, and it did \nnot accurately reflect the views of the other shareholders.  It was critical of \n \n \nSakhrani on points unsupported by Sakhrani’s fellow workers.  This action caused a \nfurther deterioration in the working relationships among the small group of \nshareholders. \n{50} The situation with respect to Vernon’s and Williams’ continued \nemployment was further complicated by the post-termination conduct of Vernon \nand Williams.  Vernon conducted a personal vendetta against Cuomo.  Vernon \nwrote to the university where Cuomo had received his doctorate and accused him of \nplagiarizing his thesis.  Vernon then wrote to N.C. State and made demands for \nextensive documents relating to Cuomo’s relationship with the University.  In a \nfurther effort to cause problems for Cuomo, Vernon also wrote to the Golden Leaf \nFoundation.  Vernon’s unjustifiable, spiteful actions were harmful to Cuomo and \ncreated an intolerable relationship between the two. \n{51} After his termination, Williams attempted to obtain the trademark rights \nto TriboGlide and StaClear.  His justification was to protect the names from loss \nsince TriboFilm had not applied for protection.  Williams could have achieved the \nsame result by demanding that TriboFilm take action to protect its trade names.  \nHis actions clearly diminished any remaining trust among the parties. \n{52} By their own conduct, Vernon and Williams made their continued \nemployment at TriboFilm unrealistic, and ultimately justifying the Board of \nDirectors’ action in preventing them from working at TriboFilm. \n{53} On November 3, 2005, acting on a Notice of Meeting sent on November 1, \n2005, the Board of Directors held a special meeting where a majority of the directors \n(such majority consisted solely of the Individual Defendants) placed Vernon and \nWilliams on administrative leave, changed the Company’s locks, and barred them \nfrom the building.   \n{54} The Board of Directors held another special meeting on November 14, \n2005, during which the directors voted to remove Vernon and Williams as officers of \nTriboFilm and terminated their employment.  This meeting was immediately \nfollowed by a special meeting of the shareholders.  At the shareholders meeting, a \nmajority of the issued and outstanding shares of TriboFilm (such majority consisted \n \n \nsolely of the Individual Defendants) voted to remove Vernon and Williams from the \nBoard of Directors. \n{55} As a result of the November 2005 meetings, Vernon and Williams were \neffectively divested of any and all management and control over TriboFilm’s \noperations.  \n{56} In early March 2006, the Individual Defendants attempted to acquire all of \nPlaintiffs’ TriboFilm stock for $2,000.00 each ($0.01 per share).  Having been \nexcluded from the business, Plaintiffs were in no position to evaluate the offer.  \n{57} Later in March 2006, Vernon and Williams made a counteroffer to \npurchase all of Defendants’ TriboFilm stock for $0.10 per share, ten (10) times the \namount offered for Plaintiffs’ shares.  Each Defendant rejected Plaintiffs’ \ncounteroffer.  Sakhrani testified that he would not have accepted a billion dollars \nfor his shares.  Tomasino testified that the opportunity to do the research and \ndevelopment on TriboFilm’s technologies was more valuable to him than selling his \nstock for $0.10 per share and that it was his belief that the other Individual \nDefendants felt the same way. \n{58} On or about June 7, 2006, shortly after the unsuccessful attempt to acquire \nPlaintiffs’ interests in TriboFilm, the Individual Defendants voted themselves \nannual salaries or, in Sakhrani’s case, a substantial salary increase, despite the fact \nthat none of them other than Sakhrani had ever been a salaried employee of the \nCompany.  TriboFilm had never had the resources necessary to pay salaries at the \nlevel the Individual Defendants approved for themselves.  Also, on or about June, 7, \n2006, the Individual Defendants, citing TriboFilm’s dire financial condition, voted to \n“defer” portions of the increased salaries. \n{59} The increased salaries were not necessary to keep the Individual \nDefendants working at TriboFilm, as each of them had non-monetary incentives to \ncontinue working, including the benefits that they would receive from completing \nthe grants and by virtue of their already existing stock ownership.  Further, neither \nthe manner in which the salaries were determined nor the expert testimony offered \nto support the salaries took into account the financial condition of the Company, the \n \n \nfact that the “officers” were not supervising anyone other than themselves, or the \nnature of the work being done.  Both Mineo and the Defendants’ expert simply used \nthe Individual Defendants’ employment titles to compare salaries within the \nindustry without truly analyzing the real work situation, the Company’s ability to \npay, and the startup nature of the venture.  The salaries were unrealistic and \ninflated given TriboFilm’s lack of funding, and they support a finding that the \nmajority shareholders were not conducting the business affairs of the Company in \nthe best interests of all the shareholders. \n{60} The Individual Defendants did not disclose to Plaintiffs the salary \nincreases or the vote to defer the increased salaries. \n{61} On or about December 11, 2006, the Individual Defendants, acting as the \nonly members of the Board of Directors, and without disclosure to Plaintiffs, voted \nto convert $15,000.00 of deferred salary into TriboFilm stock at a rate of $0.01 per \nshare.  That price per share was one-tenth of the price per share of Plaintiffs’ arms-\nlength offer in March 2006, an offer the Individual Defendants themselves had \nrejected.  In addition, the Individual Defendants gave themselves dollar-for-dollar \ncredit for the deferred salary even though the deferred salary had little to no actual \nmonetary value.  The Individual Defendants were the only persons that would \nbenefit from this transaction. \n{62} On or about December 21, 2006, the Individual Defendants, acting as the \nonly members of the Board of Directors, recommended to the shareholders that they \napprove an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation increasing the number of \nauthorized shares of TriboFilm stock from one (1) million to fifteen (15) million \nshares.  The stated purpose of the additional shares was to raise additional capital \nand pay certain obligations of the Company.  The resolution adopting the \nrecommendation did not disclose the Individual Directors’ plan to each exchange \n$15,000.00 of deferred salary for a portion of the newly authorized stock. \n{63}  On December 22, 2006, the Individual Defendants, acting as the only \nmembers of the Board of Directors, issued a notice of special shareholders meeting \nto vote on the amendment of TriboFilm’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the \n \n \nCompany’s authorized issue to fifteen (15) million shares.  The meeting notice \ndisclosed neither the reason for the request to increase the authorized shares, nor \nthe Individual Defendants’ plan to exchange $15,000.00 of deferred salary for a \nportion of the newly issued stock. \n{64} At the special shareholders meeting on January 5, 2007, the Individual \nDefendants voted over Williams’ and Vernon’s objection to approve the amendment \nof TriboFilm’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares \nto fifteen (15) million.  There was no discussion about, or disclosure of, the \nIndividual Defendants’ intent to exchange a portion of the deferred salary for a \nportion of the newly issued stock.  At the meeting, the Individual Defendants \noffered no reason for the increase in the authorized issue other than to benefit the \nCompany.   \n{65} On January 26, 2007, without disclosure to Plaintiffs, the Individual \nDefendants each transferred to themselves 1,500,000 shares of the newly \nauthorized TriboFilm stock in exchange for the forgiveness of $15,000.00 of deferred \nsalary.  The transfer reduced Plaintiffs’ percentage of the issued and outstanding \nstock of the Company from 20.2% each to 2.4% each.  The transfer of stock to the \nIndividual Defendants substantially diluted the percentage interests of Vernon and \nWilliams in TriboFilm relative to the percentage interests of the Individual \nDefendants.  The practical effect of the Individual Defendants’ actions was to obtain \na substantial part of Plaintiffs’ interest in TriboFilm, an interest that the Individual \nDefendants had been unsuccessful in purchasing only nine (9) months earlier. \n{66} At the time of the conversion of deferred salary for additional stock, the \nIndividual Defendants’ deferred salary had almost no value.  Plaintiffs were not \nprovided an opportunity to purchase any of the newly authorized TriboFilm stock.  \nWilliams requested in writing that he be issued shares of the newly authorized \nTriboFilm stock to maintain his equal percentage ownership with Cuomo and \nSakhrani, but Williams never received a response to that request. \n{67} Plaintiffs did not participate in the unreasonable salary increases and the \nresultant award of stock as payments for those increases.  No one voted for the \n \n \nsalary increases that did not benefit from the vote in favor of the salary increases.  \nOnly the Individual Defendants were permitted to vote on the resolution approving \nthe new salary structure, the resolution proposing the increase in the authorized \nissue of the Company, and the resolution converting a portion of their deferred \nsalaries into stock.  The Individual Defendants were interested parties in each of \nthese transactions since they were the only parties to benefit from the actions taken \nby the Board of Directors.  \n{68} The Individual Defendants failed to establish the reasonableness of the \ndeferred salaries and the reasonableness of the exchange of the deferred salaries for \nadditional stock.  This is especially true in light of the facts that the deferred \nsalaries had little to no actual value and the exchange was done at one-tenth of the \nmost recent arms-length offer for the stock. \n{69} The stock exchange for deferred salary was not necessary to keep the \nIndividual Defendants working at TriboFilm.  Each of them had non-monetary \nincentives to continue working, particularly to get the patents issued. \n{70} The undisclosed actions of the Individual Defendants—in unreasonably \nincreasing their salaries, deferring the salaries, and subsequently exchanging a \nportion of the deferred salaries for newly issued stock—were self-dealing.  The \nIndividual Defendants’ intended effect was to acquire Plaintiffs’ interests in \nTriboFilm by substantially diluting their ownership interests.  All of the \nshareholders had worked in this startup venture with the reasonable understanding \nthat the ultimate benefit from their efforts would come from their stock ownership.  \nWere the Court to sanction the Individual Defendants’ action in diluting Williams’ \nand Vernon’s ownership interests, there would be no impediment to the Individual \nDefendants issuing more stock for debt and virtually eliminating any minority \nownership. \n{71} By letters dated November 8, 2005 and January 10, 2006, Plaintiffs served \nTriboFilm and its directors with demands to take corrective actions as required by \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-7-42.  Defendants did not take the corrective action demanded \nby Plaintiffs within the time allowed by the statute or, indeed, within any time. \n \n \n{72} Vernon and Williams had reasonable expectations that their ownership \npercentage in TriboFilm in relation to the Individual Defendants’ ownership \npercentage would not be changed without their consent.  While the Bylaws and \nArticles of Incorporation did not prevent dilution, and startup companies often have \nto issue new stock to angel investors, Vernon and Williams could and did have a \nreasonable expectation that the majority shareholders would not dilute their \nownership purely to benefit other shareholders.   \n{73} Williams had an expectation that he would maintain an ownership \ninterest in TriboFilm equal to the ownership interests of Vernon, Cuomo and \nSakhrani. \n{74} Individual Plaintiffs’ expectations with respect to their ownership were \neither known to or assumed by the other shareholders, officers, and directors of \nTriboFilm. \n{75} Individual Plaintiffs’ expectations with respect to their ownership, through \nno material fault of their own, were frustrated by the Individual Defendants. \n{76} The Individual Defendants terminated Vernon and Williams from their \nemployment with TriboFilm and divested them of their management and \noperational duties.  Individual Defendants were justified in doing so based on the \ndysfunctional status of the Company.  Reinstatement would not be in the best \ninterest of the Company given the post-termination actions of Vernon and Williams \nand the disruption to the ongoing operation which would occur.  Individual \nDefendants were not justified, however, in diluting Vernon’s and Williams’ \nownership of TriboFilm. \n{77} Individual Plaintiffs have been excluded from the future financial benefits \nof their original ownership if TriboFilm’s technologies become successful.  Those \nfinancial benefits may be substantial. \n \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \nBased upon the foregoing Findings of Fact, this Court concludes as follows: \n{78} While shareholders may hold reasonable expectations as a result of their \n \n \nownership of a small, closely held company, those expectations may be subverted to \nthe overall business interest of the company or may become unsustainable under \ncertain circumstances.  At the outset of their involvement, Vernon and Williams had \na reasonable expectation that they would continue to work with TriboFilm.  That \nexpectation ceased to be reasonable when the Company and the relationships \namong the shareholders became dysfunctional.  It is undisputed on this record that \nby fall 2005, all trust among the parties had disappeared.  The Company could not \noperate and fulfill its function.  There was no communication or cooperation among \nthe small group of researchers who were required to work closely together.  A \ncompany is not required to fulfill once-reasonable expectations of continued \nemployment where that employment may be detrimental to the ongoing survival of \nthe business.  Something had to be done to keep the Company alive and functioning.  \nA majority of shareholders agreed on how to accomplish that goal.  The majority \nwas within its rights to terminate the employment of Vernon and Williams, and it \ndid not breach a fiduciary duty by doing so under the circumstances that existed in \nthis case.  Termination of employment does not automatically trigger a right to \ndissolution or valuation under the statute.  \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30.  Under \nsome circumstances, however, it may support a finding that dissolution was \nnecessary in order to protect the interests of all shareholders.  Here, the \nterminations standing alone would not result in a forced dissolution because the \ncontentious circumstances required some action and Individual Plaintiffs were not \nwithout fault in creating the contentious circumstances.  \n{79} Directors are fiduciaries, and they may not use their position of trust to \nfurther their own private interest.  See Meiselman v. Meiselman, 309 N.C. 279, 308, \n307 S.E.2d 551, 568 (1983).  To do so is a breach of the duty of loyalty.  See id.   \n{80} The series of transactions by which the Individual Defendants diluted the \nownership of Williams and Vernon were transactions in which they had a direct \nfinancial interest.  Consequently, the Individual Defendants were self-dealing.   \n{81} The Individual Defendants are not entitled to the protection of N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 55-8-31(a), which provides:   \n \n \nA conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation \nin which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest.  \nA conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the corporation \nsolely because of the director’s interest in the transaction if any one of \nthe following is true:  \n   \n(1) The material facts of the transaction and the director’s \ninterest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a \ncommittee of the board of directors and the board of directors or \ncommittee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction;  \n \n(2) The material facts of the transaction and the director’s \ninterest were disclosed or known to the shareholders entitled to \nvote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction; \nor  \n \n(3) The transaction was fair to the corporation. \n \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-8-31(a). \n{82} Here, none of the transactions were authorized, ratified, or approved by a \nmajority of disinterested directors.  The material facts were not disclosed to the \nshareholders; rather, they were deliberately hidden from the minority shareholders.  \nThe transaction was not fair to the corporation.  The directors clearly received a \npersonal financial benefit from the transactions they approved.  Thus, they are not \nentitled to the benefit of the business judgment rule.  See Brehm v. Eisner, 746 A.2d \n244, 264 n.66 (Del. 2000) (stating that “directors’ decisions will be respected by \ncourts unless the directors are interested or lack independence relative to the \ndecision . . . .”); see also In re Brokers, Inc., 363 B.R. 458, 474 (2007); see, e.g., Weiss \nv. Temporary Inv. Fund, Inc., 692 F.2d 928, 947 (3d Cir. 1982), vacated and \nremanded on other grounds, 465 U.S. 1001, 104 S. Ct. 989 (1984) (“Of course, the \nbusiness judgment rule is inapplicable . . . when the directors’ judgment . . . is the \nproduct of self-dealing . . . .”); Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880, 886 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. \ndenied, 460 U.S. 1051, 103 S. Ct. 1498 (1983) (“[The business judgment rule] does \nnot apply in cases . . . tainted by a conflict of interest . . . .”); In re Fleming \nPackaging Corp., 351 B.R. 626, 634 (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 2006) (“The protection . . . \nafforded by the business judgment rule does not apply where the plaintiff has made \n \n \nan adequate showing that the directors breached their duty of loyalty . . . by having \n. . . engaged in self-dealing . . . .”); In re Sheffield Steel Corp., 320 B.R. 405, 422 \n(Bankr. N.D. Okla. 2004) (“[A]llegations of self-dealing disrupt the usual \npresumption that directors have acted with reasonable business judgment.”); \nBehradrezaee v. Dashtara, 910 A.2d 349, 363 (D.C. 2006) (finding that protections \nof the business judgment rule are only available to disinterested directors whose \nconduct otherwise meets the tests of business judgment). \n{83} Individual Defendants have breached their fiduciary duties to TriboFilm \nand to minority shareholders Vernon and Williams.  Furthermore, Individual \nDefendants have frustrated the reasonable expectations of Vernon and Williams in \nthe following ways: \na. by awarding themselves unreasonable and improperly high \nsalaries, without disclosure, knowing that the then current revenues of \nTriboFilm would not cover such salaries;  \nb. by deferring the unreasonably high salaries, without disclosure \nto Vernon or Williams, causing TriboFilm to incur substantial \nadditional debt; \nc. by recommending that TriboFilm increase the number of \nauthorized shares to fifteen (15) million without disclosing to Vernon or \nWilliams the reasons for increasing the number of shares; \nd. by voting as majority shareholders to increase the number of \nauthorized shares to fifteen (15) million without disclosing to Vernon or \nWilliams the reasons for increasing the number of shares; \ne. by each exchanging, without disclosure to Vernon or Williams, \n$15,000.00 of their deferred salary claims for TriboFilm stock at $0.01 \nper share (which was ten (10) times less than the most recent arms-\nlength offer from Individual Plaintiffs nine (9) months earlier) at a time \nwhen the market value of their claims for deferred salary was at or near \nzero (0) in an attempt to acquire Williams’ and Vernon’s interests in \nTriboFilm without paying valuable consideration; \n \n \nf. by diluting, without disclosure or consent, Williams’ equal \nownership interest in TriboFilm relative to the ownership interests of \nthe Individual Defendants; \ng. by diluting, without disclosure or consent, Vernon’s equal \nownership interest in TriboFilm relative to the ownership interests of \nthe Individual Defendants; \nh. by continually failing to disclose material facts relating to the \nacquisition of Individual Plaintiffs’ interests in TriboFilm by the \ndilution of their ownership interests; and \ni. by failing to act openly, honestly, and fairly in corporate \ngovernance matters and procedures. \n{84} The above described actions constitute self-dealing by the Individual \nDefendants as directors, officers, and majority shareholders of TriboFilm.  As such, \nthe burden of proof was on the Individual Defendants to prove that the self-dealing \ntransactions were fair, just, and reasonable.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-8-31(a)-(d); \nAlford v. Shaw, 320 N.C. 465, 472−73, 358 S.E.2d 323, 327−28 (1987); Lowder v. \nAllstar Mills, Inc., 103 N.C. App. 479, 482, 405 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1991).  The \nIndividual Defendants did not meet this burden.  \n{85} The exchange of worthless or discounted debt for more than one-third \nownership in the Company is not fair to the Company or the shareholders.  The fact \nthat the individuals who benefited from the debt-for-stock exchange created the \ndebt at a time when the Company was financially strapped and unable to pay the \ndebt clearly indicates that a primary purpose was to dilute Vernon’s and Williams’ \nownership.  Individual Defendants’ other explanations of why they created the debt \nare unconvincing.  The secretive manner in which the manipulation occurred is \nfurther evidence of bad motive, and the manner in which the allocation occurred \ndemonstrates that the majority shareholders had their personal interests in mind \nwhen they acted.  \n{86} Individual Defendants had options in 2006 if they did not wish to work for \nTriboFilm under circumstances in which Vernon and Williams owned forty (40) \n \n \npercent of the Company.  They could have easily engineered a squeeze-out merger \nthat would have resulted in Vernon’s and Williams’ shares being subject to \nappraisal based on their value at that time.  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-13-02(a)(1).  \nThey did not do so.  Rather, they gambled that they could virtually eliminate \nVernon’s and Williams’ ownership by their manipulation of both compensation and \ndebt.  If they were successful, they stood to receive a far greater percentage of the \nultimate value of TriboFilm.  If they were unsuccessful, they would be in the same \nposition they were in before because, if the Court ordered dissolution pursuant to \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30(2)(ii), the Company could elect to have the Vernon and \nWilliams shares valued under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-31(d), and the Company could \npurchase the shares at the valued amount.  The only costs associated with their \ndilution efforts were legal fees and the possibility that the value of the Company \nhad increased. \n{87} Williams failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a contract for \ncommissions owed. \n{88} The Individual Defendants’ salary increases were unreasonable under the \ncircumstances in which they were implemented and for the purposes for which they \nwere ultimately used. \n{89} Equity requires that the issuance of additional shares to the Individual \nDefendants be rescinded and Vernon and Williams be restored to their previous \n20.2 ownership percentage. \n{90} The Court concludes that the circumstances existing at the time of \nVernon’s and Williams’ termination do not support dissolution under the peculiar \nfacts of this case.   \n{91} The Court concludes that the attempted dilution of the minority ownership \nwas a breach of a fiduciary duty supporting invocation of the statutory procedure for \ndissolution of the Company and, if necessary, valuation of Vernon’s and Williams’ \nshares.  \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30(2)(ii); see also N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-31(d); \nRoyals v. Piedmont Elec. Repair Co., 1999 NCBC 1, ¶¶ 38-63 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. \n3, 1999), http://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/1999%20NCBC%201.htm \n \n \n(detailing the analysis for liquidation and valuation based on N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-\n14-30(2)(ii) and N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-14-30(d)).  While the Court recognized the need \nto cure the dysfunctional state in which the Company found itself, the fact that the \nmajority shareholders, after having terminated the minority shareholders, would \nthen attempt to dilute the minority shareholders’ ownership in so significant a way \nand with no other significant benefit other than to increase their own ownership \ndemonstrates that the majority is not operating, and will not operate, the Company \nin the best interest of all the shareholders.  \n{92} There was insufficient evidence to support Plaintiffs’ claims that \nIndividual Defendants mismanaged TriboFilm’s grants or its business.  To the \ncontrary, TriboFilm stands on the verge of commercial success. \n{93} The Court has directed a verdict on Plaintiffs’ claims for diversion of \ncorporate opportunity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n{94} Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and \nDECREED: \n1. The shares issued to the Individual Defendants for debt shall be \nreturned to TriboFilm. \n2. The Court sets aside the dilution of Vernon’s stock and \nreinstates him to his 20.2 ownership percentage. \n3. The Court sets aside the dilution of Williams’ stock and \nreinstates him to his 20.2 ownership percentage. \n4. The Company shall be dissolved pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § \n55-14-30(2)(ii). \n5. TriboFilm shall have ten (10) days from the date of this Order to \nnotify the Court of its election to purchase the shares of Vernon \nand Williams at fair value.  If it so elects, the parties will have \nthirty (30) days from the date of this Order to agree upon a \nCourt appointed valuation expert and the terms of his \nengagement.  Absent agreement, the parties will have (90) days \nfrom the date of this order to complete discovery on valuation \nissues. \n6. The Court will specify the procedure to determine fair value. \n7. In the event TriboFilm elects not to pursue purchase of the \nVernon and Williams shares, the parties will have thirty (30) \ndays from the date of this Order to submit recommendations for \na receiver to liquidate the company. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 17th day of March, 2009. \n       \n \n "
