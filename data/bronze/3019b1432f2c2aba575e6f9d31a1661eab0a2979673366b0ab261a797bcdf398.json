Rowe \nfor Defendant Wells Fargo & Company. \n \nDiaz, Judge. \n{1} Plaintiff has filed a purported class action on behalf of himself and all \nother public shareholders of Defendant Wachovia Corporation (“Wachovia” or the \n“Company”). \n{2} Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges that Wachovia and its board of directors \n(every member of which is named as a defendant in the action) breached their \nfiduciary duties toward the public shareholders in connection with a proposed \nmerger between the Company and Defendant Wells Fargo & Company (“Wells \nFargo”). \n{3} Plaintiff’s Complaint seeks injunctive relief or, in the alternative, \nrescission of the merger, if consummated, and money damages. \n{4} The Court has before it (1) Plaintiff’s Amended Motion for Expedited \nProceedings, and (2) Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.1 \n{5} Plaintiff has moved to enjoin the merger2 and requests that the Court \nexpedite discovery and set a hearing on his motion for preliminary injunction in \nadvance of the merger closing date.\n3 \n{6} Pursuant to Business Court Rule 15.4, the Court rules on the request for \nexpedited proceedings without a hearing. \n{7} After considering the Court file, the Motions, and the briefs of the parties, \nthe Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for expedited discovery but GRANTS his \nmotion for expedited resolution of his prayer for preliminary injunctive relief, which \nwill proceed on the schedule set forth below.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The parties have submitted briefs in connection with Plaintiff’s Amended Motion for Expedited \nProceedings, but they have filed no briefs related to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  All \nreferences made in this Order to the parties’ briefs, therefore, refer to the briefs filed in connection \nwith the former Motion. \n2 Plaintiff asserts in his reply brief that he only seeks to enjoin certain terms of the Wells Fargo \nmerger that purportedly violate the Wachovia shareholders’ rights to freely and independently vote \nas to approval of the merger.  (Reply Br. 12.)  \n3 While no date has been set for a shareholder vote on the merger, Defendants anticipate that it will \nbe held sometime in December 2008 to permit the merger to close before year-end.  (Resp. Br. 7.)  \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nA. \nINTRODUCTION  \n{8} For several months, this nation has been engulfed by a financial storm the \nlikes of which have not been seen since the Great Depression.  Venerable financial \ninstitutions thought to be permanent pillars of both Wall Street and Main Street \nhave been sold at the equivalent of a federal fire sale, nationalized, or put into \nbankruptcy or receivership. \n{9} Wachovia’s downfall has been particularly dramatic, accelerated by \nmarket concerns regarding the Company’s deteriorating real estate mortgage \nportfolio, which, when combined with the maelstrom affecting world financial \nmarkets, caused an extended run on the Company’s bank deposits.  (Green Aff., Ex. \nA.)   \n{10} The death knell for Wachovia began sounding on 25 September 2008 \nfollowing two stunning events:  (1) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s \nseizure of the banking assets of Washington Mutual—by far the biggest bank \nfailure in U.S. history; and (2) the U.S. House of Representative’s rejection of the \ninitial “bailout” plan proposed by the United States Treasury for the nation’s \nfinancial system.  (Merritt Aff., Ex. 1, Steel Aff. ¶ 3.) \n{11} Facing significant downward market pressure on the Company’s share \nprice following these events,4 Wachovia’s senior management began vetting merger \nsuitors.  (Merritt Aff., Ex. 1, Steel Aff. ¶¶ 3–4.) \n{12} Wells Fargo and Citigroup, Inc. (“Citgroup”) quickly emerged as potential \nmerger partners. \n                                                 \n4 On 29 September 2008, Wachovia’s share price closed at $1.84, down over 90% from its $18.75 \nclosing price ten days earlier.  (Merritt Aff., Ex. 3.) \n \n{13} On 29 September 2008, Citigroup and Wachovia signed what the Company \ncharacterizes as a non-binding agreement pursuant to which Citigroup was to \nacquire Wachovia’s banking subsidiaries.   \n{14} On 2 October 2008, Wells Fargo tendered a competing merger proposal to \nacquire all of Wachovia’s assets.   \n{15} On 3 October 2008, after being advised by Robert Steel (Wachovia’s CEO \nand President) and the Company’s outside advisors that the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) was prepared to place Wachovia into \nreceivership if a merger did not materialize with either Citigroup or Wells Fargo, \nWachovia’s board approved the Wells Fargo proposal.  (Merritt. Aff., Ex. 1, Steel \nAff. ¶ 19.) \n{16} The proposed merger with Wells Fargo (the “Merger Agreement”) is a \nstock-for-stock transaction that would result in Wachovia’s shareholders receiving \n0.1991 shares of Wells Fargo common stock for each share of Wachovia common \nstock they own, valued at just under $7.00 per Wachovia share.  (Merritt Aff, Ex. 1, \nSteel Aff. ¶ 18.) \n{17} In conjunction with the Merger Agreement, Wachovia and Wells Fargo \nalso executed a separate share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange”), \npursuant to which Wells Fargo acquired newly issued Wachovia preferred stock \nrepresenting approximately 39.9% of the Company’s aggregate voting rights.  \n(Green Aff., Ex. E.)5 \n{18} The Merger Agreement does not allow Wachovia’s board to withdraw from \nthe proposed Wells Fargo transaction should a third party offer a higher bid; in such \na case, the board’s sole option is to submit the Merger Agreement to the  \nshareholders without recommendation, although it may communicate the basis for \nits lack of a recommendation.  (Merritt Aff., Ex. C to Ex. 1, §§ 6.3 and 6.8.)     \n                                                 \n5 Plaintiff also alleges that members of the Wachovia board own approximately 2.5% of all \noutstanding shares, which (according to Plaintiff) means that Wells Fargo has “locked up” 42% of the \nshares in favor of the Merger Agreement.  (Opening Br. 5.)  \n{19} On 12 October 2008, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem (the “Fed Board”) approved the Merger Agreement.  (Merritt Aff., Ex. 7.) \n{20} The Fed Board acted quickly, noting that “the unusual and exigent \ncircumstances affecting the financial markets[ and] the weakened financial \ncondition of Wachovia . . . justified expeditious action on [the Merger Agreement].”  \n(Merritt Aff., Ex. 7.) \n{21} The Fed Board also approved the Merger Agreement knowing full well that \nWachovia’s board had ceded substantial voting rights to Wells Fargo as part of the \nmerger consideration.6   \nB. \nCONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES \n{22} Plaintiff contends Defendants have engaged in “an unlawful scheme and \nplan to enable [Wells Fargo] to acquire Wachovia for inadequate consideration and \nin breach of the individual defendants’ fiduciary duties.”  (Opening Br. 2.) \n{23} According to Plaintiff,  \nWachovia’s Board negotiated a Merger Agreement with, among other \nthings, an inadequate “fiduciary out” clause, a draconian and unlawful \nShare Exchange [that circumvents th e voting process and renders the \nvote on the Merger essentially meaningless], 7 and at an inadequate \nexchange ratio for Wachovia shar eholders, all at the same time \nassuring that Wachovia’s senior executives would receive lucrative \n“golden parachutes,” whether or not they continued to work for Wells \nFargo.   \n \n(Opening Br. 4–5.)8  \n                                                 \n6 The Fed Board also provided notice of the Merger Agreement to the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Department of Justice, all of which advised the \nFed Board they had no objection to its approval.  (Merritt Aff., Ex. 7.) \n7 Plaintiff also contends the Share Exchange is unenforceable under section 126(c) of the Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”).  The portion of the EESA relied on by Plaintiff, \nhowever, provides that any agreement that “directly or indirectly . . . affects, restricts, or limits the \nability of any person to offer or acquire . . . all or part of any insured depository institution” shall be \nunenforceable against an acquirer.  (Opening Br. 6.)  Defendants assert in their brief in opposition \nthat Wells Fargo is the only acquirer on the horizon (Resp. Br. 5), and it obviously has no interest in \nhaving the Share Exchange declared unenforceable.\n     \n8 Defendants dispute that the Merger Agreement is tainted by a conflict of interest.  There is no \ndispute, however, that three members of the current Wachovia board will be invited to join the Wells \nFargo board if the Merger Agreement is finalized.  (Green Aff., Ex. F.) \n{24} As to the claim that the price offered by Wells Fargo for Wachovia’s stock \nis inadequate, Plaintiff contends that the approximately $7-per-share valuation of \nthe Company’s stock is $3 less than the market price a week before the Merger \nAgreement was consummated, and does not reflect the increased value of \nWachovia’s assets following Congress’ passage of the financial “bailout” package on \n3 October 2008.  (Opening Br. 8.) \n{25} Plaintiff also points to public statements made by Robert Steel a mere two \nweeks before the Merger Agreement was approved, wherein he touted Wachovia’s \n“great future as an independent company.”  (Opening Br. 4.)   \n{26} Plaintiff requests leave to take unspecified discovery on an expedited \nbasis9 and also requests a hearing on his motion for a preliminary injunction in \nadvance of the shareholder vote on the Merger Agreement. \n{27} Wachovia contends that expedited proceedings are “not warranted here \nbecause Plaintiff is seeking to prohibit or modify a merger necessary to ensure \nWachovia’s continued viability—and equally necessary to avoid the damage to \ncustomers, depositors, employees, shareholders and the public that would occur if \nthe merger were to be put in doubt, delayed, or blocked.”  (Resp. Br. 3.) \n{28} Defendants assert that Wachovia’s board faced a “stark choice” when it \nmet “in the wee hours of [3 October 2008]” to consider the Merger Agreement—that \nis, accept the Wells Fargo proposal or allow the FDIC to place the Company’s  \nbanking subsidiaries in receivership.  (Resp. Br. 4.) \n{29} Defendants dismiss as Monday-morning quarterbacking Plaintiff’s view \nthat Wachovia could have survived as a stand-alone entity following Congress’ 4 \nOctober 2008 enactment of the EESA, contending that “[t]here is no basis for the \nplaintiff’s assumption that emergency government funding would be available to \nWachovia.”  (Resp. Br. 4 n.2.) \n{30} As for Plaintiff’s claims that the transfer to Wells Fargo of almost 40% of \nWachovia’s aggregate voting rights pursuant to the Share Exchange effectively \n                                                 \n9 Plaintiff’s Amended Motion does not attach or otherwise describe the discovery he proposes to take \nin this case.     \ndisenfranchises Wachovia’s public shareholders and precludes any competing bid \nfor the Company, Defendants respond, first, that the Share Exchange was a \nnecessary part of the consideration for the merger, and second, that Plaintiff’s \nargument \nis based on the unsubstantiated and illogical notion that Wachovia has \nalternatives to the Wells Fargo merger and that somehow shareholders \nare being prevented from taking advantage of these supposedly \nsuperior opportunities. . . .  It is now more than a month since \nWachovia first announced that it wa s available for a transaction, and \nno offers other than those by Ci tigroup and Wells Fargo have been \nmade.  If any capable third party was interested in making such an \noffer, it could have done so.   \n \n(Resp. Br. 5.) \n{31} Defendants also reject Plaintiff’s “golden parachutes” claim, contending \nthat the only member of Wachovia’s management who voted to approve the Merger \nAgreement is Robert Steel, who “has already announced that he will not remain \nwith the merged company.”  (Merritt Aff., Ex. 5.)  \n{32} Finally, Defendants contend Plaintiff is in no position to provide adequate \nsecurity should the Court grant preliminary injunctive relief, noting that “it is \ninconceivable that this shareholder could possibly post a bond for the potential costs \nand damages resulting from obtaining a wrongful injunction against a multi-billion \ndollar merger that is critical to the stability of the financial system.”  (Resp. Br. 3.)10     \n \nII. \nPRINCIPLES OF LAW \n{33} The North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide that trial courts may \nenlarge or shorten the time for responding to discovery or taking depositions.  See \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(3), 33(a), 34(b), 36(a). \n                                                 \n10 As a prolific North Carolina business law blogger describes it, “That would be quite a bond.”  Mack \nSperling, Plaintiff Seeking Expedited Discovery in Lawsuit over Wachovia-Wells Fargo Merger, \nNorth Carolina Business Litigation Report (Oct. 28, 2008), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesslitigationreport.com/2008/10/articles/class-actions/plaintiff-seeking-expedited-\ndiscovery-in-lawsuit-over-wachoviawells-fargo-merger.  \n{34} Our appellate courts, however, have not addressed the standard to be \napplied by a trial court in considering a request for expedited discovery. \n{35} Absent such guidance, the Court looks to federal cases interpreting the \nanalogous Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and to Delaware cases addressing the \nissue in the context of challenges to a proposed merger transaction.  See Turner v. \nDuke Univ., 325 N.C. 152, 164, 381 S.E.2d 706, 713 (1989) (stating that because the \nNorth Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure are substantially similar to the Federal \nRules, our courts often look to federal cases for interpretive guidance); First Union \nCorp. v. Suntrust Banks, Inc., 2001 NCBC 9 ¶ 32 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 20, 2001), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2001%20NCBC%2009A.pdf (stating that \n“North Carolina courts have frequently looked to Delaware for guidance because of \nthe special expertise and body of case law developed in the Delaware Chancery \nCourt and the Delaware Supreme Court”). \n{36} The federal courts take divergent views on the question of expedited \ndiscovery.  One line of cases holds that where a plaintiff seeks expedited discovery \nto prepare for a preliminary injunction hearing, \n“courts should require the plaintiff to demonstrate (1) irreparable \ninjury, (2) some probability of su ccess on the merits, (3) some \nconnection between the expedited discovery and the avoidance of the \nirreparable injury, and (4) some ev idence that the injury that will \nresult without expedited discovery looms greater than the injury that \nthe defendant will suffer if the expedited relief is granted.” \n \nCrown Crafts, Inc. v. Aldrich, 148 F.R.D. 151, 152 (E.D.N.C. 1993) (quoting Notaro \nv. Koch, 95 F.R.D. 403, 405 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)).   \n{37} Other courts have criticized this approach, noting that Notaro puts the \nmerits cart before the discovery horse by requiring a party to demonstrate his \nentitlement to preliminary injunctive relief before obtaining discovery to prove the \nclaim.  See, e.g., Dimension Data N. Am., Inc., v. NetStar-1, Inc., 226 F.R.D. 528, \n531 (E.D.N.C. 2005).  Such courts instead require only a showing of  reasonableness \nor good cause for taking expedited discovery, “taking into account the totality of the \ncircumstances.”  \nId.   \n{38} The Delaware cases put some flesh on the good cause standard for \nexpedited proceedings in the context of a disputed merger transaction by requiring \na plaintiff to “articulate a sufficiently colorable claim and show a sufficient \npossibility of a threatened irreparable injury to justify imposing on the defendants \nand the public the extra (and sometimes substantial) costs of an expedited . . . \nproceeding.”  Marie Raymond Revocable Trust v. MAT Five LLC, 2008 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 77, at *6 (June 26, 2008). \n \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n{39} In considering Plaintiff’s request for expedited proceedings, the Court must \nnot lose sight of Plaintiff’s burden on the merits. \n{40} Plaintiff alleges that Wachovia’s board of directors breached their fiduciary \nduties to him and his fellow shareholders.  To prevail on that claim, however, \nPlaintiff must overcome the deference accorded Defendants’ actions by North \nCarolina’s business judgment rule. \n{41} The business judgment rule \n“operates primarily as a rule of evidence or judicial review and creates, \nfirst, an initial evidentiary presumption that in making a decision the \ndirectors acted with due care (i.e., on an informed basis) and in good \nfaith in the honest belief that their action was in the best interest of \nthe corporation, and second, absent rebuttal of the initial presumption, \na powerful substantive presumption that a decision by a loyal and \ninformed board will not be overturn ed by a court unless it cannot be \nattributed to any rational business purpose.”  \n \nHammonds v. Lumbee River Elec. Mbrshp. Corp., 178 N.C. App. 1, 20–21, 631 \nS.E.2d 1, 13 (2006) (quoting Russell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina \nCorporation Law, § 14.06, at 14-16 to 14-17 (2005)).   \n{42} Thus, the rule “protects corporate directors from being judicially second-\nguessed when they exercise reasonable care and business judgment.”  HAJMM Co. \nv. House of Raeford Farms, 94 N.C. App. 1, 10, 379 S.E.2d 868, 873, review on \nadditional issues allowed, 325 N.C. 271, 382 S.E.2d 439 (1989), and modified, aff'd \nin part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 328 N.C. 578, 403 S.E.2d 483 (1991).  \n{43} Plaintiff may well be unable to overcome the high hurdle imposed on him \nhere by the business judgment rule, particularly where (1) Wachovia’s board asserts \nthat quick action on the Merger Agreement was necessary to avoid a government-\ndirected liquidation of the Company, and (2) Plaintiff presents no evidence of a \ncompeting offer for the Company.  See, e.g., Marcoux v. Prim, 2004 NCBC 5 ¶ 64 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. April 16, 2004), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2004%20NCBC%205.htm (applying \nDelaware law and stating “that in the absence of a competing offer a plaintiff must \nmake a particularly strong showing on the merits to obtain a preliminary injunction \nbecause an injunction in such circumstances risks significant injury to \nshareholders”). \n{44} That said, however, Plaintiff appears to have alleged colorable claims as to \nhis contentions that (1) the Share Exchange transferring a nearly 40% voting bloc to \nWells Fargo in advance of a vote on the Merger Agreement is unduly coercive, and \n(2) the limited “fiduciary out” clause contained in the Merger Agreement violates \nthe Wachovia board’s continuing responsibility to exercise its fiduciary duties.  \nSee \ngenerally First Union Corp., 2001 NCBC 9 ¶¶ 81, 89 (stating that (1) a relevant test \nas to shareholder coercion is whether the vote will “‘be a valid and independent \nexercise of the shareholders’ franchise, without any specific preordained result \nwhich precludes them from rationally determining the fate of the proposed merger,’” \nand (2) courts should invalidate merger plans that “purport to restrict a board’s \nduty to fully protect the interests of the corporation and its shareholders”).  \n{45} Plaintiff also presents a colorable claim as to irreparable harm.       \n{46} Nevertheless, the Court is not convinced that expedited discovery is \nnecessary to resolve the issues raised by Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. \n{47} In that regard, the parties’ briefs barely address the scope of any proposed \ndiscovery, focusing instead on the merits of Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief.  \nPlaintiff also has not specified the discovery he wishes to take, nor has he served \ndiscovery on any Defendant. \n{48} Moreover, this is an unusual case, in that most (if not all) of the facts \npertinent to resolving Plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunctive relief are \nmatters of public record. \n{49} In that vein, there is no dispute that:  \n(1) A mere two weeks before the Company’s demise, Wachovia’s President \nand CEO was insisting publicly that Wachovia “had a great future as an \nindependent company;” \n \n(2) In the ensuing period, Wachovia’s share price tumbled from $18.75 to \n$1.84; \n \n(3) Wachovia’s board faced a crisis of historic proportions when it met to \nconsider and approve the Merger Agreement; \n \n(4) Wachovia’s board took very little time to digest and act upon the \nMerger Agreement; \n \n(5) The Share Exchange gives Well Fargo almost 40% of the vote in \nadvance of a decision by the Company’s shareholders as to approval of the \nMerger Agreement; \n \n(6) The “fiduciary out” clause in the Merger Agreement prohibits the \nWachovia board from walking away from the Wells Fargo deal should a \nbetter deal materialize, but instead only allows the board in that instance \nto make no recommendation to the shareholders, with an explanation;  \n \n(7) Should the Merger Agreement be approved by the shareholders, three \nmembers of the Wachovia board will be invited to join the Wells Fargo \nboard; \n \n(8) All of the agencies with regulatory authority over the Merger \nAgreement have approved it; and \n \n(9) Following approval of the Merger Agreement by Wachovia’s board, no \nother entity has made a bid to purchase the Company. \n \n{50} What the Court must now decide is whether these circumstances warrant \ngranting Plaintiff’s specific request that the Court preliminarily enjoin enforcement \nof the deal-protection devices embedded in the Merger Agreement.  (Reply Br. 12.) \n{51} The Court concludes that it may resolve this request on an expedited basis \nwithout allowing either side to take discovery. \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{52} The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for expedited discovery. \n{53} The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for expedited resolution of his \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction.  As to that Motion, the Courts sets the following \nschedule:  (1) Plaintiff shall file his brief in support of his Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction (along with any other supporting materials) by 10 November 2008; (2) \nDefendants shall file their brief in opposition (along with any supporting materials) \nby 17 November 2008; (3) Plaintiff’s reply shall be filed by 21 November 2008; and \n(4) the Court sets this matter for hearing at 2:00 pm on 24 November 2008 in \nCourtroom 6370 of the Mecklenburg County Courthouse.   \n \nSO ORDERED this the 3rd day of November, 2008.  \n "
