Kathleen Miller, for Defendant Airgas, Inc.\nJames, McElroy & Diehl, P.A., by Edward T. Hinson, Jr., Richard B. Fennell, Jennifer A. Youngs,\nKatherine Line Thompson Kelly and John S. Arrowood, for Defendants National Welders Supply\nCompany, Inc.,\n \nMark R. Bernstein and Judith Carpenter as Co-Executors of the Estate of J.A.\nTurner, Jr., and Judith Carpenter.\nI.\nStatement of Facts\n{2}\n               \nThis case arises out of two separate business transactions – a Right of First Refusal (“RFR”)\nentered into between National Welders Supply Company (“NWS”) and Union Carbide Industrial\nGases, Inc. (now Praxair, Inc. or “Praxair”), and a Joint Venture Agreement (“JVA”) entered into\nbetween NWS and Airgas, Inc. (“Airgas”).\n  \nIn conjunction with NWS’ purchase of certain assets from\nPraxair, on March 25, 1991, the companies entered into the RFR, which defined various triggering\nevents under which Praxair would have, for the fifteen years following, certain rights to purchase the\nstock of NWS.\n  \nOne such triggering event was a “Change in Control,” the definition of which was\nspecifically set forth in the RFR.\n{3}\n               \nIn 1995, Mr. Turner, founder of NWS, began negotiating with both Praxair and Airgas for the\nsale of a portion of NWS.\n  \nEventually, the negotiations ended with NWS and Airgas entering into the\nJVA, under which Airgas acquired 47 percent of the NWS stock.\n  \nThe JVA further provided the\nTurners with four distinct options which could be exercised in 2006, the year the RFR between Praxair\nand NWS expired.\n  \nIncluded in those options was the right either to put the remaining NWS stock in\nexchange for Airgas stock or to require redemption of the remaining NWS stock for cash.\n{4}\n               \nOn June 16, 1998, Praxair filed this action against Defendants claiming that the JVA violated the\nterms of the RFR between NWS and Praxair.\n  \nDefendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n12(b)(6) and Rule 12(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure contending the JVA was not a\nbreach of the RFR and that Praxair’s claims should therefore be dismissed.\n  \nBy Order dated May 26,\n1999, this Court found that the terms of the JVA did not, on their face, violate the RFR. Accordingly,\nthe Court dismissed Praxair’s claims to the extent that they could be read to assert a cause of action for\nbreach of contract based upon a legal interpretation of the express language of the JVA and the RFR.\n \n{5}\n               \nAdditionally, Praxair contended in its original Complaint that NWS and the Turner family\nviolated Praxair’s rights under the RFR because the JVA was a “sham transaction” designed to hide\nthe fact that the Turners secretly agreed to sell NWS to Airgas in a two-step transaction. (Compl. ¶ 1,\nNature of the Action.)\n  \nPraxair contends that this “sham transaction” is the basis for the causes of\naction alleged in its complaint.\n  \nThe Court found that Plaintiff successfully pled facts supporting claims\nagainst NWS and Airgas based on the theory that Airgas, NWS and the Turner family entered into a\nside agreement or oral understanding that may be contrary to the express terms of the JVA.\n \nSpecifically, the Court held:\nThe drafters of the [JVA] were successful in avoiding triggering Praxair’s rights under the\nRFR primarily because the agreement left Airgas at risk that whoever owned or controlled\nthe Turner Family stock in 2006 could elect to retain ownership of the stock or sell it to\nsomeone else . . . . If, however, the Turners and Airgas have agreed that the Turners will\nsell or exchange their National Welders stock for Airgas stock or cash regardless of the\nconditions in 2006, thus eliminating any risk to Airgas that it would be left owning 47% of\nNational Welders, Praxair’s contractual rights have been violated.\n{6}\n               \nPraxair, Inc. v. Airgas, Inc.\n,\n \n1999 NCBC 5 at 20\n \n(No. 98 CVS 008571, Mecklenburg County\nSuper. Ct. May 26, 1999) (Tennille, J.).\n  \nAlthough the Court reconsidered its May Order upon the\nmotion of Praxair, the Court declined to alter its previous rulings.\n  \nSee Praxair, Inc. v. Airgas, Inc.,\n1999 NCBC 9\n \n(No. 98 CVS 008571, Mecklenburg County Super. Ct. Oct. 20, 1999) (Tennille, J.).\n \nFollowing close of discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment and filed motions in limine\nseeking exclusion of certain expert testimony.\nII.\nAdmissibility of Expert Opinions\n{7}\n               \nThe Court turns first to a consideration of Defendants’ Motion in Limine.\nA.\nMotion in Limine\n{8}\n               \nAs an initial matter, the Court considers the appropriateness of the timing of Defendants’ Motion\nin Limine.\n  \nPraxair points out that the only expert testimony it currently seeks to admit is the expert\ntestimony presented in Praxair’s response to Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment; therefore,\nPraxair argues, the motion is premature and should be treated as a motion to strike.\n{9}\n               \nThe Court agrees that it is premature to rule on a motion in limine to exclude the testimony of\ncertain experts at trial.\n  \nA motion in limine must be considered in light of the issues presented for trial.\n \nThose issues may differ from the issues before the Court in ruling on Defendants’ Motion for\nSummary Judgment.\n  \nTherefore, the Court will consider the motion in limine and the proffered expert\ntestimony in connection with the issue currently to be decided – whether there is a genuine issue of\nmaterial fact as to the existence or nonexistence of a secret agreement to transfer 100 percent of the\nNWS voting stock to Airgas outside of the JVA.\n  \nHowever, the Court’s ruling should provide some\nguidance to the parties with respect to the admissibility of certain expert witness testimony offered at\ntrial.\nB.\nSupreme Court’s Requirements for Expert Testimony\n{10}\n          \nThere are three primary requirements for the admission of expert testimony: relevance,\nqualification and reliability.\n  \nSee State v. Goode\n, 341 N.C. 513, 526-29, 461 S.E.2d 631, 639-41\n(1995).\n  \nThe threshold test for the admissibility of all evidence is relevancy.\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 8C-1, Rule\n401 (1999).\n  \nEvidence is relevant if it has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\nconsequence to the determination to the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence.”\n  \nId.\n; \nsee also\n \nState v. Whiteside\n, 325 N.C. 389, 397, 383 S.E.2d 911, 915 (1989).\n \n{11}\n          \nIn addition to being relevant, expert witness testimony must also meet specific requirements.\n  \nRule\n702 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence governs the admission of expert testimony.\n  \nThe rule\nstates:\nIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\nknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an\nopinion.\nN.C.G.S. § 8C-1, Rule 702 (1999).\n  \nIn order to admit expert testimony under Rule 702, the proponent\nmust establish that the witness is qualified to testify as an expert on the subject about which the\ntestimony is offered.\n  \nSee State v. Goode\n, 341 N.C. 513, 461 S.E.2d 631 (1995).\n  \nNorth Carolina courts\nrequire that an “expert [be] better qualified than the jury as to the subject at hand,” and that his\ntestimony be “‘helpful’ to the jury.”\n  \nState v. Davis\n, 106 N.C. App. 596, 601, 418 S.E.2d 263, 267\n(1992) (citing \nState v. Huang\n, 99 N.C. App. 658, 663, 394 S.E.2d 279, 282 (1990); \nSee also\n  \nState v.\nHoward\n, 78 N.C. App. 262, 270, 337 S.E.2d 598, 604 (1985).\n  \nThus, an expert must possess some\nspecialized knowledge putting him in a superior position to evaluate the evidence.\n  \nSimply having\nsome expertise is not enough; an expert witness must give testimony that assists the trier of fact.\n{12}\n          \nAs mentioned above, reliability is the third requirement for the admission of expert testimony.\n \nThis requirement has troubled the courts and has been the subject of numerous court decisions in\nrecent years.\n  \nUntil the United States Supreme Court’s decision in \nDaubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals, Inc.\n, 509 U.S. 579 (1993), the prevailing standard for determining the reliability of\nexpert testimony was whether the methodology employed by the expert was “generally accepted”\namong the relevant scientific community.\n  \nSee, e.g., Frye v. United States\n, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir.\n1923).\n  \nHowever, in \nDaubert \nthe Court considered the language of Rule 702 and found that the drafters\nof the Federal Rules did not intend to incorporate the \nFrye\n test into the standard for admissibility of\nexpert testimony.\n  \n509 U.S. at 587.\n  \nWith its decision in \nDaubert\n, the Supreme Court rejected the\n“generally accepted” test, finding it at odds with the “‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules,” and instead\nadopted a multi-factor approach to determining reliability.\n  \nId.\n \n{13}\n          \nBased on the language of Federal Rule 702, the \nDaubert\n Court found that admissible expert\ntestimony must be based on scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact.\n  \nId. \nat 590.\n  \nThe Court\nexplained that “[t]he adjective ‘scientific’ implies a grounding in the methods and procedures of\nscience.\n  \nSimilarly, the word ‘knowledge’ connotes more than subjective belief or unsupported\nspeculation.”\n  \nId.\n  \nTo determine whether the proffered testimony meets these requirements, the trial\ncourt is required to make a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology is reliable\nor valid.\n  \nId. \nat 593.\n  \nThe Court enumerated several factors relevant to determining whether an expert’s\ntestimony is based on a reliable methodology:\n  \n(1) whether the methodology or theory has been tested;\n(2) whether the methodology has been subjected to peer review; (3) the known or potential rate of\nerror; and (4) whether the methodology is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community.\n  \nId.\nat 593-94.\n  \nHowever, the Court noted that it did not intend to set out a definitive checklist, but instead\nstated that there may be several factors bearing on the issue of reliability.\n  \nId.\n at 593.\n  \nThus, with\nDaubert \nthe Court imposed on trial judges a “gatekeeping” obligation by “assign[ing] to the trial judge\nthe task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the\ntask at hand.”\n  \nId.\n at 597.\nC.\nReliability of Nonscientific Expert Testimony\n{14}\n          \nDespite the \nDaubert\n Court’s attempt to establish some guidelines for assessing the reliability of\nexpert testimony, the decision created confusion among the federal circuits. \n \nSpecifically, the circuits\ndisagreed about whether the gatekeeping responsibility applied to nonscientific expert testimony, and\nif so, whether the \nDaubert\n factors were appropriately applied to such testimony.\n  \nThe Court attempted\nto answer these questions in \nKumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael\n, 526 U.S. 137 (1999).\n  \nThe Court found\nthat the principles identified in \nDaubert\n applied equally to nonscientific testimony.\n  \nId.\n at 147-48.\n  \nThe\nCourt reasoned that Rule 702 makes no distinction between “scientific” knowledge and “technical” or\n“other specialized” knowledge.\n  \nId. \nat\n \n147.\n  \nInstead, “it is the Rule’s word ‘knowledge’ . . . that\n‘establishes a standard of evidentiary reliability.’”\n  \nId.\n  \nTherefore, regardless of the type of expert\ntestimony under consideration, the judge must assume the role of a gatekeeper, preventing the\nadmission of opinions lacking a reliable basis.\n{15}\n          \nThe \nKumho Tire\n Court also held that when assessing the reliability of expert testimony, the trial\ncourt \nmay \nconsider the four factors enumerated in \nDaubert\n.\n  \nId. \nat 150.\n  \nHowever, the Court\nrecognized \nDaubert\n factors may not be helpful in assessing the reliability of nonscientific evidence.\n \nId.\n  \nThe Court concluded that it could “neither rule out, nor rule in, for all cases and for all time the\napplicability of the factors mentioned in \nDaubert\n . . . .\n  \nToo much depends upon the particular\ncircumstances of the particular case at issue.”\n  \nId.\n{16}\n          \nThe \nKumho Tire \nCourt noted that, in rejecting the “generally accepted” test as the sole method to\nassessing reliability, the \nDaubert\n Court was particularly concerned about the problem of the self-\nvalidating discipline.\n  \nId. \nat 151.\n  \nSpecifically, some disciplines may inherently lack reliability.\n  \nId.\n  \n“It\nis not enough that the self-proclaimed experts who practice these disciplines accept the premises and\ntechniques of the discipline.\n  \nThere must be some independent, objective indicium of the reliability of\nthe discipline.”\n  \nEdward J. Imwinkelried, \nEvaluating the Reliability of Nonscientific Expert\nTestimony:\n  \nA Partial Answer to the Questions Left Unresolved by \nKumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 52\nMe. L. Rev\n. 19 (2000) [hereinafter \nImwinkelried\n].\n  \nTherefore, the court necessarily must base its\nassessment of reliability on more than the \nDaubert\n “general acceptance” factor.\n{17}\n          \nKumho Tire\n did provide some guidance as to what factors may be helpful in assessing the\nreliability of nonscientific expert testimony.\n  \nFor example, in addition to considering whether the\nexpert’s method is generally accepted in the relevant community or whether the expert’s preparation is\nof a kind that others in the field would recognize as acceptable, it may be helpful to consider how often\nan expert’s experience-based methodology has produced erroneous results.\n  \n526 U.S. at 151.\n \nAdditional guidance may be found from the factors that the Court determined weighed against the\nadmission of the proffered tire expert’s testimony:\n  \n(1) the expert’s qualifications; (2) the\n(im)precision of the expert’s method; (3) the subjectiveness of the expert’s mode of analysis; (4) the\nshort amount of time the expert spent conducting analysis; (5) the fact that the expert reached a\npreliminary conclusion before he conducted the analysis; and (6) the expert’s failure to adequately\nexplain other possible causes.\n  \nId.\n at 153-57.\n{18}\n          \nWhile one can glean from the \nKumho Tire \ndecision a list of factors that may be helpful in\nassessing a nonscientific expert’s reliability, the \nKumho Tire\n Court purposely refrained from\nestablishing a checklist similar to the one contained in \nDaubert\n.\n  \nInstead, \nKumho Tire\n left the reliability\ndetermination entirely up to the trial court based on the specific circumstances at hand in a particular\ncase.\n  \nThus, the courts are left to determine what factors are helpful in assessing the reliability of\nnonscientific expert testimony in each case.\n  \nThe task of arriving at a set of relevant assessors of\nnonscientific expert testimony reliability poses unique problems for the courts.\n  \nEach case may result\nin the application of different assessors or differences in the degrees of importance of the same\nassessors.\n{19}\n          \nThe cases following \nKumho Tire\n provide some guidance with respect to assessing the reliability of\nnonscientific expert testimony.\n  \nAfter reviewing recent case law, the drafters of the federal rules\narrived at a set of factors useful to the courts in evaluating nonscientific expert testimony.\n  \nA proposed\namendment to Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence would change Rule 702 to read:\nIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by\nknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an\nopinion or otherwise if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the\ntestimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied\nthe principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\nFed. R. Evid\n. 702 (proposed Dec. 2000).\n  \nThe Proposed Advisory Committee’s Note to the amended\nRule 702 lists the factors courts have found relevant in determining whether expert testimony is\nsufficiently reliable to be considered by the trier of fact.\n  \nThese factors include: (1) whether the expert\nis proposing to testify about matters growing naturally and directly out of research they have\nconducted independent of the litigation; (2) whether the expert has unjustifiably extrapolated from an\naccepted premise to an unfounded conclusion; (3) whether the expert has adequately accounted for\nobvious alternative explanations; and (4) whether the field of expertise claimed by the expert is known\nto reach reliable results for the type of opinion the expert would give.\n  \nSee id\n at 338, n.56.\n \n{20}\n          \nThe above discussion focuses on the Federal Rules of Evidence and federal case law interpreting\nthose rules.\n  \nThe North Carolina Rules of Evidence are patterned after the Federal Rules.\n  \nTherefore,\nalthough this Court is not bound by federal case law, these cases prove to be helpful in arriving at a list\nof factors relevant to assessing the reliability of the expert testimony proffered in this case.\n  \nIn\naddition, as mentioned above, factors relevant to determining the reliability of scientific testimony may\nbe helpful in assessing nonscientific testimony.\n  \nSee\n \nOglesby v. General Motors Corp.\n, 190 F.3d 244,\n250 (4\nth\n Cir. 1999) (affirming the decision of the trial court to disregard the opinion of a mechanical\nengineer based on a determination that his testimony was unreliable, noting that “[r]eliability of\nspecialized knowledge and methods for applying it to various circumstances may be indicated by\ntesting, peer review, evaluation of rates of error, and general acceptability.”). \n \nFor example, it may be\nuseful to consider the expert’s professional background, any independent research conducted by the\nexpert, and the expert’s use of established techniques.\n  \nSee State v. Cardwell\n, 133 N.C. App. 496, 505,\n516 S.E.2d 388, 395 (1999) (evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony of a blood plasma\nanalyzer); \nState v. Goode\n, 314 N.C. at 528, 461 S.E.2d at 640 (evaluating the admissibility of expert\ntestimony regarding bloodstain pattern interpretation).\n{21}\n          \nPraxair has five expert witnesses who may be called to testify at trial.\n  \nThe testimony of four of\nthese proffered experts is offered in response to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  \nWhile\nDefendants only question the reliability of one of Praxair’s experts, ultimately the admissibility\ndecision will depend not only on whether Praxair’s experts are qualified and their testimony is relevant\nbut also whether their opinions have a reliable basis.\n  \nPraxair’s experts have provided opinions on\nnonscientific matters, including business ethics, contract behavior, economics, finance and accounting.\n \nThe Court will be required to evaluate this nonscientific testimony in light of the factors that it has\ndetermined are useful in assessing reliability.\n   \nIn determining the reliability of the nonscientific\ntestimony of Praxair’s experts, the Court believes that the following factors will be helpful:\n  \n(1) the\nexpert’s qualifications; (2) the preciseness of the expert’s method; (3) the subjectiveness of the\nexpert’s analysis; (4) whether a preliminary conclusion was reached before the analysis was\nconducted; (5) whether the expert considered other alternatives; (6) whether the expert’s method is\ngenerally accepted by the relevant community; and (7) whether the field of expertise is known to reach\nreliable results.\n \nD.\nLimits of Admissibility of Expert Opinion Testimony\n{22}\n          \nIn addition to determining the reliability of the nonscientific testimony of Praxair’s experts, the\nCourt must address the limits of admissible expert opinion testimony.\n  \nRule 704 of the North Carolina\nRules of Evidence states that “[t]estimony in the form of an opinion or inference is not objectionable\nbecause it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.”\n  \nN.C.G.S. § 8C-1, Rule 704\n(1999).\n  \nHowever, there are limits to the scope of expert testimony.\n  \nFor example, an expert may not\ntestify that a particular legal standard or conclusion has been met; instead, it is for the court to explain\nto the jury the given legal standard at issue and how the ultimate legal conclusion should be\ndetermined.\n  \nSee\n \nHAJMM Co. v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc.\n, l328 N.C. 578, 586-87, 403 S.E.2d\n483, 488-89 (1991).\n  \nThus, when evaluating the opinion testimony of expert witnesses, the court must\ndistinguish between testimony that goes to the ultimate issue from testimony that improperly draws a\nlegal conclusion.\n{23}\n          \nIn \nRaeford Farms\n, the North Carolina Supreme Court addressed the question of whether the trial\ncourt erred in admitting the testimony of an expert on equity redemption by agricultural cooperatives.\n \nId.\n at 583, 403 S.E.2d at 487.\n  \nAt trial, the expert witness testified to his opinion that the board of\ndirectors abused its discretion, that there was a fiduciary relationship, and that the fiduciary duty was\nbreached.\n  \nId.\n  \nThe court explained that there is a distinction between legal conclusions about which\ntestimony may not be admitted, and ultimate facts about which testimony is admissible.\n  \nId.\n at 586,\n403 S.E.2d at 488.\n  \nThe court concluded that the expert should not have been permitted to testify that,\nin his opinion, there was a fiduciary relationship which had been breached.\n  \nId.\n at 589, 403 S.E.2d at\n490.\n  \nHowever, the expert’s testimony regarding the underlying facts which were relevant to the jury’s\ndetermination of whether there had been a breach of fiduciary duty was proper.\n  \nId.\n  \nThus, an expert\nmay give opinion testimony regarding the underlying factual premises the jury must consider in\ndetermining the ultimate issue.\n  \n“Opinion testimony may be received regarding the underlying factual\npremise, which the fact finder must consider in determining the legal conclusion to be drawn\ntherefrom, but may not be offered as to whether the legal conclusion \nshould\n be drawn.”\n  \nNorris v.\nZambito\n, 135 N.C. App. 288, 293, 520 S.E.2d 113, 116 (1999) (citing \nRaeford Farms\n, 328 N.C. 578,\n403 S.E.2d 483 (emphasis in original)).\n  \n“[W]hile the legal expert may testify regarding the factual\nissues facing the jury, he is \nnot allowed\n to either \ninterpret the law \nor\n to testify as to the legal effect of\nparticular facts.\n”\n  \nSmith v.

App. 116, 349 S.E.2d 304 (1986).\n  \nIn\nWilliams\n, the trial court allowed plaintiff’s expert, who was an attorney, to give his opinion that the\nplaintiff was entitled to an easement by implication.\n  \nThe Court of Appeals disagreed, stating that\n“[e]xpressions of opinion on a question of law are not admissible into evidence.”\n  \nId.\n at 118, 349\nS.E.2d at 305.\n  \nThe court emphasized that although opinion testimony may embrace an ultimate issue\nto be decided by the fact-finder, not all opinions are admissible.\n  \nId. \nat 119, 349 S.E.2d at 305.\n  \nSuch a\nrule protects against the admission of opinions which merely tell the jury what result to reach.\n  \nId\n.\n  \nThe\nopinion is inadmissible if the question asked of the expert witness must also be answered by the jury.\n \nId.\n at 120, 349 S.E.2d at 306.\n \n{25}\n          \nThus, in this case, Praxair’s experts may testify to underlying facts that go to the ultimate issue,\nnamely whether there is a separate, secret agreement between Airgas and NWS.\n  \nHowever, Praxair’s\nexperts may not testify that, in their opinion, the defendants reached a secret agreement under which\nthe NWS preferred shareholders are required to exchange or redeem the remainder of its NWS stock.\n \nSuch testimony would merely tell the jury what result to reach.\n  \nSee Raeford Farms\n, 328 N.C. at 588-\n89, 403 S.E.2d at 490; \nWilliams\n, 83 N.C. App. at 120, 349 S.E.2d at 306.\n  \n“[T]he rules ought to be\nstructured to force the proponent to educate the trier of fact rather than permitting the proponent to\ninvite the trier of fact to simply defer to the expert.”\n  \nImwinkelried\n at 31.\n  \nTherefore, “[w]here the legal\nrelations growing out of the facts are in dispute, and the witness’s words appear to describe the\nrelations themselves, the same words may be objectionable.”\n  \n1 H. Brandis, \nBrandis on North\nCarolina Evidence \n§ 130 (3d ed. 1988).\n  \nAccordingly, Praxair’s experts’ testimony must stop short of\nopining that a secret agreement exists between Defendants.\nIII.\nExperts Offered by Praxair\n{26}\n          \nPraxair has named five expert witnesses whom they may seek to offer at trial.\n  \nPraxair’s offered\nthe testimony of four of these witnesses in opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.\n \nThe Court has considered the testimony of each of these four experts as submitted in Praxair’s\nresponsive briefs and found some of it admissible and relevant to facts at issue.\n  \nOther parts of the\nproffered expert testimony are inadmissible and therefore not properly considered in opposition to the\nmotion for summary judgment.\n \n{27}\n          \nAs a threshold matter, the Court will not allow Praxair’s experts to testify at trial that a secret\nagreement exists among Defendants.\n  \nAllowing such testimony would allow Praxair’s experts to draw\na legal conclusion and to answer the very question before the jury.\n  \nCourts have held that opinions\nwhich merely tell the jury the result they should reach are improper.\n  \nSee Williams v. Sapp\n, 83 N.C.\nApp. at 120, 349 S.E.2d at 306.\n  \nHowever, although Praxair’s experts may not draw the conclusion\nthat a secret agreement exists among Defendants, they may testify about factors and circumstances\nconsistent with the existence of a separate agreement.\n  \nWhile this distinction draws a fine line, the line\nis drawn short of the expert rendering an ultimate conclusion, thereby allowing the jury to make an\nindependent decision about whether a separate agreement exists.\nA.\nProfessor Thomas Donaldson\n{28}\n          \nDefendants challenge the testimony of Professor Thomas Donaldson, who teaches and writes\nprimarily about business ethics.\n  \nDefendants do not argue that Professor Donaldson’s testimony is\nirrelevant, as it clearly goes to the central issue in this case.\n  \nInstead, Defendants contend that Professor\nDonaldson is unqualified to render the proffered opinions because his methodology is unreliable.\n \nAfter reviewing the transcript of Professor Donaldson’s deposition and the affidavit submitted by\nProfessor Donaldson, the Court questions both the reliability of his methodology and his qualification\nas an expert on the ultimate issue in this case.\n{29}\n          \nThe Court is troubled by Professor Donaldson’s purported “methodology.”\n  \nProfessor Donaldson\nexplains that he has developed a “methodology for determining the existence of implicit norms and\nagreements.”\n  \n(Donaldson Aff. ¶ 2.)\n  \nAccording to Professor Donaldson, “the criteria for testing for the\nexistence of such implicit agreements are complex and vary on a case-by-case basis, but must have\nboth an intentional and behavioral component.”\n  \n(\nId\n.)\n  \nRecognizing that the criteria vary on a case-by-\ncase basis, the Court has nevertheless been unable to determine what criteria were utilized by Professor\nDonaldson when reviewing the evidence in this case.\n  \nPraxair explains that Professor Donaldson’s\nmethod “involves reviewing all the objective information available about both the transaction at issue\nand the parties involved, and evaluating this information based on Professor Donaldson’s knowledge\nof economics, commercial and corporate behavior, business ethics and competitive theory.”\n  \n(Pl. Resp.\nto Mt. in Limine at III.A.2.)\n \n{30}\n          \nA review of all the evidence and/or an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances does not\nconstitute a reliable methodology.\n  \nSuch a method is not subject to any peer review, nor is there any\nway to determine how often Professor Donaldson is right and how often he is wrong. There is no way\nto determine the rate of error in his methodology.\n  \nThere are no independent, objective indicia of the\nreliability of his method, nor has it been subject to peer review.\n  \n“[N]othing in either \nDaubert\n or the\nFederal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence which is connected to\nexisting data only by the \nipse dixit\n of the expert.\n  \nA court may conclude that there is simply too great\nan analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.”\n  \nGeneral Electric Co. v. Joiner\n, 522\nU.S. 136, 146 (1997).\n{31}\n          \nCourts have recognized that “the whole point of \nDaubert\n is that experts can not ‘speculate.’\n  \nThey\nneed \nanalytically sound\n bases for their opinions”\n  \nDePaepe v. General Motors Corp.\n, 141 F.3d 715,\n720 (7\nth\n Cir. 1998) (emphasis added); \nsee also Ford Olinger v. USGA\n, 52 F. Supp. 2d 947, 950 (N.D.\nInd. 1999).\n  \nThus, the court needs enough information about an expert’s methodology so as to evaluate\nthe reliability of that methodology.\n  \nThe Court has not been given sufficient information to evaluate\nProfessor Donaldson’s testimony in light of the factors identified as useful to determine the reliability\nof a nonscientific opinion.\n  \nIn short, “[t]his record discloses a well-credentialed expert who employs an\nundisclosed methodology to arrive at disclosed opinions.\n  \nThis court cannot evaluate the reliability of\nthe undisclosed methodology or of the principles that support the methodology.”\n  \nFord Olinger\n,\n \n52 F.\nSupp. 2d at 950.\n  \nThe Court has no information with which to assess the preciseness of Professor\nDonaldson’s evaluation.\n  \nIn fact, Professor Donaldson’s testimony leads the Court to believe that his\nanalysis was fairly imprecise: he simply reviewed the documentation he found relevant.\n \n{32}\n          \nIn addition, little information has been offered as to whether Donaldson’s “method” is generally\naccepted by other contract behavior experts, nor has Praxair offered historical information which\nwould help determine whether Donaldson’s field of expertise is known to reach reliable results.\n  \nFor\nexample, it would be helpful to have information about the known rate of error for those whose\nexpertise is evaluating the existence of separate secret agreements.\n      \n{33}\n          \nFinally, and perhaps most troubling, is the fact that Professor Donaldson’s opinion seems to be\ninfluenced by his “integrative social contracts theory.”\n  \nProfessor Donaldson explains that “[t]he key to\n[this] theory lies in the possibility of discovering implicit, or unwritten agreements, that may be found\nthroughout economic life.”\n  \n(Donaldson Aff. ¶ 2.)\n  \nDonaldson explains that he can assist the jury in\n“translat[ing] the code” of business transactions. (Donaldson Aff. ¶ 6.)\n  \nThis approach assumes that\nthere is a known and agreed upon code to translate.\n  \nIn fact, Donaldson testified that that written\ncontracts never completely embody the obligations of the parties. (Donaldson Dep. at 180-81.)\n \nDonaldson’s preliminary assumption is that every written agreement comes with separate oral or\nunspoken terms.\n  \nBecause of this assumption, Donaldson fails to consider the alternative – that the\nJVA is the complete embodiment of the agreement among Defendants.\n  \nThe Court believes that this\nassumption necessarily renders Donaldson’s analysis, and his opinion, unreliable.\n  \nIt clearly has the\ncapacity to confuse the jury.\n  \nTherefore, the Court is of the opinion that Donaldson’s methodology is\ninherently unreliable.\n{34}\n          \nIn his affidavit, Professor Donaldson renders other opinions about rights of first refusal (RFRs).\n \n(Donaldson Aff. ¶¶ 13, 14.)\n  \nProfessor Donaldson believes that RFRs “lie at the heart of the market’s\nability to provide optimal outcomes for society.”\n  \n(Donaldson Aff. ¶ 13.)\n  \nProfessor Donaldson gives\nhis opinion that when the spirit of a RFR is frustrated, economic freedom is endangered.\n  \n(Id.)\n \nAdditionally, Professor Donaldson says that RFRs are voluntary and do not constitute restrictions on\nalienation of property.\n  \n(Donaldson Aff. ¶ 14.)\n  \nIt is a fundamental principle of the law that RFRs are\nrestraints on alienation.\n  \nSee Bryan-Barber Realty, Inc. v. Fryar\n, 120 N.C. App. 178, 461 S.E.2d 29\n(1995).\n  \nProfessor Donaldson’s opinion about the value of RFRs is irrelevant, and his opinion about\ntheir effect on the market is both contrary to the law and to this Court’s prior Order.\n  \nProfessor\nDonaldson further testifies that the JVA “resulted in the destruction of the [RFR].”\n  \n(Donaldson Aff. ¶\n16.)\n  \nThis testimony is clearly contrary to this Court’s prior ruling that the terms of the JVA were not in\nviolation of the RFR.\n  \nPraxair, Inc. v. Airgas, Inc.\n,\n \n1999 NCBC 5 at 20\n \n(No. 98 CVS 008571,\nMecklenburg County Super. Ct. May 26, 1999) (Tennille, J.).\n  \nProfessor Donaldson’s opinions on\nthose issues are not only contrary to North Carolina law but also to the law of the case.\n{35}\n          \nThis Court also questions Professor Donaldson’s qualification as an expert in this case.\n  \nThere is\nno doubt that Professor Donaldson possesses specialized knowledge in the field of business ethics.\n \nNevertheless, the Court is not convinced that Professor Donaldson is more qualified than the jury to\nreview the evidence in this case and arrive at a conclusion about whether a secret agreement exists\namong defendants.\n  \nAdmitting Professor Donaldson’s opinion invites the jury to simply defer to the\nexpert.\n  \nIn essence, Plaintiff offers Professor Donaldson to testify that he has reviewed all the evidence\nin the case and concludes that a secret agreement exists.\n  \nSubsumed in such a conclusion are\njudgments with respect to the credibility of witnesses - judgments quintessentially left to the trier of\nfact.\n  \nThis Court is troubled by this usurpation of the jury’s function and province to determine\ncredibility.\n  \nThus, based on the affidavit submitted by Professor Donaldson, the Court is convinced\nthat he should not be permitted to testify as an expert on the ultimate issue in this case.\n{36}\n          \nIn light of the Court’s concerns regarding Professor Donaldson’s methodology and qualifications,\nthe Court strikes the testimony of Professor Donaldson submitted in connection with Praxair’s\nopposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment and has not considered his opinions in\nruling on the motion for summary judgment.\nB.\nMr. William E. Barrett\n{37}\n          \nPraxair identified William E. Barrett, a certified corporate trust specialist, as a potential expert\nwitness at trial; however, Mr. Barrett did not submit an affidavit in connection with Defendants’\nMotion for Summary Judgment.\n  \nTherefore, the Court will not make any rulings with respect to\nadmissibility of Mr. Barrett’s testimony, but instead will explain the framework in which the\nadmissibility of Mr. Barrett’s testimony at trial will be considered.\n  \nIn Mr. Barrett’s deposition, he\nconcluded that, based on his consideration of Mr. Turner’s estate plan at the time of the JVA, it is\n“highly likely” that the Turners will be compelled by economic incentives to redeem or exchange the\nNWS preferred shares sometime between the years 2006 and 2009.\n  \n(Barrett Dep. 42, 62-66.)\n \nDefendants do not challenge Mr. Barrett’s qualifications or the reliability of his testimony.\n  \nInstead,\nthe Defendants argue that Mr. Barrett’s testimony lacks relevancy.\n  \nAccording to Defendants, Mr.\nBarrett’s opinion about what the Turners should or must do based on the economic incentives in the\nJVA is irrelevant to the question of whether the Turner’s secretly agreed to redeem or exchange their\npreferred shares.\n{38}\n          \nThe Court believes that a financial expert’s opinion about the economic considerations facing the\npreferred shareholders, while circumstantial, is relevant to the question of whether the Turners secretly\nagreed to exchange or redeem their preferred shares.\n  \nEvidence that the structure of the JVA creates\nincentives for the preferred shareholders to either exchange or redeem their shares is relevant to show\nwhat Airgas and the Turners intended and agreed upon.\n  \nTherefore, Mr. Barrett should be allowed to\ndescribe the economic incentives contained in the JVA and explain their significance.\n \n{39}\n          \nHowever, Mr. Barrett may not testify as to the likelihood that the NWS preferred shareholders\nwill exchange or redeem their shares.\n  \nAlthough Mr. Barrett may explain what a rational investor\nwould do based on economic considerations, he may not draw a conclusion about the likelihood that\nthe Tuners will act as rational investors.\n  \nHe has no way of knowing what the decision maker at the\ntime will actually do.\n  \nIn addition, as discussed above, Mr. Barrett may not draw a legal conclusion for\nthe jury; thus, he may not opine that defendants reached a secret agreement.\n  \nTherefore, there is a limit\nto the admissibility of Mr. Barrett’s testimony.\n \nC.\nDr. Stewart Myers\n{40}\n          \nSimilarly, Praxair offers the testimony of Dr. Stewart Myers, professor of finance and economics\nat MIT.\n  \nIn his affidavit submitted by Praxair in opposition to Defendants’ Motion for Summary\nJudgment, Dr. Myers describes in great detail the economics of the JVA.\n  \nDefendants do not challenge\nDr. Myers’ qualifications or the reliability of his methodology, but instead argue that Dr. Myers’\ntestimony is irrelevant.\n  \nPraxair explains that Dr. Myers will testify about the fact that the financial\nincentives in the JVA “compel” redemption or exchange, thus rendering the other options in the JVA\nmeaningless.\n  \nPraxair argues that evidence that the financial incentives render a particular result highly\nlikely is relevant to the question of whether there was a separate agreement.\n{41}\n          \nDr. Myers describes the economics of the transaction between Airgas and NWS and attempts to\nvalue various aspects of the JVA.\n  \nDr. Myers testified that the transaction between Airgas and NWS\nleft Airgas the sole economic owner of NWS.\n  \n(Myers Aff. ¶ 9.)\n  \nDr. Myers also testified that the\noptions in the JVA are structured in such a way that the NWS preferred shareholders will incur “a\ndrastic financial penalty if they keep the NWS Preferred beyond June 2009.”\n  \n(Myers Aff. ¶ 32.)\n  \nIn his\naffidavit, Dr. Myers describes the NWS preferred stock and explains the basis for his opinion that the\nvalue of the NWS preferred shares depends on the option to redeem or exchange the shares.\n  \n(Myers\nAff. ¶¶ 7-14, 15-18.)\n  \nDr. Myers also explains the basis for his opinion that the voting rights attached\nto the NWS preferred stock do not add significant value to the shares.\n  \n(Myers Aff. ¶¶ 34-40.)\n  \nBased\non his analysis of the value of the preferred shares, Dr. Myers concludes that “[r]edemption or\nexchange of the Turners’ NWS Preferred at some point in the window between July 2006 and the end\nof June 2009 is a foregone conclusion.”\n  \n(Myers Aff. ¶ 19.)\n \n{42}\n          \nIn accordance with the principles discussed above, Dr. Myers may testify to the financial\nincentives in the JVA and may describe the various economics of the transaction.\n  \nDr. Myers’\ntestimony may be helpful to the jury in reaching a complete understanding of the structure of the JVA\nand of how the transaction should be valued.\n  \nSuch evidence is relevant to the question of whether the\nwritten terms of the JVA constitute the entire agreement or whether Defendants’ entered a separate\nagreement for the exchange or redemption of the remaining NWS shares.\n  \nHowever, like Mr. Barrett,\nDr. Myers cannot testify that there is a secret agreement among Defendants.\n  \nTo allow such testimony\nwould be to allow Dr. Myers to answer the question that is left for the jury.\n  \nSee Williams v. Sapp\n, 83\nN.C. App. at 120, 349 S.E.2d at 306.\n{43}\n          \nIn addition, Dr. Myers may not opine what the NWS preferred shareholders will do.\n  \nAccordingly,\nDr. Myers may not testify that redemption or exchange is a foregone conclusion or that the JVA\ncompels a given result.\n  \nSuch testimony would be contrary to the Court’s May Order.\n  \nIn that Order,\nthe Court held:\nThe Joint Venture Agreement gives the Turners the choice of doing four things after July\nof 2006. First, they may exchange with National Welders their preferred shares for Airgas\ncommon shares. Second, they may redeem their preferred shares for cash from National\nWelders. Third, they may hold their preferred voting stock and collect a 5% dividend.\nFourth, they could sell some or all of their shares if they could find a market for such a\nsecurity. Each of these choices is a contract right.\n. . .\n \nThe drafters of the Joint Venture Agreement were successful in avoiding triggering\nPraxair’s rights under the RFR primarily because the agreement left Airgas at risk that\nwhoever owned or controlled the Turner Family stock in 2006 could elect to retain\nownership of the stock or sell it to someone else. Even though there were strong incentives\nbuilt into the agreement for the Turners to exchange their National Welders stock for cash\nor Airgas stock after the RFR expired, the written agreement provided no guarantee that\nthey would do so, and it left the Turner Family in the position of being able to chose its\ncourse of action based upon the circumstances in existence in the year 2006.\n1999 NCBC 5, at 11, 20.\n  \nThus, the Court recognizes that there is a risk that is borne by Airgas as a\nresult of the express terms of the JVA.\n  \nTo testify that “the probability that the Turners will either\nredeem or exchange their [shares] . . . is virtually 100%”\n  \n(Pl. Resp. to Mt. in Limine at III.B.2) ignores\nthe noneconomic considerations that may be important to the Turners.\n  \nWhile Dr. Myers may testify as\nto the behavior of a rational investor to the economic considerations of exchanging or redeeming\nshares upon the expiration of the JVA and explain the financial incentives built into the JVA, it is\nultimately for the jury to decide whether such incentives are indicative of a separate agreement that\ninsures a given outcome.\n{44}\n          \nThus, in connection with its decision on Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the Court\nwill consider the testimony of Dr. Myers to the extent that it goes to the economics of the transaction\nand the financial incentives contained in the JVA.\n  \nHowever, the Court has not considered opinion\ntestimony that concludes that the NWS preferred shareholders will act in a given way.\nD.\nDr. Joseph E. Johnson\n{45}\n          \nDefendants also challenge testimony of Dr. Joseph E. Johnson, professor of business and\neconomics at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\n  \nFirst, Defendants argue that Dr.\nJohnson is not qualified to testify as an expert.\n  \nDefendants base this argument on a portion of Dr.\nJohnson’s deposition testimony in which Johnson states that he is no more capable than the jury to\ndraw the ultimate conclusion in this case.\n  \n(Johnson Dep. 87.)\n  \nHowever, in the same portion of\ntestimony, Dr. Johnson clarifies that his role is “not to draw the conclusion for the jury, it is to assist\nthem in interpretation.”\n  \n(\nId\n.)\n  \nDr. Johnson correctly states his role as an expert witness.\n  \nHe may not\ndraw legal conclusions for the jury, but instead my offer testimony which will help the jury understand\nthe underlying facts.\n  \nThe Court believes that Dr. Johnson’s education and experience qualifies him to\ntestify as an expert on the subjects of economics, finance and business transactions.\n  \nDr. Johnson has\ntaught courses in these subject matters for over 35 years and is widely published in the areas of finance\nand economics.\n  \nIn addition, Dr. Johnson has testified as an expert on the subjects of business,\neconomics and finance several times in the past.\n  \nDr. Johnson’s education, training and experience\nqualifies him to provide expert testimony that will assist the jury in understanding the economic\naspects of the transaction between Defendants.\n{46}\n          \nDespite Dr. Johnson’s qualifications, there are some problems with his testimony.\n  \nLike Professor\nMyers, Dr. Johnson believes that the only viable option available to the NWS preferred shareholders is\nto exchange or redeem their stock.\n  \nAgain, Dr. Johnson may not testify that the JVA compels a given\nresult.\n  \nAs already discussed, the Court has ruled that the JVA gives the NWS preferred shareholders\nfour distinct options.\n  \nTo testify that the Turners have no choice under the JVA is contrary to the\nexpress terms of the agreement.\n \n{47}\n          \nIn opposition to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Praxair offers the opinion of Dr.\nJohnson that \"the Turners will redeem or exchange their NWS preferred stock between the years 2006\nand 2009 . . . in part because the failure of the Turners to exercise either of the options to redeem or\nexchange would result in the Turners holding a security with dividends producing below market\nyields.\"\n  \n(Pl. Br. Opp. S.J. citing Johnson Dep. at 173,75, 189, 246-53, 258.)\n  \nWhile Dr. Johnson may\nexplain the economics of the transaction and the economic consequences of the various options\ngranted by the JVA, he may not testify as to what the Turners \nwill\n do.\n  \nTherefore, for purposes of\nruling on the motion for summary judgment, the Court will strike the testimony of Dr. Johnson to the\nextent that it seeks to tell the Court what option the Turners \nwill\n exercise.\n{48}\n          \nIn addition, Dr. Johnson may not testify that he is of the opinion that Defendants entered into a\nsecret agreement.\n  \nFirst, the Court does not believe Dr. Johnson is qualified to testify to the ultimate\nissue in this case.\n  \nHe has so stated.\n  \nSecond, the Court has some concerns about the reliability of Dr.\nJohnson’s testimony.\n  \nDr. Johnson admits that he has no evidence of an explicit agreement, but that\nbased on his review of the totality of the circumstances, he believes that there was an “unspoken,”\n“unmemorialized” and “implicit understanding” among defendants.\n   \n(Johnson Dep. II. at 289-92,\n316.)\n  \nThe Court is unclear as to the methods that Dr. Johnson used to arrive at his conclusion; thus the\nCourt is unable to assess the reliability of his opinion.\n  \nHowever, regardless of the reliability of Dr.\nJohnson’s opinion, Dr. Johnson may not testify in a manner which urges the jury to reach a certain\nconclusion.\n  \nSee Norris v.

G.)\n  \nMr. Heyman explains that Airgas did not consolidate NWS\nfinancial statements only because of the temporary control exception, as opposed to the express terms\nthe JVA agreement.\n  \nFurthermore, Mr. Heyman concludes that\n  \nKPMG’s analysis and treatment of\nother accounting issues indicate that Airgas acquired a controlling financial interest in NWS.\n{52}\n          \nMr. Heyman reviewed the JVA, accounting documents, and the testimony of Alan DeMart, Chief\nFinancial Officer of NWS.\n  \nThis review led Mr. Heyman to the conclusion that Airgas and NWS\n“possessed an effective understanding of a ‘controlling financial interest’ under GAAP.”\n  \n(Heyman\nAff. ¶¶ 9, 10.)\n{53}\n          \nIn simplest terms, Mr. Heyman is offered as an accounting expert to testify that in his opinion:\n1.\n       \nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) determine when an entity should be\nconsolidated with another entity based upon the first having a controlling financial\ninterest in the second.\n \n2.\n       \nUnder GAAP, the JVA did not create a controlling financial interest in NWS by\nAirgas.\n3.\n       \nBased on his review of the work papers, KPMG, - Airgas outside accountants -\nconcluded that Airgas did have a controlling financial interest, but that it would not\nconsolidate the financial statements because the litigation with Praxair rendered the\ncontrol “temporary” under GAAP.\n4.\n       \nTherefore, KPMG must have relied on terms, agreements or conditions to the\nAirgas/NWS transaction outside the JVA to conclude that Airgas had a controlling\nfinancial interest in NWS.\n{54}\n          \nKPMG accountants deny knowledge of any separate agreement to complete the acquisition of\nNWS by Airgas and deny basing their accounting determination on the knowledge or existence of any\nseparate agreement.\n \n{55}\n          \nMr. Heyman may testify that, in his opinion, the terms of the JVA do not support a determination\nthat Airgas acquired a controlling financial interest in NWS.\n  \nHowever, Mr. Heyman cannot testify\nthat he is of the opinion a separate agreement existed.\n   \nHe is not qualified to render that opinion and\nthe jury will determine the credibility of the witness and draw its own inferences from the evidence.\n \nMr. Heyman’s testimony creates an issue of fact which may be rebutted by testimony from the KPMG\naccountants and/or others.\n  \nLike the other proffered experts, he may not express an opinion on the\nultimate issue to be decided by the jury in this case, but may provide testimony with respect to\nunderlying financial premises.\nF.\nConclusion as to Admission of Expert Testimony\n{56}\n          \nIn conclusion, the Court has decided to exclude some of the expert testimony offered by Praxair\nfrom consideration in connection with Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.\n  \nThe Court has\ndecided to strike the testimony of Professor Donaldson on the grounds that Professor Donaldson’s\nmethodology is unreliable.\n  \nIn addition, the Court has decided to consider the testimony of Mr. Barrett,\nDr. Myers and Dr. Johnson to the extent that they seek to testify about the economics of the transaction\namong Defendants or the financial incentives built into the JVA.\n  \nHowever, the Court will not consider\ntestimony that concludes that the JVA compels any given result, nor will the Court accept the opinions\nof Praxair’s experts that a separate agreement was in fact reached between Defendants.\n  \nFinally, the\nCourt will consider Mr. Heyman’s opinions about the significance of Airgas’ decision not to\nconsolidate based on the “temporary control” exception.\n  \nAt trial, an expert’s testimony will be\nadmitted only upon a showing that the expert is qualified, that his testimony is relevant and that his\nmethodology is reliable.\n  \nWhile the Court has discussed the standards it will apply with respect to the\ntestimony of experts, it will consider at trial whether the proffered expert testimony satisfies these\nadmissibility requirements.\nIV.\nMotion for Summary Judgment\n{57}\n          \nPursuant to Rule 56(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment shall\nbe rendered if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  \nSee \nN.C.

Smith\n, 597 F.2d 406, 414-15 (4th Cir. 1979); \nChesapeake\nPaper Prod. Co. v.

Kane,\nFederal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d\n § 2730 at 7 (1998) (summary judgment is generally\ninappropriate in actions where state of mind is at issue because “someone’s state of mind usually\nentails the drawing of factual inferences as to which reasonable people might differ – a function\ntraditionally left to the jury . . . .”).\n  \nHere the issue presented necessarily involves presentation of\ncircumstantial evidence to prove a fact denied by parties in sole possession of the direct evidence.\n{60}\n          \nThe third basis for denying summary judgment is that the Court cannot say with confidence that\nno reasonable jury could find in favor of Praxair.\n  \nThe evidence presented to the Court raises several\nissues of fact.\n  \nPraxair presents evidence that, when taken in the light most favorable to Praxair, sheds\ndoubt upon the legitimacy of the JVA and infers that Defendants entered into a separate, secret\nagreement for the sale of 100 percent of NWS to Airgas.\n  \nFor example, Praxair presents evidence that\nNWS sought to sell 100 percent of the company, both when it was in negotiations with Praxair and\nlater when it entered into negotiations with Airgas.\n  \nDefendants dispute this argument; however,\nDefendants’ position only indicates that there are issues of fact to be decided by the jury. Additionally,\nPraxair offers evidence, including the valuation of an investment banking firm retained by NWS, that\nthe Turners received from Airgas 100 percent of the economic value of NWS in 1996 instead of the 47\npercent ostensibly purchased as expressed in the JVA agreement.\n  \nThis evidence, when taken in the\nlight most favorable to Praxair, supports the argument that the JVA, which on its face did not provide\nfor the complete transfer of NWS to Airgas, did not embody the complete agreement between\nDefendants, but instead Defendants entered into a separate agreement for the complete transfer of\nNWS to Airgas.\n{61}\n          \nPraxair also offers evidence that the JVA has no legitimate business purpose, supporting the\nallegation that the JVA is a sham.\n  \nFirst, Praxair argues that Airgas shares none of the profits or losses\nof the JVA with NWS, which is contrary to North Carolina case law, which provides that “an\nagreement for the sharing of profits is essential to creation of a joint venture.”\n  \nRockingham Square\nShopping Center, Inc. v. Integon Life Ins. Corp.\n, 52 N.C. App. 633, 646, 279 S.E.2d 918, 926 (1981).\n \nSecond, Praxair presents evidence that operating synergies were not created by the JVA despite the\nparties’ contention that they are “partners.”\n  \nThird, Praxair presents evidence that Mr. Turner was\nforced out of NWS, contradicting Mr. Turner’s testimony that he remained in control of NWS.\n \nFinally, Praxair presents evidence that Airgas is treating NWS not as a joint venture partner, but as any\nother company it has acquired.\n  \nDefendants present counter-evidence to dispute the argument that the\nJVA is a sham.\n  \nAgain, at this juncture the Court’s role is not to weigh the evidence, but instead to\ndetermine whether questions of fact exist.\n  \nHere, the opposing evidence presented by the parties\nclearly reveals genuine issues of material facts.\n{62}\n          \nPraxair also presents a significant amount of evidence concerning the economic incentives built\ninto the JVA.\n  \nAccording to Praxair’s experts a rational investor would either exchange or redeem his\nshares upon the expiration of the JVA based on these incentives.\n  \nPraxair argues the JVA, with its\nfinancial incentives all point to one result, and is evidence that Defendants entered into an agreement\noutside of the JVA.\n  \nDefendants argue that such evidence ignores noneconomic considerations\nimportant to the Turners.\n  \nWhile this may be so, jurors are entitled to consider the evidence of\neconomic incentives in light of these noneconomic considerations and decide for themselves whether\nthe economic structure of the JVA is indicative of a separate agreement.\n{63}\n          \nThe parties also disagree about the value, if any, of the preferred shareholder rights that continue\nafter the JVA expires.\n  \nDefendants attach significance to these rights, arguing that the preferred\nshareholders have a right to “hold” their preferred stock, and that with such right attaches the\npossibility that shareholders can demand a higher dividend.\n  \nThus, according to Defendants, the hold\noption retained will be more valuable than the option to redeem or exchange.\n  \nPraxair takes issue with\nthis purported “hold option,” arguing that (1) under corporate law, in the absence of an agreement to\nthe contrary, the 5 percent dividend attached to the preferred stock is fixed; (2) Airgas rejected NWS’\nshareholders’ request to receive participating stock; and (3) the argument that the preferred\nshareholders could force an increased dividend ignores their fiduciary duties to act in the best interests\nof NWS and all of its stockholders.\n  \nAgain, this dispute about the evidence supports the Court’s\ndetermination that genuine issues of material fact exist, and that summary judgment is inappropriate.\n{64}\n          \nFinally, Praxair offers evidence that Airgas’ accountants and bankers viewed the transaction\nbetween Defendants as one involving the complete transfer of NWS to Airgas.\n  \nSpecifically, Praxair\nargues that, based on the information provided about the transaction, Airgas’ accountants treated the\ntransaction as an acquisition of NWS and Airgas’ lenders understood that Airgas was acquiring NWS.\n \nPraxair further argues that Airgas’ bankers concluded, based on information provided by Airgas and\nNWS, that the transaction between Defendants was one for the acquisition of NWS, and that the\nmechanism of a joint venture was simply a means to avoid triggering the RFR.\n  \nPraxair points to\ndocuments and deposition testimony supporting the argument that bankers privy to information about\nthe transaction all interpreted the transaction as an acquisition.\n{65}\n          \nIn further support of its claim, Praxair submits evidence that Airgas’ accountants determined that\nAirgas acquired a controlling financial interest in NWS; Airgas was required to consolidate NWS’\nfinancial results into Airgas’ financial statements unless a limited exception applied; such an exception\ndid apply; and, the exception could only apply after a determination that Airgas had a controlling\nfinancial interest in NWS.\n  \nThis determination may be further evidence that Airgas’ accountants\ntreated the transaction as an acquisition.\n  \nAdditionally, Praxair offers expert testimony that the\ndetermination that Airgas had a controlling financial interest was not supported by the terms of the\nJVA.\n  \nPraxair argues that the fact that the accountants’ analysis was not supported by the JVA\nevidences an agreement outside of the JVA.\n{66}\n          \nDefendants take the position that Rule 602 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence renders any\ntestimony by outside accountants or bankers characterizing the deal as an acquisition inadmissible.\n \nRule 602 provides that a witness may not testify to a matter unless his testimony is based upon\npersonal knowledge.\n  \nAccording to Defendants, the only witnesses whose testimony about the\ntransaction may be considered are those who actually participated in the transaction.\n  \nThe Court rejects\nthis argument as a blanket rule in this case.\n  \nCertainly, an individual may have personal knowledge\nabout the facts of a transaction based on information he is provided from those involved in negotiating\nthe deal.\n  \nSee \nCorbin on Contracts (rev. ed.) § 4.12 at 629 n.3 (the understandings of third persons “can\nbe good circumstantial evidence of what the understandings of the parties might be or reasonably\nshould be.”)\n  \nTo find otherwise forces the jury to accept the testimony of the parties to the transaction\nwithout allowing them to consider third parties’ view of the transaction based on information they\nobtained from the participating parties.\n  \nIf the testimony of these accountants and bankers is based on\npersonal knowledge, it reflects directly what those persons learned by reason of their personal\nparticipation in some aspect of the transaction.\n  \nThose decisions will be made at trial based on the\nsource of knowledge of the speaker and whether or not the speaker’s conclusions were merely\nassumptions.\nB.\nCircumstantial Evidence\n{67}\n          \nWhile the above discussion reveals several issues of fact, more issues of fact arise on\ncircumstantial evidence submitted to the Court.\n  \nThe circumstantial evidence, when taken as a whole\nand viewed in the light most favorable to Praxair, could support a jury decision that Defendants\nentered into an agreement outside of the JVA for the sale of NWS to Airgas.\n  \nIt would be inappropriate\nto grant summary judgment to Defendants under these circumstances.\n{68}\n          \nPraxair argues that it is entitled to an inference that the documents allegedly destroyed by\nDefendants contained evidence of a secret agreement between Airgas and National Welders, and that\nsummary judgment should not be granted on these grounds.\n  \nPraxair relies on the spoliation of\nevidence rule, which provides that the intentional destruction of evidence may give rise to an inference\nthat the destroyed evidence was harmful to the destroyer.\n  \nSee Red Hill Hosiery Mill, Inc. v. Magnetek,\nInc.\n, NO. COA 99-597 (N.C. Ct. App. May 16, 2000); \nMcClain v. Taco Bell Corp.\n, No. COA 98-750\n(N.C. Ct. App. Apr. 4, 2000.); \nYarborough v.

Bayliner Marine\nCorp.\n, 71 F.3d 148, 155 (4\nth\n Cir. 1995).\n  \nSpecifically, “where a party fails to introduce in evidence\ndocuments that are relevant to the matter in question and within his control . . . there is a presumption\nor at least an inference that the evidence withheld, if forthcoming, would injure his case.”\n \nYarborough\n, 139 N.C. at 209, 51 S.E.2d at 907-08.\n  \nThis rule of evidence is based on the common\nsense notion that individuals do not normally withhold or destroy evidence useful to their case.\n  \nSee\nKronisch\n, 150 F.3d at 126.\n  \nThe inference serves to restore the prejudiced party to the same position he\nwould have been in had the destruction of relevant documents not occurred.\n  \nSee id\n.\n \n{69}\n          \nThe standard for applying the spoliation inference is evidence that the party intentionally\ndestroyed potentially relevant materials while aware of the possibility of future litigation.\n  \nSee\nMcClain\n, slip op. at 13-14.\n  \nWhether materials were intentionally destroyed depends on the awareness\nof the party in possession of the documents.\n  \nTherefore, a party is entitled to the spoliation inference, if\nhe shows that the party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the time it\nwas destroyed.\n  \nSee \n150 F.3d at 126\n.\n  \nSuch an obligation arises when the party in possession of the\nevidence is on notice that the evidence may be relevant to future litigation.\n  \nSee id.\n  \nThus, where the\nparty was “aware of circumstances that were likely to give rise to future litigation” but nevertheless\ndestroyed potentially relevant documents, the jury may draw an adverse inference against such party.\n \nMcClain\n, slip op. at 14.\n  \nA showing of such awareness satisfies the requirement that the evidence was\nintentionally destroyed; bad faith or even awareness of impending trial need not be shown.\n  \nId. \nat 8-9.\n{70}\n          \nFurthermore, “the prejudiced party may be permitted an inference in his favor so long as he has\nproduced some evidence suggesting that a document or documents relevant to substantiating his claim\nwould have been included among the destroyed files.”\n  \nKronisch\n, 150 F.3d at 128.\n  \nStated simply, the\nmaterial destroyed must be potentially relevant to the issues presented at trial.\n  \nSee id\n.\n  \nTo ascertain\nrelevancy, the party seeking the spoliation inference must show that “there is [a] likelihood that the\ndestroyed evidence would have been of the nature alleged by the party affected by its destruction.”\n \nSee id \nat 127.\n  \nTherefore, while it is often difficult to ascertain the relevancy of the materials\ndestroyed, evidence identifying the types of documents destroyed may provide the court with\nsufficient information to make the relevancy determination.\nB. 1.\nAwareness of Pending Litigation\n{71}\n          \nThe record contains evidence that Airgas and NWS intentionally destroyed relevant documents at\na time when they fully anticipated litigation with Praxair.\n  \nFor example, Praxair has presented evidence\nof at least two letters serving to put Airgas and NWS on notice of the potential for future litigation\nwith Praxair.\n  \nFirst, as early as 1995, Bill Lichtenberger, CEO of Praxair, sent a letter to Peter\nMcCausland, CEO of Airgas, notifying McCausland that Praxair would not tolerate Airgas’\ninterference with its rights under the RFR with NWS.\n  \nLater, on July 2, 1996, just a few days after the\nexecution of the JVA, Praxair attorney Bill McClure sent a letter to NWS attorney Mark Bernstein\nreminding Bernstein of Praxair’s rights under the RFR and requesting copies of documents relating to\nthe JVA transaction.\n  \nDespite these letters, in July 1996, NWS individuals who were central to the\nnegotiations between NWS and Airgas met and ultimately decided to gather documents relating to the\nJVA, including drafts and handwritten notes, and take them to Bill Boone (General Counsel for NWS)\nfor destruction.\n  \nIn addition, there is evidence that, following the execution of the JVA, Bob Young, an\nattorney for Airgas and a participant in the negotiations, destroyed his files, also containing drafts and\nnotes taken during negotiations.\n{72}\n          \nAside from the letters mentioned above, Defendants have essentially admitted that they\nanticipated litigation even prior to the execution of the JVA.\n  \nDefendants asserted the work product\ndoctrine as a basis for withholding documents from Praxair and instructed witnesses not to answer\ndeposition questions relating to conversations prior to June 28, 1996 on the basis that such\nconversations were held in anticipation of litigation and are protected by the attorney work product\ndoctrine.\n  \nEvidence and common sense shows Defendants were fully aware of and anticipated the\npotential for litigation with Praxair.\n  \nNevertheless, Defendants admittedly destroyed documentation\nrelated to the negotiations surrounding and the execution of the JVA.\nB. 2.\nRelevancy of Destroyed Documents\n{73}\n          \nAccording to the testimony of many NWS and Airgas witnesses, the documents destroyed\nincluded drafts of the JVA, handwritten notes, correspondence, memos, and even entire files associated\nwith the transaction.\n  \nThere is no question that documents destroyed by Airgas were relevant to this\nlitigation.\n  \nThe central issue involves determining if the JVA reflects the entire agreement among\nDefendants.\n  \nCertainly drafts of the agreement between Defendants and handwritten notes of the\nnegotiations have some bearing on the question of whether the Defendants entered into an agreement\nnot embodied by the written terms of the JVA.\n  \nThe fact that files relating to the JVA were destroyed\nsatisfies the relevancy requirement of the spoliation inference.\n{74}\n          \nPraxair’s evidence of spoliation is such that the strength of Praxair’s allegation weighs against\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Defendants.\n  \nAlthough the destruction of evidence, standing\nalone, is insufficient to allow a party producing such evidence to support a summary judgment claim,\nsuch destruction “may push a claim that might not otherwise survive summary judgment over the\nline.”\n  \nKronisch\n, 150 F.3d at 128.\n  \nIn the words of the Second Circuit:\n[The Court] believe[s] that plaintiff has produced enough circumstantial evidence to\nsupport the inference that the destroyed [] files may have contained documents supporting\n(or potentially proving) [its] claim, and that the possibility that a jury would choose to draw\nsuch an inference, combined with the plaintiff’s circumstantial evidence, is enough to\nentitle plaintiff to a jury trial.\nId.\n  \nPraxair has produced sufficient circumstantial evidence in support of its argument that Defendants\ndestroyed potentially relevant documents.\n  \nIn addition, as discussed above, Praxair presented sufficient\ncircumstantial evidence to raise issues of fact.\n  \nWhile “the [spoliation] inference does not supply the\nplace of evidence of material fact, and does not shift the burden of proof so as to relieve the party upon\nwhom it rests of the necessity of establishing a prima facie case,” the inference, together with Praxair’s\ncircumstantial evidence, provides a sufficient basis for denying summary judgment.\n  \nMcLain\n, slip op.\nat 8 (quoting \nDoty v. Wheeler\n, 182 A. 468, 471 (Conn. 1936).\nV.\nConclusion\n{75}\n          \nThe motion in limine was premature and this Court substituted, in its place, a motion to strike\ncertain evidence submitted by Praxair in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.\n  \nThe Court\nevaluated the expert testimony submitted by Praxair in light of the requirements for admissibility of\nsuch testimony:\n  \nqualification, relevance, and reliability.\n  \nIn conjunction with this review, the Court\nidentified several factors helpful in assessing the reliability of the nonscientific expert testimony\noffered by Praxair.\n  \nAt trial, the Court must be satisfied not only that any expert is qualified and his\ntestimony is relevant, but also that his methodology is reliable based on these factors.\n{76}\n          \nThe Court decided to exclude some of Praxair’s proffered expert testimony from its consideration\nof the motion for summary judgment.\n  \nSpecifically, the Court strikes all of Mr. Donaldson’s testimony\nbased on a determination that Mr. Donaldson is unqualified to render an opinion on the ultimate issue,\nnor is his methodology reliable.\n  \nIn addition, the Court considered testimony regarding the economics\nof and the financial incentives in the JVA given by Dr. Myers and Dr. Johnson.\n  \nLikewise, the Court\nconsidered the testimony of Mr. Heyman that sought to explain the accounting principles relevant to\nthe decision not to consolidate the companies’ financials, and the significance of this decision in light\nof the terms of the JVA.\n  \nHowever, the Court did not consider any expert testimony that concluded a\ngiven result would in fact occur or that a separate agreement was in fact reached.\n{77}\n          \nAfter considering the testimony of Praxair’s witnesses, the evidence of record and the briefs and\noral arguments of counsel, the Court determines that summary judgment is inappropriate.\n   \nAirgas and\nNational Welders Supply make strong arguments that the parties to the JVA and their supporting cast\nof accountants, lawyers, investment bankers and others - all having excellent reputations in their\ncommunities - did not and would not participate in such a massive fraud.\n  \nMr. Turner, Mrs. Carpenter,\nMr. McCausland and Airgas vehemently deny such an agreement existed.\n  \nDefendants may well\nconvince a jury that;\n  \n1) the Turners need not make a decision about the stock until after the RFR\nexpired; 2) the Turners might voluntarily make an economically irrational decision, or; 3) the Turners\nare able to renegotiate the deal.\n  \nOn the other hand, Praxair may convince a jury that; 1) the Turners\nwanted to sell the company; 2) they wanted to sell it to Airgas; 3) they structured a deal which on\npaper did not trigger Praxair’s rights under the RFR;\n  \n4) the Turners got 100 percent of the value of\ntheir stock when the JVA was signed; 5) Mr. McCausland , Mr. Turner and Mrs. Carpenter met alone\nand agreed that when the time came to make the decision under the JVA, the Turner family would\nelect either to cash out or exchange their preferred stock for Airgas stock,\n  \nand; 6) Praxair may prove\nthat no rational investor would make a different decision.\n  \nThere are strong arguments made on both\nsides.\n  \nSummary judgment may not be entered under these circumstances.\n \n{78}\n          \n \nTherefore, it is hereby \nORDERED, ADJUDGED\n and \nDECREED\n that:\n1.\n       \nDefendants’ motion in limine is treated as a motion to strike and is granted in part and\ndenied in part; and\n2.\n       \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment is denied.\n \nThis the 14th day of August, 2000.\n \n \n \nThe Honorable Ben F. Tennille\nSpecial Superior Court Judge\nFor Complex Business Cases\n \n \n \n "
