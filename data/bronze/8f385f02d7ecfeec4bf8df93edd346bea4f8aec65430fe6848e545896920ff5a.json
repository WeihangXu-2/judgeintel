Page, Esq., \nJonathan L. Crook, Esq., for Plaintiff American Air Filter Company, Inc. \nd/b/a AAF International. \n \nSmith Moore Leatherwood, LLP  by George J. Oliver, Esq., Jeffrey R. \nWhitley, Esq., for Defendants Samuel C. Price, Jr. and Camfil USA Inc. \nd/b/a Camfil Americas.  \n \n McGuire, Judge. \n  \n \n \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n1. The Court does not make findings of fact on motions to dismiss under \nRule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (N.C. Stat. § 1A -1, Rule \n12(b)(6) (hereinafter the “Ru le(s)”), but only recites those facts included in the \nComplaint that are relevant to the Court’s determination of the Motion. See e.g.,  \nConcrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs Grp., Inc. , 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 \n(1986).  \n2. Plaintiff American Air Fi lter, Inc. (“ AAF”) is a Delaware corporation \nwith its principal place of business in Louisville, Kentucky. It “maintains operations” \nin Wake County, North Carolina. (VFAC ¶ 1.)1 AAF manufactures and services clean \nair products and equipment for commercial buildings, data centers , healthcare \nfacilities, food and beverage, microelectronics, and schools and universities. \n3. Camfil is a direct competitor of AAF. Camfil also does business in North \nCarolina, including Wake County. \n4. Price is a resident of Johnston County, North Carolina, and a former \nemployee of AAF. Price is currently employed with Camfil. \nA. AAF’s confidential business information. \n5. AAF’s “business is driven by relationships with its customers.” (VFAC ¶ \n8.) AAF has made significant investment in developing and enhancing customer \nrelationships and in obtaining and compiling a substantial body of  what it alleges is \n                                                 \n1References to the allegations contained in the Verified First Amended Complaint, filed by \nAAF on December 5, 2016, are denoted “VFAC.”  \n \n \n“confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets .  . . critical to its ability \nto serve existing and prospective” customers.  (VFAC ¶¶ 11, 12.) \n6. AAF maintains web -based tools called “Sales Playbook” and \n“Salesforce.com” in which it compiles confidential and proprietary information used \nin its sales efforts.  \n7. AAF also has a proprietary program called Total Cost of Ownership \nDiagnostics (“TCOD”). (VFAC ¶ 17.) TCOD provides technical data about AAF \nproducts and competitors’ products based on AAF’s internal and third -party testing \nand performance studies. TCOD also calculates the costs of ownership of AAF’s \nproducts as compared to competitors’ products.  \n8. AAF alleges that “[t]he specific trade secrets accessible through these \nprograms include,” inter alia: “secret and highly sensitive company -wide prices that \nAAF corporate officers negotiated on behalf of AAF with its national accounts”; \n“quoting tools  that use proprietary algorithms to create custom quotes that \nincorporate prices AAF negotiated with national accounts, AAF’s custom discounts, \nand customer-specific needs”; “audit reports created by AAF sales professionals at the \nphysical location of cust omer facilities which include identification of customers’ \ncurrent air filtration products, sizes, specifications, and customer -specific issues or \ntalking points developed by AAF sales professionals”; “information on the costs of \ngoods sold that could allo w calculation of AAF profit margins”; “technical \nspecifications and data that resulted from extensive internal and third-party product \n \n \ntesting and performance studies”; and “detailed drawings and product specifications \ncreated by AAF for new customer construction projects.” (VFAC ¶ 18.) \n9. All three databases are password -protected, requiring an employee to \nlog in with a username and password. As an additional security measure, information \nin Sales Playbook cannot be downloaded or printed. \n10. AAF immediately disables employee access to its databases  upon the \nemployee’s notice of resignation or termination from AAF, or if the employee indicates \nthat he or she is going to work for a competitor. (VFAC ¶¶ 25—26.) \nB. Price’s employment with AAF and the 2006 Agreement. \n11. In December 1989, AAF hired Price as Branch Manager  for territories \nconsisting entirely of counties in North Carolina. (VFAC ¶¶ 28, 30.)  Price was \n“responsible for leading and managing a sales team to achieve monthly, quarterly, \nand annual revenue goals, as well as growing sales and profitability in [his] assigned \nterritory.” (VFAC ¶ 29.)  Price remained Branch Manager until his resignation from \nAAF on August 12, 2016. During his employment, Price had full access to, was trained \nto use, and regularly relied on Sales Playbook, Salesforce.com, and TCOD to perform \nhis job duties. \n12. As a condition of employment, AAF required Price to sign employment \nagreements which set out the respective rights and responsibilities of Price and AAF \nin relation to Price’s employment with the company , the first of which was executed \non December 11, 1989 . Thereafter, AAF periodically entered into new agreements \n \n \nwith Price that “ altered Price’s and AAF’s respective rights and responsibilities .” \n(VFAC ¶ 42.) \n13. On November 13, 2006 , AAF and Price entered into a written “Sales \nRepresentative Employment Agreement” (“the 2006 Agreement”). (VFAC ¶ 43, Ex. B; \nhereinafter, “2006 Agreement.” ) This was the final written employment ag reement \nbetween AAF and Price. In exchange for the 2006 Agreement, AAF provided Price \nwith a 3.5% salary increase and a materially different Sales Quota and Contribution \nMargin Target (“Margin Target”).  \n14. The 2006 Agreement contained a covenant not to compete  that read as \nfollows: \nIf the Employee terminates this Agreement or Company  \nterminates this Agreement for cause, then in either event, \nfor a period of one (1) year after such termination, \nEmployee will not either  on Employee’s own behalf or on \nbehalf of any other person, firm, corporation or other \nentity, either directly or indirectly, (a) contact, for the \npurpose of diverting, any of Company’s customers or the \nAccounts;  (b) solicit the trade of, or trade with an y of \nCompany’s customers of the Accounts/Territory; (c) engage \nin any Competitive Business with the Accounts/Territory; \n(d) seek to cause any person, firm or corporation with whom \nthe Employee came in contact as a representative o f \nCompany to refrain from doing business in whole or in part \nwith or through Company; or (e) solicit or induce any \nemployee, current or future, of Company, to leave Company \nor to work for another individual. \n \n(2006 Agreement § 6.1.) \n15. The 2006 Agreement state s that the “Accounts/Territory”  from which \nPrice willd be restricted under the covenant is “set out o n Exhibit B” to the \n \n \nAgreement, but no Exhibit B was included with or attached to the 2006 Agreement. \n(2006 Agreement § 1.1.) \n16. The 2006 Agreement commenced on November 13, 2006, and was for a \nterm of one year. ( 2006 Agreement § 5.1.) The 2006 Agreement states that it “shall \nautomatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless terminated[.]” (Id.)  AAF \nalleges “Price received consideration for each rene wing year of the 2006 Agreement \nin the form of base salary, commission and or/bonus,” but does not allege that Price’s \nsalary or bonuses were increased in conjunction with the alleged renewals. (VFAC ¶ \n50.) \nC. Price’s resignation from AAF and employment with Camfil. \n17. On July 24, 2016, unbeknownst to AAF, Price accepted employment \nwith Camfil. (VFAC ¶¶ 53–54.) \n18. On August 5, 2016, Price submitted his notice of resignation from AAF \neffective at close of business on August 12, 2016. Price told AAF managers that he \nwas retiring from the air filtration industry and would not be joining a competitor. \n(VFAC ¶ 52.) In reliance on Price’s representations, AAF permitted Price to continue \naccessing its databases from August 5 until August 12, 2016. AAF alleges that had \nPrice told AAF that he was going to work for Camfil, AAF would have revoked Price’s \naccess to its databases and trade secrets immediately. (VFAC ¶¶ 56–58.) \n19. Price commenced his employment with Camfil sometime shortly after \nAugust 12, 2016.  Price is em ployed as a Branch Manager for Camfil in North and \n \n \nSouth Carolina performing “substantially the same duties” as he had with AAF. \n(VFAC ¶ 72.) \n20. Price accessed Salesforce.com at least three time s after accepting \nemployment with Camfil ; attended a training seminar on the TCOD on or around \nAugust 1, 2016 during which he accessed TCOD; and , acquired knowledge of the \nalgorithms and code used to create TCOD by receiving answers to detailed questions \nhe asked of AAF’s in-house developer of TCOD. (VFAC ¶¶ 60–63.) \n21. In late August 2016 AAF learned that  Price was working for Camfil. \nAAF sent a letter to Camfil’s Executive Vice President , Armando Brunetti \n(“Brunetti”) to inform Camfil of Price’s continuing obligations under the covenant not \nto compete and to request that Camfil refrain from inducing Price to breach the \ncovenant. Brunetti confirmed that  Camfil had hired P rice and that Price had sent \nfour emails to customers he had previously serviced at AAF. AAF requested that Price \nimmediately cease employment with Camfil, refrain from contacting AAF customers \nand disclosing confidential information. \n22. AAF alleges that “several customers have  contacted AAF to alert them \nthat Price was soliciting business from them on behalf of Camfil.” (VFAC ¶ 78.)  The \nVFAC does not allege that AAF has lost any customers as a result of Price’s or \nCamfil’s conduct or that Camfil has used any specific AAF confidential information \nor trade secrets. AAF does not allege any specific economic injury or damages, but \nalleges only that “AAF has suffered and will continue to suffer substantial irreparable \ninjury and actual damages.” (VFAC ¶¶ 88, 95, 101, 115, 120, and 126.)  \n \n \n23. AAF initiated this action by filing a Complaint  on November 4, 2016. \nAAF amended its Complaint by filing the VFAC on December 5, 2016. In the VFAC, \nAAF makes claims against Price for breach of contract  (Count I) and breach of \nfiduciary duty  (Count II); a claim against Camfil for  tortious interference with \ncontract (Count III); and claims against both Price and Camfil for misappropriation \nof trade secrets in violation of the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act, G.S. \n§ 66-151, et seq. (“NCTPA”)  (hereinafter, references to the North Carolina General \nStatutes will be to “G.S.”)  (Count IV), violation of t he North Carolina Unfair an d \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act. G.S. § 75.1 et seq. (“UDTPA”) (Count V), and civil \nconspiracy (Count VI).  \n24. On January 17, 2017, Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss. The \nMotion was fully briefed, the Court has heard oral arguments, and it is now ripe for \ndisposition. \nDISCUSSION \nA. Rule 12(b)(6) Standard. \n25. In ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s \ninquiry is “whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as \ntrue are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal \ntheory, whether properly labeled or not .” Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank , 85 N.C. App. \n669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987). Our appellate courts frequently reaffirm that \nNorth Carolina is a  notice pleading state. See, e.g., Feltman v. City of Wilson , 238 \nN.C. App. 246, 252, 767 S.E.2d 615, 620 (2014) (quoting Wake Cty. v. Hotels.com, L.P., \n \n \n762 S.E.2d 477, 486 ( N.C. Ct. App. 2014))  (“Under notice pleading, a statement of \nclaim is adequate if it gives sufficient notice of the claim asserted to enable the \nadverse party to answer and prepare for trial, to allow for the application of the res \njudicata, and to show the type of case brought.”)).  \n26. In deciding a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), t he Court construes the \nComplaint liberally and accepts all allegations as true. Laster v. Francis , 199 N.C. \nApp. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 (2009). However, the Court is not required “to \naccept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, \nor unreasonable inferences.” Good Hope Hosp., Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 174 N.C. App. 266, 274, 620 S.E.2d 873, 880 (2005).  In addition, t he Court \nmay consider docume nts which are the subject of the complaint and to which the \ncomplaint specifically refers, including the contract that forms the subject matter of \nthe action. Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60–61, 554 S.E.2d 840, \n847 (2001). \n27. Dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its face reveals that no law supports plaintiff’s claim; (2) when the \ncomplaint reveals on its face the absence of fact sufficient to make a good claim; [or] \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the complaint necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s \nclaim.” Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985). Otherwise, \n“a complaint should not be dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty \nthat plaintiff is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in \nsupport of the claim.” Sutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 103, 176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970).  \n \n \nB. Choice of Law.  \n28. The parties dispute whether the law of North Carolina or Kentucky \ngoverns the contract and tort claims raised in the VFAC. AAF has its principal place \nof business and corporate headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. On the other hand, \nAAF brought this lawsuit in North Carolina, and Price worked for AAF, and currently \nworks for Camfil, in North Carolina . In addition, virtually all of the conduct \nunderlying the claims occurred in North Carolina. The Court will first consider the \nchoice of law questions. \ni. Breach of Contract. 2 \n29. AAF claims Price breached the  2006 Agreement. The 2006 Agreement \ncontains a choice of law pr ovision that states that “[t]he  construction performance \n(sic) and completion of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of \nKentucky.” (2006 Agreement § 7.2.) North Carolina courts generally recognize the \nvalidity and enforceability of such provisions unless: \n(a) the chosen state has  no substantial relationship to the \nparties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable \nbasis for the parties’ choice,  \n                                                 \n2 Defendants contend that North Carolina law applies to the breach of contract claim, but do \nnot make any argument in support of their contention in their Brief in Support of the Motion \nto Dismiss. Instead, Defendants state in their brief that they “incorporate the argument that \nNorth Carolina law controls the contractual anal ysis, as briefed in response to Plaintiff ’s \nMotion for Preliminary Inju nction.” (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 4, fn. 1.) The General \nRules of Practice and Procedure for the North Carolina Business  Court (“BCR”) do not \nexpressly permit parties to incorporate previously -filed briefs and documents outside of the \nbrief at issue, at least not to supplement the substantive text of the brief at issue. In fact, \nBCR 7.8 provides strict word limits on briefs  submitted to this Court. Even if incorporation \nof previous brief s were allowable, it appears a party incorporating a previously -filed brief \nwould have to certify under BCR 7.8 that the brief and the incorporated brief did not exceed \nthe word limits. Defendants have not done so in this case. As a result, the Court declines to \nconsider Defendants’ arguments and authorities regarding choice of law issues contained in \nother filings with the Court. \n \n \n \nor  \n \n(b) application of the law of the chosen state would be \ncontrary to the fundamental policy of a state which has a \nmaterially greater interest than the chosen state in the \ndetermination of the particular issue and which . . . would \nbe the state of applicable law in the absence of an effective \nchoice of law by the parties.  \n \nCable Tel Servs ., 154 N.C. App. 639, 642 –43, 574 S.E. 2d 31, 33 –34 (quoting \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 187 (1971)). \n30. AAF maintains a principal place of business in Louisville, Kentucky.  \nThus, Kentucky has a substantial relationship to this matter and there is a \nreasonable basis to the parties’ choice. Mosteller Mansion, LLC v. Mactec Eng’g & \nConsulting of Ga., Inc ., No. COA07 -664, 2008 N.C. App. LEXIS 1011, *9, (May 20, \n2008) (finding that Georgia has a substantial relationship to the dispute where a \nparty to the contract maintained its principal place of business in Georgia). \n31. In addition, the Court concludes that the applica tion of Kentucky law \nwould not be contrary to the fu ndamental polic ies of North Carolina. “To render \nforeign law . . . contrary to public policy, it must violate some prevalent conception of \ngood morals or fundamental principle of natural justice or involve injustice to the \npeople of the foreign state[,] [such as involving] prohibited marriages, wagers , \nlotteries, racing, gaming, and the sale of liquor.” Mosteller, 2008 N.C. App. LEXIS \n1011, at *9 (quoting Boudreau v. Baughman, 322 N.C. 331, 342, 368 S.E.2d 849, 857–\n58 (1988) (citations omitted). \n \n \n32. In their reply, Defendants argue that applying Kentucky law would \nviolate public policy because Price did not receive consideration and North Carolina \nwould not enforce a covenant not to compete that was not supported by consideration. \n(Defs.’ Reply Supp. Mot. Dismiss 1.)  In support of this contention, Defendants cite \nCox v. Dine-A-Mate, Inc., 129 N.C. App. 773, 501 S.E.2d 353 (1998).  In Cox, the Court \nof Appeals considered the application of a New York choice of law provision contained \nin a non-compete agreement entered into by a North Carolina employee. The Court \napplied the “ A.E.P. test” which provides that “a covenant not to compete violates \npublic policy ‘where the sole purpose is to prevent competition rather than protect a \nlegitimate interest of the employer.’” Cox, 129 N.C. App. at 778, 501 S.E.2d at 356 \n(quoting A.E.P Indus. v. McClure, 308 N.C. 393, 403, 302 S.E.2d 754, 761 (1983)). The \ncourt reasoned that the agreement at issue was executed to prevent competition , \nrather than to protect the defendant’s business interests, because the defendant did \nnot provide consideration to the plaintiff  other than continued employment, and \nbecause the non-compete covenant lacked a reasonable restriction as to territory. Id. \nat 778, 501 S.E.2d at 356. The court concluded: \nWe recognize, however, that the outcome of the \nconsideration test migh t well be different if examined \nunder New York law . . . . What concerns this Court is that, \nin a case such as this one, application of New York law \nwould be a violation of North Carolina public policy in that \nthe contract before us falls squarely into the category of an \nattempt to prevent competition rather than to protect a \nlegitimate interest of the employer. \nId. \n \n \n33. Finally, the Court  in Cox held that the non-compete covenant was not \nintended to serve a legitimate business purpose because the alleged confidential \ninformation the defendant’s sought to protect through the covenant were not trade \nsecrets.  Id. at 780, 501 S.E.2d at 357. \n34. No such fundamental policy concerns exist in this case.  Although \nKentucky law regarding the enforceability o f non -compete covenants differs from \nNorth Carolina law in some regards, Kentucky law requires that an enforceable non-\ncompete covenant be supported by consideration other than continued employment, \nsee Creech v. Brown, 433 S.W.3d. 345, 353–54, 2014 Ky. LEXIS 233, *20–25 (Ky. Sup. \nCt. 2014), and that it have  a geographic restriction,  see Hammons v. Big Sandy \nClaims Serv., Inc., 567 S.W.2d 313, 315, 1978 Ky. App. LEXIS 543, *3 –4 (1978). In \nother word s, Kentucky law would not permit enforcement of a covenant without \nconsideration. \n35. In addition, the allegations before the Court, including the terms of the \n2006 Agreement, do not support the conclusion that the sole purpose of the 2006 \nAgreement was to prev ent competition. As discussed below, AAF has alleged that \nPrice had access to and opportunity to misappropriate AAF’s trade secrets. Protecting \nagainst the acquisition and use of AAF’s trade secrets by competitors  is a legitimate \nbusiness interest.   \n36. Because Kentucky has a substantial relationship to the parties and the \ntransaction, and application of Kentucky law does not violate North Carolina public \n \n \npolicy, the Court concludes that Kentucky law applies to AAF’s claim for breach of \ncontract. \nii. Breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference, and civil conspiracy. \n37. AAF has also makes tort claims for breach of fiduciary duty, tortious \ninterference with contract, and civil conspiracy. In North Carolina, “[f]or actions \nsounding in tort, the state where the in jury occurred is considered the situs of the \nclaim,” or the lex loci delicti. Harco Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Grant Thronton LLP , 206 N.C. \nApp. 687, 692, 698 S.E.2d 719, 722 –23 (2010) (quoting Boudreau v. Baughman, 322 \nN.C. 331, 335, 368 S.E.2d 849, 853–54 (1988)).  \n38. AAF alleges that Price breached a fiduciary duty to AAF by lying to AAF \nabout his resignation and plans to work for Camfil , by soliciting his former AAF \ncustomers once he joined Camfil, and by using AAF’s confidential information and \ntrade secrets inappropriately. (VFAC ¶ 92.)  All of this alleged conduct apparently \noccurred in North Carolina, where Price was employed.  At the time Price resigned, \nhis customers were located in North Carolina and South Carolina, and with Camfil, \nPrice is responsible for a territory consisting of North Carolina and South Carolina. \n(VFAC ¶¶ 30 , 72.) Any injury to AAF’s customer relationships would have been to \nthose customers he solicited in its sales markets in North Carolina and South \nCarolina.3 Harco, 206 N.C. App. at  698, 698 S.E.2d at 72 6 (concluding that the \nplaintiff had its principal place of business in Illinois, but suffered injury in North \nCarolina when Department of Insurance seized the plaintiff’s funds held in a North \n                                                 \n3 Neither party argues that South Carolina law should be applied to any of the claims in \nthis action. \n \n \nCarolina trust account); Lloyd v. Carnation Co., 61 N.C. App. 381, 387–88, 301 S.E.2d \n414, 418 (1983) (applying Virginia law to tort claims where acts were done entirely \nwithin Virginia, although defendant, a North Carolina business, was alleged to have \nwrongfully forced plaintiff out of marketing territory in Virginia, North Carolina, and \nSouth Carolina); Synovus Bank v. Parks, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 36, *15–17 (N.C. Super. \nCt. July 30, 2013) (holding that North Carolina was the place of injury, rather than \nthe complainant’s state of residence, where the loss in value of property at issue was \nlocated in North Carolina ). Accordingly, North Carolina law should be applied to \nAAF’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty. \n39. AAF’s third cause of action alleges that Camfil tortuously interfered \nwith the 2006 Agreem ent by inducing Price to violate his obligations under the \nagreement. (VFAC ¶¶ 96–101.) Tortious interference requires actual pecuniary harm. \nPinewood Homes, Inc. v. Harris , 184 N.C. App. 597, 604 –05, 646 S.E.2d 826, 832 \n(2007) (providing the elements of t ortious interference with contract). Again, a ny \neconomic damages stemming from Camfil’s alleged interference with the 2006  \nAgreement arose from injuries to AAF’s customer relationships in North Carolina  \nand South Carolina  caused by Price allegedly breaching the agreement . Under the \nlex loci delicti test, North Carolina law should be applied to the claim for tortious \ninterference with contract.  \n40. AAF’s claim against Price and Camfil for civil conspiracy requires AAF \nto establish “the agreement of two or more parties to carry out the conduct and injury \nresulting from the agreement.” Toomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. App. 462, 483, 574 S.E.2d \n \n \n76, 92 (2002). Any agreement between Price and Camfil to carry out a wrongful act \nagainst AAF was contrived to damage AAF’s sales in North Carolina. Again, the only \nalleged injuries suffered by AAF are to i ts business in North Carolina , and possibly \nSouth Carolina . The Court will apply  North Carolina law to the claim for civil \nconspiracy. \nC. AAF has not stated a claim for breach of contract because the VFAC does not \nallege that the renewals of the 2006 Agreement were supported by \nconsideration. \n \n41. AAF alleged that Price breached the 2006 Agreement by, inter alia , \naccepting employment with Camfil, soliciting AAF’s customers, and disclosing AAF’s \nconfidential business information . (VFAC ¶ 87.)  Defendants argue that the non -\ncompete provision in the 2006 Agreement is unenforceable because it is not supported \nby consideration, is overly broad in restri cting Price’s activities , lacks a geographic \nscope, and its restrictions on solicitation of AAF’s customers are vague and too broad \nin scope. (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 4 –12.) The Court concludes that at the time \nof Price’s resignation, the 2006 Agreement was not supported by consideration and, \nbecause the 2006 Agreement did not contain a geographic or territorial restriction, it \ncannot be enforced.   \n42. Under Kentucky law, a non -compete covenant entered into by an \nemployee after his initial hiring must b e supported by consideration beyond his \ncontinued employment. Charles T. Creech, Inc. v. Brown , 433 S.W.3d 345, 353 –54, \n2014 Ky. LEXIS 233, *20–25 (Ky. Sup. Ct. 2014); Cmty. Ties of Am., Inc. v. NDT Care \nServs., LLC, No. 3:12-cv-00429-CRS, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14990, *53 (W.D. Ky. \n \n \nFeb. 6, 2015) (citing Cent. Adjustment Bureau, Inc. v. Ingram Assocs., Inc., 622 S.W.2d \n681, 685, 198 Ky. App. LEXIS 296, *10 –11 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981))  (“As early as 1981, \nKentucky law has required that an employment agreements [sic] signed by \nemployees after the date of his or her initial employment  must be supported \nby more than just continued employment to be enforceable .”). In order to constitute \nconsideration, the employment relationship between the parties  must change \nfollowing the signing of a restrictive covenant . Creech, 433 S.W.3d at 354, 2014 Ky. \nLEXIS 233 at *24–25.  Such changes could include  changing the employee’s status \nfrom at -will to “for c ause” termination, providing the employee a promotion or \nincreased compensation, or providing the employee with specialized training. Id.; \nCmty. Ties of Am., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14990, at *54. \n43. In the VFAC, AAF alleges that the 2006 Agreement “was supported by \nthe additional consideration of increased salary o f 3.5%, which totaled $1,001.00[,] \n[in addition to containing]  a materially different [Margin Target] compared to \n[Price’s] 2005 Employment Agreement.” (VF AC ¶ 46.) These allegations clearly are \nsufficient to establish that the 2006 Agreement was supported by consideration for \nthe one year term of the agreement from November 13, 2006, through November 12, \n2007. \n44. The VFAC, however, does not sufficiently allege that Price was provided \nconsideration for the yearly renewals of the 2006 Agreement from 2007 through the \nend of Price’s employment . Instead, AAF alleges only that “Price received \nconsideration for each renewing year of the 2006 Agreement in the form of b ase \n \n \nsalary, commission and/or bonus.” (VFAC ¶ 50.) AAF, however, does not allege that \nit provided Price with any specific consideration for each yearly renewal. For \nexample, AAF does not allege that it  increased Price’s base salary, commission, or \nbonuses. AAF does not allege that Price received promotions or any change in job \nduties in conjunction with yearly renewals.  In fact, AAF expressly alleges that Price \nwas employed as a Branch Manager “continuously” from his hire in 1989 “until his \nresignation on August 12, 2016.” (VFAC ¶ 28.)4  \n45. While AAF alleges that it  provided Price with certain training during \nhis employment, it does not allege when such training took place, nor that the \ntraining was provided as consideration for Price’s promises in the 2006 Agreement or \nany renewals of the agreement. (VFAC ¶¶ 30, 31, and 34.) The only training that AAF \nalleges took place after Price executed the 2006 Agreement was a training seminar \non the TCOD that Price attended on August 1, 2016. (VFAC ¶ 61.) Again, AAF does \nnot allege that Price received th is training in exchange for any non-compete or \nconfidentiality obligations. The allegation that Price received training almost 10 \nyears after the execution of the 2006 Agreement is not sufficient to support a claim \nthat Price received consideration for each of the alleged renewals of that Agreement. \n46. The Court is not required to accept AAF’s legal conclusion 5 that Price \nreceived “consideration” for the renewals of the 2016 Agreement when there are not \nfacts pleaded in supp ort. Bunch v. Britton , No. COA16 -181, 2017 N.C. App. LEXIS \n                                                 \n4 AAF also alleges that Price’s job responsibilities did not change at any time after December \n31, 2011. (VFAC ¶ 44.) \n5 Under Kentucky law, whether consideration has been provided is a question of law. Grass \nv. Akins, 368 S.W.3d 150, 153, 2012 Ky. App. LEXIS 79, *7 (Ky. Ct. App. May 25, 2012). \n \n \n435, *21 (June 6, 2017) (“Although well -pleaded factual allegations of the complaint \nare treated as true for purposes of a 12(b)(6) motion, conclusions of law or \nunwarranted deductions of facts are  not admitted .”). The absence of such factual \nsupport is particularly problematic where AAF relies on an agreement that allegedly \nrenewed for successive one-year terms during the last 10 years of Price’s employment. \nAny failure to provide consideration for  a given year’s renewal would break the \n“chain” and render the 2006 Agreement unenforceable as to subsequent years. AAF’s \nallegations in the VFAC do not support the notion that AAF provided consideration, \nor that Price’s employment relationship with AAF ch anged, in exchange for his \nagreement to renew the non -compete covenant each year after 2006.  Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the claim for breach of contract should be GRANTED, and the claim \nshould be dismissed WITHOUT PREJUDICE. \nD. AAF has not alleged facts that support a claim that Price owed AAF a fiduciary \nduty because Price did not have dominance and influence over AAF. \n \n47. AAF alleges that Price, as Branch Manager, owed it a fiduciary duty of \nloyalty which obligated him “to act exclusively in AAF’s best interests,” and that Price \nbreached this duty by, inter alia , lying to AAF about his intentions following his \nresignation, and using AAF’s confidential information and trade secrets a fter his \nresignation from AAF. (VFAC ¶¶ 90—95.) \n48. To sufficiently plead a c laim for breach of fiduciary duty, the plaintiff \nmust allege that (1) a fiduciary relationship existed (2) the defendant breached that \nduty, and (3) the breach proximately caused plaintiff’s injury. BDM Inv v. Lenhill, \nInc., 2014 NCBC LEXIS 6, *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 20, 2014)  \n \n \n49.  “For a breach of fiduciary duty to exist, there must first be a \nfiduciary relationship between the parties.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651–52, \n548 S.E.2d 704, 707 (2001). A fiduciary relationship may arise when “there has been \na special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act \nin good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence[.]”  \nId. (quoting Abbitt v. Gregory, 201 N.C. 577, 598, 160 S.E. 896, 906 (1931)) (internal \nquotations omitted).  Such a relationship “extends to any possible case in which a \nfiduciary relationship exists in fact, and in which there is confidence reposed in one \nside, and resulting domination and influence on the other .” Id. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at \n707–08 ( quoting Abbitt, 201 N.C. at 598, 160 S.E. at 906 ). “Only when one party \nfiguratively holds all the cards—all the financial power or technical information, for \nexample—have North Carolina courts found that the special circumstance o f \na fiduciary relationship has arisen.”  Lockerman v. South River Elec.  Membership \nCorp., 794 S.E.2d 346, 352, 2016 N.C. App. LEXIS 1234, * 11 (2016) (quoting S.N.R. \nMgmt. Corp. v. Danube Partners 141, LLC , 189 N.C. App. 601, 613, 659 S.E.2d 442, \n451 (2008)). \n50. North Carolina’s courts have consistently held that an employer -\nemployee relationship is not a fiduciary one, even where the employee has significant \nmanagement authority, absent some allegation that the employee exercised  \ndominance and control over his employer. See Austin Maint. Constr., Inc. v. Crowder \nConstr. Co., 224 N.C. App. 401, 410, 742 S.E.2d 535, 542 (2012) (finding no breach of \nfiduciary duty because “any confidence that AAF reposed in [employee] consisted of \n \n \nnothing more than relying on him to competently perform his assigned duties”); \nDalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at 708 (quoting King v. Atl. Coast Line \nR.R. Co., 157 N.C. 44, 62–63, 72 S.E. 801, 808 (1911)) (“Under the general rule, ‘ the \nrelation of employer and employee is not one of those regarded as confidential.’” ); \nReichhold Chems., Inc. v. Goel , 146 N.C. App. 137, 155, 555 S.E.2d 281, 292 (2001) \n(finding no fiduciary duty for company vice president because “[a] managerial \nposition alone does not demonstrate the requisite domination and influence on the \nother”); Artistic S. Inc. v. Lund, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 113, *41–43 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. \n9, 2015) (dismissing fiduciary duty claim against salesperson, noting that allegations \nof soliciting clients and collecting money did not support finding that employee “held \nall the cards”); Allegis Grp., Inc. v. Zachary Piper LLC , 2013 NCBC LEXIS 12, *32 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 25, 2013) (holding that “basic management responsibilities” do \nnot support fiduciary relationship); Battleground Veterinary Hosp., P.C. v. McGeough, \n2007 NCBC LEXIS 33, *16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 19, 2007) (“Even when an employee \nis entrusted with substantial managerial authority, a fiduciary relationship will not \nexist absent evidence that such authority led to the employer being subjugated to the \n‘improper influences or domination of [its] employee.’”) (citation omitted). \n51. Here, AAF has not alleged that Price held a position of dominance and \ninfluence, or “figuratively h eld all the cards,” in his relationship with AAF. To the \ncontrary, the VFAC alleges a garden -variety employment relationship between a \nmanagement-level employee with sales responsibilities  and his employer . The \nallegations suggest that Price had authority to manage sales employees within \n \n \ncertain territories in North Carolina and perhaps other states, and to sell AAF’s \nproducts to customers under parameters est ablished by AAF.  (VFAC ¶¶ 29; see \ngenerally 2006 Agreement .) Far from having domination or control ov er AAF, the \n2006 Agreement, which AAF alleges set the terms of Price’s employment, gave AAF \nalmost unfettered authority to terminate Price at -will, change his territory and \ncustomers, and change his compensation. Dalton, 353 N.C. at 652, 548 S.E.2d at 708 \n(“[A]bsent a finding that the employer in . . . was somehow subjugated to the improper \ninfluences or domination of his employee -- an unlikely scenario as a general \nproposition and one not evidenced by these facts in particular -- we cannot conclude \nthat a fiduciary relationship existed between the two.”); see also DSM Dyneema, LLC \nv. Thagard, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 50, *21 –22 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 12, 2015) (h olding \nthat the plaintiff had failed to allege “the extraordinary or special type of employer -\nemployee relationship that gives rise to a fiduciary  duty” because the facts pleaded \n“failed to allege that Thagard enjoyed the sort of domination or influence over DSM \nthat our courts have found necessary to create a fiduciary duty”). \n52. The facts alleged in the VFAC do not support the legal conclusion that \nPrice owed AAF a fiduciary duty.  Defendants’ motion to dismiss AAF’s claim for \nbreach of fiduciary duty should be GRANTED. \nE. AAF failed to allege that the 2006 Agreement was valid and enforceable.  \nAccordingly, AAF’s claim for tortious interference with contract must fail. \n \n53. AAF claims that Camfil tortiously interfered with AAF’s emp loyment \ncontract with Price, particularly with the non-compete and confidentiality covenants \nin the agreement. (VFAC ¶¶ 96 —101.) To survive a motion to dismiss, AAF must \n \n \nallege the five elements of tortious interference with a contract: “(1) a valid contract  \nbetween the plaintiff  and a third person, conferring upon the plaintiff some \ncontractual right against the third person; (2) t he defendant knows of the contract; \n(3) the defendant intentionally induces the third person not to perform the contract; \n(4) the defendant acts without justification;  and (5) the defendant’s conduct causes \nactual pecuniary harm to the plaintiffs.” Pinewood Homes, 184 N.C. App. 597, 604–\n05, 646 S.E.2d 826, 832 (2007). \n54. The Court has concluded that the 2006 Agreement was not valid  and \nenforceable at the time of Price’s separation from AAF.  Accordingly, AAF’s claim for \ntortious interference with contract must fail, and Defendants’ motion to dismiss this \nclaim should be GRANTED. \nF. AAF has sufficiently alleged a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets. \n \n55. AAF claims that Price and Camfil misappropriated its trade secrets in \nviolation of the NCTSPA. (VFAC ¶¶ 103–116.) \n56. “To plead misappropriation of trade secrets, ‘a plaintiff must identify a \ntrade secret with sufficient particularity so as to enable a defendant to delineate that \nwhich he is accused of misappropriating and a court to determine whether \nmisappropriation has or is threatened to occur.’” VisionAIR, Inc. v. James, 167 N.C. \nApp. 504, 510 –11, 606 S.E.2d 359, 364 (2004) (citation omitted). “The threshold \nquestion in any misappropriation of trade secrets case is whether the information \nobtained constitutes a trade secret[.]”Combs & Assocs. v. Kennedy, 147 N.C. App. 362, \n369, 555 S.E.2d 634, 639 (2001). The NCTSPA defines a “trade secret” as: \n \n \n[B]usiness or technical information, including but not \nlimited to a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation \nof in formation, method, technique, or process that: (a) \nDerives independent actual or potential commercial value \nfrom not being generally known or readily ascertainable \nthrough independent development or reverse engineering \nby persons who can obtain economic va lue from its \ndisclosure or use; and (b) Is the subject of efforts that are \nreasonable under the circumstances to maintain its \nsecrecy.  \n \nG.S. § 66-152(3) \n57. The burden of proof is on the owner of the trade secrets to establish the \nprima facie case of misappropriation by introducing “substantial evidence” that the \ndefendant: “(1) knows or should have known of the trade secret; and (2) has had \nspecific opportunity to acquire it for disclosure or use or has acquired, disclosed, or \nused it without the express or implied consent or authority of the owner.”  G.S. § 66-\n155 (1999)). \n58. Defendants argue that AAF has not alleged its trade secrets with \nsufficient specificity to survive dismissal. (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 17–19.) The \nCourt disagrees. AAF alleges that the TCOD is a proprietary program developed by \nAAF that contains data reg arding AAF’s and its competitor s’ products compiled, in \npart, through AAF’s own inte rnal testing and performance studies. The program \ncalculates the costs of ownership of AAF’s product s as compared to its competitor s’ \nproducts based on the customer’s operating parameters.  (VFAC ¶ 17.) AAF also \nalleged that the trade secrets at issue in this matter included, inter alia, information \nabout prices AAF negotiated with its national accounts, tools that use proprietary \nalgorithms to create custom quotes, reports created by AAF at its customers’ facilities \n \n \nwhich include identification of customers’ current air filtration products, sizes, \nspecifications, and other customer -specific issues, AAF’s costs of goods sold from \nwhich AAF’s profit margins can be determined, and detailed drawings and product \nspecifications created by AAF for customers. (VFAC ¶ 18.) This description of the \ninformation at issue satisfies AAF’s obligations to identify its trade secrets  with \nsufficient specificity at this stage of the litigation. \n59. Defendants also contend  that AAF has not alleged tha t Defendants \nmisappropriated its trade secrets.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 19 –20.) Again, the \nCourt disagrees and concludes AAF has sufficiently alleged misappropriation. \n60. First, AAF has alleged that Price knew of and had access to AAF’s data \nbases containing its trade secrets (e.g., VFAC ¶ 35.) Accordingly, the first prong under \nG.S. § 66-155 is satisfied. \n61. AAF has also pleaded that Price had opportunity to, and did, acquire \nAAF’s trade secrets.  AAF alleges that because Price deceived AAF about the fact he \nwas going to work for Camfil, AAF did not terminate Price’s access to its trade secrets, \nbut instead continued his access until August 12, 2016.  AAF would have terminated \nPrice’s access immediately had it known his true intentions. (VFAC ¶¶ 56–58.) AAF \nalleges that between accepting employment with Camfil and his final day of \nemployment with AAF , Price accessed AAF’s password-protected systems at least \nthree times, and otherwise obtained trade secret information from AAF’s employees. \n(VFAC ¶¶ 60–63.) \n \n \n62. Finally, AAF alleges, albeit on information and belief, that Camfil hired \nPrice for the purposes of gaining access to AAF’s trade secrets and that Price has and \ncontinues to disclose AAF’s trade secrets to Camfil.  (VFAC ¶¶ 74, 84.) \n63.  The Court concludes that AAF has alleged that Price accessed its trade \nsecrets under circumstances where he did not have AAF’s consent, acqui red AAF’s \ntrade secrets, and disclosed those trade secrets to Camfil.  AAF’s claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets should not be dismissed, and Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss the claim for misappropriation of trade secrets should be DENIED. \nG. AAF has alleged a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices. \n64. AAF alleges that Price and Camfil’s actions as alleged constitute unfair \nand deceptive trade practices in violation of the UDTPA. (VFAC ¶¶ 118 –121.) The \nUDTPA declares unlawful “[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, \nand unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” G.S. § 75-1.1. To \nstate a valid UDTP c laim, a plaintiff must allege: “ (1) an unfair or deceptive act or \npractice, or unfair method of competition, (2) in or effecting commerce, and (3) which \nproximately caused actual injury to  the AAF or his business.”  Combs & Assocs. v. \nKennedy, 147 N.C. App. 362, 373 –74, 555 S.E.2d 634, 6 42 (2001). North Carolina \ncourts “have long recognized that claims for misappropriation of trade secrets … may \nform the basis of a UDTP claim [.]” South Fastening Sys. v. Grabber Constr. Prods., \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 42, *28 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 28, 2015) (citing Drouillard v. Keister \nWilliams Newspaper Servs., Inc., 108 N.C. App. 169, 172 -73, 423 S.E.2d 324, 326-27 \n(1992)). \n \n \n65. AAF's misappropriation of trade secrets claim sh ould survive \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss. In addition, AAF alleges that Defendants engaged in \nother deceptive conduct surrounding Price’s resignation from employment and \ncontinued access to AAF’s trade secrets. Accordingly, AAF’s UDTPA claim simiarly \nshould survive dismissal. Veer Right Mgmt. Group, Inc. v. Czarnowski Display Serv., \n2015 NCBC LEXIS 13, *17 –18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 4, 2015) (“Plaintiff’s claim for \nunfair and deceptive trade practices must await further adjudication of the other \nclaims upon which it is based.”). Defendants’ motion to dismiss AAF's claim for unfair \nand deceptive trade practices in violation of G.S. § 75-1.1 should be DENIED. \nH. Civil Conspiracy. \n66. “There is no independent cause of action for civil conspiracy. Only when \nthere is an underlying claim for unlawful conduct can a plaintiff state a claim for civil \nconspiracy by also alleging the agreement of two or more parties to carry out the \nconduct and injury resulting from the agreement.” Toomer v. Garrett, 155 N.C. App. \nat 483, 574 S.E.2d at 92. “A civil conspiracy is essentially an action for damages, and \nno action lies unless one or more conspirators actually cause damage.” Krawiec v. \nManly, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 7, *33 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 22, 2016). \n67. AAF alleges that “Price and Camfil . . . conspired and agreed to . . . \nmisappropriate AAF ’s trade secrets, to illegally use AAF’s trade secrets,  [and] to \ncommit unfair and deceptive trade practices . . . .” (VFAC ¶ 123.) \n68. Since AAF’s claims for  misappropriation and unfair trade practices \nsurvive dismissal, these claims can serve as the requisite underlying torts for a civil \n \n \nconspiracy claim. Krawiec, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *33–34. Accordingly, Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss AAF’s claim for civil conspiracy should be DENIED.  \nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s \nFirst Amended Complaint is GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part, as follows: \n69. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract is \nGRANTED, and is dismissed WITHOUT PREJUDICE. \n70. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for breach of fiduciary \nduty against Price is GRANTED, and is dismissed WITH PREJUDICE. \n71. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for tortious interference \nwith contract against Camfil is GRANTED, and is dismissed WITHOUT \nPREJUDICE.  \n72. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for misappropriation of \ntrade secrets in violation of the North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act  is \nDENIED. \n73. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s claim for violation of the North \nCarolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act is DENIED. \n74.
