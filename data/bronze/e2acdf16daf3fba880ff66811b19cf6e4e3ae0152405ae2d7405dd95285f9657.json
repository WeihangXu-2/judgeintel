Plaintiffs Encompass Services, PLLC and Encompass Services, LLC \nd/b/a/ Encompass Energy Services, LLC’s  (hereinafter, the two Plaintiff companies \nare “Encompass”) and Defendant Maser Consulting P.A. (“Maser”)\n2 are competitors.  \nEncompass brings this action to redress what it contends were unlawful actions taken \nby its former employee, Defendant Christopher Hilsman (“Hilsman” ; together with \nMaser, the “Defendants”), leading up to and following his departure from Encompass \nto work for Maser.   Specifically, Encompass contends that Defendants \nmisappropriated Encompass’ legally protected information to achieve an unfair and \n \n2 Maser is a New Jersey civil survey company that began expanding its p resence in North \nCarolina in 2017.  (ECF No. 146.5, at pp. 13– 15, 73.)  Prior to 2017, Maser had no North \nCarolina office and no significant presence in the State.  (Id.) \n \nunlawful competitive advantage—particularly as it relates to competitive bidding on \nprojects. \n2. Instead of pursuing contract claims based on the employment \nagreement, Encompass relies on allegations of trade secret misappropriation  under \nthe North Carolina Trade Secrets Protection Act, N.C.G.S. § 66 -152, et. seq. \n(“NCTSPA”).  Further, Encompass conte nds that the same conduct it asserts as a \nviolation of the NC TSPA is also  a violation of the North Carolina Unfair and \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C.G.S. § 75 -1.1 (“UDTPA”).  Finally, Encompass \ncontends that Hilsman and Maser committed computer trespa ss in violation of \nN.C.G.S. § 14 -458 and § 1 -539.2A, and tortiously interfered with Encompass’ \nprospective contractual relations.   \n3. Defendants now move for summary judgment on all claims, arguing that \nEncompass’ trade secret claim fail s as a matter of law because, even assuming \nEncompass’ data and information at issue in this case would otherwise qualify as a \ntrade secret , Encompass failed to take reasonable measures to guard its  secrecy.  \nFurther, Defendants contend that the UDTPA claim fails because it depends on the \nNCTSPA claim; that the computer trespass claim fails because the statute prohibits \nunauthorized access to a “computer” and not a “computer network”; and  that the \ntortious interference claim fails because (a) it is dependent on the NCTSPA, (b) Maser \nwas justified in seeking out contracts in furtherance of its own business, and (c) \nEncompass has produced no “but for” evidence that it would have received any of the \ncontracts for which it claims Defendan ts interfered.  Alternatively, Hilsman seeks \npartial summary judgment with respect to potential damages stemming from two \nprojects which he claims Encompass has effectively “taken off the table.”   \nII. FACTS3  \n4. Many of the facts giving rise to this lawsuit are not in dispute; however, \nthe parties’ respective characterizations of the  facts and their legal significance are  \nhighly contested, perhaps best illustrated by their introductions set out in their \nbriefs.  Encompass introduces the case with the following:  \n[Hilsman] formerly worked for [Encompass].  Hilsman \nresigned mid- August 2018 to join Encompass’ direct \ncompetitor [Maser].  Before his departure, Hilsman \ndownloaded his entire Encompass Outlook account (over \n9,000 files) and approximately 1,000 additional documents \nto an external storage device.  These misappropriated \ndocuments included extensive confidential bidding, \npricing, and project information that provided Hilsman \nand Maser a roadmap to Encompass’ proposed pricing and \nstaffing proposals surveying p rojects in North Carolina, \nwhere the two companies were regularly competing head -\nto-head in confidential bidding processes.  \n \n(ECF No. 163, at p. 1.)  In contrast, Hilsman  and Maser introduce the case with the \nfollowing:  \nThis is not a case . . . of a departing employee who, cloaking \nhis plans, surreptitiously and maliciously downloaded \ncompany secrets and stole away in the dark of night to \nwork for a competitor.  No, Hilsman transparently resigned \nhis employment to work for a competitor (Maser), worked \nout his notice, helped prepare his successor, and walked \n \n3 The Court does not make findings of fact on a motion for summary judgment, but rather \nsummarizes the material facts it considers to be undisputed.  The facts  as included herein \nare drawn from the allegations in the Verified Complaint that are not in dispute (ECF No. 3; \nsee Answer of Defendant Christopher Hilsman, ECF No. 40; Defendant Maser Consulting \nP.A.’s First Amended Answer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint and Counterclaim Against Plaintiffs, \nECF No. 61), as well as the evidentiary record on summary judgment.   \n \nout the door.   When he did, he had Encompass’ \nelectronically stored information innocently in his \npossession – information which he had accumulated over \nyears of employment with the company. \n \n(ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 137, at p. 1.)   \nEncompass filed this lawsuit after it realized that it made \na mistake when it off- boarded one of its former employees \nbut before it conducted any meaningful investigation into \nwhether that employee or his new employer unfairly \nexploited that mistake to gain an unfair and competitive \nadvantage.  Instead, as the testimony and evidence \ncollected during discovery reveals, E ncompass not only \nfailed to secure any of the data or information that it claims \nis confidential and/or a trade secret, but it also failed to \nfollow many of its own procedures for departing employees.  \nEncompass seeks to hold Defendants responsible for its  \nown mistakes and to gain an advantage over its competitor, \nwhich this Court should not permit.  \n \n(ECF No. 125, at p. 1.)  \nA. Encompass \n5. Encompass is a national civil survey firm specializing in providing land \nsurveying services for oil and gas transmission pi pelines, including “ conducting \npipeline surveys, mapping, routing, and pipeline integrity testing[.]”  (ECF No. 3, at \n¶ 8; Oware Dep., ECF No. 114.2, at p. 48.)\n4  Encompass expanded its operations into \nNorth Carolina in 2011.  (Aff. of Jeremiah Horne , ECF No. 146.14 (hereinafter, the \n“Horne Affidavit”).)   \n \n4 Encompass Services, LLC is a Texas company with its principal place of business in Texas.  \n(Id. at ¶ 2.)  Its subsidiary, Encompass Services, PLLC is a North Carolina company with its \nprincipal place of business in Asheville, North Carolina.  (Id. at ¶1.)   \n \n6. Encompass typically obtains work through confidential, competitive \nbids made directly to an  energy provider or through an engineering prime \ncontractor/engineering service provider.  ( Horne Dep. ECF N o. 146.2 [SEALED], \nredacted at ECF No. 146.15, at pp. 245–46; ECF No. 3, at ¶ 11; ECF No. 40, at ¶ 11.)  \nTo accurately estimate costs and prepare the most competitive bid proposal, \nEncompass relies on data that it has gathered including: “(i) cost data for prior similar \nprojects, (ii) maps and drawings developed with the use of expensive investments in \ntechnology such as radar scanning, and satellite and aerial imaging, (iii) knowledge \nof constructability, environmental, and socio-economic issues, . . . .”  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ \n12; ECF No. 40, at ¶ 12.)   \n7. Since 2011, Encompass has compiled a library of what it considers \n“confidential and proprietary” documents to “assist with its bidding and project \nexecution process” in the North Carolina market.  (ECF No. 146. 14, at ¶ 4.)  These \ndocuments include “rate and fee tables, negotiated subcontractor services \nagreements[,] and past proposals/bids” as well as “Encompass’ as-built data regarding \nspecific lines, change orders, budget trackers, survey and point base documents[,] and \nmosaics.”\n5  ( Id. at ¶¶ 4– 5.)  Further, Encompass’ document library contains non -\npublic plat documents, field notes, requests for proposals, requests for information, \nemails, and other business information it uses to assist with its operations.  (Id. at ¶ \n \n5 “As-built” data refers to a file containing all the aggregated information pertaining to a \nparticular project, including “every single point of data that was collected by every single \ncrew for the entire duration” of a project.  (ECF No. 146.2  [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. \n146.15, at pp. 35–36.)   \n \n6.)  Encompass “considers this data confidential and prohibits its disclosure to third \nparties” (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 13), and “would consider most of these documents a trade \nsecret” (ECF No. 146.14, at ¶¶ 4–5).6  \ni. Server storage of Encompass data  \n8. Encompass stores its “confidential and proprietary” documents  on a \ncloud-based server operated by a third- party application , Egnyte  (“the “Egnyte” \nserver).  (ECF No. 3, at Ex. A, ¶ 5.)7  Encompass hired Technology Solution Partners, \nInc. d/b/a CMIT Solutions of Pittsburgh North (“CMIT”) to set up and manage the \nEgnyte server.  (ECF No. 146.14, at ¶ 8.)  Access to the Egnyte server requires a valid \nusername and password, which is issued by CMIT at the direction of Encompass.  \n(ECF No. 3, at Ex. A, ¶ 5. )  All Encompass employees are provided with an Egnyte \nusername and password.  (Cooper Dep., ECF No. 114.10, at p. 105.)   \n9. Egnyte restricts each particular employees’ access by both Folder \nPermissions (i.e., the set of actions a user can perform on a particular folder, such as \nwhether a user can download files) and User Types ( i.e., a classification system that \ndetermines the number/set of documents to which a particular employee has access).  \n \n6 For example, Senior Vice President and co- founder of Encompass, Jeremiah Horne \n(“Horne”), provided in his affidavit that “most of these documents have independent \ncommercial value” in that they would allow a c ompetitor “to win a bidding contest against \nEncompass” and that Encompass’ as-built data in the hands of a competitor would save the \ncompetitor potentially “tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars.”  (ECF No. \n146.14, at ¶ 4; ECF No. 146.2 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 146.15, at p. 37.) \n \n7 Encompass used the cloud-based storage platform “Dropbox” to store company data prior to \nmigrating to Egnyte in 2016.  (ECF No. 110.1, at p. 111.)   \n \n(ECF No. 146.14, at ¶ 9.)   Further, when Encompass’ data is transferred to or from \nthe Egnyte server, the data is encrypted.  (ECF No. 146.14, at ¶ 6.)   \n10. Egnyte allows for the use of various features and applications, including \nan Egnyte Desktop Sync function, allowing users to automatically download files \nand/or entire folders from the Egnyte server to a hard drive (Hilsman Aff. in Opp. to \nMot. For TRO, ECF No. 28, at ¶ 20; Egnyte Instructions , ECF No. 114.8) ; an auto -\nlogin feature, allowing for log-in credentials to be saved (Yalamarthy Dep., ECF No. \n146.4, at pp. 71–76)8; and a phone app allowing for use of Egnyte on a cell phone (ECF \nNo. 114.4 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 134.5).   \n11. With respect to storage of Encompass employee email, Encompass uses \nMicrosoft Outlook, and  maintains the emails  on a Microsoft Outlook Exchange \nServer.  (ECF No. 146.4, at pp. 80–81; Hilsman Dep., ECF No. 146.6, at pp. 163–64.)  \nEncompass employees have access to their email when connected to Encompa ss’ \nsystem via a virtual private network (“VPN”).  (Id.)  Thus, Encompass employees may \naccess their emails upon entering their username and password on a company-issued \ncomputer or via web access through use of a multi -factor identification process (e.g., \nby cell phone).  (Id.)  \nii. Local computer storage and external storage devices \n \n8 Chief Technology Officer for CMIT, Sunil Yalamarthy (“Yalamarthy”), testified at his \ndeposition that the Egnyte system has an auto-login feature where you can save a password, \nwhich Egnyte then forces you to re -enter “every now and then,” but Yalamarthy c ould not \n“remember exactly how many weeks or how many days it is[.]”  (ECF No. 146.4, at pp. 71–\n76.)   \n12. Some, but n ot all, Encompass employees are provided company-issued \ncomputers.  ( Oware Dep., ECF No. 114.2, at pp. 105– 06.)  Further, no Encompass \nemployees were provided company -issued cell phones or other external storage \ndevices (e.g., USB thumb drives).  ( Id.; 3/10/16 email from Horne, ECF No. 114.4  \n[SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 134.5.)  Thus, while Encompass used the Egnyte and \nOutlook server s as centralized storage lo cations for its data and information , \nEncompass employees inevitably download ed and store d this data on to either (a) \nhard drives on their company -issued computers  or (b) personally owned storage \ndevices (e.g., personal computer hard drives, cell phones, USB thumb drives).  (ECF \nNo. 114.2, at pp. 105 –10; ECF No. 114.4 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 134.5 ; \n114.10, at p. 16. )  For example, Tyler Hastings (“Hastings”), Hilsman’s former \nsupervisor at Encompass, testified at his deposition that he used personal electronic \nstorage devices when in the field to store and access Encompass data and information, \nand that he knew other employees also did so.  (Hastings Dep., ECF No. 110.9, at pp. \n34–36.)  Further, former Encompass employee Philip Shaw (“Shaw”) testified  that \n“every surveyor has company information on a flash drive somewhere, every single \none.”  (Shaw Dep., ECF No. 110.4, at p. 65.) \n13. Encompass’ company-issued computers require a username and \npassword, but this security function can be disabled, and Encompa ss had no policy \nprohibiting employees from disabling this security function. (ECF No. 114.2, at p. \n135; ECF No. 28, at ¶ 22.)  U pon an employee’s departure or termination of \nemployment with Encompass, employees are required to return their company-issued \nlaptops.  (Offboarding Checklist, ECF No. 110.10.)   \n14. With respect to its employees’ use of personal storage devices, \nEncompass had no formal policies .  ( Horne Dep., ECF No. 110.2, at p. 190.)  \nEncompass was aware of but did not limit its employees’ use of personal devices to \nstore Encompass data.  (Cooper Dep., ECF No. 114.10, at p. 18; ECF No. 114.2, at pp. \n105–07, 116.)   Encompass did not require employees to password protect their \npersonal external devices, nor did it catalogue whi ch employees use them.  ( 3/4/19 \nHilsman Aff., ECF No. 110.5, at pp. 123–126.)  Moreover, Encompass did not track or \nmonitor any of its employees’ use and storage of Encompass documents and \ninformation (Encompass Rule 30(b)(6) Dep., ECF No. 114.3, at p. 191; Hastings Dep., \nECF No. 114.1, at pp. 46–48), and did not ask departing employees to secure, return, \nor destroy company data on these devices (ECF No. 110.9, at pp. 48–49; see e.g., ECF \nNo. 110.3, at p. 13–16). \niii. Confidentiality policies  \n15. Aside from the protection provided by its use of the Egnyte server , \nEncompass required its employees to execute Employment Agreements containing \nconfidentiality provisions.  (ECF No. 110.9, at p. 34; see e.g. , Hilsman Employment \nContract, ECF No. 110.11.)  Further, i n 2016, Encompass implemented certain \n\"Standards of Conduct” disseminated in an employee handbook. Included in the \nStandards of Conduct was a policy titled “Confidentiality/Intellectual Property” that \nstated, in pertinent part: \n[y]our employment with [Encompass] assumes an \nobligation to maintain confidentiality even after you leave \nour employment.  Employee agrees that all information . . . \nshall be held in confidence by Employee and shall not be \nused by Employee for any  purpose other than for the \nperformance of the services contemplated by this \nAgreement or any other agreement between the \nparties. . . . Employee agrees that it shall not make \ndisclosure of any such Confidential Information to anyone \nexcept to whom disclosure is necessary for the purposes of \naccomplishing the work to be performed by Employee. . . . \nBecause of its seriousness, disclosure of confidential \ninformation could lead to disciplinary action up to, and \nincluding, termination.  \n \n(Encompass Standards of  Conduct, ECF No. 146.1, at p. 2  (hereinafter, the \n“Standards of Conduct”).)    \n16. Nevertheless, the record is less than clear as to whether employees \nunderstood the details of Encompass’ confidentiality policies  as it applied to the \nEgnyte server, and to what, if any, extent these policies  were enforced.  (ECF No. \n110.3, at p. 40; ECF No. 110.6, at pp. 48 –49, 181; ECF No. 110.9, at p. 34.)  For \nexample, Encompass did not mark any of its confidential documents on the Egnyte \nserver with a confidentiality sticker or tag.  (ECF No. 114.1, at p. 33.) \nB. Hilsman’s Employment with Encompass \n17. Hilsman worked for Encompass as a Field Surveyor from April 2012 to \nJanuary 2014, and later as a Survey Supervisor from April 2015 until August 2018.  \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 15–18; ECF No. 40, at ¶¶ 15–18; ECF No. 146.14, at ¶ 12; ECF No. \n3, at Ex. B.)  In his role, H ilsman was directly involved in the process of preparing \nbid proposals within his region.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶ 16; Hilsman Answer, ECF No. 40, \nat ¶ 16.)  As Survey Supervisor, Hilsman had access to a small portion of the data on \nthe Egnyte server  and would utilize Encompass’ data stored on that server  to help \nthe Southeast Regional Director prepare bid proposals.  (Id.; ECF No. 146.14, at ¶ 12; \nECF No. 152.2, at p. 31.)9 \n18. As a condition to his second  stint of employment with Encompass \nbeginning in April 2015, Hilsman entered into an Employment Agreement.  (ECF No. \n3, at ¶ 15; “Employment Agreement,” ECF No. 3 at Ex. B.)  The Employment \nAgreement stated, in pertinent part,  \nEMPLOYEE . . . agrees that t hey shall not, at any time \nduring the term of this Agreement or for one year \nthereafter, disclose to or make use of for any person, \ncorporation or other entity, any proprietary files, trade \nsecrets or other confidential information defined as, the \nbusiness, clients, methods, operations, financing or \nservices of [Encompass].   EMPLOYEE acknowledges that \nall files, lists, books, records, literature, products and any \nother materials owned by [Encompass] shall at all times \nremain the property of [Encompass].   \n \n(ECF No. 3, at ¶ 17; ECF No. 3 at Ex. B, ¶ 8.)  Notably, however, while Hilsman \nsigned the Employment Agreement, Encompass neither signed the agreement nor \nentered an acceptance date.  ( Id.)  Further, Hilsman claims he did not fully \nunderstand the content of his Employment Agreement.  (ECF No. 110.6, at p. 181.)  \nIn 2016, Hilsman was also provided with a copy of and/or access to an employee \nhandbook containing the Standards of Conduct.  (ECF No. 114.2, at p. 79.)   \n19. While working at Encompass, Hilsman  used a  company-issued \ncomputer, which Hilsman claims was not password-protected.  (ECF No. 110.5, at ¶ \n \n9 To provide context, Encompass has close to 5 million files in Egnyte, and Hilsman had access \nto roughly 60,000 of them.  (ECF No. 146.14, at ¶ 12.)  \n11.)  Hilsman used the auto-login feature on Egnyte, allowing him to save his login \ncredentials such that he was not required to manually put in his use rname or \npassword to access the Egnyte server.   (Id. at ¶ 19; ECF No. 146.4, at pp. 71– 76.)  \nHilsman states that “by simply powering on [his] laptop,” and in conjunction with \nEgnyte’s Desktop Sync function, Egnyte would “automatically ‘download’ and update \nthe working files containing Encompass project information ” and “ anyone who \npowered on the laptop would have full and unencumbered access to all company \ninformation stored on the laptop.”  (Hilsman Aff., ECF No. 110.5, at ¶¶ 21–22.)   \n20. In addition to the u se of his company -issued computer, Hilsman  also \nutilized a personal non- password-protected external storage device  and a personal \ncell phone to access and/or store Encompass data and information .  ( Id. at ¶¶ 7– 9, \n27.)  Hilsman’s external storage device contained “massive amounts of company data \nand project files.”  (Id. at ¶ 17.)  Hilsman admits that he maintained files long after \nprojects were completed because he would frequently get follow -up questions from \nclients—potentially years later—about an old project.  (Hilsman Dep., ECF No. 110.6, \nat p. 66.)   \nC. Hilsman’s Departure for Maser  \n \n21. In June 2018, Hilsman was approached by Tommy Mallard (“Mallard”), \nMaser’s Regional Director of the Survey Geospatial Division , who had been  tasked \nwith growing Maser’s presence in North Carolina.  (Mallard Dep., ECF No. 146.5, at \npp. 13, 20–21.)  In July 2018, Mallard offered Hilsman the position of Senior Survey \nProject Manager, in which Hilsman would be responsible for business development,  \nincluding preparing bids and managing customer relationships.   ( Id. at pp. 18 –19, \n22–24.)   \n22. On August 3, 2018, Hilsman notified Encompass that he was  resigning \nhis employment to join Maser and provided two weeks’ notice.  (ECF No. 146.6, at pp. \n163–64.)  On the same day , Hilsman’s entire Encompass email account was backed \nup to an external storage device, although  Hilsman maintain s that this was a \nregularly scheduled automatic backup.  (ECF No. 146.6, at pp. 163–64.)   \ni. Off-boarding from Encompass \n23. Encompass claims that its off- boarding procedure consists of “ a \ncomprehensive off-boarding checklist followed to ensure data security and to protect \nconfidential information and trade secrets, [which] includes collecting company -\nissued equipment (e.g. laptops) and notifying Encompass’ third-party vendor to shut \ndown access upon termination to its cloud -based server.”  ( Encompass Disc. Resp., \nECF No. 110.15 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 134.2, at .pdf p. 22, ¶ 9.)10  The off-\nboarding checklist assigns each action item to an Encompass employee, and provides \nthat each item is “[d]ue on termination date.”  (Id.)   \n24. On the date it received Hilsman’s two weeks’ notice, Encompass notified \nCMIT of Hilsman’s resignation and requested that Hilsman’s access to the Egnyte \nserver be revoked effective August 1 7, 2018.  (ECF No. 146.14. at ¶ 13.)   Within \n \n10 The off-boarding checklist produced by Encompass contains the following action items: (i) \ndeactivate AutoCad License, (ii) inactivate ISN, (iii) deactivate email account, (iv) send \nemployee evaluation, (v) equipment reconciliation, and (vi) inactivate on employee bio sheet.  \n(Hilsman’s Off-boarding Checklist, ECF No. 110.10.)   \n \nminutes, CMIT responded confirming the revocation.  (ECF No. 114.3, at p. 205.)  \nHowever, CMIT inadvertently fail ed to revoke Hilsman’s access, which remained \nactive until January 2019, approximately four months following Hilsman’s departure.  \n(ECF No. 3, at Ex. A, ¶ 8; ECF No. 146.4, at p. 47; ECF No. 114.2, at p. 84.)   \n25. Hilsman’s last day of employment with Encompass was August 17, 2018.  \nDespite its policy requiring that it do so, Encompass did not conduct a formal exit \ninterview or provide an evaluation to Hilsman.  (ECF No. 114.3, at p. 169.)  \nEncompass also failed to  collect Hilsman’s company-issued laptop upon his \ndeparture.  Rather, Hilsman’s supervisor, Hastings, told Hilsman to leave his laptop \nat one of Encompass’ job trailers.  (Hastings Dep., ECF No. 114.1, at p. 51.)  Another \nEncompass employee, Shaw, used Hilsman’s computer until August 31, 2018.  (ECF \nNo. 114.11, at pp. 35 –36; ECF No. 114.3, at pp. 205 –06.)  During this period, \ndocuments were uploaded to and downloaded from the Egnyte server via Hilsman’s \nEgnyte account both by Shaw and through operation of the desktop sync application.  \n(Id.; ECF No. 114.9, at p. 54.)     \nii. Hilsman joins Maser \n26. It is undisputed that after  joining Maser on August 20, 2018, Hilsman \naccessed and downloaded Encompass data and information from  the Egnyte server, \nsome of which was  subsequently located on Maser’s server.   (ECF No. 146.6, at pp. \n124, 138–39, 143; Hash Hits Spreadsheet, ECF No. 120.11.)   \n27. In addition, when Hilsman departed Encompass, certain responsibilities \nregarding the “Line 434” project fell to the next employee in the chain of command, \nShaw.  ( ECF No. 114.9,  at pp. 81 –82.)  Seeking assistance with the project from \nHilsman, Shaw downloaded the Line 434 project folder to an external storage device \nand brought it to Hilsman’s house, where the Line 434 project documents were \nsubsequently downloaded onto Hilsman’s Maser-issued laptop.  (Shaw Dep., ECF No. \n114.11, at p. 41; ECF No. 146.7, at p. 14; Hilsman Dep., ECF No. 146.6, at pp. 76, 83–\n84, 94; Hastings Dep., ECF No. 114.1, at pp. 20–23.)\n11   \n28. CMIT also discovered via routine audit that on more than sixty (60) \noccasions after Hilsman’s employment with Encompass terminated, Hilsman’s \ncredentials were used to access, view, or download information from the Egnyte \nserver by way of the mobile phone application.  (Oware Dep., ECF No. 146.3, at p. \n120; Yalamarthy Dep., ECF No. 146.4, at pp. 76–77; Egnyte Data, ECF No. 152.5.)   \n29. Encompass contends that Hilsman used its “confidential” information to \ngive Maser an advantage in head-to-head bidding with Encompass for potential work, \nparticularly with respect to the Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas Line 328 \nProject (hereinafter, the “Line 328” project).  (ECF No. 163, at p. 11.)  First, on August \n22, 2018, Hilsman submitted a worksheet to his supervisor  at Maser  containing \npreliminary labor and pricing assumption s for Maser’s bid.  Hilsman prepared the \nworksheet using a template from a recent Encompass proposal which included \nEncompass’ recent labor and pricing assumptions.  (ECF No. 146.9 [SEALED]; ECF \nNo. 152.2, at pp. 110 –12.)  Second, Maser’s initial August 22, 2018 bid  for the Line \n328 project was higher than Encompass’  August 28, 2018 bid, but on September 20, \n \n11 Shortly thereafter, Shaw also resigned from Encompass and joined Hilsman at Maser.  \n(ECF No. 152.2, at p. 70.)     \n2018, Maser submitted a revised lower bid —the same  day that Hilsman accessed \nEncompass’ August 28, 2018 proposal on the Egnyte server.  (ECF No. 146.10  \n[SEALED]; ECF No. 120.8; ECF No. 146.6, at p. 138.)  Maser ultimately won the \nproject.   \n30. Encompass alleges that “Hilsman continued to access and use \nEncompass proposals . . . as he priced other Maser projects” and that “[s]ome of these \n[projects] were also awarded to Maser.”  (ECF No. 163, at p. 12.)  For these reasons , \nEncompass believes it is entitled to lost profits on the following projects: the Line 328 \nProject, the Line 456/457 Project; the Line 466 Project; the Line 467 Project; and the \nRutland Road project .  (ECF No. 110.15  [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 134.2,  at \n.pdf p. 33.)   \nIII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \n31. Encompass initiated this action by filing a  Verified Complaint on \nJanuary 30, 2019.  (ECF No. 3. )  This matter was designated as a complex business \ncase and assigned to the undersigned on January 31, 2019.  (Des . Ord., ECF No. 1; \nAssign. Ord., ECF No. 2.)   \n32. In the Verified Complaint, Encompass brought a claim against Hilsman \nfor conversion (“First Claim”) , and claims against both Hilsman and Maser  for: \nmisappropriation of t rade secrets in violation of the NCTSPA (“Second Claim”) ; \ntortious interference with prospective economic advantage (“Third Claim”); computer \ntrespass (“Fourth Claim”) ; unfair trade practices in violation of UDTPA  (“Fifth \nClaim”); and punitive damages (“Sixth Claim”).  (ECF No. 3, ¶¶ 41–68.)  \n33. Hilsman and Maser filed motions to dismiss  the V erified Complaint .  \n(“Hilsman’s MTD,” ECF No. 38; “Maser’s MTD,” ECF No. 63.)  On November 5, 2019, \nthe Court issued its Order and Opinion on the motions to dismiss.  (ECF No. 84.)  The \nCourt dismissed Encompass’  claim for conversion against Hilsman , but otherwise, \ndenied Hilsman’s MTD and denied Maser’s MTD.   \n34. On December 16, 2020, both Hilsman and Maser filed their respective \nMotions for Summary Judgment on Encompass’ remaining claims.    Along with the \nMotions for Summary Judgment, Hilsman and Maser subsequently filed their \nrespective briefs in support ( Def. Christopher Hilsman’s Memo. ISO his Mot. for \nSumm. J., ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 137; Def. Maser Consulting \nP.A.’s Bf. ISO its Mot. for Summ . J., ECF No. 125) .  Hilsman also filed evidentiary \nexhibits in support of Hilsman’s Motion (ECF No. 110.1 –110.16), and Maser filed \nevidentiary exhibits in support of Maser’s Motion (ECF No. 114.1–114.12).  \n35. Encompass filed a consolidated Brief in Oppositio n to Defendants’ \nMotions for Summary Judgment (“Brief in Opposition,” ECF No. 163) and supporting \nexhibits (ECF No. 146.1–146.15). \n36. Hilsman and Maser filed reply briefs in support of their respective \nMotions for Summary Judgment.  ( Hilsman’s Reply, ECF No. 164; Maser’s Reply, \nECF No. 165.) \n37. On February 22, 2021, Hilsman’s Motion to Strike was filed with the \nCourt.  (ECF No. 166.)  Encompass filed a brief in opposition to Hilsman’s Motion to \nStrike.  (Encompass’ Bf. in Opp. to Hilsman’s Motion to Strik e, ECF No. 176.)  No \nreply brief was filed.   \n38.  The Court held a hearing on the Motions on March 19, 2021 at which \ncounsel appeared and made arguments.  The Motions are now ripe for decision.  \nIV. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n39. Summary judgement is appropriate where “the pleadings, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Variety Wholesa lers, Inc. v. Salem \nLogistics Traffic Servs. , 365 N.C. 520, 523 (2012) (quoting N.C.G.S. § 1A -1, Rule \n56(c)).  “An issue is ‘genuine’ if it can be proven by substantial evidence and a fact is \n‘material’ if it would constitute or irrevocably establish any m aterial element of a \nclaim or a defense.”  CSX Transp., Inc. v. City of Fayetteville, 247 N.C. App. 517, 521 \n(2016) (quoting Lowe v. Bradford, 305 N.C. 366, 369 (1982)). \n40. On a motion for summary judgment, the Court views the evidence in the \n“light most favorable to the non-moving party.”  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Lahoud, 167 N.C. \nApp. 205, 207 (2004) (citation omitted). “The party moving for summary judgment \nultimately has the burden of establishing the lack of any issue of triable fact.”  Unitrin \nAuto & Home Ins. Co. v. McNeill , 215 N.C. App. 465, 467 (2011) (citations omitted).  \nThe moving party may meet this burden by “proving an essential element of the \nopposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot be proven at trial, or would be barred by \nan affirmative defense.”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83 (2000) (citations omitted).  \nOnce the moving party “makes the required showing, the burden shifts to the \nnonmoving party to produ ce a forecast of evidence demonstrating specific facts, as \nopposed to allegations, showing that he can at least establish a prima facie case at \ntrial.”  Unitrin Auto & Home Ins. Co., 215 N.C. App. at 467 (citations omitted). \nV. ANALYSIS  \nA. Trade Secrets Protection Act  \ni. Motion to Strike  \n41. Preliminarily, the Court will address Hilsman’s Motion to Strike.  (ECF \nNo. 166.)  Hilsman contends that the Horne Affidavit (ECF No. 146.14) was prepared \nafter the close of discovery “[i]n an attempt to manu facture a triable issue of fact \n(where one does not exist) on the singular issue of [ Encompass’] lack of ‘reasonable \nsecurity measures’ used to protect their purported trade secrets” and is  a sham \naffidavit that contradicts [Horne’s] earlier sworn testimon y as a Rule 30(b)(6) \ndesignee.”  (ECF No. 166, at pp. 1–2.)   \n42. The Court disagrees.  At best, the alleged inconsistencies between \nHorne’s affidavit and his deposition testimony go to Horne’s credibility.  Hilsman has \nnot pointed to any direct contradictions that render the affidavit a sham.  Therefore, \nhaving considered Hilsman’s Motion to Strike, the briefs in support and in opposition, \nand the arguments of counsel at the hearing, the Court concludes, in its discretion, \nthat Hilsman’s Motion to Strike shoul d be DENIED.  See W&W Partners, Inc. v. \nFerrell Land Co., LLC, 2019 NCBC LEXIS 104, at *3 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 6, 2019)  \n(“The introduction of evidence into the record, including the Court’s decision on a \nmotion to strike an affidavit, is left to the sound  discretion of the trial court.” (citing \n3 Waterway Drive Prop. Owners’ Ass’n, Inc. v. Town of Cedar Point , 224 N.C. App. \n544, 555 (2012))).  \nii. Reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy \n43. Defendants argue that none of the Encompass documents or information \nallegedly misappropriated by Hilsman and Maser qualify as a “trade secret” under \nthe NCTSPA because Encompass failed to use reasonable efforts to maintain their \nsecrecy.  (ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 137 , at pp. 12–18; ECF No. \n125, at pp. 12– 19.)12  Specifically, Defendants point to: (a) Encompass’ lack of any \npolicy regarding the use of non-password protected personal storage devices to store \nfiles downloaded from the Egnyte server; (b) Encompass’ “threadbare” Employment \nAgreement, which was not signed or dated by Encompass, and which Hilsman claims \nhe did not fully understand ; (c) and Encompass’ off-boarding failures, including \nEncompass’ failure to revoke Hilsman’s access to the Egnyte server  after his \ndeparture from Encompass.  (ECF No. 125, at pp. 18– 19; ECF No. 126 [SEALED], \nredacted at ECF No. 137, at pp. 13–19.) \n44. In response, Encompass argues that  its measures to maintain the \nsecrecy of its documents or information at issue are  sufficient to create an issue of \n \n12 For the purposes of their arguments on summary judgment, Defendants assume \nEncompass can establish all other elements of a legally  protected trade secret as to at least \nsome of the documents and information at issue.  (ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at ECF \nNo. 137, at p. 12, n.4; ECF No. 125, at p. 14.)  Thus, Defendants solely focus their argument \non the reasonableness of Encompass’ efforts to protect the secrecy of its purported trade \nsecrets, without conceding the other elements are established.   \nmaterial fact for  the jury , therefore precluding summary judgment on this issue .  \n(ECF No. 163, at pp. 15–17.)  Specifically, Encompass contends that:  \n[Encompass] required employees to execute confidentiality \nagreements.  Employees were required to use unique login \ncredentials to log into their [c]ompany -issued computers.  \nOnly select employees were provided web access to work \nproduct or Outlook and such access required further login \ncredentials or security measures.  Even  employees with \nenhanced access still were limited to accessing only those \ndocuments for which they had a need to know.  Numerous \ncourts have recognized that such measures are sufficient to \nbring a claim for trade secret misappropriation.   \n \n(ECF No. 163, at p. 15.)  \n45. The NCTSPA provides the  owner of a trade secret  with a “ remedy by \ncivil action for misappropriation of his trade secret.”  N.C.G.S. § 66 -153 (2021).  A  \n“trade secret” is defined as \nbusiness or technical information, including but not limited \nto a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of \ninformation, method, technique, or process that: \n \na. Derives independent actual or potential commercial \nvalue from not being generally known or readily \nascertainable through independent developmen t or \nreverse engineering by persons who can obtain \neconomic value from its disclosure or use; and \n \nb. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the \ncircumstances to maintain its secrecy.  \n \nN.C.G.S. § 66-152(3) (2021) (emphasis added). \n46. In assessing whether information that would otherwise qualify as a \npurported trade secret “is the subject of efforts that are reasonable . . . to maintain \nits secrecy,” our courts have recognized that the  “inquiry is fact-specific, and ‘courts \nthat have ad dressed it closely examine the circumstances surrounding the trade \nsecret to determine what measures are reasonable.’”  Comput. Design & Integration, \nLLC v. Brown, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 216, at *46 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 10, 2018) (quoting \nKoch Measurement Devices Inc. v. Armke, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *15 (N.C. Super. \nCt. May 1, 2015)).  “The critical question in deciding this issue on summary judgment \nis ‘whether [plaintiffs are] entitled to ask the jury to undertake an analysis of the \nreasonableness of [plaintif fs’] efforts to maintain the confidentiality of the \ninformation.’”  Id. at *48–49 (citation omitted).   \n47. As cited by the parties in their briefs, t his Court has , on numerous \noccasions, addressed on summary judgment a defendant’s argument that plaintiffs \nfailed to make reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of its information.  See, e.g., \nHopkins v. MWR Mgmt. Co., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 47, at *73 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 31, \n2017) (holding plaintiff’s efforts sufficient to create jury issue and denying summary \njudgment where confidential documents were stored on a community computer with \ngeneric login information written down on a sticky note attached to the screen, access \nwas restricted to only certain employees , and employees executed employment \nagreements detailing the handling of confidential data);  TaiDoc Tech. Corp. v. OK \nBiotech Co. , 2016 NCBC LEXIS 26, at *21– 25 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 28, 2016) \n(denying summary judgment where t here were multiple measures to protect the \nconfidentiality of the information , including confidentiality acknowledgements on \nevery page, confidentiality labels on disclosed documents, a draft confidentiality \nagreement to be executed, and restricted access to full disclosure); Koch Measurement \nDevices, Inc, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 45, at *16 (denying summary judgment where \nplaintiff kept its confidential material in locked facilities and included a \nnondisclosure provision in its employment agreements); Safety Test & Equip. Co., Inc. \nv. Am. Safety Util. Corp., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *32–33 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 23, \n2015) (denying summary judgment where plaintiff kept its confidential material in \nlocked facilities under video surveillance, maintained a password-protected database, \nincluded confidentiality agreements with some suppliers, and included a  \nnondisclosure provision in its employment agreements) ; Edgewater Servs. v. Epic \nLogistics, Inc., 2009 NCBC LEXIS 21, at *11–15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 11, 2009), aff’d, \n217 N.C. App. 399 (2011) (holding plaintiff’s efforts not reasonable as a matter of law \nand granting summary judgment  for defendant where plaintiff maintained \nconfidential files in an “unlocked file room, accessible to anyone” without safeguards \nto ensure security). \n48. Notably, the only case cited by Defendants in which this Court granted \nsummary judgment on the grounds that the plaintiff  failed to take reasonable \nmeasures to protect the s ecrecy of a trade secret is Edgewater.  In their briefs, both \nDefendants attempt to analogize the facts of this case to those  in Edgewater.  (ECF \nNo. 125, at pp. 17–19; ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 137 , at pp. 13–\n14.)  However, the Court is not persuaded that Encompass’ password protected \nEgnyte server, coupled with confidentiality provisions in employment agreements, is \ntantamount to an “unlocked file room, accessible to anyone.”  Edgewater, 2009 NCBC \nLEXIS 21, at *12. \n49. As persuasive authority, D efendants also point to a recent case out of \nthe Eastern District of North Carolina, Neighborhood Networks Publ’g, Inc. v. Lyles, \nNo. 7:19- CV-89-BO, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18445 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 1, 2021), which \nDefendants contend presents a “remarkably similar fact pattern” that “appears to be \nthe first instance where a court has evaluated a situation where an employer failed \nto remove a former employee’s electronic database access in the context of a trade \nsecret misappropriation claim under North Carolina law.”  (ECF No. 164, at p. 2; ECF \nNo. 165, at p. 4.)   \n50. In Neighborhood Networks Publ’g , the federal district court granted \nsummary judgment for defendant, finding that plaintiff’s information at issue was \nnot subject to “reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy” and therefore not entitled \nto trade secret protection.  2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18445, at *16–17.  The court noted \nthat the plaintiff magazine publisher continued to allow defendant, a former \nfranchisee, access to plaintiff’s cloud- based server for seven months after the \ndefendant sold her franchise , and “could have terminated her acce ss at any time[.]”  \nId.  Here, however, it is not in dispute that Encompass timely requested CMIT  to \nrevoke Hilsman’s access to the Egnyte server upon his departure from Encompass.  \nUnlike in Neighborhood Networks Publ’g , Encompass did take action to termi nate \nHilsman’s access to the cloud-based server.  The only reason Hilsman retained access \nto the cloud-based server was because of the inadvertent failure of a third -party IT \nfirm, and CMIT discovered and corrected its failure four months after Hilsman’s \ndeparture from Encompass.  Thus, this Court concludes that Neighborhood Networks \nPubl’g is distinguishable from this case.    \n51. The facts demonstrate that Encompass made at least some  efforts to \nmaintain the secrecy of its information, including maintaining a password-protected \ndatabase with levels of access granted on a need -to-know basis; password protected \ncompany-issued computers; written employment agreements with confidentiality \nprovisions; and an employee handbook including Standards of Conduct on the \nconfidentiality of intellectual property.   \n52. Defendants seek to rebut these facts, noting that  there is evidence that \nEncompass’ employment agreements and employee handbook lack specificity as to \ninformation on the Egnyte server; passwords to the Egnyte server can be saved;  the \npasswords on company-issued computers can be disabled; there were no policies with \nrespect to the use of personal external storage devices to store data downloaded from \nthe Egnyte server; and Encompass failed to properly off-board departing employees, \nincluding Hilsman, to ensure the secrecy of its purported trade secrets.   \n53. Although Defendants have cast doubt on the adequacy of Plaintiffs’ \nefforts to maintain the secrecy of their purported trade secrets, viewing the evidence \nin the light most favorable to Encompass, the Court finds that Encompass has \nprovided sufficient evidence of measures to protect its co nfidential information to \ncreate an issue of fact as to their reasonableness, and the Court cannot conclude as a \nmatter of law that Encompass has failed to adequately protect this information.  See, \ne.g., Roundpoint Mortg. Co. v. Florez, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 18, at *36–38 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Feb. 18, 2016) (holding confidentiality provision in handbook, password-protected \ncomputer systems, and employee confidentiality agreements created issue of material \nfact as to whether plaintiff took reasonable measures even wh ere defendants \n“produced evidence that could lead a jury to doubt the adequacy of [plaintiff’s] \npolicies”).  While a jury may be particularly troubled by Encompass’ failures to \nimplement or enforce many of its confidentiality policies, especially with resp ect to \nthe use of personal external storage devices, the Court concludes that Encompass’  \nclaim for Defendants’ violation of the NCTSPA should  survive summary judgment.  \nAccordingly, to the extent Hilsman’s Motion and Maser’s Motion seek summary \njudgment in their favor as to Encompass’ NCTSPA claim, Defendants’ Motions for \nSummary Judgment should be DENIED.   \nB. Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage   \ni. Maser’s Motion  \n54. In Maser’s Motion, Maser’s sole argument in favor of summary \njudgment on the claim for tortious interference with prospective advantage is that \n“Encompass’ claims of Tortious Interference with Prospective Economic \nAdvantage . . . fail along with its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets. ”  (ECF \nNo. 125, at p. 19.)  Specifically, Maser solely argues that “Encompass bases its claim \nfor tortious interference . . . on its allegations that Maser stole and misappropriated \nits protected trade secrets ” which “Encompass cannot establ ish[.]”  ( Id. at p. 20.)  \nSince the Court has concluded that Encompass’ misappropriation claim under the \nNCTSPA should survive summary judgment, Maser’s Motion seeking summary \njudgment in its favor on Encompass’ tortious interference claim should, accordingly, \nbe DENIED.  \nii. Hilsman’s Motion  \n55. Hilsman argues that Encompass has failed to establish a claim for \ntortious interference with prospective economic advantage  because (1) “Encompass \nand Maser were responding to Requests for Proposals (“RFPs”) from third -party \nengineering firms involving multiple bidders” and “Maser was justified in seeking out \ncontracts in furtherance of its own business”; and (2) “Encompass has produced no \n‘but for’ evidence that it would have received any of the contracts for which it claims \nDefendants interfered.”  ( ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 137, at p p. \n19–21.)   \n56. “An action for tortious interference with prospective economic \nadvantage is based on conduct by the defendants which prevents the plaintiffs from \nentering into a contract with a third party.”  Walker v. Sloan, 137 N.C. App. 387, 392–\n93 (2000) (citing Owens v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co., 330 N.C. 666, 680 (1992)).  A claim \nfor tortious interference with prospective economic advantage requires a plaintiff to \nshow that the defendant “ interfere[d] with a business relationship ‘ by maliciously \ninducing a person not to enter into a contract with [the plaintiff], which he [or she] \nwould have entered into but for the interference, . . . if damage proximately ensues, \nwhen this interference is done not in the legitimate exercise of the interfering person's \nrights.’”  Beverage Sys. of the Carolinas, LLC v. Associated Bev. Repair, LLC, 368 N.C. \n693, 701 (2016) (quoting Spartan Equip. Co. v. Air Placement Equip. Co. , 263 N.C. \n549, 559 (1965)).  The malice required to overcome a justification of business \ncompetition is legal malice, and not actual malice.  Childress v. Abeles, 240 N.C. 667, \n675 (1954)  (“It is not necessary, however, to allege and prove actual malice in the \nsense of personal hatred, ill will, or spite in order to make out a case for the recovery \nof compensatory damages against the outsider for tortiously inducing the breach of \nthe third person’s contract with the plaintif f.  The term ‘malice’ is used in this \nconnection in its legal sense and denotes the intentional doing of the harmful act \nwithout legal justification.”).  Legal malice “means intentionally doing a wrongful act \nor exceeding one’s legal right or authority in order to prevent the making of a contract \nbetween two parties” and the act “must be taken with the design of injuring  one of \nthe parties to the contract or of gaining some advantage at the expense of a part y.”  \nBldg. Ctr., Inc. v. Carter Lumber of the Nort h, Inc., 2017 NCBC LEXIS 85, *28- 29, \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 21, 2017) (quoting Murphy v. McIntyre, 69 N.C. App. 323, 328-\n29 (1984)). \n57. Encompass responds only to Hilsman’s second argument that \nEncompass cannot produce “but for” evidence that Encompass would have awarded \nany of the contracts with which it claims Defendants interfered.  (ECF No. 163, at p. \n22.)  Encompass points to the circumstances surrounding Maser’s changed bid on the \nLine 328 project as evidence that Hilsman and Maser accessed and used information \non the Egnyte server.  (Id.)  The Court concludes that Encompass has created an issue \nof fact with regard to whether Encompass would have been awarded the Line 328 \nproject had it not been for Hilsman’s interference. \n58. As to Hilsman’s first argument, the  undisputed evidence establishes \nthat Hilsman, while working at Maser, was a competitor with Encompass for the type \nof work involved in the Line 328 project and had a legitimate business interest in \nacquiring such work of that nature .  Nevertheless, the evidence that Hilsman \naccessed Encompass’ confidential Egnyte data and Encompass’ bid for the Line 328 \nproject, and that Maser then changed its bid to undercut Encompass’  bid, is also \nsufficient to create an issue of material fact as to whether Hilsman ac ted with legal \nmalice.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Encompass, these facts \ncould support a jury concluding that Hilsman intentionally and wrongfully used \nEncompass’ confidential information to prevent Encompass from winning the Line \n328 project contract, and that Hilsman took these actions with the design of gaining \nan unfair advantage over Encompass.  See Murphy, 69 N.C. App. at 328-29. \n59. Therefore, to the extent Hilsman’s Motion seeks summary judgment in \nhis favor as to Encompass’ claim for tortious interference with prospective economic \nadvantage, Hilsman’s Motion should be DENIED.   \nC. Computer Trespass  \n60. Defendants seek summary judgment in their respective favors on \nEncompass’ claim for computer trespass.   In the Verified Complaint, Encompass \nalleges that “Hilsman and Maser (through Hilsman) used Encompass’ computer or \ncomputer network without authority and with the intent to . . . [make] an \nunauthorized copy of Encompass’ computer data residing in, communicated by, or \nproduced by Encompass’ computer or computer network” and that “Defendants had \nno right or permission from Encompass to use its computer or computer network, \nand/or used Encompass’ computer or computer network i n a manner exceeding any \nright or permission.”  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 57 –58.)  Encompass alleges that Hilsman’s \nand Maser’s conduct violated N.C.G.S. § 14-458.13  (Id. at ¶ 59.) \n61. The provisions of section 14-458 relevant to Encompass’ claim state that \n“it shall be unlawful for any person to use a computer or computer network without \nauthority and with the intent to . . . [m]ake or cause to be made an unauthorized copy, \nin any form, including, but not limited to, any printed or electronic form of computer \ndata, computer programs, or computer software residing in, communicated by, or \nproduced by a computer or computer network.”  N.C.G.S. § 14-458(a)(5).  The statute \nfurther provides that “a person is ‘without authority’ when [ ] the person has no right \nor permission of the owner to use a computer, or the person uses a computer in a \nmanner exceeding the right or permission[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 14-458(a). \n62. Article 60 defines “computer” as “an internally programmed, automatic \ndevice that performs data processing or telephone switching.”  N.C.G.S. § 14 -453(2).  \nA “computer network” is defined as “the interconnection of communication systems \nwith a computer through remote terminals, or a complex consisting of two or more \ninterconnected computers or telephone switching equipment.”  N.C.G.S. § 14-453(3). \n63. Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment in their \nfavor on Encompass’ computer trespass claim under N.C.G.S. § 14-458\n14 because that \n \n13 Section 14-458 is contained within Article 60 of Chapter 14 entitled “Computer Related \nCrimes.”  N.C.G.S. §§ 14-453–458.2 (“Article 60”). \n14 While section 14-458 governs the crime of computer trespass, the statute allows for “[a]ny \nperson whose property or person is injured by reason of a violation of this section [to] sue for \nstatute does not apply to the facts of this case, and because Hilsman accessed \nEncompass’ computer network with authorization.   (ECF No. 126 [SEALED], \nredacted at ECF No. 137 , at p. 22; ECF No. 125, at pp. 21 –22.)  Specifically, \nDefendants argue that (1) the defi nition of “without authority” under the statute  \napplies to unauthorized use of a computer and not a computer network  as is alleged \nin this case; and (2) because Hilsman’s username and password to the Encompass \nserver remained active through January 4, 2019,  and because Hilsman was never \ninstructed to not access the Encompass server,  Hilsman’s access of the server was \nauthorized, citing in support a federal case addressing the “without authorization” \nissue “under a companion federal law known as the Computer  Fraud and Abuse Act \n(‘CFAA’).”  (ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at ECF No. 137, at pp. 22–26; ECF No. \n125, at pp. 21–23; citing WEC Carolina Energy Solutions LLC v. Miller, 687 F.3d 199, \n202 (4th Cir. 2012) (affirming the dismissal of a CFAA claim brought  by employer \nagainst a former employee and business competitor where the defendant -employee \naccessed and downloaded documents before he resigned, and after resigning, used \nthem to gain business for his new employer).   \n64.  In response, Encompass first argues that Defendants’ interpretation of \nN.C.G.S. § 14 -458 is “fatally flawed” because it would render “null” section 14-\n458(a)(5), which expressly makes unlawful the unauthorized “use of  a computer or \ncomputer network” to make a copy of electronic data.  (ECF No. 163, at p. 18 (emphasis \nadded); citing to HCA Crossroads Residential Centers, Inc. v. N. Carolina Dep’t of \n \nand recover any damages su stained and the costs of the suit pursuant to G.S. 1 -539.2A.”  \nN.C.G.S. § 14-458(c).   \nHuman Res., Div. of Facility Servs., Certificate of Need Section , 327 N.C. 573, 578 \n(1990) (“[A] statute must be construed, if possible, to give meaning and effect to all of \nits provisions.”)).   \n65. Second, Encompass argues that, when Hilsman copied data from the \nEgnyte computer server via the cloud, Hilsman was accessing the data on Encompass’ \ncomputers, citing to the definition of “computer” in the CFAA and authority from the \nfederal courts.  (ECF No. 163, at p. 19; citing 18 U.S.C.A. § 1030(e)(1) (defining the \nterm “computer” to “include[] any data storage facility or communications facility \ndirectly related to or operating in conjunction with such device . . .”); United States v. \nSavader, 944 F. Supp. 2d 209, 214 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) ( explaining that “ [c]loud \nstorage is a service model in which data is maintained, managed and backed up on \nremote servers (computers) and then made  available to users over a network \n(typically the internet)” (citation omitted)) ; Prop. Rights Law Group P.C. v. Lynch , \nNo. 13 -00273 SOM/RLP 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74259 (D. Haw. May 30, 2014) \n(holding that a defendant “[a]ccessing [a plaintiff’s] ‘cloud’ constitutes accessing a \n‘protected computer’ within the meaning of the CFAA”).)   \n66. Third, Encompass argues that , unlike the CFAA, North Carolina’s \nstatute does not use the term “access”; rather, North Carolina makes it unlawful for \nany person to use a computer or computer network without authority.  (ECF No. 163, \nat p. 20; citing N.C.G.S. § 14-458(a).)  Accordingly, Encompass argues that “the record \nevidence shows that before and after his resignation from Encompass, Hilsman \ncopied over 10,000 files related t o pricing, profit, performance, etc., so that he would \nbe able to use them for the benefit of his new employer.”  (Id. at p. 21.)   \n67. Determination of Defendants’ statutory argument requires the Court to \ninterpret the relevant provisions of Article 60 and, more particularly, section 14-458.  \nThe Supreme Court of North Carolina summarized the basic principles used by our \ncourts when interpreting the language in a statute as follows: \n[q]uestions of statutory interpretation are ultimately \nquestions of law for the courts . . . .  The principal goal of \nstatutory construction is to accomplish the legislative \nintent.  The best indicia of that intent are the language of \nthe statute, the spirit of the a ct and what the act seeks to \naccomplish.  The process of construing a statutory \nprovision must begin with an examination of the relevant \nstatutory language.  It is well settled that where the \nlanguage of a statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no \nroom for judicial construction and the courts must construe \nthe statute using its plain meaning. \n \nWilkie v. City of Boiling Spring Lakes , 370 N.C. 540, 547 (2018)  (cleaned up).  In \naddition,  \n[c]ourts should “give effect to the words actually used in a \nstatute” and should neither “delete words used” nor “insert \nwords not used” in the relevant statutory language during \nthe statutory construction process.  “[U]ndefined words are \naccorded their plain meaning so long as it is reasonable to \ndo so.”  In determining t he plain meaning of undefined \nterms, “this Court has used ‘standard nonlegal dictionaries’ \nas a guide.”  Finally, statutes should be construed so that \nthe resulting construction “harmonizes with the \nunderlying reason and purpose of the statute.”  \n \nMidrex Techs. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 369 N.C. 250, 258 (2016) (citations omitted). \n68. As to Defendants’ first argument, while the applicable definition of \n“without authority” in N.C.G.S. § 14-458(a) appears to create an inconsistency within \nthe statute by limiting the term to unpermitted access of a “computer” and not a \n“computer network,” here, all parties acknowledge that the Egnyte system  (the \ncomputer network) provides access to Encompass’ server.  (See ECF No. 125, at p. 21 \n(“Here, Hilsman admits that on specific occasions following his employment he \naccessed Encompass’ cloud- based computer network in the form of the Egnyte \nserver.”); ECF No. 164, at p. 1 (referring to the “undisputed fact[]” that “Hilsman [  ] \ncontinue[d] to access [Encompass’] Egnyte server for nearly five months following his \ndeparture from Encompass”).)  Encompass alleges in its complaint that access to \ndocuments on this server is the basis of its computer trespass claim.  (See ECF No. 3, \nat ¶¶ 22–29, 56–59.)  While “server” is not defined in the trespass act, the Court may \nlook to standard non -legal dictionaries as a guide.  See Midrex Techs.,  396 N.C. at \n258.  Merriam-Webster defines “server” as “a computer in a network that is used to \nprovide services (such as access to files or shared peripherals or the routing of email) \nto other computers in the network.”  Server,  MERRIAM-WEBSTER, \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/server (last visited May 20, 2021).  \nDictionary.com defines “server” as “a computer that makes services, as access to data \nfiles, programs, and peripheral devices, available to workstations on a network.”  \nServer, Dictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/server  (last visited May \n20, 2021).     \n69. In addition, it is a tenet of North Carolina statutory construction that  \n“[p]ortions of the same statute dealing with the same subject matter are to be \nconsidered and interpreted as a whole, and . . .  every part of the law shall be given \neffect if this can be done by any fair and reasonable intendment.”  Huntington Props., \nLLC v. Currituck Cty., 153 N.C. App. 218, 224 (2002) (quotation and citation omitted).  \nHere, the first sentence of section 14-458(a) makes it unlawful to use “a computer or \ncomputer network without authority .” The last sentence  in this subsection defines  \n“without authority” as used in the subsection (a).  The most logical reading of the \nlanguage is that “without authority” is intended to apply to both use of a computer or \nuse of a computer network.  It would be highly inconsistent to make it unlawful for a \nperson to use a computer without authority but permit them to access the information \nthrough the computer’s network without authority.  In fact, the conduct prohibited by \nsubparagraphs (a)(1)–(6) (i.e., disabling a program on a computer network, altering \nor erasing data or programs, or making copies of computer data) would mostly be \nimpossible without accessing the network to which a computer is linked. \n70. Further, this Court’s interpretation is in line with the various federal \ncases interpreting the CFAA cited by Encompass holding that a “computer” includes \ncloud storage  and servers .  ( See ECF No. 163, at pp. 19– 20 and the cases cited \ntherein.) \n71. Therefore, the Court concludes t hat the term “without authority” in \nN.C.G.S. § 14-458(a) includes the use of computers and computer networks. \n72. As to Defendants’ second argument, while the Court acknowledges the \nfact that Encompass failed to revoke Hilsman’s access to Encompass’ server aft er \nHilsman’s resignation, the Court is not persuaded that Hilsman simply didn’t know, \nor was never “instructed,” that accessing this information on the Encompass server \nafter his departure from Encompass was prohibited.  First, the confidentiality \nprovision in Hilsman’s Employment Agreement plainly states that Hilsman  \nshall not, at any time during the term of this Agreement or \nfor one year thereafter, disclose to or make use of for any \nperson, corporation or other entity, any proprietary files, \ntrade secrets or other confidential information defined  as, \nthe business, clients, methods, operations, financing or \nservices of [Encompass]. \n \n(ECF No. 110.11, at ¶ 8.)  Second, Encompass’ Standards of Conduct implemented in \n2016 stated, in pertinent part with regards to “Confidentiality/Intellectual Property”:  \n[y]our employment with [Encompass] assumes an \nobligation to maintain confidentiality even after you leave \nour employment.  Employee agrees that all information . . . \nshall be held in confidence by Employee and shall not be \nused by Employee for any purpose other than for the \nperformance of the services contemplated by this \nAgreement or any other agreement between the parties.  \n \n(ECF No. 146.1, at p. 2.)  Third, Encompass took measures to secure the information \non the Egnyte server, such as password protection and folder permissions limiting \nthe access of certain information to only certain individuals.  (ECF No. 146.4, at pp. \n71–72; ECF No. 146.3, at p. 97; ECF No. 146.14, at ¶ 9.)   \n73. At the very least, there remains a dispute of material fact as to whether \nHilsman was authorized to access this information on the Egnyte server after his \nemployment with Encompass  terminated.  Further, the  federal case upon which \nDefendants rely in support of their argument —WEC Carolina Energy Solutions \nLLC—involved an employee’s access of a server during  his employment and before \nhis resignation.  See 687 F.3d at 202.  Here, the evidence demonstrates that Hilsman \naccessed the Egnyte server after he was no longer employed by Encompass.  (ECF No. \n152.5.)  To the extent these various accesses to the Egnyte server can be explained by \nway of the Egnyte Desktop Sync function (see, e.g., ECF No. 125, at p. 7), Defendants \nhave neither argued nor provided sufficient evidence that this automatic download \nfunction accounts for every single access by Hilsman  of the Egnyte server after he \nwas no longer employed by Encompass.  \n74. Therefore, the Court concludes that Defendants have failed to establish \nthat they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Encompass’ claim for \nviolation of section 14-458.  Accordingly, to the extent Maser’s Motion and Hilsman’s \nMotion seek summary judgment in their respective favors on Encompass’ claim for \nviolation of N.C.G.S. § 14-458, the Motions should be DENIED.    \nD. UDTPA  \n75. Defendants argue that Encompass’ UDTPA claim fails as a  matter of \nlaw because it is based on the same conduct as Encompass’ misappropriation claim \nunder the NC TSPA.  (ECF No. 125, at p. 19; ECF No. 126 [SEALED], redacted at \nECF No. 137, at p. 27 .)  Hilsman also contends that this lawsuit is an employment \ndispute, and employment disputes do not give rise to claims under the UDTPA.  (ECF \nNo. 164, at p. 5–6.)   \n76. “A violation of the [NC]TSPA may also constitute an unfair trade \npractice.”  Safety Test & Eqip. Co., 2015 NCBC LEXIS 40, at *47 (citing Med. Staffing \nNetwork, Inc. v. Ridgway , 194 N.C. App. 649, 659 –60 (2009); Drouillard v. Keister \nWilliams Newspaper Servs., Inc., 108 N.C. App. 169, 172–73 (1992)).  Given this Court \nhas concluded that Encompass’ misappropriation claim under the NC TSPA should \nsurvive summary judgment, Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment seeking \nsummary judgment in their favor on Encompass’ UDTPA claim should, accordingly, \nbe DENIED. \nE. Punitive Damages   \n77. As a “Sixth Cause of Action,” En compass asserts a claim for punitive \ndamages under N.C.G.S. §  1D-1, et seq.  (ECF No. 3, at ¶¶ 64– 68.)  Maser and \nHilsman make short, passing reference to their seeking of summary judgment on the \npunitive damages claim, but neither make any substantial or persuasive argument \nin support.  Therefore, to the extent Maser’s Motion and Hilsman’s Motion seek \nsummary judgment in their respective favors on Encompass’ claim for punitive \ndamages, Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment should be DENIED. \nF. Line 466 Project and Line 467 Project  \n78. Hilsman additionally contends that the Court should grant summary \njudgment in its favor on Encompass’ claims for damages regarding the Line 466 \nProject and Line 467 Project because “counsel for Encompass emailed Defendants \nstating that it would ‘remove two of those projects from our lost profits grid’” and that \n“the two projects specified were Line 466 and Line 467.”  (ECF No. 126 [SEALED], \nredacted at ECF No. 137 , at p. 27; citing ECF No. 110.14.)  Accordingly, Hilsman \nargues that “Encompass’ lost profits and damages claims should be limited to the \nLine 328 and Line 457 projects[.]” (Id.)  Encompass made no argument in opposition \nto this contention.  Accordingly, Hilsman’s Motion seeking summary judgment in his \nfavor on Encompass’ claims for damages regarding the Line 466 Project and the Line \n467 Project should be GRANTED. \nVI. CONCLUSION  \nTHEREFORE, it is ORDERED that the Motions are GRANTED, in part, and \nDENIED, in part, as follows: \n1. Hilsman’s Motion to Strike is DENIED.   \n2. Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment seeking summary \njudgment in their favor on Encompass’ misappropriation claim under \nthe NCTSPA are DENIED.  \n3. Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment seeking summary \njudgment in their favor on Encompass’ tortious interference with \nprospective economic advantage claim are DENIED.   \n4. Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment seeking summary \njudgment in their favor on Encompass’ computer trespass claim are  \nDENIED. \n5. Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment seeking summary \njudgment in their favor on Encompass’ UDTPA claim are DENIED. \n6. Defendants’ Motions for Summary Judgment seeking summary \njudgment in their favor on Encompass’ punitive damages claim are \nDENIED. \n7. Hilsman’s Motion seeking  summary judgment in his  favor on \nEncompass’ claims for damages regarding the Line 466 Project and the \nLine 467 Project is GRANTED. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 28th day of June, 2021. \n \n \n/s/ Gregory P.
