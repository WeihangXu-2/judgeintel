THIS MATTER arises out of the assertion of appraisal rights by \nDefendants, who are former shareholders of Plaintiff Reynolds American Inc. (“RAI” \nor the “Company”) , in connection with the merger  of RAI with  and into a wholly -\nowned subsidiary of British American Tobacco plc (“BAT”) (the “Merger”).  By statute, \nthe Court is charged with determining the fair value of Defendants ’ shares at the \ntime of the transaction.  N.C.G.S. § 55-13-30(a).   \n2. The Court has considered all relevan t and admissible evidence of value \npresented by the parties at trial, including the pre-Merger trading price of RAI stock; \nthe robustness of the negotiations between RAI and BAT and the resulting deal price; \nthe valuation work performed by Goldman  Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman”) , Lazard \n(formerly known as Lazard Frères & Co. ), and JPMorgan  Chase and Co. \n(“JPMorgan”) (collectively, the “Financial Advisors”) in connection with the M erger; \nthe pre-litigation valuations prepared by the parties ; and other evidence from the \ntestimony of the fact witnesses, the testimony of the parties ’ retained experts, and \nthe documents introduced by the parties as set forth herein.   \n3. After full consideration of the evidence presented at trial and the parties’ \nwell-presented arguments in voluminous pre - and post-trial submissions and at an \nall-day post-trial hearing, the Court, for the reasons set forth below,  concludes that \nthe $59.64 per share that RAI has already paid Defendants equals or exceeds the fair \nvalue of RAI shares as of the date of the Merger and that RAI is therefore entitled to \na judgment that no further payments to Defendants are required. \nCravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, by Gary A.

RAI filed this judicial appraisal action on November 29, 2017, pursuant to \nN.C.G.S. § 55-13-30.  (ECF No. 4.)  The case was designated as a mandatory complex \nbusiness case by Order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina \n \n \n \non November 30, 2017, (ECF No. 3), and assigned to the undersigned on December 1, \n2017, (ECF No. 2).   \n5. This matter came on for trial before the undersigned and was tried to the \nCourt, sitting without a jury, on June 10–25, 2019.  By consent of all parties, the trial \nwas held in Mecklenburg County.  Th e trial was conducted by very experienced and \naccomplished counsel and generated an extensive record.  The Court admitted into \nevidence 177 exhibits and received testimony both from witnesses appearing at trial \nand from witnesses appearing by written deposition transcript and/or by videotape.1  \nThe parties have submitted post -trial briefs and proposed findings of fact and \nconclusions of law, and the Court heard post-trial oral argument on October 2, 2019.  \nAll issues and claims are now ripe for determination.   \n6. Having considered the relevant and admissible evidence 2 and the \nsubmissions and arguments of the parties, the Court now makes the following \n                                                 \n1 Four experts appeared and testified at trial.  Plaintiff’s expert was Dr. Paul Gompers  \n(“Gompers”), the Eugene Holman Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business \nSchool.  (Gompers Tr. 721:5 –18; Parties’ Witness Summaries 3, ECF No. 189.)   Defendants \nintroduced expert testimony from three experts: Dr. Fredrick Flyer (“Flyer”), the Executive \nVice President of Compass Lexecon, an economic consulting firm, (Flyer Tr. 1065:18–1066:11; \nParties’ Witness Summaries 2); Dr. Mark Zmijewski (“Zmijewski”), a Professor Emeritus of \nfinancial accounting and corporate finance  at The University of Chicago Booth School of \nBusiness, (Zmijewski Tr. 1237:23– 1238:5; Parties’ Witness Summaries 6); and Dr. Bilge \nYilmaz (“Yilmaz”), the Wharton Private Equity Professor and a Professor of Finance at the \nWharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, (Yilmaz Tr. 1863:23– 1864:21; Parties’ \nWitness Summaries 6).  Nine fact witnesses appeared and testified at trial .  Deposition \ntestimony was introduced from an additional seven fact witnesses.   \n2 The parties lodged numerous objections to proffered exhibits and testimony during the trial.  \nThe Court ruled on many of these objections at the time they were made.  As to others, \nhowever, the Court received the proffered exhibits and testimony subject to objection and \npermitted post-trial briefing and argument on the objections.  The Court’s rulings on the \nparties’ remaining evidentiary objections are set forth in Appendix B attached hereto and \nthose rulings are incorporated herein. \n \n \n \nfindings of fact and conclus ions of law pursuant to Rule  52(a) of the North Carolina \nRules of Civil Procedure (“Rule(s)”). \nII. \nFINDINGS OF FACT3 \n7. Plaintiff RAI is a corporation incorporated under the laws of North Carolina, \nwith its principal place of business located in Winston-Salem, Forsyth County, North \nCarolina.  (JX0017.0003.)   \n8. Prior to July 25, 2017,  RAI was a public company traded on the Ne w York \nStock Exchange (“NYSE”), with over 1.4 billion shares of common stock outstanding.  \n(JX0017.0001, .0003.)  Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated January \n16, 2017 (the “Merger Agreement”), (JX0023.0572–.0647), a wholly-owned subsidiary \nof BAT was merged with and into RAI on July 25, 2017 (the “Transaction Date”), with \nRAI continuing as the surviving corporation and as an indirect and wholly -owned \nsubsidiary of BAT, (Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶¶ 17, 19; JX0017.0003).   \n9. Plaintiff seeks a judgment establishing the fair value of RAI common stock \nat no more than $59.64 per share.  (Bornstein Tr. 13:16–18.) \n                                                 \n3 Any determination later stated as a C onclusion of Law that should have been stated as a \nfinding of fact is incorporated in these Findings of Fact.  The Court incorporates herein and \nadopts as findings of fact the Corrected Joint Statement of Stipulated Facts filed by the \nparties on September 27, 2019.  ( Corrected Joint Statement Stipulated Facts [hereinafter \n“Corr. Stip’d Facts”], ECF No. 233.)  Citations to the record herein are not exhaustive and do \nnot necessarily reflect all evidence upon which corresponding findings of fact are based. \n \n \n \n \n10. Defendants (or “Dissenters”)4 are former shareholders of RAI who asserted \nappraisal rights in connection with the Merger.  Dissenters seek appraisal for \n9,641,911 shares held on the date of the Merger.  (Compl.  Judicial Appraisal ¶¶ 3–\n25, ECF No. 4; Appendix A.)   \n11. Dissenters contend that the $59.64 per share they received for their shares \ndoes not reflect the shares’ fair valu e and instead seek a judgment establishing the \nfair value of RAI common stock at  $92.17 per share , plus interest , pursuant to \nN.C.G.S. 55-13-30(e)(i).  (Sadighi Tr. 30:5–8.)  Dissenters also seek to recover their \ncosts and expenses, including their attorneys’ fees.   \nA. RAI’S Business \n12. At the time of the Merger, RAI was a holding company whose wholly-owned \nsubsidiaries collectively had three major business lines:  cigarettes, moist snuff, and \nvapor and other “next generation products .”  (Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 7.)  RAI’s \nsubsidiaries operated predominantly in the United States, with domestic sales \naccounting for over 97% of  their collective revenue in 2016.  (JX0017.0032, .0075, \n.0154.)  RAI’s wholly -owned subsidiary, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (“RJR T”), \nwas the second largest tobacco company in the United States .  At the time of the \nMerger, RAI had a market capitalization of over $67 billion.  (PX0115.0181; Gompers \nTr. 777:25–778:10.) \n                                                 \n4 Each individual Dissenter, with the number of shares the Dissenter owned and the amount \nRAI paid to the Dissenters for the Dissenters’ shares, is set forth in the chart attached hereto \nas Appendix A.  As shown on the chart, there are three groups of dissenters: the “ Magnetar \nDefendants,” the “Canyon, Mason, and BlueMountain Defendants,” and the “Barry Blank \nTrust.” \n \n \n \n13. RAI’s primary product was cigarettes, which it sold through its subsidiaries \nRJRT and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company , Inc.  (“SFNTC”).  Cigarettes  \naccounted for approximately 90% of RAI’s revenue in mid-2017.  (JX0017.0005, .0018; \nWajnert5 Tr. 35:5–7; Fragnito6 Tr. 1670:3–5.)  RAI’s primary cigarette brands were \nNewport, the best-selling menthol cigarette in the United States ; Camel; Pall Mall; \nand Natural American Spirit.  (Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 10; JX0017.0017.)  These brands \naccounted for approximately 93% of RAI’s cigarette units sold in 2016.  \n(JX0017.0038–.0041; PX0063.0044–.0045; Fragnito Tr. 1670:3–12.)  RAI referred to \nthese brands as its “drive brands ” and provided greater marketing and discounting \nsupport behind them.  (JX0017.0038; PX0063.0051–.0052; Gilchrist7 Tr. 406:7–12.) \n14. In addition to cigarettes, RAI sold moist snuff through its operating \ncompany, American Snuff Company , LLC (“American Snuff”), which accounted for \nroughly 7% of RAI’s revenue in 2016.  (PX0009.0003.)  At the time of the Merger, \nAmerican Snuff was the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in \nthe United States, (DX0321.0008), and it s primary brands included Grizzly and \nKodiak, (Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 11; JX0017.0032).  U.S. moist snuff retail volumes grew \n2% to 3% annually from 2011 to 2016.  (Flyer Tr. 1113:4–9; DX0321.0008.) \n                                                 \n5 Thomas Wajnert (“Wajnert”), the former Chair and C hief Executive Officer (“CEO”)  of \nAT&T Capital Corporation , was Chair of the RAI Board of Directors from 2010 until \nDecember 31, 2016.  (Wajnert Tr. 31:17–32:16, 34:11–12; Parties’ Witness Summaries 5.)  \n6 Joseph Fragnito (“Fragnito”) was President and Chief Commercial Officer of R JRT at the \ntime of the Merger.  (Fragnito Tr. 1666:9–13; Parties’ Witness Summaries 3.) \n7 Andrew Gilchrist (“Gilchrist”) was Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of RAI at the time of \nthe Merger.  (Gilchrist Tr. 370:20–371:6; Parties’ Witness Summaries 3.)   \n \n \n \n15. RAI had an other operating company , RAI Innovations  Company (“RAI \nInnovations”), that was responsible for  its next generation products, including its \nvapor products.  RAI’s primary vapor product at the time of the Merger was Vuse .  \n(Corr.  Stip’d Facts ¶ 12.)  Prior to the Merger, RAI Innovations’ revenues were never \nmaterial enough to warrant separate public reporting.  RAI Innovations accounted \nfor roughly $150 million in revenue in 2016, which was roughly 1.2% of RAI’s total \nrevenue that year.  (Hanigan 8 Tr. 1623:11–13, 1648:9–17; DX0061.0007– .0008; \nDX0233.0016; JX0017.0069.)  As of the Transaction Date , RAI Innovations had not \nyet posted a profit on its vaping and other next generation products .  (Hanigan  Tr. \n1651:13–17; Crew9 Tr. 642:25–643:22; Flyer Tr. 1205:17–21; Fragnito Tr. 1683:21–\n25.) \nB. The Challenges Facing RAI and the U.S. Tobacco Industry \n16. Although the parties agree that the tobacco industry is in decline, the \nseverity and rapidity of that decline and its impact on RAI’s future growth were hotly \ncontested issues at trial.  Stated broadly, RAI tended to introduce evidence suggesting \nthat RAI’s future grow th is imperiled by real and substantial risks that were not  \nquantified or measure d through its ordinary course financial modeling and are \nsignificant downward determinant s in assessing RAI’s fair value.  In contrast, \nDissenters tended to introduce evidence suggesting that RAI had enjoyed strong \n                                                 \n8 Carolyn Hanigan (“Hanigan”) was the President of  RAI Innovations at the time of the \nMerger.  (Hanigan Tr. 1612:3–7; Parties’ Witness Summaries 3.) \n9 Debra Crew (“Crew”) was President and Chief Operating Officer of RJRT before she became \nRAI’s CEO and joined the RAI Board on January 1, 2017.  She served as RAI’s CEO through \nthe Transaction Date.  (Crew Tr. 631:17–22; Parties’ Witness Summaries 2.)   \n \n \n \nrevenue and earnings growth in the years leading up to the Merger, its ordinary \ncourse modeling forecasted continued strong growth for at least the next decade, and \nRAI’s concerns over the future risks to its business were exaggerated. \n17. Prior to the Merger, RAI had reasons for both optimism and serious concern \nabout its future.  Through acquisitions and divestitures, cost -cutting, and sound \nfinancial management, RAI had weathered the decline of the U.S. tobacco industry \nreasonably well, and it had built a portfolio of strong brands .  Indeed, RAI’s drive \nbrands accounted for well over 9 0% of RAI’s cigarette sales by mid -2017, (Fragnito \nTr. 1670:3–13), and three of those brands —Newport, Camel, and Pall Mall —\nexperienced volume growth during the ten years prior to the Merger, (Flyer Tr.  \n1110:4–11).   \n18. Nevertheless, RAI management and its B oard of Directors appropriately \nrecognized that the Company was subject to certain key negative trends affecting the \nU.S. tobacco industry at large.  They also understood that the Company was limited \nin its ability to grow in the ways it had in the recent past and was exposed to key \nrisks that, if they came t o pass, would cause material harm to RAI’s business and \nprofitability and substantially limit the Company’s growth or even cause its business \nto decline.  (Wajnert Tr. 43:17–49:11; Gompers Tr. 730:10–731:5.) \na. Cigarette Volume Declines \n19. The U.S. cigarette mar ket at the time of the Merger was “[c]learly an \nindustry in structural decline.”  (Crew Tr.  640:21–641:7; Wajnert Tr.  35:13–36:2; \nFragnito Tr. 1669:14–1697:8.)  Overall demand for cigarettes had been declining \n \n \n \nsteadily at an average of 3% to 4% per year since 1981, and that trend was expected \nto continue for the foreseeable future.  (de Gennaro10 Tr. 204:5–25; Wajnert Tr. 35:13–\n36:2; Crew Tr. 640:21–641:10; Flyer Tr. 1092:20–1093:6; JX0017.0005.)  As a point of \nreference, the U.S. cigarette industry sold 624 billion cigarettes (“sticks”) in 1981.  In \n2016, the number was 258 billion, an amount roughly in line with sales during the \n1940s when the U.S. population was less than half its total in July 2017:   \n \n(PX0009.0006.)   \n20. In addition to the total number of cigarettes sold, the number of consumers \nand the individual levels of tobacco consumption by each consumer was also in long \nterm decline as of the Transaction Date.  (JX0017.0018; Flyer Tr. 1188:17–1189:17.)  \n                                                 \n10 Maxence de Gennaro (“de Gennaro”) was a Managing Director at Lazard who provided \nfinancial advice to RAI concerning the Merger as well as in connection with RAI’s purchase \nof Lorillard Tobacco Company (“Lorillard”) in 2015.  (de Gennaro Tr. 184:13–185:18, 186:21–\n187:9; Parties’ Witness Summaries 2.) \n\n \n \n \nThe number of new smokers also was steadily decreasing, (Flyer Tr.  1189:8–17), \ndropping from 20% of 20 -year-olds to 10% over the prior 20 -year period, (Flyer Tr.  \n1189:12–17, 1204 :20–1205:13).  The age at which smokers reached their peak \nsmoking consumption was also accelerating.  (Flyer Tr. 1188:17–1189:7.) \n21. The evidence showed that there are several factors contributing to the \ntobacco industry’s decline, many of which are familiar: health con cerns; price \nincreases; restrictions on advertising and promotions; governmental and private \nrestrictions on the locations where tobacco may be used; increases in federal, state , \nand local regulation and excise taxes that have made tobacco more expensive f or \nconsumers; a general decline in the social acceptability of smoking ; and a migration \nto smoke-free products.  (JX0017.0018; de Gennaro Tr. 204:3–25.) \n22. RAI was not immune to the industry -wide decline.  Testimony from RAI’s \nFragnito confirmed that RAI’s sales volumes have declined at rates approaching the \nrates of decline in the industry overall.  (Fragnito Tr. 1669:10–1670:2.)  Indeed, \nDissenters’ expert Flyer  testified that it is possible RAI’s cigarette business will \ndecline such that by  2026, cigarettes “may be 15, 20 percent of the business [,]” as \nopposed to nearly 90% of RAI’s business in 2017.  (Flyer Tr. 1207:4–23.)   \n23. RAI ha d been able to partially offset declining volumes by growing its \nmarket share for certain of its brands.  (Fragnito Tr. 1678:4–9.)  Increased market \nshare, however, does not directly correlate with increased profitability.  As Fragnito \nput it, gaining market share in cigarettes “essentially just means you’re gaining a \nlarger slice in a much smaller pie.”  (Fragnito Tr. 1678:10–15.)  There was no evidence \n \n \n \nthat RAI’s modest share gains would materially offset annual volume declines of 3 % \nto 4% in the future.  In fact, RAI’s internal documents state otherwise.  In materials \nprepared for a February 2, 2017 meeting of RAI’s Board of Directors, in which RAI \nmanagement described 2016 as a “BIG year” with “ Outstanding results[,]” RAI saw \nan overall increase of 0.3% in its share of cigarette sales, but nonetheless experienced \na 2% decline in cigarette shipments and expected that “[l]o ng term, [RAI would] \nresume a 3% - 4% industry decline[.]”  (DX0291.0121–.0124.)   \nb. Limited Sources of Potential Growth \n24. Given the substantial declines in sales of cigarettes, which accounted for a \nsubstantial majority of RAI’s profits, RAI historically employed a variety of operating \nand non-operating mechanisms in order to meet its goal of annual earnings per share \n(“EPS”) growth in the “high single-digit[s.]”\n11   (Wajnert Tr. 110:14–18; Gilchrist Tr. \n373:20–374:13.) RAI was able to achieve its EPS targets through a combination of \nengaging in mergers and acquisitions, aggressively cutting costs, taking advantage \nof low interest rates to refinance its debt, repurchasing its own stock , and—most \nimportantly—raising prices for its products.  (Cre w Tr. 642:7–24, 644:17 –645:15, \n646:4–25, 647:16– 648:18; Peters\n12 Dep. Tr. 93:05–94:01.)  The evidence showed, \n                                                 \n11 RAI’s EPS growth goal was in response  to shareholder demands  and expectations .  \n(Gilchrist Tr. 373:20–374:13 (“Q.  And is there a reason that the company tracked EPS as its \nprimary metric?  A.  That was what the shareholders were primarily focused on.  That’s what \nour board had structured, you know, a lot of our goals and objectives around.  So that was \nour primary focus and that’s where our goals and objectives had been – you know, had been \nfocused from the board perspective.”).) \n12 Mark Peters (“Peters”) was RJRT’s CFO at the time of the Merger.  (Peters Dep. Tr. 17:14–\n18:7.)  Portions of Peters’s deposition were admitted into the trial record.  (ECF No. 207.) \n \n \n \nhowever, that, at the time of the Merger, the mechanisms RAI had previously \nemployed to increase profitability and meet its EPS targets were less l ikely to be \navailable in the future.   \ni. Fewer M&A Opportunities \n25. Historically, consolidation had been a way for the tobacco industry to lower \ncosts and address declining consumer demand.  While there had originally been a \ngroup of seven leading U.S. tobacco companies, commonly referred to as the “Big \nSeven,” over time consolidation in the industry had shrunk the number of competitors \nfrom the Big Seven to the “Big Three.”  (Crew Tr.  646:17–25; Fragnito Tr. 1674:13–\n16.)  The Big Three included (i) Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”), the maker, through its \nsubsidiary Philip Morris USA Inc. (“Philip Morris”), of the leading Marlboro brand \ncigarette and the market leader with a nearly 50% share of sales; (ii) RAI, with a \n32.3% share of sales; and (iii) Imperial Tobacco Group, PLC (“ITG”), with a 9% share \nof sales.  Several smaller manufacturers of deep-discount brands competed for market \nshare against the Big Three.  ( Corr. Stip’d Facts  ¶ 8; JX0017.0005 –.0006; \nJX0004.0024; PX0063.0047; Fragnito Tr. 1674:9–18.)   \n26. RAI had played a leading role in this consolidation trend.  As Crew testified, \nRAI had long served as a “consolidator in the industry[,]” with that history of \nconsolidation helping Reynolds “stay[ ] in business.”  Crew testified that most of the \nBig Seven U.S.  tobacco companies “are now part of Reynolds American[,]” and \ndescribed how RAI had engaged in a series of acquisitions, culminating in the \nacquisition of a large competitor, Lorillard, in 2015.  (Crew Tr. 646:11–647:6; \n \n \n \nJX0014.0001 (“Our 900% +return over the last 10 years ha[s] been largely driven by \ndeals[.]”).)   \n27. By the time of the Merger negotiations  in October 2016, however, it \nappeared that RAI would no longer be able to rely on meaningful future mergers and \nacquisitions to overcome the effect of declining cigarette sales volumes and to increase \nits profitability and EPS.  As RAI’s CFO  at th at time, Gilchrist testified that \n“consolidation had sort of run its course in terms of really material impact \nconsolidation.”  ( Gilchrist Tr. 433:13–20.)  Wajnert  similarly testified that, due to \nantitrust concerns, there “were not major revenue [M&A] opportunities at all” \nbecause “the industry had consolidated so much over the years[,]” leaving only three \nmajor competitors.  (Wajnert Tr. 40:18–41:2.)  In addition, de Gennaro testified that, \nafter RAI acquired Lorillard, “it was inconceivable that the regulators” would have \nallowed further consolidation in the tobacco industry to make it effectively a duopoly.  \n(de Gennaro Tr.  190:10–21.)  In short, “there [were] no big deals remaining.”  \n(JX0014.0001; Crew Tr. 647:3–15; Flyer Tr. 1156:14–24; Peters Dep. Tr.  93:05–\n94:01.)  Thus, future consolidation was not a likely strategy for R AI to increase \nprofitability and EPS. \nii. Reduced Cost-Cutting Opportunities \n28. Another important tool RAI had used to increase its profitability had been \ncost-cutting.  RAI historically had successfully implemented numerous cost -cutting \ninitiatives to improve productivity and efficiency.  (Wajnert Tr.  39:8–23; Crew Tr.  \n642:16–19.)  By the time of the Merger, however, RAI’s ability to further cut costs as \n \n \n \na standalone company had been nearly exhausted, particularly as synergies 13 had \ngotten “thin.”  (Crew Tr. 648:19–649:5; Peters Dep. Tr.  93:05–94:01.)  For example, \nRAI identified $800 million in synergies attributable to the acquisition of Lorillard in \n2015, but by July 2016, the vast majority of those synergies had been achieved.  (Crew \nTr. 649:5–649:15; Wajnert Tr.  52:15–17; Gilchrist Tr.  490:1–10 (“I believe the \nmajority had been captured and we were just –  the last piece of synergies had to do \nwith machinery and the move from the old Lorillard facility to Winston-Salem.”).) \niii. Debt Refinancing Completed \n29. RAI also employed non -operating financial strategies affecting its finances \n“below the line” to meet EPS targets, including liabilities management.  (Crew Tr.  \n647:16–25.)  Given RAI’s extensive mergers and acquisitions activity, RAI often had \nsubstantial levels of debt.  Accordingly, in 2016, one of the financial steps RAI took \nto help  meet its EPS goals was to capitalize on historically low interest rates to \nrefinance much of its debt.  But this was a one -time event.  Because there were few \nopportunities for further debt refinancing , that once -effective strategy  no longer \n                                                 \n13 Synergies are gains that a buyer expects to achieve through the combination of its existing \nbusiness and the acquired one.  See, e.g ., Adam Barone, Synergy , Investopedia (March 10, \n2020), https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synergy.asp (“Synergy is the concept that the \ncombined value and performance of two companies will be greater than the sum of the \nseparate individual parts.”); Synergy, Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary, \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synergy (defining “synergy” as “a mutually \nadvantageous conjunction or compatibility of distinct business participants or elements \n(such as resources or efforts)” ). \n \n \n \npresented RAI a significant path to increase its profitability moving forward.  (Crew \nTr. 648:9–18; Price14 Tr. 1044:20–25.)  \niv. Limited Share Buyback Opportunities \n30. RAI also sought to increase its EPS by repurchasing shares of its stock on \nthe open market in share buybacks.  (Crew Tr. 647:16–25; Price Tr. 1022:16–22 (“So \nthe share repurchases are something that we had been doing for a number of years.  \nSomething that the analysts liked seeing.  And it was an efficient way to utilize the \ncash when we didn’t have other uses f or it.”).)  Although RAI’s Board of Directors \napproved a $2 billion share repurchase program in June 2016 due to certain unique \ncircumstances relating to RAI’s 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) \npayment obligations in 2017, (Gilchrist Tr. 412:4 –413:11; Wajnert Tr. 146:2 –5), as \nwith debt refinancing, share buybacks were not a viable, long -term solution to \novercome declining annual cigarette sales volumes to maintain or increase profits, \n(Gilchrist Tr. 413:12–14).   \nv. Constrained Net Price Realization \n31. Through the date of the Merger, the primary driver of profit growth for RAI \nand its competitors in the U.S. tobacco industry ha d been the ability to increase \ncigarette pricing above the rate of volume decline over many years due in no small \npart to the largely inelastic demand for cigarettes resulting from nicotine addiction .  \n(JX0004.0006, .0028;  Flyer Tr. 1095:17– 21, 1096:12– 21; Crew Tr. 642:7–15; de \n                                                 \n14 Ronald Price (“Price”) was Vice President of Business Development of RJRT at the time of \nthe Merger.  (Price Tr. 940:12–941:7; Parties’ Witness Summaries 5.) \n \n \n \nGennaro Tr. 204:3–16; Cameron15 Dep. Tr. 25:08–16; Wajnert Tr. 37:18–38:4.)  RAI \nreferred to this pricing power as “net price realization.”  (DX0003.0094.)  As Fragnito \nexplained, “[I]f volume is declining at 3 percent, we would have [to] price above the 3 \npercent in order to drive profit.”  (Fragnito Tr. 1672:5–11.) \n32. RAI recognized that its reliance on net price realization would increase as \nvolumes continued to decline and thus that achieving sufficient net price realization \nwas “a critical imperative” to meet its EPS goals.  (Fragnito Tr.  1726:3–17; \nPX0063.0044; JX0004.0006.)  RAI anticipated that its future growth “would continue \nthrough increased pricing on cigarettes as the volumes declined [,]” but RAI also \nbelieved that the assumption that RAI could continue to raise prices indefinitely was \n“tenuous at best [,]” (Wajnert Tr. 41:14–19), because “you get to a point where the \nvolume declines were so substantial that you would end up having to raise prices to \n30, 40, $50 a pack of cigarettes, which obviously wouldn’t make sense[,]” (Wajnert Tr. \n39:2–7).  RAI’s Financial Advisors and RAI management, including Cameron, shared \nthese views, recognizing that  pricing strategies cannot offset volume decline “[i]n \nperpetuity” because to assume such would require “selling the last cigarette for 20 \nbillion” dollars.  (Cameron Dep. Tr.  93:13–25; de Gennaro Tr.  204:10–25; Crew Tr.  \n644:17–645:15; Fragnito Tr. 1672:20–1673:5; Gompers Tr. 746:11–17.)   \n                                                 \n15 Susan Cameron (“Cameron”) was RAI’s CEO from 2005 to 2010 and again from May 1, \n2014 until December 31, 2016.   She became the Chairman of the RAI Board on January 1, \n2017 and held that position at the time of the Merger.  (Cameron Dep. Tr. 10:18– 11:8; \nFragnito Tr. 1669:5– 9; Parties’ Witness Summaries 1.)  Portions of Cameron’s deposition \nwere admitted into the trial record.  (ECF No. 201.) \n \n \n \n33. Additionally, Altria’s de facto control over pricing dynamics in the cigarette \nindustry was a significant source of uncertainty impacting RAI’s ability to continue \nto increase prices to offset volume declines.  For the two decades prior to the Merger, \ncigarette pricing was led by Altria, which would raise prices for cigarettes twice per \nyear, amounting to about a 5 % to 6% total price increase annually.  The rest of the \nU.S. tobacco industry, including RAI, tended to follow Altria’s pricing.  (JX0004.0008–\n.0013; PX0063.0100, .0107; Wajnert Tr.  37:1–8; Fragnito Tr. 1673:21–25.)  Altria’s \nsubsidiary Philip Morris  and its pricing practices  are “the number one reason the \nindustry can or cannot take pricing.”  (Jennette\n16 Dep. Tr. 87:08–88:25.)   \n34.  RAI could not raise its prices before Altria because “Altria had a substantial \nmarket leverage, had much more volume.  They had more control over the \nmarketplace.”  (Wajnert Tr. 38:7–12.)  For this reason, RAI believed that if Altria did \nnot raise prices,  RAI could not profitably raise prices either, without accelerating \nswitching or “downtrading” from its consumers, (Crew Tr. 644:17– 645:15; Fragnito \nTr. 1675:19–1676:21; PX0063.0107; JX0009.0001), which occurs “when a consumer \nwill choose a lower priced of fering versus their usual brand that they would buy [,]” \n(Fragnito Tr. 1680:5–22).  In particular, RAI feared losing volume to Altria’s already \npopular Marlboro cigarettes, “which would be a preferred brand” if priced lower.  \n(Wajnert Tr. 38:17–23.) \n                                                 \n16 Winton Jennette (“Jennette”) was RJRT’s Senior Vice President of Strategy and Planning \nat the time of the Merger.   (Jennette Dep. Tr. 12:21– 24; Parties’ Witness Summaries 4.)  \nPortions of Jennette’s deposition were admitted into the trial record.  (ECF No. 205.) \n \n \n \n35. RAI’s perception of the pricing environment is grounded in historical fact.  \nIn 1993, Altria’s predecessor decided to dramatically drop the price of Marlboro \ncigarettes on what is referred to in the industry as “Marlboro Friday.”  As a result of \nMarlboro Friday, “pricing in the U.S. came down significantly [.]”  (Flyer Tr. 1090:8–\n14; Peters Dep. Tr. 92:8–17 (“Marlboro Friday . . . reduced industry profits \ndramatically.”).)   \n36. Further, Altria was a diversified company with sizeable interests in sectors \nbesides tobacc o, including beer, wine , and cigars, among others.  RAI was less \ndiversified and more reliant on cigarette pricing than Altria to grow its earnings.  \n(JX0004.0008–.0013; PX0063.0044, .0048 –.0049; Fragnito Tr. 1677:1–17.)  In 2016, \nin connection with the merger of beer companies AB InBev and SABMiller, of which \nAltria owned over 25%, Altria received a large cash payment and a roughly 10% \nequity stake in the newly-formed company.  There was significant concern within RAI \nthat Altria would have less pressure t o raise cigarette prices as it had done in the \npast because of the additional financial flexibility brought by the SABMiller deal.  \n(PX0063.0044, .0048–.0049, .0107; JX0004.0008 –.0009; JX0009; Fragnito Tr. \n1673:17–1674:8, 1677:18–1678:3 (“So [Altria has] o ther revenue and profit streams \nthat we don’t have at Reynolds that could potentially alleviate – if one of those other \nprofit streams did exceptionally well, it would reduce their need to drive a significant \namount of profit on their combustibles business via pricing.”).)  As Wajnert explained,  \nIf Altria had more alternatives to deliver earnings growth to their share \nowners that wasn’t dependent on raising prices for their cigarette \nportfolio, that would be a threat to Reynolds.  Because if Altria didn’t \nraise prices, Reynolds would not raise pri ces.  In which case, the \n \n \n \nreduction in cigarette volumes would have a significant impact on \nReynolds. \n(Wajnert Tr. 44:25–45:6.)   \n37. RAI also perceived a risk that Altria and Philip Morris International, an \ninternational tobacco company with no presence in the United States, would re-\ncombine and become a stronger, even more diversified company, again reducing \nAltria’s need to raise prices and putting RAI’s ability to compete with the combined \ncompany at risk.  (JX0014.0001; Cameron Dep. Tr. 25:8–26:9; Wajnert Tr. 83:15–84:6 \n(“[T]hey had been together previously and had been separated –  put those two \ncompanies back together, the economic power and the brand power would be \ntremendous.  And, in fact, they were working together in terms of innovation products \nas well, which was very threatening to Reynolds.”).) \n38. RAI also had reason to believe that it would face increased pricing pressure \nfrom deep-discount cigarette brand manufacturers.  As pricing by the Big Three \ncontinued to increase, these smaller manufacturers could become more competitive \nby maintaining pricing levels, or increasing them only slightly, and creating greater \nrelative discounts to the brands of the Big Three.  (Fragnito Tr. 1678:16–1679:15.)  In \nother words, the more the Big Three raised prices, the more attractive the deep -\ndiscount brands would become to consumers and the more those brands could raise \ntheir prices and increase their profits while still remaining lower-priced alternatives.  \n(Fragnito Tr. 1679:16–1680:4.)   \n39. RAI was particularly vulnerable to this threat due to its product mix.  RAI’s \nsales were concentrated in premium and super-premium brands, which accounted for \n \n \n \napproximately 73% of RAI’s cigarette volume in 2016.  (JX0017.0018;  Flyer Tr. \n1113:13–17.)  This concentration made RAI more susceptible to downtrading : “as \nconsumers look for less expensive alternatives [to RAI products], there’s less products \nwithin o ur portfolio that would meet that need from a price perspective.  So they \nultimately move to products outside of our portfolio.”  (Fragnito Tr.  1680:5–22; \nJX0017.0018 (“RAI’s subsidiaries are more susceptible to consumer price \nsensitivities[.]”).)  In addition, smokers in the 50+ age category, who are the heaviest \nsmokers and account for approximately 50% of RAI’s revenue, are more sensitive to \nincreases in cigarette prices and are more likely to downtrade in the face of increasing \nprices.17  (Fragnito Tr. 1682:13–1683:8.) \n40. Despite these serious long-term risks, RAI anticipated that, in the near term \n(and barring a change in behavior by Altria or increased excise taxation), it would be \nable to increase cigarette prices at historical levels and continue to prof it.  (Fragnito \nTr. 1672:2–1673:16.)  Over time, however, RAI’s ability to maintain growth through \nincreased pricing would become more and more doubtful.  (Fragnito Tr. 1672:20 –\n1673:3 (“[T]here would ultimately be a time where . . . the price of cigarettes would \nhave to be at a point where it would just accelerate the rate of decline.”).) \nvi. Uncertain Growth and Profitability  of Next Generation \nProducts \n \n41. RAI expressed hope that its “next generation products,” including vapor \nproducts, could someday be potentially “transformative” for RAI’s business and \n                                                 \n17 This risk was somewhat mitigated by Newport’s appeal to younger smokers.  (Flyer Tr. \n1115:19–25.) \n \n \n \npresent “big opportunit[ies]” that could provide a possible avenue for overcoming \ndeclining cigarette sal es.  (Crew Tr. 642:20–24; Hanigan Tr. 1613:14–17.)  The \nevidence shows, however, that RAI’s vapor products were not profitable at the time \nof the Merger.  (Flyer Tr. 1205:17–21; Wajnert Tr. 36:3–25; Crew Tr. 642:25–643:22; \nHanigan Tr. 1651:13–17.)   \n42. Indeed, despite RAI’s high hopes, it was unclear whether and when RAI’s \nvapor products would achieve profitability or the degree to which those products \nwould impact RAI’s future revenues  and profits.  P rior to the Merger, RAI did not \n“have a path to profitabili ty based on a specific milestone” for its vapor products .  \n(Fragnito Tr. 1704:20–1705:2.)  Vapor had not been profitable because \nthe cost of goods associated with an electronic cigarette are \nexponentially higher than a combustible cigarette as you would imagine.  \nThe electronics, the batteries, the fact that they’re manufactured in \nChina.  And we don’t have the scale – the category is still relatively small \nin the world of total tobacco.  So without the econom[ies of] scale to offset \nthose higher costs.  And because we’re still trying to educate, inform and \ngain trial on consumers, there’s not a lot of pricing power in the \nindustry. . . .  So relatively low price despite the high cost of goods, on \ntop of the significant amount of investment required from an R&D[ a]nd \nthen advertising and marketing perspective makes it difficult to make \nmoney in that. \n(Fragnito Tr. 1687:17–1688:7.)   \n43. Another challenge facing RAI in the vapor market was that, unlike \ncigarettes, the vapor market was highly fragmented and rapidly evolving, with more \nthan a thousand competitors marketing their products through different “channels,” \nincluding through convenience stores and gas stations (the “C-gas” channel, in which \nRAI competed) and through vape shops and e -commerce (in which RAI did not \ncompete).  (Hanigan Tr. 1639:8–1640:21; Fragnito Tr. 1684:18–1685:21.)   \n \n \n \n44. As of July  19, 2017, approximately 950,000 vapor products had been \nregistered with the FDA (including 900,000 e-liquids).  (JX0019.0011.)  RAI’s leading \nvapor brand, Vuse, was sold only through the C -gas channel, in which RAI was able \nto use its cigarette relationships to optimize shelf space and placement.  While Vuse \nwas the industry leader in the C-gas channel with approximately 30% share of sales, \nVuse’s overall market share in all channels was estimated to be closer to 5%.  \n(PX0009.0025; Hanigan Tr. 1618:14–19, 1643:24–1644:13.) \n45. Sales of vapor products impacted RAI’s profitability in other ways.  Certain \nconsumers switched from cigarettes to vapor, resulting in greater sales of \nunprofitable vapor products at the expense of profitable sales of cigarettes.  (Crew Tr. \n643:23–644:16; Fragnito Tr. 1688:8–1689:21.)  Similarly, RAI found that in 2015, \n42.7% of adult tobacco users under age 35 consisted of “poly-users”—consumers who \nused vapor products in addition to other tobacco products.  RAI’s profitability \ndecreased as vapor sales to those customers replaced cigarette sales.  (PX0009.0004; \nFragnito Tr. 1688:8–1689:21.)   \n46. RAI’s efforts prior to the Merger to address its unprofitable vapor business \nthrough mergers and acquisitions also failed.  RAI Innovations considered acquiring \nminority positions in three small vapor companies (Vape Forward, Cosmic Fog and \nFive Pawns) but elected not to pursue transactions with any of them because none \npassed RAI Innovations’ product integrity tests.  In any event, none of these \ncompanies had revenues that would have materially affected the profitability of RAI \nInnovations’ vapor business.  (Hanigan Tr. 1637:20–1639:1, 1650:16–1651:7.) \n \n \n \n47. In addition to these hurdles, RAI identified “major obstacles to the consumer \nadoption of vapor [,]” including, among other things, the “uncertainty and potential \ndifficulty of the vapor innovation approval pathway” and “a tough legislative and \nregulatory environment.”  (PX0063.0057.)   \n48. At the federal level, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) \npossesses broad authority under the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act (the “Tobacco Control Act”), 21 U.S.C. § 387 et seq., over the manufacture, \nsale, marketing, and packaging of tobacco products.  In May 2016, the FDA issued a \nregulation expanding the purview of the Tobacco Control Act to include vapor \nproducts.  Prior to this announcement, there had been no federal regulation, and very \nlittle state or local regulation, of the vapor industry.  Afterwards, vapor product \nmanufacturers were  required to seek approval for existing vapor products on the \nmarket by submitting Premarket Tobacco Product Applications (“PMTAs”) .  FDA \napproval of a PMTA was also required before a manufacturer could  lawfully release \na new tobacco product.  (JX0017.0011; Hanigan Tr.  1620:9–17; Crew Tr.  642:25–\n643:22; DX0230.0005.)   \n49. While RAI was better-positioned to comply with the FDA’s regulations than \nsome of its vapor competitors, RAI was not able to capitalize on that advantage \nbecause the FDA delayed the deadline by which manufacturers were required to \nsubmit a PMTA, allowing RAI’s competitors to sell vapor products in the market \nlonger without FDA approval. (Hanigan  Tr. 1639:8–1640:9.)  From 2009 until the \nTransaction Date, the FDA authorized the introduction onto the market of only eight \n \n \n \nnew tobacco products, all of which were noncombustible cigarettes.  (Flyer Tr. 1087:4–\n1088:6.) \nc. Substantial Regulatory, Taxation, and Litigation Risk \n50. In addition to industry -wide cigarette volume declines and limited \nopportunities for growth, extensive evidence was introduced showing that RAI faced \na number of other serious risks that had the potential to undermine the Company’s \nfuture profitability or, depending on their nature and magnitude, have devastating \neffects on RAI’s future business prospects.  (Gompers Tr.  730:10–731:5; Gilchrist \n387:25–391:9.) \ni. Regulatory Risk \n51. At the time of the Merger, t he tobacco industry was  highly regulated; \ntobacco products were subject to a variety of federal, state,  and local laws and \nregulations, and regulation had an extensive impact on how the industry operated.18  \n(JX0017.0011.)  The evidence shows that the existing and future regulation of tobacco \nproducts had the potential to substantially affect RAI’s ability to increase future \nprofits.  \n52. At the federal level, the Tobacco Control Act was a concern for the tobacco \nindustry.  As  Wajnert explained,   \n[H]aving the Tobacco Control Act put in place with the FDA having \nsupervision created perceived risks and I think have manifested \nthemselves in that the FDA has been working to reduce the harm within \n                                                 \n18 At the same time, extensive regulation, including restrictions on marketing, distribution, \npoints of sales, and taxation, made it very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to bring \nnew products from other countries into the United States, if at all.  (Flyer Tr. 1086:6–1086:17, \n1089:1–25.)   \n \n \n \n \ncigarettes, which could include changing formulations, could include \nattractiveness of the product, and it could include banning certain \nflavors, for example, as in menthol.  All those were uncertain at the time \nand I think still uncertain.   \n(Wajnert Tr. 46:7–20.)   \n53. In addition to federal regulations, many state, local, and municipal \ngovernments and agencies had adopted laws or regulations restricting or prohibiting \nthe public use of tobacco products, including but not limited to age and location \nrestrictions, and bans or restrictions on the sale or use of e- cigarettes and other \ntobacco products, including mentho l cigarettes. (JX0017.0011; Crew Tr.  691:23–\n692:9; Fragnito Tr. 1692:7–21, 1694:9–1695:6.)  Indeed,  regulation and legislation at \nthe local level were “becom[ing] the new frontier of tobacco control” and such efforts \nwere viewed by RAI as a significant threat, as there were “close to 700 pieces of anti-\ntobacco legislation at the local level” that had the potential to impact RAI’s and the \nindustry’s growth prospects.\n19  (Fragnito Tr. 1692:4–21.) \n54. The parties presented conflicting evidence concerning the likel ihood of \nfuture regulation and its effects on RAI’s business.  Much of this evidence related to \nregulation of menthol cigarettes.   \n55. Menthol regulation was a primary concern for RAI because of the extent to \nwhich RAI relied on menthol products for its reven ue and profit, particularly in \ncomparison to other tobacco companies.  At the time of the Merger, 60% of RJRT’s \n                                                 \n19 Flyer testified that the purpose of much of this legislation was to reduce “second -hand \nsmoke essentially.  And the health effects of . . . [e]nvironmental smoke levels . . . .  So that’s \nreally my understanding is the impetus for – behind most of these laws in public places, you \ndon’t want to expose nonsmokers to smoke.”  (Flyer Tr. 1183:6–16.)   \n \n \n \nrevenue, and 50% of RAI’s overall revenue, was attributable to sales of menthol \ncigarettes.  RAI’s Newport brand was the number one menthol ciga rette on the \nmarket and was RAI’s best -selling product.  (JX0017.0016; Fragnito Tr.  1670:17–\n1671:5, 1671:20–1672:1; Flyer Tr. 1212:16–19.)   \n56. The RAI Board attributed “growing . . . importance” to sales of menthol \ncigarettes to RAI’s adult smokers under 35 because RAI was realizing market share \ngrowth to that demographic group, which implied that as “this segment aged, there \nwould be continued usage of the [menthol] product” due to nicotine addiction and \nbrand loyalty.  (Wajnert Tr.  55:18–56:4; PX0009.0008.)   As a result, heightened \nregulation of menthol, such as a federal ban on sales of menthol cigarettes, was \nviewed as “disastrous” and “devastating” for RAI , (Wajnert Tr. 119:21–120:5; \nFragnito Tr. 1690:14–20), and presented a credible, significant threat to RAI’s ability \nto maintain or increase its profitability into the future.   \n57. Evidence was introduced that the FDA viewed a ban on menthol as a \npotentially viable regulatory strategy.  In 2013, the FDA announced its intention to \nreview the possible increased regulation of menthol cigarettes, including a potential \nban on menthol-flavored products.  This announcement acted as an “overhang on the \n[C]ompany and in the industry.”  (Fragnito Tr. 1671:20–1672:1; JX0017.0016.)  Crew \nexplained that after the FDA’s 2013 review of menthol, RAI believed that the FDA \nhad never stopped looking at it, despite the fact they couldn’t find any \nincreased toxicity or disease caused by menthol cigarettes, it was very \nclear that the government was still intending to do something about \nmenthol.  We weren’t sure what they were going to do, whether it was \njust reduce the amount of menthol allowed or they could go all the way \nto a ban.  We weren’t sure exactly whether –  but they – we knew they \n \n \n \nfelt like they could do that.  So we were very concerned about that.  It \nwas one of our largest profit contributors to the business. \n(Crew Tr. 662:5–16.)  That the FDA had, prior to the Merger, expressly considered \nincreasing regulation of menthol demonstrates that RAI’s fears of future regulation \nwere well-founded. \n58. Flyer did not believe a federal menthol ban would have a meaningful impact \non the value of RAI .  The Court finds this testimony unpersuasive.  Flyer testified \nthat a menthol ban would simply push smokers to non-menthol products, but his own \nresearch indicated that when adult smokers switched from Newport to another \nbrand, those smokers were much more likely to switch to Marlboro or another non -\nRAI brand, thus reducing RAI revenues.  (Flyer Tr. 1081:13–1082:20, 1215:1–1216:2 \n(“It makes sense it would be Marlboro because Marlboro’s four  times the size or \nmaybe five times the size of Camel.  So it would have to almost certainly be Marlboro \nas being the closest substitute.”).)   \n59. Dissenters also offered statements by RAI reflecting RAI’s expectation that \nit would be able to successfully man age regulatory risks associated with menthol.  \n(DX0009.0007 (“With new FDA chief, see potential for some easing of the more \nonerous regulations.”); Price Tr. 1049:6–19.)  The Court is again unpersuaded.  While \nRAI no doubt had plans to address any future menthol regulation and seek to mitigate \nits impact, the record is clear that at the time of the Merger the threat of future \nmenthol regulation was a significant risk to RAI’s future profit growth and therefore \nits fair value.   \n \n \n \n60. The Tobacco Control Act also established onerous requirements for a \nmanufacturer to launch a new tobacco product or modify an existing product, which \nare known as “product standards” regulations.  (JX0017.0016; JX0009.0001 –.0002; \nFlyer Tr. 1087:4–1088:6.)  These regulations imposed restrictions on the composition \nand use of RAI’s products and had the ability to significantly affect RAI’s revenues \nand cash flows.  (JX0017.0014–0017; Wajnert Tr. 119:21–120:5.)   \n61. Pursuant to FDA product standards regulations, manufacturers of t obacco \nproducts introduced between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011 were required \nto file a “substantial equivalence report” with the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products \n(the “CTP”).  In the report, the manufacturer had to demonstrate that the new \nproduct was “substantially equivalent” to a product already on the market.  A product \nsubject to such a report is referred to as a “provisional product” because it was subject \nto the CTP’s approval.  If the CTP determined that a product was not “substantially \nequivalent” to a product already in the market,  the FDA could force the removal of \nthe provisional product from the market.  (JX0017.0016.)   \n62. In September 2015, the CTP issued orders determining that four  RAI \nproducts, including RJRT’s Camel White and Camel Crush Bold brands, were not \nsubstantially equivalent to a product already in the market.  The CTP ordered RAI \nto “stop all distribution, importation, sale, marketing and promotion” of those \nproducts.  (JX0017.0016; DX0069.0013; DX0291.0112; DX0392.0083.)  Nearly all of \nRAI’s products on the market as of the Transaction Date  were provisional products \n \n \n \nthat were subject to a future FDA determination that could require RAI to remove \nthe product from the market.  (JX0017.0014–.0017.)   \n63. In addition to product standards regulations on cigarettes, RAI’s moist snuff \nbusiness faced potentially catastrophic regulation.  Prior to the Merger, the FDA \nproposed regulations limiting the amount of a particular compound—\nN-nitrosonornicotine, commonly known as “NNN” —that was f ound in RAI’s moist \nsnuff products.  If such a regulation were put into effect, it could “basically ban” RAI’s \nentire moist snuff portfolio.  (Crew Tr. 663:16–664:7; JX0016.0004.) \n64. Product standards regulations were not the only threat to RAI’s business \nimposed by the FDA.  In 2015, SFNTC received a “warning letter” from the FDA \nconcerning SFNTC’s use of descriptors including “natural” and “additive free” to \ndescribe its Natural American Spirit cigarettes.  (Crew Tr.  662:15–25.)  The FDA \nletter was cited in over a dozen private lawsuits that pose a threat to the future \ngrowth and profits of RAI’s fastest-growing brand.  (Crew Tr. 658:18–20.) \n65. The FDA also publicly announced that it was considering requiring a \ndecrease in nicotine levels in cigarettes to a frac tion of current levels.  (Flyer Tr.  \n1199:16–1200:1.)  As Fragnito testified, “the goal of the FDA with [lowering nicotine \nlevels] is essentially to terminate the existence of the industry”  so that “ultimately \nsmoking would go away.”  (Fragnito Tr. 1691:3–11.)   \n66. Restrictions on sales of flavored tobacco products generally, beyond menthol, \nalso represented a significant regulatory headwind for RAI.  (DX0009.0007.)  At the \ntime of the Merger, the FDA was actively considering proposals to limit the sale of \n \n \n \nflavored vapor products.  (Fragnito Tr.  1690:11–13, 1691:18 –1692:3.)  Certain \njurisdictions, including San Francisco and Beverly Hills, had already banned flavored \nproducts altogether.  (DX0009.0007; Fragnito Tr. 1692:13–16, 1695:3–6.)   \n67. Numerous state and local governments had also passed legislation and \nordinances limiting the places in which tobacco may be used.  For example, smoking \nhad been prohibited on government property in Charlotte, and all forms of tobacco \nuse had been prohibited in public parks in Mecklenburg County.  The express purpose \nof these regulations is to “deglamorize and denormalize tobacco use helping it become \nless acceptable.”  (Flyer Tr. 1181:14–1183:21.)  \nii. Taxation Risk \n68. In addition to risks associated with heighten ed regulation, RAI faced the \nprospect of significant excise tax increases.  Cigarettes and other tobacco products \nare subject to substantial taxation at the federal, state, and local levels.  On average, \n45–50% of the price of a pack of cigarettes is relat ed to excise taxes.  (JX0017.0019; \nFragnito Tr. 1695:7–1696:22.)  Taxing authorities have increasingly imposed higher \nexcise taxes on tobacco products.  As Price explained, “[A]s the governments become \nmore and more in need of money, tobacco is a very easy  target for them to increase \ntaxes, whether it be at the state level or the federal level.”  (Price Tr. 976:12–977:5.)   \n69. These increases in taxation posed significant risks to RAI’s business.  While \nan increase in the federal excise tax was viewed as the “most impactful” because it \nwould be applied on a national basis, (Gilchrist Tr. 384:12–17), state excise taxes also \nsignificantly affected RAI’s profitability.  RAI projected it would face an annual five- \n \n \n \ncent-per-pack increase in net state excise taxes, an  increase that, standing  alone, \nwould cause RAI to lose sales of 300 million sticks and about $30 million in profit \nevery year.  Fragnito explained that “at any given time of the 50 states, there were \nusually a dozen or so proposals to increase” state excise taxes.  RAI expected these \ntrends to continue, with each state proposing to increase its excise tax every two to \nfour years.  (Fragnito Tr. 1700:10–1701:8, 1770:25 –1772:5; JX0009.0001; \nJX0010.0004; JX0017.0019.) \n70. Increased excise taxes have resulted in declines in overall sales volume and \nshifts by consumers to less expensive brands.  Additional increases are likely to result \nin future sales declines or downtrading to less expensive brands or both.  Increased \ntaxes have also reduced RAI’s ability to increase pricing in areas with steep increases \nin excise taxes.  (JX0017.0019; Fragnito Tr.  1695:7–14; JX0009.0001.)  As Wajnert \nexplained,  \n[W]hether federal or state excise taxes, if those were raised, that would \nbe passed through to the consumer which would raise the prices of \ncigarettes which would have the effect of potentially reducing volumes, \nbecause those pricing – the taxes are passed through. \n \n(Wajnert Tr. 45:7–15.) \n71. For example, in April 2017, California raised its excise taxes by $2 per pack, \nwhich had an immediate effect on demand.  Fragnito explained that the increase   \nessentially amounted to a 35 percent increase in prices.  California’s \nabout 6 percent of industry volume.  So it’s one of the largest states from \na volume perspective.  And so that increase resulted in volumes \ndeclining in the range of 25 to 30 percent in California . . . [, which] drove \nan additional 80 basis points.  So .8 of a percentage point decline in the \nindustry.  \n \n \n \n(Fragnito Tr. 1696:9–22.)  At the time, RAI was also concerned that the California \nexcise tax increase would lead to a “snowball effect” and encourage other West Coast \nstates to increase their excise taxes to match California’s taxes.  (Gilchrist Tr. 387:25–\n388:15; JX0010.0006.) \niii. Litigation Risk \n72. The potential for increased litigation and settlement costs posed another \nmeaningful risk to RAI’s future profitability.  Already accounting for a large portion \nof the tobacco industry’s costs, any increase in litigation and settlement costs would \nhave the potential to substantially affect RAI’s ability to increase profits.  \n(JX0017.0011, .0014–.0018.) \n73. The risks associat ed with litigation had the potential to adversely affect \nRAI’s growth potential.  In the years leading up to the Merger, RAI had more than \n50 active cases going to trial each year.  There were thousands of active cases in \nFlorida alone against RAI and othe r tobacco manufacturers .  (Crew Tr. 658:6–17; \nGilchrist Tr. 389:8–23.)  C ontinued litigation arising out of the sale, distribution, \nmanufacture, development, advertising, marketing, and health effects of cigarettes \nand other tobacco products was expected f or the foreseeable future.  (JX0017.001 4–\n.0018, .0096–.0138; PX0009.0002; Crew Tr. 658:6–17; Wajnert Tr. 46:21–47:2, 54:23–\n55:3.) \n74. In addition to litigation costs, the Big Three manufacturers all have \nperpetual, multi -billion dollar annual payment obligatio ns under the MSA , which \nresulted from health -related lawsuits brought against tobacco companies by the \n \n \n \nattorneys general of 46 states.   (JX0017.0001, .0017–.0018; Gilchrist Tr. 390:1–12.)  \nFragnito estimated the MSA payment at approximately $0.72 per pack.  (Fragnito \nTr. 1702:13–1703:2, 1703:17 –1704:14.)  Because RAI’s annual MSA payment is \nindexed to inflation, RAI’s payment obligations increase as inflation rises.  The effect \nof inflation has “a dramatic impact on [RAI’s] cost of goods sold [,]” and any increase \nin inflation would increase the likelihood of an associated decrease in RAI’s \nprofitability.  (Price Tr. 984:19–985:9; Gilchrist Tr. 389:24–390:12; JX0009.0001.) \nC. RAI’s Transaction History  \n75. Prior to the Merger, RAI was involved in several signif icant corporate \ntransactions, several of which had features relevant to its competitive positioning and \nrelationship with BAT in the time leading up to the Merger. \na. Brown & Williamson Transaction \n76. On July 30, 2004, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc. (“RJR”) and Brown \n& Williamson Tobacco Corporation (“B&W”) completed a series of transactions that \nresulted in the combination of RJR and the U.S. assets, liabilities, and operations of \nB&W (the “B&W Transaction”).  ( Corr. Stip’d Facts  ¶ 1; JX0017.0003, .0074; \nJX0023.0042; Wajnert Tr.  60:5–9; Price Tr. 939:7–9.)  As part of the B&W \nTransaction, RAI was incorporated as a new publicly traded holding company to hold \nthe now combined businesses.  (Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 2; JX0017.0003, .0074.)   \n77. Immediately prior to the B&W Transaction, RJR was publicly traded, and \nB&W was an indirect wholly -owned subsidiary of BAT.  ( Corr. Stip’d Facts  ¶ 3; \nJX0017.0003, .0074.)  As a result of the B&W Transaction, BAT owned approximately \n \n \n \n42% of the stock of RAI.  The remaining RAI shares were held by the former \nstockholders of RJR a nd publicly traded on the NYSE .  (JX0017.0003,  .0155; \nJX0023.0042; Wajnert Tr. 60:13–21.) \nb. Lorillard Transaction \n78. In June 2015, RAI acquired Lorillard, a competing tobacco company, for \nconsideration valued at $25.8 billion (the “Lorillard Transaction”).  (Corr. Stip’d Facts \n¶ 6.)  Lorillard had been the third-largest cigarette company in the United States and \nat the time its largest brand was Newport, which RAI acquired as part of the Lorillard \nTransaction.  (JX0017.0004, .0016.)  To achieve antitrust approval for the Lorillard \nTransaction, RAI divested certain cigarette and vapor products to ITG .\n20  (Wajnert \nTr. 40:18–41:13; de Gennaro Tr. 243:19–23.) \nc. RAI and BAT Governance Agreement \n79. Contemporaneously with the B&W Transaction  in 2004, RAI and BAT \nnegotiated a set of contractual restrictions designed, among other things, to maintain \nRAI’s independence and strictly limit the influence BAT and its subsidiaries could \nexert over RAI.  This set of restrictions was known as the “ Governance Agreement.”  \n(Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 5; JX0020; JX0023.0065; Wajnert Tr.  61:9–15; de Gennaro Tr.  \n185:23–186:20.)  The Governance Agreement was put in place because the RJR Board \nof Directors “did not want BAT to control the [RAI] business in any meaningful \nway[.]”  (Wajnert Tr.  61:2–8.)  Nevertheless, RAI disclosed to investors that “BAT’s \n                                                 \n20 The divested cigarette brands included Winston, Salem, Kool, and Maverick, four of RAI’s \nweaker “tail brands.”  (Flyer Tr. 1114:6–19.)  \n \n \n \n \nsignificant beneficial equity interest in RAI could be determinative in matters \nsubmitted to a vote by RAI’s other shareholders, resulting in RAI taking actions that \nRAI’s other shareholders do not support.”  (DX0321.0024.) \n80. Under the Governance Agreement, BAT had the ability to designate for \nnomination five of RAI’s thirteen directors, 21 three of whom were required to be \nindependent of both RAI and BAT under applicable NYSE listing standards.  \n(JX0020.0006, at § 2.01(c)(ii); Wajnert Tr.  62:3–8.)  For the remaining eight Board \nseats, the Governance Agreement required BAT to vote its shares as directed by the \nBoard’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.  As a result, and as an \nexample, BAT would not have been allowed to vote Thomas Wajnert, an independent \ndirector, off the Board.  (JX0020.0006, at § 2.01(c)(iii); Wajnert Tr.  62:9–16.)  BAT \nthus contracted away its ability to direct its vote for those eight Board seats, thereby \nforegoing any right to vote for or otherwise influence the c omposition of a clear \nmajority of the RAI Board.  (JX0020.0006, at § 2.01(c)(iii).)   \n81. The five BAT -appointed directors had access to confidential, nonpublic \ninformation shared at regular RAI Board meetings by virtue of their membership on \nthe RAI Board.  ( Wajnert Tr. 50:8–19, 146:15–149:15; Gompers Tr.  844:22–845:2; \nGilchrist Tr. 395:14–23, 405:2–19, 408:22–25; DX0024.) \n82. Under the Governance Agreement, any material contract or transaction \nbetween BAT and RAI required the approval of a majority of the seven independent \n                                                 \n21 After the Lorillard Transaction in 2015, the Board of Directors was temporarily increased \nto fourteen directors.  BAT was still limited to nominating only five of those fourteen \ndirectors.  (JX0023.0065; DX0393.0045.) \n \n \n \ndirectors not designated by BAT (known as the “Other Directors”).  The Other \nDirectors did not depend on B AT’s support for their election. 22  (JX0020.0010, at \n§ 2.07; Wajnert Tr. 62:17–24, 63:2–10.)  \n83. Under the Governance Agreement, BAT agreed not to increase its ownership \nin RAI for ten years after the close of the B&W Transaction  in July 2004.  This \nstandstill provision expired as scheduled in July 2014.  (JX0020.0020– .0021, at \n§ 4.01; Wajnert Tr. 66:2–8.) \n84. The protections  under the Governance Agreement persist ed even if BAT \nbecame a majority shareholder  of RAI .  This device ensured that BAT could not \ncircumvent (or threaten to circumvent) these contractual restrictions by buying more \nstock.  Only if BAT acquired 100% of RAI’s stock would the Governance Agreement’s \nprotections fall away.  (JX0020.0026, at § 6.11(a); Wajnert Tr. 63:11–17.)   \n85. BAT negotiated certain  veto and contractual approval rights over certain \nRAI corporate transactions.  For example, subject to certain exceptions, approval of \nthe BAT-appointed directors was required for RAI to issue securities comprising 5% \nor more of RAI’s voting power or to r epurchase RAI’s common stock.  (JX0020.0022, \nat § 5.01(ii).)  BAT’s approval as a shareholder was also required for the following \nRAI activity: (i) the implementation of takeover defense measures, (ii) any \ntransaction that would “impose material limitations on the legal rights of” BAT or its \n                                                 \n22 The thirteenth director, who was neither a BAT designee nor an independent Other \nDirector, was RAI’s CEO.  The fourteenth director, added after the Lorillard Transaction, \nwas the former CEO of Lorillard, who was also not an independent Other Director.  \n(DX0393.0045.) \n \n \n \nsubsidiaries, and (iii) the sale of intellectual property relating to international tobacco \nbrands that may be able to compete with BAT.  (JX0020.0010, at § 2.04(b).)  \n86. BAT also held contractual protections that ensured its 42% ownership stake \nwould not be diluted.  I n November 2011, RAI and BAT agreed to amend the \nGovernance Agreement, whereby RAI would not be allowed to repurchase its shares \nif the repurchase was  implemented in such a way “that the number of outstanding \nshares of RAI common stock would not increase, and the beneficial ownership interest \nof BAT and its subsidiaries in RAI would not decrease.”  (DX0323.0061.)   BAT took \ngreat effort to ensure its high ownership stake.  For example, c oncurrently with the \ncompletion of RAI’s acquisition of Lorillard, BAT invested approximately $5 billion in \norder to maintain its approximate 42% beneficial ownership in RAI common stock.  \n(de Gennaro Tr. 192:13–18.)   \n87. Considering all of the facts, the Supreme Court of North Carolina concluded \nthat “[i]n several ways, the Governance Agreement placed ‘contractual handcuffs’ on \nBAT that prevented it from controlling the Reynolds board.”  Corwin v. British Am. \nTobacco PLC, 371 N.C. 605, 619, 821 S.E.2d 729, 739 (2018), reh’g denied, 822 S.E.2d \n648 (N.C. 2019).  As the Supreme Court explained, “the fact of BAT’s contractual \nrights did not, on its own, give BAT the kind of coercive power over the Reynolds \nboard that could allow BAT to exercise actual control.”  Id. at 620, 821 S.E.2d at 740.  \n“At best, the allegations that some terms in the transaction agreement were favorable \nto BAT show only that BAT[ had] . . . the ability to secure some favorable terms from \nthe board.  Those allegations do not show that BAT exercised control over the board—\n \n \n \nthat is, to make it take action.”  Id. at 624, 821 S.E.2d at 742.  Thus, BAT was not a \ncontrolling shareholder of RAI , and n otwithstanding BAT’s substantial holdings in \nthe Company , RAI ha d the freedom to make decisions independently from BAT.  \n(JX0023.0080; Wajnert Tr. 63:18–64:18.) \nd. RAI Related Person Policy \n88. RAI also instituted a related person transaction approval policy (the \n“Related Person Policy”) to foster transparency and proper governance which \nrequired various levels of review before RAI could enter into any transaction with \nBAT.  (PX0002.0001; Gilchri st Tr.  428:7–10.)  In addition to the Governance \nAgreement’s prohibition on material transactions between RAI and BAT without \napproval of the Other Directors, the Related Person Policy established more granular \nrestrictions: any transaction between RAI and BAT involving an amount that would \nbe: (i) less than $1 million required the prior approval of RAI’s CEO, CFO or General \nCounsel, (ii) equal to or greater than $1 million and less than $20 million required \nthe prior approval of RAI’s Audit Committee, and (iii) greater than $20 million \nrequired the prior approval of the Other Directors.  (PX0002.0003.)  To implement \nthe Related Person  Policy, RAI created a Related Party Transaction Committee, \nwhich met monthly to review and approve all interactions between RAI and BAT in \nthe regular course of business.  (Gilchrist Tr. 426:15–24.) \ne. RAI’s Independence from BAT in Practice \n89. RAI’s ability to act independently of BAT, and even in a manner contrary to \nBAT’s wishes, was demonstrated in practice.  Between July 2004 an d the \n \n \n \nconsummation of the Merger in July 2017, RAI and BAT engaged in negotiations over \npotential agreements on a variety of matters, some of which were protracted and \ncontentious, some of which did not result in agreement, and one of which led to \narbitration between the two companies.  (Gilchrist  Tr. 431:10–18; Crew Tr. 634:24–\n635:20.)   \n90. As further evidence of RAI’s independence, in the fall of 2015, RAI invited \nBAT to submit a bid to acquire the international rights to RAI’s Natural American \nSpirit brand.  (Wajnert Tr. 91:21–92:14; Constantino\n23 Tr. 1812:7–20.)  RAI wanted \nto improve its b alance sheet after the Lorillard Transaction by de -levering and \nreducing its overall debt level through this sale.  (Constantino Tr. 1804:12–18:06:18; \nGilchrist Tr. 412:16–413:11.)  After BAT expressed its preference that RAI not sell \nthose international r ights, BAT submitted an offer.  BAT’s competitor, Japan \nTobacco, Inc. (“Japan Tobacco”) also submitted an offer and won the bid.  Although \nBAT preferred that the international rights not be sold at all, and expressed that \npreference to RAI’s management, RA I proceeded with the sale to Japan Tobacco  for \n$5 billion in January 2016.  (Wajnert Tr. 64:4–18, 65:9–16, 91:4–92:14.) \n91. RAI and BAT engaged in other arm’s -length transactions in the years \npreceding the Merger.  In December 2015, after protracted negotiatio ns with BAT, \nthe Other Directors ultimately approved a “vapor collaboration agreement” regarding \n                                                 \n23 Daniela Constantino (“Constantino”) was a Partner and a Senior Member of the research \nteam of Mason Capital Management (“Mason Capital”), one of the Dissenters, at the time of \nthe Merger.  (Constantino Tr. 1787:25–1788:6, 1789:17–1790:10; Parties’ Witness Summaries \n1.)  \n \n \n \ncertain next-generation technologies.  (JX0023.0066; Hanigan  Tr. 1617:10–12.)  In \nMay 2016, a few months before the Merger negotiations beg an in October, RAI a nd \nBAT negotiated a termination of the parties’ contract manufacturing agreement, \nwhich was approved by the Other Directors.  (Crew Tr.  634:24–635:20.)  There is no \nevidence that these interactions were not fairly negotiated.  \nD. Preparing for a Potential BAT Bid \n92. Leading up to and after the expiration of the standstill provision in the \nGovernance Agreement in July 2014, RAI management met periodically with various \ninvestment bank s to discuss industry trends, RAI’s relationship with BAT, and \npotential transactions involving RAI, including a potential transaction with BAT.  \n(Gilchrist Tr. 562:20–563:6, 568:21–569:11, 569:19–570:19, 572:8–25.)   \n93. Contrary to Dissenters’ suggestions, t here was nothing sinister nor \nnefarious concerning these meetings.  L azard had been advising RAI regarding its \nrelationship with BAT dating back to 2011.  (de Gennaro Tr.  185:11–186:20.)  \nDe Gennaro described his meetings with Gilchrist and others within RAI, including \nCameron, then the CEO of RAI, as a “banking exercise” a nd “banker positioning[,]” \nand explained that “the nature of our business is that we try and stay involved with \nour clients or potential clients constantly.”  (de Gennaro Tr.  246:7–21.)  In addition \nto advising RAI on a potential offer from BAT, Lazard’s m eetings with RAI during \nthese pre-Merger years addressed other topics, including the effects that a potential \ntransaction between BAT and ITG would have on RAI.  (de Gennaro Tr.  244:4–23.)  \nLazard’s evaluation of a potential offer from BAT was part of the “comprehensive \nanalysis” Lazard sought to offer its client.  (de Gennaro Tr. 247:5–20.)   \n \n \n \n94. Goldman also periodically met with RAI management to discuss financial \nindustry trends, RAI’s business, and other topics.  Around the time of the expiration \nof the standstill in 2014, Goldman and RAI began discussing BAT’s ownership stake \nand the potential for a future transaction, the terms an offer by BAT to purchase the \noutstanding shares in RAI might include, and steps RAI could take to prepare for \nsuch a potential offer.  (Eckler24 Dep. Tr. 14:8–15:16.) \n95. JPMorgan met with RAI “on an ongoing basis in the ordinary course \ncoverage of the client” in the time leading up to the Merger.  (Clark 25 Tr. 1462:14–\n1463:4.)  In August and September 2016, Gilchrist and Cameron  met with \nrepresentatives from JPMorgan and discussed issues related to potential \ntransactions involving RAI and BAT, including premiums paid in transactions with \nlarge shareholders, potential financing concerns for BAT in a transaction with RAI, \na potential mix of the offer between equity and cash, and the effects of Brexit on the \nshareholder bases of RAI and BAT.  (DX0063.0005; Clark Tr.  1462:14–1463:9, \n1463:13–1469:18.) \n96. There is no evidence anyone at RAI acted to further his or her own personal \ninterest ahea d of the Company’s  in the time period prior to the Merger and, in \nparticular, in RAI’s pre-Merger meetings with Lazard, Goldman, and JPMorgan.  \n                                                 \n24 Zachary Eckler (“Eckler”) was a Vice President (and later Managing Director) at Goldman \nwho advised the Transaction Committee concerning the Merger.  (Price Tr. 1056:3–5; Eckler \nDep. Tr. 19:05–20:01; Parties’ Witness Summaries 2.)  Portions of Eckler’s deposition were \nadmitted into the trial record.  (ECF No. 199.)  \n25 John Clark (“Clark”) was a Managing Director at JPMorgan  who advised RAI’s Board \nregarding the Merger.  (Clark Tr. 1425:6–21; Parties’ Witness Summaries 1.) \n \n \n \n97. While Dissenters have tried to suggest that Gilchrist took actions to ensure \nhe would receive his “golden parachute” compensation,26 (Gilchrist Tr. 555:6–556:18), \nthere is no evidentiary basis from which to draw such a conclusion.   Gilchrist ’s \ncompensation arose from his pre -existing employment contract and consisted of a \nstandard severance package of two years’ salary and bonus, vesting of restricted stock \noptions that he already owned, and a payout of his pension.  (JX0023.0146, .0153; \nGilchrist Tr. 553:16–554:7.)  None of his golden parachute compensation arose \nspecifically from the Merger; he would have received his compensation regardless of \nthe reason for his termination (other than firing for cause) .  (JX0023.0146, .0153; \nGilchrist Tr. 573:1–574:3.)  In fact, he did not receive over 25% of his golden parachute \ncompensation because the conditions for i ts payment were not triggered.  (Gilchrist  \nTr. 555:25–556:4.)   \n98. Dissenters also suggest that  Gilchrist sought the investment bankers’ \nperspectives on the amount BAT might be willing to pay in an acquisition of RAI to \nmanipulate a potential future valuatio n of RAI to a value within BAT’s perceived \nprice range .  (DX0063.0013; de Gennaro Tr.  244:13–245:25; Gilchrist  Tr. 580:18–\n581:8, 585:22–586:4; Clark Tr. 1466:15–1469:9.)  No credible evidence, however, was \noffered to support this claim.   \n                                                 \n26 Dissenters appear to have backed away from this contention in their post -trial briefing, \nasserting that the reason management did not provide the ten-year projections on which the \n2016 “Strategy Day” presentation (explained in depth below) was based is “irrelevant.”  \n(Defs.’ Responsive Post -Trial Br. 12, ECF No. 231.)  The Court addresses the contention \nnonetheless. \n \n \n \n99. As an initial matter, more people would have been needed to manipulate the \nvaluation, including Cameron , who received no personal benefit from the Merger, \n(Cameron Dep. Tr.  223:11–18 (“I didn’t qualify for a penny, nothing.  I was out, \nDecember 31.”)), and Crew, who came to RAI with the goal of becoming CEO , (Crew \nTr. 634:9–23, 669:20–671:2 (“I literally had just been named sort of CEO elect and \nthen this unsolicited offer came in.  So, you know, it’s just personally disappointing \n. . . that I wasn’t going to get a chance to . . . lead the company . . . as an independent \nentity.”)).  There is no evidence either participated in this alleged scheme. \n100. Moreover, the evidence shows that RAI management (including, but not \nlimited to, Gilchrist) made responsible efforts to understand the contours of a \npotential offer from BAT in order to better understand the negotiating dynamics that \nmight accompany a potential transaction with BAT and to compare it to other \nstrategic alternatives available to the Company.  (DX0063.0007 –.0010; de Gennaro \nTr. 246:22–247:4; Clark Tr. 1468:8–1469:5; Gilchrist Tr. 580:22–581:8.)   \n101. Given BAT’s 42% ownership stake in RAI and BAT’s public representations \nthat it periodically considered the possibility of making an offer for RAI, RAI’s \nseparate pre-Merger meetings with Lazard, Goldman, and JPMorgan were a prudent \nstep taken by RAI management to be better prepared for a potential offer from BAT \nand to be better positioned to advocate for a higher price if such an offer materialized.  \nRather than evidence a conspiracy to facilitate acceptance of an artificially low price, \nthese meetings between the Financial Advisors and a variety of individuals from RAI \n \n \n \nreflect prudent scenario planning on the part of RAI ’s management and routine \nbusiness development efforts on the part of these investment banks.   \nE. The Merger \n102. As set forth in more detail below, the deal price in this case was reached \nthrough months of arm’s-length negotiations between sophisticated parties.  On RAI’s \nside, the deal was negotiated by a fully independent and well -informed transaction \ncommittee, which showed a willingness to walk away from a deal entirely and \ncontinue operating as an independent company if a fair price could not be obtained.  \nThree highly respected financial advisors separately concluded that the deal price \nwas fair to RAI ’s shareholders.  RAI’s non -BAT shareholders voted overwhelmingly \nin favor of the M erger.  For these and the other reasons set forth herein , the Court \nfinds that the deal price is entitled to substantial , if not determinative,  weight in \ndetermining the fair value of Dissenters’ shares of RAI. \na. BAT’s October 20, 2016 Offer \n103. After the market closed on October 20, 2016, BAT made an unsolicited offer \nto acquire the rema ining shares of RAI that it did not already own through a letter \nsent to Wajnert, as Chair of the RAI Board, and Cameron, as RAI’s CEO.  BAT’s offer \nletter proposed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of RAI for a mix of stock and \ncash equal to $56.50 per share of RAI common stock (the “October 20 Offer”), a 19.8% \npremium over the $47.17 closing price of RAI common stock that day (the “Unaffected \nStock Price”).  ( Corr. Stip’d Facts  ¶¶ 13–14; JX0021.0002; JX0023.0068; \n \n \n \nPX0115.0254, .0531, .0578; DX0095.0008; Cameron Dep. Tr. 20:9–21:25; Wajnert Tr. \n65:17–22.)   \n104. The October 20 Offer exceeded RAI’s six-month average stock price prior to \nBAT’s initial offer, which was $48.97, and its all -time high price of $54.48 per share \non July 5, 2016.  (PX0115.0290, .0390.)  The October  20 Offer implied a total equity \nvalue for RAI of $80.56 billion.  (PX0115.0128; JX0021.0002; JX0023.0068.)   \n105. Consistent with BAT’s obligations under U.S. securities laws, BAT publicly \nannounced its propo sal the next day before the markets opened.  In its \nannouncement, BAT stated that it expected to achieve approximately $400 million in \nsynergies from the transaction.  (JX0021.0007; JX0023.0068.) \n106. BAT’s letter acknowledged , consistent with the Governance Ag reement, \nthat a proposed transaction between BAT and RAI would require the approval of a \nmajority of the Other Directors, BAT would not pursue the transaction without such \napproval, and BAT expected that a merger would require the approval by a majority \nof the votes cast by the non-BAT shareholders.  (JX0021.0002; JX0023.0069.)   \n107. The RAI Board understood BAT’s representations to mean that BAT would \napproach this transaction as a “friendly transaction” and that BAT “didn’t want to be \nthreatening in any way.”   (Wajnert Tr. 68:8–69:17.)  The Board found these \nrepresentations significant because, freed from a hostile takeover threat by BAT, the \nBoard would be able to “control the transaction” and ensure that whatever decision \nit made about the October 20 Offer w as fair to the other shareholders.  (Wajnert Tr.  \n68:21–22.)  Importantly, the requirement that the transaction be approved by the \n \n \n \nnon-BAT shareholders gave “the power to accept or reject the transaction” to the \nnon-BAT shareholders.  (Wajnert Tr. 68:8–69:17.) \n108. The October 20 Offer also stated that “BAT is interested only in acquiring \nthe shares of [RAI] not already owned by BAT[,] and . . . BAT has no interest in selling \nany of the [RAI] shares it owns, nor would BAT support any alternative sale, merger \nor similar transaction involving [RAI].”  (JX0021.0003.)  The Board did not consider \nBAT’s representation to limit the Board “in terms of thinking through what the \nalternatives might be for” the non-BAT shareholders; Wajnert explained that “at the \nend of the d ay, anything would be negotiable.  So while BAT was expressing an \ninterest in not participating in a transaction with someone else, the realities of the \nworld, people change their minds.”  (Wajnert Tr.  69:18–70:19; Nowell\n27 Dep. \nTr. 57:01–59:21 (“Q[.] . . .  Did the board believe that [BAT’s statement] foreclosed the \npossibility of selling to another third party?  A[.]  No.”).)  Nevertheless, RAI disclosed \nto investors that “BAT’s significant beneficial ownership interest in RAI[ ] and RAI’s \nclassified board of directors and other anti-takeover defenses could deter acquisition \nproposals and make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of RAI without the \ncooperation of BAT.”28  (DX0317.0026.) \n                                                 \n27 Lionel Nowell (“Nowell”) became Lead Director of RAI’s Board and Chair of the Transaction \nCommittee on January 1, 2017 and served in that capacity at the time of the Merger.  (Nowell \nDep. Tr. 13:17 –23; Crew Tr. 638:22– 639:2; Parties’ Witness Summaries 4.)  Portions of \nNowell’s deposition were admitted into the trial record.  (ECF No. 202.)  \n28 For example, Goldman noted in its fairness opinion presentation that if “[BAT] is not \nsupportive [of a third-party sale of RAI], a merger requires approximately 88% approval from \nall other shareholders.”  (DX0277.0011.)   \n \n \n \n109. Contemporaneous research analyst commentary on  the October  20 Offer \ngenerally viewed the proposed transaction as a positive for RAI shareholders.  \n(PX0115.0129, .0289, .0459;  Gompers Tr. 802:25–803:8; Zmijewski Tr.  1380:17–\n1381:2.)  In fact, some analysts perceived BAT to be overpaying or at least purchasing \nat a time when RAI was trading at a relatively high multiple to its earnings.  \n(PDX0005.0025; Yilmaz Tr. 2004:16–19; PX0115.0623.)  \nb. Recusal and Formation of Transaction Committee \n110. Between October 24, 2016 and October 28, 2016, the RAI Board and the RAI \nOther Directors met multiple times and  interviewed potential legal and financial \nadvisors.  On October 24, 2016, Jerome Abelman  and Ricardo Oberlander, the two \nBAT employees on the RAI Board, voluntarily recused themselves from any RAI \nboard meetings at which any proposed transaction involving BAT or any potential \nalternative strategic transaction would be discussed or considered.  They also did not \nparticipate in any discussion or consideration of a potential transaction with the BAT \nBoard or any BAT employees.  (PX0031.0001, .0003; PX0033.0001; JX0023.0069; \nWajnert Tr. 76:3–6.)   \n111. On October 28, 2016, the RAI Board created a trans action committee \ncomprised solely of the Other Directors to consider and evaluate the proposed \ntransaction and any other strategic alternative s (the “Transaction Committee”).  \n(JX0007.0002–.0005; PX0033.0003 –.0005; JX0023.0069 –.0070.)  RAI’s Board had \nfourteen directors at that time, seven of whom were Other Directors.  The seven Other \nDirectors were:  \n \n \n \na. John A. Boehner , retired Speaker of the United States House of \nRepresentatives; \nb. Luc Jobin, President and CEO of Canadian National Railway Company; \nc. Holly Keller Koeppel , former Managing Partner and Co -Head of Corsair \nInfrastructure Management, L.P.; \nd. Nana Mensah, Chairman and CEO of ‘XPORTS Inc.; \ne. Lionel Nowell, retired Senior Vice President and Treasurer of PepsiCo; \nf. Thomas Wajnert, former Chairman and CEO of AT&T Capital Corporation; \ng. John Zillmer, retired President, CEO and Executive Chairman of Univar. \n(JX0023.0069.) \n112.  Wajnert was selected to serve as the Chair of the Transaction Committee.  \nThe remaining directors on the RAI Board in October 2016, none of whom served on \nthe Transaction Committee, were Cameron  (CEO of RAI), Murray Kessler (former \nCEO of Lorillard) , and the five designees BAT added to the Board under the \nGovernance Agreement, two of  whom were BAT executives .  (JX0007.0001, .0003; \nWajnert Tr. 72:21–73:3, 146:6–14.) \n113. The members of the Transaction Committee were fully independent of BAT \nand able to consider the proposed transaction (and any alternatives) free of any \nconflicts, focused only on the best interests of the RAI shareholders other than BAT.  \n(Wajnert Tr. 63:5–10, 72:21–73:3.)  The Transaction Committee was “sophisticated” \nand included a number of current and former CEOs, including “[a] lot of people with \nfinancial backgrounds” and experience with mergers and acquisitions.  All members, \n \n \n \nexcept Speaker Boehner, had participated in the complex Lorillard Transaction.  (de \nGennaro Tr. 214:9–215:14.) \n114. The RAI Board delegated to the Transaction Committee the power and \nauthority to, among other things, evaluate, discuss and negotiate the terms and \nconditions of, approve , recommend , and/or reject the October 20 Offer, any other \npotential transaction with BAT, and any potential alternative strategic transaction.  \nThe “Transaction Committee was empowered to analyze, accept, reject, full power to \nmake recommendations to the board, and then eventually to the shareowners.  But it \nhad full power to move forward, one way or the other.”  (Wajnert Tr.  71:21–25; \nJX0007.0003–.0004; JX0023.0069 –.0070.)  The RAI Board resolved that if the \nTransaction Committee rejected the October 20 Offer or any other offer, that rejection \nwould be final and binding on behalf of the full Board.  (JX0007.0003– .0004; \nJX0023.0069–.0070; Wajnert Tr. 74:8–24 (“[W]e had the final authority to accept or \nreject and to move forward with another transaction.”).)   \nc. Retention of Financial Advisors \n115. After interviewing several investment banks, the Transaction Committee \nappointed Goldman as its financial advisor based on its reputation and experience \nwith large complex transactions, the tobacco industry, and with RAI and its business.  \nAnother reason the Transaction Committee selected Goldman was because Goldman \nhad not been hired or compensated by BAT to provide any M&A financial advisory \nservices in the prior two years and had no other material relationships with BAT that \nmay have been expected to create a conflict of interest for Goldman.  ( Corr. Stip’d \n \n \n \nFacts ¶ 16; JX0023.0070; PX0038.0005–.0006; Wajnert Tr.  74:25–75:8; Eckler Dep. \nTr. 15:17–16:20, 18:11–19:03.)   \n116. On October 25, 2016, the Other Directors hired Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP \n(“Weil”) and Moore & Van Allen as legal counsel.  Both were fully independent of both \nRAI and BAT.  ( Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 16; PX0035.0001–.0003; JX0023.0069; Wajnert \nTr. 71:13–20, 73:11–23.)   \n117. Jones Day served as legal counsel to the Board and RAI in connection with \nthe review of the October 20 Offer and any subsequent developments.  The Board and \nRAI also hired both Lazard and JPMorgan as their financial advisors.  ( Corr. Stip’d \nFacts ¶ 16; JX0023.0070; de Gennaro Tr. 215:24–216:2; Gilchrist Tr. 437:5–10; Clark \nTr. 1561:13–1562:1.)   \n118. The Financial Advisors were highly sophisticated and respected investment \nbanks with extensive experience advising large companies in corporate transactions, \nincluding in the tobacco sector.  (DX0151.0015; DX0065.0008; de Gennaro Tr. 210:6–\n19, 211:13–212:1; Clark Tr. 1427:10–25; Eckler Dep. Tr. 14:8–15:11.)  The format of \nthe Financial Advisors ’ compensation —each was to receive a percentage of any \ncompleted deal (a “success fee”) —was typical in the industry and aligned the \nFinancial Advisors’ incentives with the Company’s to get the highest price.  (Wajnert \nTr. 75:13–76:2, 77:8–12; de Gennaro Tr . 217:15–219:3, 257:22–258:8.)  Investment \nbankers understand that  they may not receive a fee for their work on a proposed \ntransaction if the parties do not agree to a completed deal.  (Clark Tr. 1428:23–1429:1; \nde Gennaro Tr. 256:19–21.)   \n \n \n \n119. Although the Dissenters suggest that the Financial Advisors’ contingent fee \narrangements incentivized them to  encourage the Transaction Committee and RAI \nto agree to the Merger at a depressed price to ensure their compensation, there is no \ncredible evidence that any of t he Financial Advisors took any action in connection \nwith the Merger to cause a transaction with BAT at less than fair value .  To the \ncontrary, there was credible testimony that the Financial Advisors’ long-term \nreputations were more important to each of them than the compensation to be earned \non the Merger and that attempting to depress the merger price  would tarnish that \nreputation.29  (de Gennaro Tr. 257:2–18; Nowell Dep. Tr. 127:21–128:7.) \nd. Information Provided to Financial Advisors \n120. In the days following BAT’s initial offer, Gilchrist  and Price spoke with \nmembers of the teams at Goldman, Lazard, and JPMorgan  about clearing any \nconflicts of interest and determining what materials the Financial Advisors wanted \nto review if they were sel ected as a financial advisor for the Merger.  Gilchrist and \nPrice prepared the materials within days, allowing the Financial Advisors the ability \nto get up to speed quickly.  (JX0008.0001; DX0039.0001; DX0041.0001; Gilchrist Tr.  \n441:4–442:13; Price  Tr. 945:19–946:11, 1051:19– 1052:2.)  The Financial Advisors \nlikewise prepared to receive the information they expected from RAI management so \nthat they would be able to run their analyses as quickly as possible if they were hired.  \n(de Gennaro Tr. 273:12–274:3, 283:14–285:6.)   \n                                                 \n29 The Financial Advisors eventually received deal fees of $46.3 million (Goldman), $41.1 \nmillion (JPMorgan), and $11.1 million (Lazard), nearly all of which was contingent upon the \ncompletion of the Merger.  (JX0023.0101, .0116, .0130.) \n \n \n \n121. The parties’ dispute over RAI’s valuation in this action turns, in significant \npart, on the reliability of the information RAI provided to the Financial Advisors to \ninform their valuation analyses and whether RAI should have provided additional \ninformation in the form of internal, nonpublic , ten-year financial projections that \nunderlaid RAI management’s presentation to the Board at RAI’s Strategy Day in July \n2016 showing projections of 7% to 8% comp ound annual growth over the next ten \nyears.  Dissenters contend that these ten -year projections, and, in particular,  years \nsix through ten of those projections, were reliable and accurate, and when used in a \ndiscounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis to generat e a n adjusted blended terminal \ngrowth rate , result in a far higher valuation for RAI than the deal price.  (Defs.’ \nOpening Post-Trial Br. 31–43, ECF No. 221.)  RAI argues that the out years of the \nCompany’s ten-year projections were never used or intended to value the Company \nand are largely extrapolations of existing trends such that they are entirely unsuited \nand unreliable for purposes of calculating RAI’s fair value.  (RAI’s Post-Trial Br. 74–\n77, ECF No. 219.)   \ni. RAI’s Financial Projections \n122. RAI managed i ts business with a focus on attempting to provide regular \nreturns to its shareholders in the form of growing EPS by a stated target of growth \nin the high-single digits.  (Gilchrist Tr. 373:20–374:13; Wajnert Tr. 110:14–18.)  EPS \nwas the single most importa nt metric for the RAI B oard in measuring RAI’s \nperformance.  Management therefore focused its decision making and financial \npresentations on maintaining target growth in RAI’s EPS year over year.  ( Gilchrist \n \n \n \nTr. 373:20–374:13 (“That was what the shareholders were primarily focused on.  \nThat’s what our board had structured, you know, a lot of our goals and objectives \naround.”).) \n123. RAI maintained a financial projection process as part of its ordinary \noperation of the business, which was designed to measure how well RAI was \nperforming relative to its annual EPS target.  (Gilchrist Tr. 374:14–375:1.)  \n124. Before Gilchrist became CFO of RAI, he oversaw a project to overhaul RAI’s \nforecasting process from what was once disjointed and focused on the short-term into \na more rigorous and disciplined process.  (Gilchrist Tr. 452:22–455:6.)  As part of this \noverhaul process, RAI started taking a “forward-looking” perspective to the forecasts, \nproviding longer forecasts in the range of five to ten years, as opposed to focusing on \nonly one year, and began to update the forecasts every month as opposed to only four \ntimes a year.  (Gilchrist Tr. 454:22–455:15.)   \n125. The goal of the forecasting process was to stimulate more discussion and \ntransparency among business units so they would have a more cohesive view as to \nwhat was happening at RAI as a whole.  (Gilchrist Tr.  457:2–458:12.)  To that end, \neveryone involved in forecasting was working off one forecast for the entire company.  \nGilchrist testified that “what we wanted to do was make sure that everybody – we \ndidn’t have people saying your forecast is wrong, our forecast is right.  We had one \nforecast, and everybody was working off the same forecast.”  RAI developed a motto \nfor the forecasts: “one version of the truth.”  (Gilchrist Tr. 458:20–459:11.) \n \n \n \n126. As  Gilchrist explained, RAI’s projections were “assumption-based,” in that \nthey incorporated   \nassumptions based on competitive activity, based on market dynamics.  \nIt would be assumptions based on litigation, regulation, taxation.  You \nknow, a lot of those things are unknown so we would obviously have to \nmake assumptions.  And the way  . . . we structured that was basically \nto outline what those assumptions were so there was complete \ntransparency on the assumptions.  Obviously, you know, everybody was \naware of what those assum ptions would be and the –  as those \nassumptions changed, you would expect to see changes flow through the \n[forecast]. \n(Gilchrist Tr. 378:6–18.)   \n127. The evidence shows that RAI’s financial projection process was not designed \nto take into account the large looming risks to the industry, such as new or tightened \nregulations, increased or new excise taxes, large litigation judgments or settlements, \nor competitive changes like an alteration  in Altria’s pricing behavior, because these \nrisks were difficult both to predict and to quantify and were largely beyond RAI’s \ncontrol.  (Wajnert Tr. 58:2–59:9, 111:5 –10, 119:5 –120:5; Gilchrist Tr. 385:10–17, \n391:4–9, 394:24–395:9.)  As Jennette testified, “a company is not going to go forward \nto [its] Board of Directors and say, [‘]Hey, you know, the industry is coming apart and \nwe don’t have any answers. [’] ”  (Jennette Dep. Tr.  31:23–32:1; Holland\n30 Dep. Tr. \n40:5–25.) \n                                                 \n30 Steven Holland (“Holland”) was Senior Director of Capital Markets of RAI Services Co., a \nwholly-owned subsidiary of RAI, where he worked in the treasury group providing \ninformation to financial advisors at the time of the Merger.  (Gilchrist Tr. 598:3–16; DX0115; \nParties’ Witness Summaries 4.)  Portions of Holland’s deposition were admitted into the trial \nrecord.  (ECF No. 206.)   \n \n \n \n128. Accordingly, RAI management and the Board discussed the existence of the \nrisks as downside sensitivities to the forecasts, which expressly  assumed that the \nrisks would not occur during the projection period.  (JX0009.0001 –.0002; \nPX0047.0002; JX0010.0006; PX0052.0004, .0006; Gilchrist Tr. 380:21–391:09.)  If any \nof those risks did occur, RAI would have to change its projections and, more \nimportantly, its business practices, in response to them.  (JX0010.0006; JX0023.0134; \nPX0052.0004, .0006; Wajnert Tr. 49:12–50:7; Gilchrist Tr.  378:22–379:15, 382:09 –\n391:09, 462:1–8; Fragnito Tr.  1774:3–11; Price Tr. 963:25–964:1.)  As one  example, \nGilchrist explained that while the imposition of onerous state excise taxes was a \nlarge, looming risk to RAI’s business, RAI incorporated into its financial forecasts a \nCalifornia ballot measure to raise its state excise tax in November 2016 only when it \npassed and its effective date determined.  (Gilchrist Tr. 462:18–463:12.) \n129. In short, RAI’s projections “were intended to be the best estimate [of] the \nfuture performance based on the assumptions that [the Company] had [,]” (Gilchrist \nTr. 377:23–378:5), but a proper consideration of those assumptions and sensitivities \nwas critical in determining whether the projections could be reasonably relied upon \nfor a particular purpose or use.  Importantly, assumptions that “were unknown either \nin timing, impact or scale, or imple mentation . . . [were] outlined as risks and \nsensitivities” but not included in RAI’s management’s forecasts .  ( Gilchrist Tr. \n378:22–379:15.)  \n \n \n \nii. The Latest Estimates \n130. In the ordinary course of business, RAI developed financial projections every \nmonth except January.  RAI’s financial planning process began with management’s \nforecast of industry-wide volumes and pricing for the forecast period.  ( Gilchrist Tr. \n457:12–23.)  These volume and pricing forecasts were the “foundation” of RAI’s \nfinancial projections, and were based on publicly-available, historical pricing, market \nshare and volume information, as well as publicly available information about \nAltria’s financial results and stated EPS targets.  (Gilchrist Tr. 529:12–25.)  Once the \nvolume and pricing forecasts were developed, division finance leaders would add \nprojections for their specific businesses.  From these, a single RAI forecast, called a \n“Latest Estimate” or “LE,” was developed.  ( Gilchrist Tr.  376:19–377:12; Price Tr. \n941:15–20.)   \n131. In the Lat est Estimates from February through May  every year , RAI \nprojected the current year plus two additional years, providing quarterly projections \nfor each of those years.  (Gilchrist Tr. 375:2–24; DX0015, at tab “Consol Fcst.”)  This \nlength of time was chosen because RAI’s Board and management were focused on \nthat short time horizon and because it was the most likely period of time to be \naccurate due to the assumptions included in the projections.  (Gilchrist Tr. 376:4–18; \nJennette Dep. Tr. 32:1–5.)   \n132. As Nowell testified, \n[RAI] is a business . . . trying to get through the next six months, the \nnext quarter would have been, in some cases, long term because it’s a \ndeclining industry based off of pricing and that.  So getting out beyond \n \n \n \nfive years, . . . at that point in time, wasn’t value added beca use there \nwere too many variables that were outside of our control. \n(Nowell Dep. Tr. 26:1–9.)  \niii. The Operating Plan \n133. Once per year, typically in October, RAI management created an “Operating \nPlan” for the Board’s approval, which set out the Company’s financia l targets and \nbudget for the upcoming year.  Management based the financial portion of the \nOperating Plan on the October LE, which contained five years of projections.  \n(JX0012.0017–.0019; JX0016.0005– .0007; Wajnert Tr. 41:25–42:13; Gilchrist Tr.  \n391:10–392:2.)  The Operating Plan itself, as presented to the Board, contained high-\nlevel financial projections for only the following two years, including “industry, \ncompany and brand volume and market share; adjusted operating income; adjusted \noperating margins and adjusted EPS growth.”  (JX0012.0018; PX0063.0042; Gilchrist \nTr. 391:10–392:2.)   \n134. As  Gilchrist explained, management used the additional years of  financial \nprojections   \nto make sure that we had an understanding of the dynamics of the \nbusiness, to make sure that the strategies actually were working and \nreally for an opportunity to make sure that we had visibility on some of \nthe key milestones and/or gaps in the business so that we can identify \nthree years out[.]  \n(Gilchrist Tr. 392:10–15.)  I n contrast, the Board had no need for these additional \nyears of projections for purposes of evaluating and approving the O perating Plan, \nwhich the Board used as a budget tool and to set financial performance and \nmarketplace objectives only for the upcoming  year.  ( Gilchrist Tr.  392:7–394:23 \n \n \n \n(noting that projection years three through five were generally used “as a check to \nmake sure things are still on track”).) \n135. The final O perating Plan prepared prior to the Merger was for 2017.  On \nseveral occasions, RAI m anagement identified the key assumptions underlying the \n2017 Operating Plan.  At the September 2016 Board meeting, RAI management \npresented those assumptions to the Board in preparation for the full plan review at \nthe next Board meeting.  (DX0025.0011–.0012.)  The key assumptions underlying the \n2017 Operating Plan projections also were included in the Operating Plan executive \nsummary.  (PX0063.0045 –.0046.)  Gilchrist discussed these same assumptions and \nsensitivities at the December 1, 2016 Board meeting, which had been outlined in \nPowerPoint slides shared with the Board prior to the meeting:   \n \n(PX0063.0100); \n\n \n \n \n \n(PX0063.0106–.0107; see also JX0012.0018.)  \niv. The Strategic Plan and Strategy Day \n136. Once per year, typically in July, RAI held a Strategy Day  Board meeting, \nwhen \nthe board would gather with management to do – have deep thoughts \nand think about where the company was going over the next five to ten \nyears, and discuss what the issues were that were obvious to everybody \nat that particular point and what opportunities might be there as well.  \n(Wajnert Tr. 50:11–19.)   \n137. Nowell described Strategy Day in similar  terms, as a time when \nmanagement would present  \nan overview of the company and how we thought we were going to \noperate, say, going over the next two, three years.  That would be then \noverlaid with an R&D discussi on about new products, new generation \nproducts, other products we had in the pipeline, when we thought they \nwould be introduced.  We would talk about the regulatory environment \nin terms of what’s happening in DC in view of that political \nenvironment, how t hat might impact us, what was going on in the \n\n \n \n \noverall economy, and how that might impact us.  And then rolling all \nthat together, kind of have a closer view on . . . all that being considered \nalong with . . . a lot of risk and other things that went throug h it, what \ndoes that look like for us going forward. \n(Nowell Dep. Tr. 24:19–26:09.) \n138. In preparation for each year’s Strategy Day, members of RAI’s finance team \ndeveloped the June LE, which contained projections for the current year plus nine \nyears, providing quarterly projections for the current year and the next two years and \nmore generalized annual projections for the remaining years.  (DX0140,  at tab \n“Consol Fcst.”)  RAI management typically created a “Strategic Plan” for the Board’s \nreview at Str ategy Day, the financial portion of which was based on the June LE.  \n(DX0011; Martin\n31 Dep. Tr. 34:21–37:08, 156:19–157:21).  In preparing the June LE, \nthe finance team applied a “broad brush approach [,]” used a “much higher” \nmateriality threshold for forecasting years three through ten, and emphasized \n“identifying significant gaps in achieving the desired earnings [.]”  (DX0023.0002.)  \nRAI management used years six through ten of the  June LE  only in planning \nmanufacturing capacity and funding for capital expenditure s.  (Wajnert Tr. 116:21–\n118:11; JX0004.0031).   \n139. Wajnert explained the purpose of the financial information presented at \nStrategy Day as follows:   \nthe discussion related to the future state of the tobacco industry and, of \ncourse, Reynolds American.  So you would have a discussion about three \nyears, five years, what could happen, discussing various scenarios.  We \n                                                 \n31 Stephen Thad Martin (“Martin”) was the Senior Director of Financial Planning of  RAI \nServices at the time of the Merger.  (Gilchrist Tr. 465:19–21; Parties’ Witness Summaries 4.)  \nPortions of Martin’s deposition were admitted into the trial record.  (ECF No. 204.)   \n \n \n \nwouldn’t be looking at approving finan cial projections for a long period \nof time.  That was not the purpose.  The purpose was to frame the \nconversation. \n(Wajnert Tr. 57:7–15.) \n140. RAI possessed “no material insight” about brand strength, trends or growth \nin the industry in years six through ten that was not also available to individuals \noutside the Company who were knowledgeable about the tobacco industry.  \n(DX0023.0002; Gilchrist Tr. 405:2–406:6, 528:24–530:6, 620:8–11 (“Q.  And did RAI \nhave superior information over others in the tobacco industry to look at and analyze \nthat historical information and pull it forward?  A.  No.  It was public information.”).)  \nRAI management and the Board considered the forecasts for years three through five \nto be of ever -decreasing reliability and years six through  ten to be extrapolations \nintended to provide information about whether a continuation of existing trends \nwould allow the Company to meet its EPS targets.  ( Gilchrist Tr. 375:2–24, 404:9–\n405:1, 501:9–16; Price Tr. 1017:13–20.)   \n141. Gilchrist testified that “the very foundational elements of the forecast, \nindustry volume, market share, pricing  . . . were generally extrapolations” in years \nsix through ten.  ( Gilchrist Tr.  626:20–627:1.)  The contemporaneous evidence \nsupports Gilchrist’s explanation of RAI’s forecasting process.  For instance, the Yearly \nCigarette Volume tab of the June 2016 LE shows that RAI’s “Cigarettes –  Share of \nShipments” projections are straight -line extrapolations derived directly from RAI’s \nindustry volume forecasts: \n \n \n \n \n(DX0140, at tab “Yr – Cigt Vol,” rows 42–79; see also Gilchrist Tr. 617:21–620:15 (“If \nyou look at market share growth, for example, which is a key component, they would \njust project out a certain market share growth which then would be translated down \nto volume all the way through the process.”); Price Tr. 961:18–962:10.) \n142. The fact that extrapolations provided the most fundamental inputs to years \nsix through ten of the ten-year projections was not contradicted.  Although Dissenters \nidentified certain entries in the June 201 6 LE, including the entries entitled \n“discounting” in the RJRT Detail tab, that did not follow a straight- line pattern, \n(DX0140, at tab “RJRT Detail,” row 940; Gilchrist Tr.  520:19–521:9), Gilchrist \ncredibly explained that “discounting” entries and many others were derived from the \nvolume, market share, and pricing elements, (Gilchrist Tr. 521:5–22).  The results of \nthe interaction among those foundational elements would not necessarily reflect \nstraight-line patterns, despite the results having been based on entries that were \nthemselves extrapolated.  (Gilchrist Tr. 617:21–620:15, 623:25–627:1.)   \n\n \n \n \n143. Many topics were covered by the Board during the July 2016 Strategy Day, \nincluding competitive analysis, research and development, regulatory developments \nand risks, new business opportunities , and, briefly, a discussion of the impacts of \nRAI’s Strategic Plan on RAI’s financial projections.  (PX0009.0010– .0013, .0021–\n.0025; JX0003.0003–.0005; JX0004.0020–.00231.)   \n144. At the end of the July 2016 Strategy Day meeting, Peters presented to the \nBoard a short financial overview presentation, which showed summary and top- line \nprojected financials for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021 and 2025.  These projections, \npresented in condensed fashion, reflected 7% to 8% compound annual growth over the \nnext ten years, (JX0004.0027; Gilchrist Tr.  526:22–25), and were based on certain \nidentified assumptions that there would be no significant changes from the status \nquo, (JX0004.0020–.0035; Nowell Dep. Tr.  46:23–47:12; Wajnert T r. 56:10–57:1, \n117:19–118:4).  As was the case with projections generally, the financial information \npresented to the Board did not incorporate any of the large-scale risks facing RAI, in \npart because many of the risks were effectively an “on/off switch” w hich could not \nhave been factored into the numbers  accurately.  (Wajnert Tr.  58:11–21; \nJX0004.0021.)  The Board did not receive the underlying ten -year projections from \nthe June LE, nor did the Board give feedback on the projections for management to \nconsider.  (Wajnert Tr. 56:10–57:1, 58:7–21.)  \nv. The October 2016 Projections  \n145. On October 29, 2016, RAI sent each Financial Advisor a set of financial \nprojections (the “October 2016 Projections”).  (JX0008.0001; PX0039.0001; \n \n \n \nDX0043.0001.)  The October 2016 Projections were based on the October 2016 LE,  \nthe most recently completed LE  available at the time of the October 20 Offer .  The \nprojections used by the Financial Advisors for years one through five were based on \na three-tab spreadsheet containing an income statement, a balance sheet, and a cash \nflow statement.  (JX0008.0001, .0003–.0005; PX00039.0003–.0005; DX0043, at sheets \n“Income Statement,” “Balance Sheet,” and “Cash Flow.”)  The October 2016 LE also \nserved as the baseline for the 2017 Operating Plan that RAI’s financial management \nwas preparing prior to BAT’s October 20 Offer.  (Gilchrist Tr. 441:8–442:13.)   \n146. Prior to sending the October 2016 LE to the F inancial Advisors, RAI’s \nfinancial team made a series of adjustments to account for updated information and \nhigh-level financial decisions that had not yet been made public.  These adjustments \nwere called “Top -Side Adjustments” or “Management Overlays.”  The adjustments \nadded roughly $300 million in income before tax to each year of the October 2016 LE \nprojections, or approximately $1.4 billion in total.  (DX0041, at tab “Top Side Adjs”; \nGilchrist Tr.  443:9–12, 443:15 –444:18; Price Tr. 1053:18–1054:14, 105:23– 1055:4; \nZmijewski Tr. 1246:5–12.)  Some Top -Side Adjustments were based on public \ninformation that had not yet been incorporated into the October 2016 LE, including \nchanges to state tax laws and effects from positive stock market performance.  (Price \nTr. 957:22–958:6.)  Other Top-Side Adjustments related to information that was not \nwidely known, such as a planned restructuring of RAI’s sales force that was projected \nto increase RAI’s income.  ( Price Tr. 957:10–21.)  Although these Management \nOverlays were typically not included in the ordinary course forecasts, RAI added \n \n \n \nthem to provide the Financial Advisors with the most accurate and reliable \ninformation it had concerning RAI’s business.  (Price Tr. 983:3–985:14.) \n147. Over the next few weeks, Gilchrist, Price, and others on RAI’s finance team \ncontinued sending documents and information to the F inancial Advisors, including \ninformation about RAI’s projections, and participated in diligence calls with the \nFinancial Advisors to discuss the materials that were sent and any additional \nquestions or requested information.  ( Gilchrist Tr. 440:10–22, 445:17–20; Price Tr. \n945:3–12; PX0047.0001–.0004; DX0046.0001–.0004.) \nvi. The Ten-Year Projections   \n148. Dissenters have alleged that Gilchrist  and Price intentionally withheld \ncertain information from the Financial Advisors , including RAI’s ten -year financial \nprojections developed in connection with the June 2016 Strategic Plan, in an attempt \nto mislead the Financial Advisors about the prospects of the Company and deceive \nthe Board and Transaction Committee into accepting an offer from BAT below RAI’s \nintrinsic value.  (DX0067.0001; Clark Tr.  1518:1–21; Gilchrist Tr.  446:7–447:20, \n628:13–629:5; Price Tr. 959:23–960:7, 1001:21– 1003:2.)  Dissenters’ allegati on is \ncontrary to the evidence.   \n149. First, l ess than two weeks after the October  20 Offer, RAI management \nprovided each of the Financial Advisors with the financial information given to the \nBoard at the July 2016 Strategy Day, including projections of operating income and \ngrowth rates for years six through ten of the June 2016 Strategic Plan .  \n(DX0069.0021; DX0169.0040; DX0234.0021.)  The Financial Advisors were thus \n \n \n \naware of the forecasted compound annual growth rates of 7% to 8% for the out years \nof those projections.  A management team intent on hiding the ten -year projections \nwould not have provided the Strategy Day presentation with the ten -year operating \nincome and growth rates.  At that point, the supposed conspiracy would have been \nexposed because all three Financial Advisors knew the projected trajectory and could \nhave insisted on further detail if they believed it was necessary.  That simply did not \nhappen here. \n150. In addition, the June 2016 LE projections were several months old  by \nOctober 2016, and Clark testified that JPMorgan “can’t use [a] stale set of projections.  \nWe have to use the most up -to-date set of projections.”  (Clark Tr. 1519:7–11.)  It is \nundisputed that t he five-year October 2016 P rojections were the most up -to-date \nprojections available.   \n151. Further, years six through ten of the June 2016 LE projections were less \ninformative than the projections in the October 2016 Projections because the later \nyears, based in large part on extrapolations of existing trends, were developed with a \n“broad brush approach [,]” and used a “much higher” materiality threshold .  \n(DX0023.0002; Gilchrist Tr. 375:2–24, 404:9–406:6 (“[I]t was the best view of what \nthe business would do based on the assumptions that we laid out.”), 501:9 –16; Price \nTr. 1017:7–23.)  \n152. Next, the  evidence does not indicate that the Financial Advisors  needed \ndetailed ten-year projections to adequately perform their valuation analyses.  Indeed, \nrepresentatives from Goldman, Lazard , and JPMorgan  each testified that such \n \n \n \ninformation was unnec essary.  (Eckler Dep. Tr.  61:3–12; de Gennaro Tr. 352:8 –13; \nClark Tr. 1432:23–1433:3.)   \n153. Contrary to Dissenters’ suggestion at trial, de Gennaro testified that there \nis no “hard and fast rule” for the number of years of projections required for any of \nthe banks to do their work, although typically “five, five to ten years” are used.  \n(de Gennaro Tr. 205:24–206:11.)  Although de Gennaro had an expectation that RAI \nwould provide ten-year projections just as they had in connection with the Lorillard \nTransaction in 2015, (de Gennaro Tr. 273:18–23), he explained that \n[t]here’s no magic to ten years, seven years, five years as long as it forms \na reasonable and best view and management tells us, this is what we \nbelieve to be the case, we go through it, we get valid ation, that’s what \nwe use.  And it’s perfectly adequate for our purposes.  So I genuinely \nhave no recollection of being concerned that we might get ten years, five \nyears, other than we were going to use what we got, and we wanted to \nbe in a position to use what we got.  There’s no issue with a five-year set \nof numbers.  There just wasn’t this pressing question, other than from a \nprocedural standpoint.  We needed to know what numbers we were \ngoing to get in order to be able to do analysis if and when the time came. \n(de Gennaro Tr. 293:18–294:6, 352:8–13 (“[W]e were very comfortable working with \n. . . a five-year forecast.”).) \n154. Similarly, after reviewing and analyzing the information from RAI \nmanagement, Eckler determined that “the financial forecast was sufficient to make \nall of the necessary judgments for the purposes of [Goldman’s] valuation analysis.”  \n(Eckler Dep. Tr.  61:3–12.)  JPMorgan reached a similar conclusion.  (Clark Tr. \n1597:12–16.)  Despite the preference of certain team members to work with ten-year \nprojections and initially asking whether RAI management could provide such \n \n \n \nprojections, JPMorgan ultimately determine d that a detailed ten -year forecast was \n“not necessary” to perform its valuation work.  (Clark Tr. 1432:23–1433:3.)   \n155. Testimony from the Financial Advisors further indicates that it was typical \nwhen performing valuation work to receive and use five- year projections from \nmanagement.  (Clark Tr. 1432:3–8; Eckler Dep. Tr. 32:03–33:20, 34:01–14, 35:08–09, \n35:11–19, 67:07–67:15; de Gennaro Tr. 205:24–206:11, 220:13–221:5, 222:19–223:5.)  \nIndeed, Dissenters’ own expert, Zmijewski, testified that he used ten-year projections \nonly to calculate RAI’s pension liabilities; he otherwise elected to perform his DCF \nanalysis for purposes of this case using five years of RAI management projections.  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1247:1–1248:6.)  And RAI i tself, in preparing its share repurchase \nceiling (as discussed below), used five-year projections when it obviously knew that \nten-year projections existed.  (DX00138; DX0622, at tab “Sheet1.”) \n156. Dissenters’ suggestion that the Financial Advisors agreed, at RAI’s request, \nto use five-year, rather than ten-year, projections to protect their compensation at the \nexpense of providing an accurate and reliable valuation , is not supported by the \nevidence. \n157. Price’s statements at his deposition that he prepared “ten-year projections” \nfor delivery to the Financial Advisors in late October 2016 does not change the Court’s \nfindings.  At the time of trial, Price was no longer employed by RAI and ha d no \nincentive to be untruthful.  He offered a credible explanation at trial that he meant \nto refer at his deposition to the five- year projections derived from the October 2016 \nProjections plus the Top-Side Adjustments and that he had not in fact prepared ten-\n \n \n \nyear projections in October 2016 .  (DX0039.0001; Price Tr. 946:18–952:5, 952:20 –\n953:22, 954:4–7.)  Price’s trial testimony is corroborated by the fact that there is no \nevidence that  RAI prepared ten -year projections for any purpose other than the \nBoard’s Strategy Day in June of each year , (Gilchrist 375:13–376:3), and Dissenters \nhave not identified any evidence, documentary or otherwise, indicating the existence \nof up-to-date, ten-year projections as of October 2016.  The Court finds that Price  \nsimply made an honest mistake at his deposition. \n158. Similarly, Dissenters’ focus on alleged discrepancies between the testimony \nof the Financial Advisors, Gilchrist, and Price does not diminish the credibility of the \nlatter two.  While the evidence shows that JPMorgan asked RAI for ten -year \nprojections, (Clark Tr. 1433:4–17), and that Lazard had received ten-year projections \nfrom RAI in the Lorillard Transaction, (de Gennaro Tr.  260:20–24, 262:23–263:11, \n312:24–313:7, 364:8–365:4; DX0148.0009–.0013), that evidence does not contradict \nGilchrist’s and Price’s testimony that they did not recall Clark ’s requests, (Gilchrist \nTr. 589:23–590:11; Price Tr. 1016:23–1017:6).  Clark testified that Gilchrist and Price \ntold him that RAI did not have “an up -to-date set of ten -year financial forecasts [,]” \n(Clark Tr. 1433:4–17), and that the ones that it did have were “stale [,]” (Clark Tr. \n1518:12–21), which is consistent with all the credible evidence introduced at trial.  \n159. Considering all of the evidence, including the credibility of the relevant \nwitnesses, the Court cannot conclude that RAI’s decision to provide the Financial \nAdvisors with the five -year October  2016 Projections rather than the ten -year \nprojections from the June 2016 LE was calculated to deprive the Financial Advisors \n \n \n \nof important information to drive down their valuations of RAI to a range affordable \nto BAT.  All credible evidence is to the contrary.  Ultimately, the record is clear that \nthe Financial Advisors received all the information they believed they needed for \ntheir valuation work , (de Gennaro Tr.  352:8–13; Eckler Dep. Tr.  61:3–12), and no \ncredible evidence was offered at trial supporting any effort by RAI management to \nhide information to depress the resulting valuation of the Company.\n32 \ne. Share Repurchase Plan \n160. In the summer of 2016, the RAI Board approved a share repurchase program \nin response to unique circumstances related to RAI’s MSA payment  obligations in \n2017 that gave rise to a $250 million increase in RAI’s costs.  RAI referred to this \nincrease as the “NPM cliff”:  \n[I]n 2013 a settlement was reached with 22 states and jurisdictions on \ndisputed 2003-2012 NPM [non-participating manufacturer] credits, plus \ntwo more states in 2014, for credits to be paid over five years.  \nAdditionally, a settlement was reached with the State of New York \nrelated to payment years 2004 -2014 for credits to be paid over a four-\nyear period.  The NPM credits account for a total financial benefit of \napproximately $1.2 billion through 2019.  Some transition credits \nexpire[d] after 2014, with most of the remaining credits expiring after \n2016, creating a one-time $250 million drop in 2017 and $100 million in \n2019 – the “NPM cliff.”  The removal of these credits will increase Cost \nof Goods Sold for RJRT in 2017, causing year over year profit to be flat. \n(PX0063.0046.) \n161. RAI management expected to mitigate the 2017 NPM cliff “through actions \nthat will not impact the commercial business[;] these mitigation activities will appear \n                                                 \n32 As will be discussed infra, the evidence actually shows that RAI management advocated to \nthe Financial Advisors for a higher valuation, in order to obtain the best possible purchase \nprice for the Company.  (Price Tr. 1054:23–1055:14.)   \n \n \n \nbelow operating income.”  (PX0063.0046, .0100.)  Management recommended to the \nBoard a share repurchase plan in the summer of 2016 using RAI’s excess cash to help \nboost EPS, describing the share repurchase program as a “cliff mitigation element to \nhelp overcome the impact of the loss of those credits.”  (Gilchrist Tr. 412:16–413:14.) \n162. A share repurchase plan involves a company’s “go[ing] on the open market \nand repurchas[ing] its shares to reduce its overall share count.”  (Gilchrist Tr. 412:7–\n12.)  By reducing a company’s share count, the share repurchases reduce the \ndenominator in the E PS calculation and therefore increase EPS.  ( Gilchrist Tr.  \n413:15–21.) \n163. To proceed with the share repurchase plan, RAI management requested and \nobtained Board approval for the time frame of purchases (two -and-a-half years), the \namount of capital to be used ($2  billion), and the authorization ceiling at which \nmanagement would be permitted to repurchase shares without further Board \napproval ($65 per share).  (Gilchrist Tr. 413:22–414:14.) \n164. The share repurchase authorization ceiling was an internal corporate grant \nof authority from the Board to management, allowing management to purchase \nshares on the open market up to the ceiling price if management believed it was in \nthe best interest of the Company to do so.  ( Gilchrist Tr.  415:2–5, 416:10–417:13, \n417:20–418:1, 418:11 –15.)  Consistent with standard practices of publicly traded \ncompanies, RAI’s share repurchase authorization ceiling was an internal matter and \nwas not disclosed to the market.  (Wajnert Tr. 166:5–21; Crew Tr. 714:15–25.)   \n \n \n \n165. RAI arrived at the $65 s hare repurchase authorization ceiling after \nperforming a rough discounted cash flow calculation  using “conservative \nassumptions” over the two- and-a-half year length of the proposed program.  \n(DX0284.0003–.0004; Holland 30(b)(6) 33 Dep. Tr. 37:16 –40:18 (“We would \npurposefully kind of weight it on the higher end.”), 43:5–44:8; Gilchrist Tr. 418:2–10, \n548:15–549:2.)  The share repurchase DCF was not intended to value the Company, \nbut rather to derive a reasonable request for RAI management to make to the Board \nas a ceiling price for management’s authority to repurchase shares.  I t was not \nmanagement’s intention to set the share repurchase authorization ceiling at the \n“intrinsic value” of RAI’s shares; rather, RAI management sought to  \nget authorization from the board to purchase shares up to a certain point \nif the market took the stock to that point.  So we were intending to \nobviously reduce our share count over a period of time to help overcome \nthat NPM cliff.  That’s really what we were trying to accomplish.   \n(Gilchrist Tr. 414:19–415:1.) \n166. Once the ceiling price was set, RAI management retained discretion to make \na judgment in each quarter as to whether buying shares at the then- prevailing \nmarket price was an appropriate use of the Company’s resources.  It was not required \nto proceed with the purchases, even if the shares were trading below $65.  ( Gilchrist \nTr. 412:7–15, 417:14–21; Wajnert Tr. 149:16–23 (noting that in a share repurchase a \n                                                 \n33 Holland was designated pursuant to N.C. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) to testify regarding certain \ntopics on behalf of RAI.  (Parties’ Witness Summaries 4.)  Portions of Holland’s 30(b)(6) \ndeposition were admitted into the trial record.  (ECF No. 210.)   \n \n \n \ncompany will not pay shareholders “more than wh at the company believes the stock \nis worth”).)  \n167. Indeed, the status of the share repurchase program and management’s \nintended purchases were subject to regular review by the Board’s Audit and Finance \nCommittee.  (Gilchrist Tr. 413:22–414:14, 419:12– 420:2; D X0284.0003–.0006; \nDX0622.0003.)  Gilchrist testified that even though he had requested authority from \nthe Board to buy shares at a price up to $65 per share, he intended to discuss the \nmatter with the Board again if the stock traded higher and he determine d the price \nwas not attractive.  ( Gilchrist Tr. 417:22–418:15.)  RAI ended up purchasing only a \n“very small amount” of shares pursuant to the plan because RAI suspended the plan \nonce BAT made its first offer.  (Gilchrist Tr. 416:23–417:13.) \n168. The inputs used in the share repurchase DCF included a very wide range of \nterminal growth rates from 1% to 4% and a very wide range of weighted average costs \nof capital from 7% to 9.5%.  (DX0622, at tab “ Sheet1”; DX0138, at tab “ Sheet1”; \nHolland 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr.  58:16–59:7.)  The DCF analysis RAI created for the share \nrepurchase program ultimately used a 7.5% weighted average cost of capital \n(“WACC”) and a 3.0% perpetuity growth rate (“PGR”) for RAI.  (Gilchrist Tr. 543:20–\n24; DX0284.0003.)  The analysis was “based on the 2016 Strat[egy] Plan as of June \n2016 for a five -year period” and did not include the projected compound annual \ngrowth of 7% to 8% in years six through ten referenced in the 2016 Strategic Plan.  \n(Gilchrist Tr. 545:7–12, 547:3–13; DX00138.)   \n \n \n \n169. These inputs are not a reliable basis for valuing RAI.  The range of weighted \naverage costs of capital is much higher than is supported by any of the other evidence \nin the case, including from both sides’ experts and all three Financial Advisors.  \nIndeed, in the context of a valuation, there are significant methodological flaws with \nRAI’s selection of the weighted average cost of capital.  (Gompers Tr.  759:7–762:10, \n762:15–19.)  These problems undermine the utility of both the weighted average cost \nof capital and the perpetual growth rate in the share repurchase DCF because the \ntwo are linked, and RAI management considered them together in making its \nselection as to the authorization ceiling to request from the Board.  (DX0622, at tab \n“Sheet1”; DX0138, at tab “Sheet1”; Gilchrist Tr. 421:12–20; Gompers Tr. 760:3–13; \nFlyer Tr. 1226:23–1228:18 (“So the higher the WACC, the actually higher my implied \nPGR would be, because I’m weighing the beginning period more.  The lower the \nWACC, the lower the PGR would be, because I’m weighing the later periods more.”).) \nf. Further Deliberations and Negotiations \n170. On November 6, 2016, RAI sent each Financial Advisor a planned \npresentation for Board and Transaction Committee meetings on November  8 that \noutlined the assumptions and sensitivities to the October 2016 LE Projections as well \nas some of the high -level figures.  (PX0052.0001, .0004, .0006; JX0010.0001, .0004, \n.0006; Gilchrist Tr. 380:21–381:8.)   \n171. On November 8, 2016, the RAI Board met and reviewed the October 2016 \nProjections.  During the meeting, Gilchrist gave a presentation to the Board in which \nhe explained that the financial forecasts incorporated significant assumptions about \nthe industry dynamics, including ”[c]ontinuation of recent pricing e nvironment – no \n \n \n \nsignificant disruption[,]” “cigarette industry volume down ~3  - 4 percent[,]” “moist \nand vapor industry volume up ~2 percent [,]” “3 percent inflation [,]” “[state excise \ntaxes] $.05 per pack annually, moist snuff $.01 per can annually [,]” “S hare \nrepurchase beyond 2018 at $1 billion per year[,]” and “Capital expenditures continue \nat $150 - 200 million per year[.]”  (PX0052.0004; JX0010.0004.) \n172.  Gilchrist also identified upside and downside sensitivities to the financial \nprojections, including “ Accelerated growth from new revenue streams –  \nVapor/Transformation” as an upside and the greater risk of adverse FDA regulations \nas a downside.  (JX0010.0006.)  After his presentation, Gilchrist and Crew spoke with \nthe Board about “potential upside and downside to the business based on their \ncurrent thinking [,]” (PX0054.0002–.0003), and specifically advised the Board that  \n“the upside sensitivities and the downside se nsitivities are not all created equal[.]”   \n(Gilchrist Tr. 389:1 –3; JX0010.0003, .0006; PX0115.0127, .0377; JX0023.0070 –\n.0071.) \n173. On November 11, 2016, RAI rejected BAT’s October 20 O ffer.  \n(JX0023.0071–.0072).  On December  5, 2016, BAT made a revised offer t o acquire \nRAI, which RAI also rejected.  On neither occasion did RAI make a counterproposal.  \nAs shown on the following chart, BAT ultimately raised its offers four times before a \nfinal deal was reached on January 17, 2017: \n \n \n \nDate BAT \nShares  \nCash Value Per \nShare on Date \nTotal Value on \nOffer Date34 \nOct. 20, 2016 0.5502 $24.13 $56.50 $80.56 billion \nDec. 5, 2016 0.4923 $29.44 $56.60 $80.70 billion \nDec. 20, 2016 0.5105 $29.44 $58.30 $83.12 billion \nJan. 10, 2017 0.5250 $29.44 $59.15 $84.34 billion \nJan. 10, 2017 0.5260 $29.44 $59.20 $84.41 billion \nJan. 17, 2017 0.5260 $29.44 $59.64 $85.04 billion \n \n(Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 17; JX0023.0068–.0078.) \n174. The Transaction Committee never demanded that BAT support an \nalternative transaction to allow for an auction process , (Wajnert Tr. 70:7–11, 90:7–\n9), although there was no evidence at trial that BAT would have agreed to withdraw \nits announced opposition had it been pressed.  Nor did the Transaction Committee \nauthorize the Financial Advisors to solicit any expressi ons of interest from other \nparties concerning the sale of the Company or an  alternative transaction , \n(JX0023.0650, .0652, .0655; DX0272) , but, similarly, there was no admissible \nevidence at trial from any source that any third party was interested in purch asing \nRAI with or without BAT’s support.   \n175. Indeed, given the nature of the tobacco industry, regulatory requirements, \nRAI’s large size, and antitrust concerns, there were few (if any) companies in the \nworld—in the tobacco industry or adjacent industries—that could have made an offer \nfor RAI, regardless of BAT’s stock ownership.  (JX0023.0070; PX0115.0469; Eckler \nDep. Tr. 51:08–52:08.)  Significantly, although BAT’s offer was widely publicized, no \n                                                 \n34 Offer value is calculated based on the trading price of BAT stock and the British pound/U.S. \ndollar exchange rate as of the closing price on the date of the offer.  (JX0023.0068 –.0070.)  \nTotal value is the implied market capitalization, i.e. , RAI’s total shares outstanding on the \noffer date multiplied by the value per share of the offer.  (JX0023.0084–.0085.) \n \n \n \nthird party ever contacted the Transaction Committee, RAI man agement, or any of \nRAI’s Financial Advisors about the possibility of engaging in diligence or making a \ncompeting bid.  (Wajnert Tr. 90:3–6; Clark Tr. 1429:16–18.)   \n176. Goldman reviewed alternatives to negotiating a merger with BAT with the \nTransaction Committee.  (Eckler Dep. Tr. 50:13–50:25.)  The Transaction Committee \nconsidered whether Japan Tobacco could be a serious potential alternative buyer but \nconcluded that it was not.  This conclusion was based on RAI’s previous dealings with \nJapan Tobacco in which Japan Tobacco was quick to respond to RAI’s offers but \nmaintained a difficult internal process to move forward.  Past conversations with \nJapan Tobacco also led the Transaction Committee to reasonably believe that Japan \nTobacco would not be interested in dealing with the U.S. regulatory regime.  The \nTransaction Committee also reasonably believed that, given their positive \nrelationship with Japan Tobacco and Japan Tobacco’s 2016 purchase of the \ninternational rights to RAI’s Natural American Spirit brand, if there had been any \nreal interest in purchasing RAI, Japan Tobacco would have reached out to RAI \ndirectly.  (Wajnert Tr. 91:1–3, 99:17–100:1, 171:19–172:12 (“[W]e were not optimistic \nat all about Japan Tobacco being a potential bidder.  And we knew them well enough \nindividually, had visited together and the like, that if there had been an interest, a \nreal interest, they would have called.”).) \n177. While BAT indicated that it was not interested in selling its shares to an \nalternative buyer, that did not mean RAI had to sell the Company to BAT, nor did it \nmean that the members of the RAI Transaction Committee and Board were willing \n \n \n \nto—or had any reason to —sell the Company for less than its fair value.  \n(JX0021.0003; Wajne rt Tr. 73:24–74:24.)  Multiple witnesses testified that RAI \nseriously considered strategic alternatives, including remaining independent from \nBAT.  (Nowell Dep. Tr.  150:13–24; Cameron Dep. Tr.  106:16–107:11; Crew Tr. \n665:16–666:15.)  Indeed, the Transactio n Committee twice rejected BAT’s merger \noffers without making a counterproposal —showing the Transaction Committee \nthoroughly explored the viability of RAI’s remaining independent as an alternative \nto executing a transaction with BAT.  (JX0023.0067–.0073.)   \n178. It was not until after the Transaction Committee successfully negotiated \nfour price increases, securing an additional $4.5 billion in value for shareholders by \nthe time of signing, that the Transaction Committee concluded that a merger with \nBAT w as more attractive than other alternatives.  (JX0023.0065– .0078.)  In fact, \nJPMorgan advised RAI on various alternatives to BAT’s offers, including \ncontinuing to operate as a stand -alone entity, looking at other M&A \ntransactions where Reynolds would not –  not be the seller but be a \npotential acquirer of assets . . . [,] alternatives related to the company’s \ncapital structure, whether or not a leveraged recapitalization could \nmake sense, alternatives as it relates to its use of free cash flow in the \ncontext of repurchases or dividends.  A variety of alternatives.  \n(Clark Tr. 1429:2–12.) \n179. The Transaction Committee and its advisors ran a thorough deal process \nfrom October 28, 2016 to the signing of the Merger Agreement on January 16, 2017.  \nAll negotiations with  BAT were conducted by the Transaction Committee or its \nrepresentatives.  Wajnert, as Transaction Committee Chair (and after his retirement \non December 31, 2016, his replacement, Nowell), negotiated directly with BAT CEO, \n \n \n \nNicandro Durante.  (Wajnert Tr. 79:13–81:9; Nowell Dep. Tr. 169:11–170:6, 170:13–\n171:4, 171:12–173:9, 174:21–176:25; JX0023.0072–.0076.)   \n180. Likewise, Goldman negotiated directly with BAT’s bankers at Centerview \nand Deutsche Bank.  The Transaction Committee repeatedly rejected BAT’s offers \nand did not make a counterproposal until after BAT made its third offer, on December \n20, 2016, which BAT had said was its final proposal.  (Wajnert Tr.  79:13–81:5; \nJX0023.0073–.0074.)  The Transaction Committee regularly met and spoke with \nGoldman about the offers and investor reactions.  (JX0023.0070– .0078.)  Goldman \nand JPMorgan made many presentations of their valuation analyses to the \nTransaction Committee and to the Board during the negotiation process.  \n(JX0023.0070–.0078.) \n181. As a result of the Transacti on Committee’s efforts, BAT increased its offer \nto purchase RAI’s common stock four times from a per- share value of $56.50 in the \nOctober 20 Offer to a per-share value of $59.64 when the transaction was announced \non January 17, 2017, amounting to an additi onal $4.5 billion in deal value for RAI ’s \nshareholders and a 26.4% premium over the Unaffected Stock Price.  (Wajnert Tr.  \n80:19–22; Nowell Dep. Tr. 173:25–176:25; JX0023.0068–.0076, .0088.)   \ng. Financial Advisors’ Fairness Opinions and Shareholder Vote \n182. Corporate boards contemplating a sale of a company often seek fairness \nopinions from their financial advisors before agreeing to recommend the transaction \nto stockholders.  In order to arrive at a fairness opinion, a financial advisor performs \n \n \n \na financial analysis of the company typically using a variety of techniques.  (de \nGennaro Tr. 192:24–194:3.)   \n183. To prepare their fairness opinions in connection with the Merger, Goldman, \nLazard, and JPMorgan  each separately evaluated the final BAT offer from \nJanuary 10, 2017 and determined that it was fair from a financial point of view to the \nRAI shareholders other than BAT.  Each of the Financial Advisors presented a draft \nfairness opinion to its fairness committee prior to giving the bank’s final fairness \nopinion to the Board or the Transaction Committee or both on January 16, 2017.   \n184. Each Financial Advisor  conducted several types of valuations of RAI, \nincluding analyses of comparable companies’ market multiples, precedent \ntransaction multiples, and DCFs, based on their knowledge of RAI, the tobacco \nindustry, and the market.  These valuation analyses were me ant to be examined \ntogether.  (JX0023.0077 –.0078; PX0115.0252–.0282, .0526– .0570, .0572– .0635; de  \nGennaro Tr. 227:19–229:14, 232:19– 235:20; Clark Tr. 1448:24–1449:8, 1435:14–\n1436:5, 1448:24–1449:8; Eckler Dep. Tr. 49:4–15, 201:7–22.)   \n185. RAI management represented to the Financial Advisors that the five- year \nprojections provided earlier were management’s best estimates of its future cash \nflows, and the Financial Advisors relied on that representation, stating in their \nfairness opinions (al so published in SEC filings in connection with the Merger):  \n“[T]he unaudited financial forecasts were prepared on a reasonable basis and \nreflected the best then -currently available estimates and judgments of RAI’s \nmanagement.”  (JX0023.0133, .0649; Martin Dep. Tr. 113:05–113:10 (“Q. . . .  [D]o you \n \n \n \nrecall anyone at Reynolds commenting that the projections that were going to go into \nthe proxy statement were unrealistic?  A.  No.”); Price Tr. 710:15–19 (“Q.  [Y]ou would \nnever give the financial advisors proj ections that were –  that you thought were \nunreliable . . . .  A.  Well, no.  We’re going to be very transparent with everything we \ncan.  We disclose all of this.”).) \n186. In preparing their valuations, the Financial Advisors had access to whatever \ninformation they requested from RAI for their analyses.  (Gilchrist Tr. 445:17–20, \n446:7–447:20, 481:1–13, 481:19–482:12 (“I am certain they had everything that they \nrequested and that they needed.”), 587:8 –12; Price  Tr. 1017:5–6; de Gennaro \nTr. 222:12–18.)  As illustrated by the “football field” slides reproduced below from \neach of the Financial Advisors’ January 16, 2017 presentations to the RAI \nTransaction Committee and/or Board, the $59.64 per-share deal price was well within \nthe calculated ranges of equity value per share:   \n \n \n \n \n \n(PX0115.0539);  \n\n \n \n \n(PX0115.0258);  \n\n \n \n \n \n(PX0115.0582). \n187.  The deal price that RAI negotiated with BAT, as described by Lazard’s de \nGennaro, was a “very full price” and a “landmark price.”  (de Gennaro Tr. 236:6–16.)  \nJPMorgan’s Clark described it as a “homerun transaction for [RAI ,]” (Clark Tr.  \n1443:24–1444:5); he further testified that he had no concerns about issuing a fairness \nopinion for th e Merger, stat ing that “it was a fantastic transaction [,]” and that he \nwished he “had the ability to get transactions like this for all of [JPMorgan’s] \nclients[,]” (Clark Tr. 1451:7–12).  A number of analysts even expressed concern that \nBAT was overpaying.  After the announcement of the Merger, research analysts did \nnot comment that BAT was receiving a bargain or that RAI was undervalued in the \ndeal.  (Gompers Tr. 802:25–803:8; Yilmaz Tr. 2003:4–22.) \n\n \n \n \n188. From BAT’s October 20 Offer until the Transaction Date in  July 2017, the \nS&P 500, a broad measure of large U.S. companies, rose 17.15%.  Altria, the only \nother major U.S. tobacco company, rose 20.44% over that same period.  (Gompers Tr., \n792:2–11.)   \n189. At the shareholder vote on the Merger, RAI’s shareholders overwhelmingly \napproved the deal, by both a majority (83%) of the outstanding shares and by a \nmajority (71%) of the non -BAT-owned outstanding shares.  Nearly 72% of the non-\nBAT-owned shares were voted in the Merger, and 99% of those shares were voted in \nfavor of the Merger.  ( Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 18; DX0277.0011; DX0324.0002; \nJX0023.0044; Crew Tr. 671:23–672:10.)   \n190. Roughly 80% of RAI’s public shareholders were sophisticated, institutional \ninvestors.  (PX0115.0618.)  Among those voting in favor of the Merger were RAI’s \ndirectors and officers, who had the best information about the value of the Company.  \nRAI witnesses testified that they voted in favor of the deal, including Price, who lost \nhis job as a result of the Merger.  (Wajnert Tr.  85:13–24; Price Tr. 1061:1–1062:2.)  \nNone testified that they voted against it. \n191. On July 25, 2017, the Merger became effective, and an  indirect, wholly -\nowned subsidiary of BAT was merged with and into RAI, with RAI continuing as an \nindirect and wholly-owned subsidiary of BAT.  (Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 19; PX0109.0002, \n.0085–.0086; DX0325.0003.)  The merger consideration on that date had a cash value \nof $65.87.  The increase in the value of the merger consideration from January  16, \n2017 to the Effective Date of the Merger was due to the increase in the BAT share \n \n \n \nprice and favorable changes to the British pound/U.S. dollar exchange rate.  \n(DX0325.0003–.0004; Zmijewski Tr. 1241:24–1242:10.) \n192. In September 2017, RAI sent payment to Dissenters for RAI’s $59.64 per -\nshare estimate of the fair value of the shares held by Dissenters, plus interest \ncalculated pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 55 -13-01(6).  ( Corr. S tip’d Facts  ¶¶ 20 –25; \nAppendix A.) \nF. Evidence of Value  \n193. At trial, RAI introduced evidence of value using various valuation concepts \nand techniques that, when cross -checked against one another, show that the price \npaid by BAT reflected the fair value of RAI.  Additionally, RAI presented testimony \nfrom its executives, Board members , and Financial Advisors  regarding the \ncontemporaneous analyses and assessments they performed based on their \nknowledge of the Company and the industry—most of which supported the conclusion \nthat RAI shareholders received fair value in the transaction.   \n194. The conclusion that the deal price reflected fair value was further \ncorroborated by the testimony of RAI’s valuation expert, Gompers, who testified about \nhis own valuation analyse s and those of the Financial Advisors .  Based on that \nevidence, and for the reasons set forth below, the fair value of RAI at the Merger \nclosing on July 25, 2017 was no more than the deal price of $59.64. \n195. Dissenters sought to explain why all of the valuation evidence presented by \nRAI should be ignored, and that the value of RAI should be determined based solely \non the DCF model developed by their experts, Zmijewski and Flyer.  Relying entirely \non this made-for-litigation analysis, Dissenters request that the Court find that RAI’s \n \n \n \nfair value as of July 25, 2017 was $92.17—an amount that far exceeds any other \nevidence of value in the record and suggest s that RAI’s management, RAI’s B oard, \nRAI’s Financial Advisors, RAI’s shareholders, stock market analysts, and the market \nitself mispriced RAI by as much as $50 billion.35   \na. Market-Based Valuations \n196. Extensive evidence was offered showing that RAI’s fair value was in line \nwith the value that the market ascribed to RAI.  In the circumstances presented here, \nthe market’s view of the value of RAI is persuasive evidence of underlying fair value.  \nAs Gompers testified, “[I]f the market is efficient and there’s no material, non-public \ninformation, then the market price will be the best estimate of a firm’s .  . . intrinsic \nor fundamental value.”  (Gompers Tr. 784:1–6.)   \ni. RAI’s Stock Price \n197. On October 20, 2016, RAI’s common stock closed at $47.17 per share (the \n“Unaffected Stock Price”).  ( Corr. Stip’d Facts  ¶ 13.)  The evidence shows that this \nprice did not represent a s ubstantial deviation from the price at which RAI’s stock \nwas previously trading.  RAI’s 52- week trading average prior to BAT’s initial offer \nwas approximately $49.00.  (PX0115.0258.)  RAI’s common stock hit its all-time high \nof $54.48 per share on July 5, 2016.  (PX0115.0390.)  In fact, RAI’s share price had \n                                                 \n35 Zmijewski also testified at trial about a series of late-made calculations that were disclosed \nto RAI the morning prior to his testimony.  He acknowledged, however, that “[he] did one \nvaluation. . . .  And that value is $92.17.”  (Zmijewski Tr. 1325:3–13, 1325:21-23 (“Q.  So is it \nfair to say that the rest of these just illustrate the math if I asked you ‘what would it be if?’  \nA.  Yes.”).)  \n \n \n \nrealized significant gains in the years leading up to BAT’s initial offer.  \n(PX0063.0039.)   \n198. RAI’s stock was trading “at a pea k multiple in the marketplace” prior to \nBAT’s October 20 offer.  ( Gilchrist Tr. 560:22–561:11.)  Although RAI’s share price \nhad dropped at that time from its all -time high three months before, f rom the time \nthe Lorillard T ransaction closed in June 2015 unt il October 20, 2016, the volume \nweighted average price of RAI stock was $46.26—slightly below the Unaffected Stock \nPrice.  And trading data shows that the deal price was substantially above prior price \nlevels: \n \n(PX0115.0071.) \n\n \n \n \n199. Yilmaz testified that there are certain circumstances where the presence of \nlarge blockholders that have access to nonpublic information can lead to an increase, \nrather than a decrease, in a company’s value.  (Yilmaz Tr. 1967:18–1968:13 (“Q. . . .  \n[I]f the large blockholder does a good job . . . monitoring management’s performance, \nthat could lead to an increase in value . . . ?  A.  Yes.  Q.  And if the large blockholder \nhas expertise in the industry . . . it can provide to management, that too can increase \nthe company’s value . . . ?  A.  It is possible.  Yes.”).)  While Zmijewski suggested that \nBAT’s ownership stake in RAI could have depressed RAI’s market price to some \ndegree, (Zmijewski Tr. 1384:25– 1387:1), he presented no evidence to support his \nsuggestion or the magnitude  of a ny hypothetical depressive effect of BAT’s stake.  \nContrary to his suggestion, numerous analysts indicated that, prior to BAT’s October \n20 Offer, RAI’s unaffected stock price incorporated some value attributable to a \npossible acquisition by BAT.  (Cameron Dep. Tr. 80:14–81:2; Nowell Dep. Tr. 107:11–\n19; PX0115.0091.)  \n200. A detailed analysis of market efficiency requires an answer to three \nquestions: (i ) “[d]id the . . . stock trade in [an] efficient market?”; ( ii) were “there \nmarket frictions that would cause a disconnect between the company’s publicly traded \nstock price and its fair value?”; and ( iii)  “ was there value -relevant, non -public \ninformation?”  (Zmijewski Tr. 1317:19–1318:8.) \n201. RAI possessed many attributes that courts have found to suggest  that a \nstock trades in an efficient market.  Experts for both sides testified that they had \nidentified no “trading frictions” or other evidence suggesting that RAI’s stock was not \n \n \n \ntrading efficiently.  ( Yilmaz Tr. 1966:18–1967:6; Gompers Tr. 785:9–11, 785 :24–\n786:8.)   \n202. Experts for both sides also agreed that the market for most publicly traded \nstocks on most days is close to semi-strong form efficient, particularly stock for large \ncompanies like RAI.36  (Yilmaz Tr. 1967:7–13; Gompers Tr. 785:3–8.)  Although both \nsides’ experts agreed that the fact a company is widely traded on a national exchange \ndoes not mean it automatically trades in a semi-strong efficient market at any given \npoint, (Gompers Tr. 833:23–834:6; Zmijewski Tr. 1320:17–1321:2), given the evidence \nintroduced by RAI, which was not disputed by Dissenters, there is a sufficient factual \nrecord\n37 for the Court to determine that the market for RAI’s stock was semi -strong \nform efficient:   \na. Until the Merger, RAI was publicly traded in high volum es and with high \nliquidity on the NYSE, the largest stock exchange by market capitalization \nand monthly trading volume in the world.  (JX0017.0003.)   \nb. RAI was a very large company with a market capitalization of \napproximately $67.3 billion on October  20, 2 016.  ( Gompers Tr. 777:25–\n778:10; PX0115.0181.) \n                                                 \n36 A market that is semi-strong form efficient quickly incorporates into the price of a security \nthe release of all new publicly available information.  (Gompers Tr. 833:11–15; Yilmaz Tr. \n1874:18–21.) \n37 RAI did not offer expert testimony to establish that the market for RAI’s stock was semi -\nstrong form efficient, an alleged failure of proof Dissenters suggest precludes the Court from \nfinding market efficiency.  (Defs.’ Resp. Post-Trial Br. 19, ECF No. 231.)  The Court disagrees \nand concludes that expert testimony on market efficiency is not necessary to the Court’s \ndetermination in light of the undisputed evidence of record establishing that the market for \nRAI’s shares was semi-strong efficient at the time of the Merger.  (See Appendix B at § E.) \n \n \n \nc. Information about RAI was both widely available and readily disseminated \nto the market.  (de Gennaro Tr. 215:15–23 (“No indication that the market \nwasn’t absorbing news on a regular basis.”). )  F or most public companies, \n“most of the relevant information is disclosed.”  (Wajnert Tr. 124:4–7.) \nd. RAI’s historical stock price increased and decreased in relation to the \nrelease of new Company -specific information and market -wide trends.   \n(Wajnert Tr. 59:10–60:4; de Gennaro Tr. 215:15–23.) \ne. RAI’s stock was followed by 16 equity analysts, who frequently published \nresearch about the Company.  (PX0063.0010, .0025; de Gennaro Tr. 187:18–\n188:8 ( RAI was “a well -covered company . . . .  A lot of analysts issued \nregular reports.”).) These analysts were well-informed about RAI’s business \nand the U.S. tobacco industry.  (PX0063.0010, .0025; de Gennaro Tr.  \n187:18–188:8, 199:2–19.)   \nf. RAI did not have a controlling shareholder at any time prior to the Merger.  \n(JX0023.0080; Wajnert Tr. 63:18–64:18.) \n203. Dissenters also sought to prove at trial that RAI’s stock price was not a \nreliable indicator of fair value because of the existence of certain material nonpublic \ninformation that was not reflected in the stock price:  (i) the Top-Side Adjustments to \nthe Oc tober 2016 Projections provided to the Financial Advisors , ( ii) the projected \ngrowth rates for years six through ten in the June 2016 LE, and ( iii) the $65 share \nrepurchase authorization ceiling.  ( See Defs.’ Resp. Post -Trial Br. 22–24.)  None of \nthis nonpublic information warrants disregarding RAI’s Unaffected Stock Price as \n \n \n \nevidence of value.  Indeed, Dissenters’ expert, Yilmaz, admitted that he did not have \nan opinion “one way or the other on whether the private information at the company, \non balance, wa s more negative or more positive[.]”   (Yilmaz Tr. 1959:1–12 (“Given \nthat I have not done the work, I [can] not opine on that.”).) \n204. First, the Top-Side Adjustments amounted to an additional $1.4  billion in \nRAI’s income before taxes, or roughly $300 million added to each year of the five-year \nprojections.  (DX240, at tab “top side adj,” row 14; Price Tr. 989:18–990:16.)  As of the \nrecord date of June 12, 2017, RAI had approximately 1.426 billion shares of common \nstock outstanding.  (JX0023.0029.)  Given RAI’s immense size, public disclosure of \nthis additional projected income would not likely have affected the stock price in a \nmeaningful way, and it does not undermine the relevance of the Unaffected  Stock \nPrice as evidence of value.  There is certainly no basis to find that this information \ncould justify the massive premiums to RAI’s Unaffected Stock Price for which \nDissenters advocate.   Further, some of the Top -Side Adjustments were based on \npublic information that had not yet been incorporated into the October 2016 LE, such \nas changes to state tax laws and effects from positive stock market performance.  \n(Price Tr. 957:22–958:6.)   \n205. Next, as discussed previously, t he growth rates in years six through ten of \nthe June 2016 LE were based largely on extrapolations of current volume and pricing \ntrends in the industry, which were publicly available and therefore already likely to \nbe reflected in RAI’s stock price.  (Gilchrist Tr. 375:2–24, 404:9–406:6, 529:12–25.)   \n \n \n \n206. Moreover, and also as previously discussed, RAI management credibly \ntestified—and the documents relating to the ten-year projections confirmed—that the \nprojections for these later years did not account for any of the various serious risks \nfacing the Company.  (DX0023.0002; Gilchrist Tr. 410:8–412:2.)  In particular, they \nwere not intended to be used to value RAI’s shares but only in connection with certain \nlimited planning objectives.  The projected growth rates were not based on any \nunderlying material, value -relevant information  about specific busi ness plans or \nother developments.  They did not constitute the kind of information that, if disclosed, \nwould have meaningfully affected the stock price, and they do not provide any reason \nto believe that the fair value of RAI materially deviated from the U naffected Stock \nPrice.  Dissenters do not contest that RAI was not required to have disclosed these \nprojections.  (Yilmaz Tr. 1959:15–25.) \n207. Finally, the authorization ceiling for the share repurchase approved by the \nBoard is not material, value -relevant information because it was not a valuation of \nRAI.  Rather, as discussed above, it was an internal corporate authorization for a \npurchasing program, which was intentionally set at a price that was higher than \nwhat RAI management ever expected it would need to spend.  (Gilchrist Tr. 414:19–\n415:1.)  Indeed, Zmijewski pointedly declined to testify that the authorization ceiling \nwas value -relevant information even when prompted by counsel.   (Zmijewski Tr. \n1316:10–1317:3.)  \nii. Adjusted Unaffected Stock Price \n208. RAI’s July 24, 2017 stock price is not a relevant proxy for fair value on the \nTransaction Date because after BAT’s announcement of its October  20 Offer, RAI’s \n \n \n \nstock price would have reflected the expected deal price, including expected synergies \ncreated by the Merger, and the market’s view of the likelihood of the deal closing.  \n(Gompers Tr. 790:1–11.)   \n209. In addition, in the time between the October 20 Offer and the Transaction \nDate, events took place that may have affected RAI’s standalone value and been \nreflected in RAI’s stock price had BAT not made its October 20 Offer.  (Gompers Tr. \n790:12–791:12.)  In particular, Donald Trump had been elected President of the \nUnited States, and the Republican Party held a majority in both the Senate and the \nHouse of Rep resentatives.  Both President Trump and Republican congressional \ncandidates had campaigned on a lowered corporate tax rate.  While no formal tax \nplan had been proposed or implemented prior to the Transaction Date , there was \nspeculation that the Republican-led Congress would pass a tax bill that would lower \nthe corporate tax rate and that there would be a more benign regulatory climate for \nthe U.S. tobacco industry.  (PX0115.0185, .0446, .0456; Eckler Dep. Tr. 101:07–102:3.)   \n210. To estimate the effect that these and other market industry developments \nwould likely have had on RAI’s stock price between BAT’s October 20 Offer and the \nclosing of the Merger on July 25, 2017,\n38 Gompers calculated an “Adjusted Unaffected \nStock Price” that  indexed RAI’s Unaffected Stock Price to the performance of its \nclosest competitor, Altria, and to the performance of the S&P 500 generally from \nOctober 20, 2016 through July  24, 2017.  Based on the performance of the S&P 500 \n                                                 \n38 At trial, no evidence was offered of a material, value- relevant event between October 20, \n2016 and July 25, 2017 that affected RAI separately from the tobacco industry or the market \nas a whole. \n \n \n \nTotal Return Index, Gompers calculated that RAI’s unaffected stock price of $47.17 \nwould have grown to $53.78 as of July 24, 2017.  Based on the performance of Altria’s \nstock during that period, Gompers calculated that the implied value of RAI’s stock as \nof July 24, 2017 would be $55.33.  (Gompers Tr. 791:13–792:25; PDX0005.0020.)   \n211. Using either metric, the evidence shows that, while RAI’s stock price may \nhave appreciated to some degree in the time between the October 20 Offer and the \nTransaction Date, RAI’s stock would still have traded 7% to 10% below the deal price \nas of July 24, 2017.  The Court finds Gompers’s  Adjusted Unaffected Stock Price to \nbe persuasive evidence that suggests that the deal price is consistent with, and \nDissenters’ proposed valuation is inconsistent  with, RAI’s fair value  on the \nTransaction Date. \niii. Comparable Companies  \n212. A comparable companies analysis is a valuation technique that involves \ncomparing a company’s valuation multiples to those of its peers.  Often, an enterprise \nvalue to EBITDA multiple is used.  ( Gompers Tr. 770:12–20; de Gennaro Tr. 198:1–\n17.)  Companies with more shared characteristics will be more informative for \nvaluation purposes, but disregarding companies that share important characteristics, \neven if not a perfect twin, would not be cons tructive.  ( Gompers Tr. 771:7–24; de \nGennaro Tr. 329:21–330:16.)   \n213. Two of RAI’s Financial Advisors , Lazard and JPMorgan,  performed \ncomparable companies analyses in their valuation work on behalf of RAI.  \n(PX0115.0258, .0586.)  According to  Lazard’s de Gennaro, there was a “fairly well -\ndefined set of tobacco companies” that provided “informative and relevant” \n \n \n \ninformation for purposes of determining the value of RAI.  (de Gennaro Tr. 198:1–13, \n233:21–234:7.)   \n214. Not all of the tobacco companies identified as comparable to RAI operated \nin the United States or even sold cigarettes.  But  as de Gennaro explained, the goal \nof performing a comparable companies analysis is  not to identify a perfect twin but \nto develop information that would be informa tive for valuation purposes.  ( de \nGennaro Tr. 331:19–332:20, 335:12–337:9; Gompers Tr. 772:16–773:3 (“[C]ertainly \nsome of these are going to provide more information about value than others.”).)  \n215. Lazard and JPMorgan each calculated RAI share values based on the price \nto earnings ratio (the “P/E Ratio”), which compares a company’s stock price to its \nearnings per share, for comparable companies.  JPMorgan ’s range was $32.50 to \n$51.25, and Lazard’s range was $43.08 to $50.68.  (PX0115. 0258, .0582; Clark Tr. \n1439:5–1440:2; de Gennaro Tr.  233:21–234:7.)  Both Financial Advisors also \ncalculated RAI share values based on the enterprise value (“EV”) to EBITDA trading \nmultiple.  JPMorgan’s range was $36.50 to $51.75, and Lazard’s range was $40.86 to \n$49.67.  (PX0115. 0258, .0582; Clark Tr. 1439:5–1440:2; de Gennaro Tr.  233:21–\n234:7.) \n216. One purpose for calculating the multiples of comparable companies is to \ncheck the results of other valuat ion techniques.  ( de Gennaro Tr.  227:19–229:14; \nGompers Tr. 770:21–771:6.)  Gompers also conducted a comparable companies \nanalysis for RAI as part of his review of the reasonableness of the DCF analyses of \n \n \n \nthe Financial Advisors.  In picking his set of comparable companies, he looked in the \ntobacco industry because those companies  \nare going to have similar sets of regulatory risk and use issues and that \nwill help them provide information to the value of RAI.   Certainly the \ncloser a company is in terms of the geography, operating in the U.S., its \nproduct mix in terms of mostly being cigarettes, that will provide more \ninformation.  But to disregard companies that have other characteristics \nwhich are shared with RAI would be inappropriate.  \n(Gompers Tr. 771:7–24.) \n217. Gompers used eight companies in his comparable companies analysis: \nAltria, ITG, ITC Limited, Japan Tobacco, Philip Morris International, Scandinavian \nTobacco Group, Swedish Match AB, and Vector Group.  (PDX0005.0008.)  Lazard and \nJPMorgan both used most of this same group for their analyses as well.  \n(PX0115.0259, .0586.)  Gompers found that Altria was the most informative company \nbecause  \nit’s – you know, it’s the biggest rival of RAI in the U.S.  In fact, it’s the \nmarket leader l arger than RAI.  Its sales are primarily cigarettes.  \nVirtually all of their sales are cigarettes.   And they operate in the U.S.   \nAnd so it has –  you know, it’ s subject to the same regulatory \nenvironment, the same consumer issues and the like.  And so while it’s \nnot a perfect twin, it’s probably the most important as a check of value. \n(Gompers Tr. 773:4–20; PDX0005.0009.)   \n218. Gompers also calculated the multiples for a full set of RAI’s peers.  (Gompers \nTr. 774:10–775:16; PDX0005.0010.)  He applied those multiples to RAI’s EBITDA \nprojections and arrived at the following valuations:  \n \n \n \n Peers’ Mean Peers’ Median Altria \nNext Twelve \nMonths EBITDA $49.70 $46.79 $46.18 \n13-24 Months \nEBITDA $51.76 $48.52 $48.52 \n(Gompers Tr. 776:4–13; PDX0005.0011.) \n219. Zmijewski reviewed market multiple methodologies, including a comparable \ncompanies analysis, and concluded that such an analysis would not result in a \nreliable valuation of RAI.  (Zmijewski Tr.  1287:8–24.)  He testified that a robust \ncomparable company analysis requires review of all determinants of a company’s \nEBITDA multiples: “risk, growth, for EBITDA multiple, working capital \nrequirements, capital expenditure requirements, tax rates, cost structure,  rates of \nreturn, margins, all of those factors drive multiples in one direction or another.”  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1289:3–13.)  Zmijewski  concluded that potential ly comparable \ncompanies that were not located in the United States or did not sell products in the \nUnited States were likely not reliable comparators to RAI due to differences between \nthe U.S. and foreign markets as to  (i) tax rates, (ii) accounting principles, (iii) GDP \ngrowth rates, (iv) inflation rates, (v) regulatory structures, and (vi) competitive  \nlandscapes.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1289:14–1291:15.)  In light of these concerns, Zmijewski \ndetermined that for a company to be comparable  for valuation purposes, it must (i) \ngenerate at least 25% of its revenue in the United States, (ii) sell cigarettes, and (iii) \nfollow U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).  (Zmijewski Tr.  \n1291:16–1292:12.)  \n \n \n \n220. The only company selected by the Financial Advisors and Gompers that met \nZmijewski’s selection criteria  was Altria .  ITG, ITC Limited, and Philip Morris  \nInternational all generated  less than 25% of their revenue in the United States; \nScandinavian Tobacco Group and Swedish Match did not sell cigarettes and did not  \nfollow U.S. GAAP reporting standards.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1291:21–1292:17.)   \n221. Zmijewski opined that where, as here, “you [have] one comparable company, \nthere’s no group.  The comparable company has to be very near a twin, because you \ncannot put it in a distribution somewhere.  You have to use it.  You only have one.  So \nit has to be very, very similar.”  (Zmijewski Tr. 1294:20–1295:7.)  In Zmijewski’s view, \nAltria was not a “near twin” because it had different business lines, including cigars, \nwine, and beer (most importantly, its substantial ownership stake in the brewery AB \nInBev, the manufacturer of Budweiser and other alcoholic products) , and it ha d a \nmuch different growth profile.  (Zmijewski Tr.  1292:18–1294:6.)  H e testified that \nbecause Altria’s growth rates were lower than RAI’s (as reflected in the June 2016 \nLE), “its market multiple is going to be lower [,]” (Zmijewski Tr. 1294:2–5), and that \nalthough RAI had a similar market capitalization to Altria, the two companies ha d \ndifferent revenues, growth rates, and margins and were  therefore not comparable,  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1298:2–24).  Zmijewski concluded that none of the companies selected \nby the Financial Advisors and Gompers, including Altria, was a comparable company \nfor purposes of valuation.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1292:13–17, 1294:1–6.) \n222. While providing persuasive evidence that Altria and the other companies \nselected by the Financial Advisors and Gompers  for their comparable companies \n \n \n \nanalyses were not perfect twins of RAI,39 Zmijewski’s testimony did not establish that \nAltria was wholly irrelevant as a benchmark in the analysis of RAI’s fair value.  To \nthe contrary , there are obvious similarities in many aspects of RAI’s and Altria’s \nbusinesses as the two largest United States cigarette companies, and a comparison \nof the two comp anies provided useful information to the Financial Advisors and \nserved as a helpful market check in performing their work.  \n223. Moreover, in addition to the peer multiples, Gompers calculated the implied \nmultiple based on Zmijewski’s valuation of $92.17 per share.  Zmijewski’s valuation \nimplied a 24x multiple compared to Altria’s multiples of 11.79x (for next 12 months \nEBITDA) and 12.29x (for 13–24 months EBITDA), which if correct would suggest that \nRAI’s “prospects are twice as good as  . . . t he other peer companies in the \nindustry[,]”(Gompers Tr. 777:8 –22), including companies that operate in countries \nwhere “there are almost twice as many smokers . . . than there are in the United \nStates” and where “over 60 percent of men” smoke, (de Gennaro Tr. 334:11–17).  That \nwould be an unrealistic conclusion not supported by the evidence presented at trial  \nand raises significant doubt concerning the reliability of Zmijewski’s valuation.  \n224. Based on the evidence presented, t he Court finds that the comparable \ncompanies analyses performed by RAI’s Financial Advisors and by Gompers provide \n                                                 \n39 Indeed, Gompers acknowledged that (i) Philip Morris International sells cigarettes in \ncountries with vastly different regulatory environments, economies , and smoking \npopulations including Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Japan, \nSweden and Norway, (Gompers Tr. 899:2–8); (ii) ITC Limited is an Indian conglomerate that \nsells a “very high percentage” of its tobacco in India, (Gompers Tr. 899:9–11); and (iii) four of \nthe five other potentially comparable companies are, at best, “weak comparables” to RAI , \n(Gompers Tr. 897:13–898:14).  Peters also testified that “the international players compete \nin a very different market with very different structures.”  (Peters Dep. Tr. 188:20–22). \n \n \n \nrelevant information that, when considered in connection with other valuation \nconcepts and techniques, supports a conclusion that Zmijewski’s $92.17 per share \nvaluation is excessive.  The Court further finds, however, that the many differences \nin the peer group companies compel the Court to give no weight to these analyses in \nassessing the deal price as fair value for RAI’s shares. \niv. Precedent Transactions \n225. A precedent transactions analysis is a valuation technique that is similar to \na comparable companies analysis and involves comparing a company’s multiple to \nthe multiples of the prices paid for selected peer compan ies.  (Gompers Tr. 779:25–\n780:16; de Gennaro Tr. 196:22–197:25; Clark Tr. 1440:3–1441:5.)  The same factors \nthat help determine comparability between the subject company and selected public \ncompanies in a comparable company valuation apply equally to a precedent \ntransactions analysis.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1299:5–15.) \n226. Each Financial Advisor presented a range of RAI share values based on the \nAdvisor’s analysis of comparable precedent transactions. 40  Goldman’s range was \n$38.12 to $59.51,  Lazard’s was $43.03 to $55.69, 41 and JPMorgan’s was $43.00 to \n                                                 \n40 Each Financial Advisor used a slightly different calculation in its precedent transactions \nanalysis.  Goldman used the transaction multiples derived from dividing the EV by the \nEBITDA from the last twelve months (“LTM EBITDA”) , Lazard used the transaction \nmultiples derived from dividing the EV by the adjusted 2016 EBITDA , and JPMorgan used \nthe transaction multiples derived from dividing the implied firm value (“FV”) by the adjusted \nLTM EBITDA.  (PX0115.0258, .0539, .0582.)   \n41  Lazard also calculated the EV/LTM EBITDA multiple implied by the proposed transaction \nwith BAT as 16.9x, significantly higher than the EV/LTM EBITDA multiple for the Lorillard \nTransaction, 13.1x, a transaction which occurred fewer than three years prior.   \n(PX0115.0578, .0585.) \n \n \n \n$60.00.  (PX0115.0258, .0539, .0582; de Gennaro Tr. 233:12–20; Clark Tr. 1440:23–\n1441:5.)  Goldman and Lazard also calculated RAI share values based on the \npremiums paid to the trading prices in precedent transactions.  Goldman’s range was \n$54.25 to $61.32, and Lazard’s range was $56.60 to $63.68.  (PX0115.0539, .0582.)  \n227. As with his comparable companies analysis, Gompers conducted a precedent \ntransactions analysis for RAI as part of his review of the reasonableness of the DCF \nanalyses of the Financial Advisors.  (Gompers Tr. 779:25–780:8.)  He testified that he \nselected his precedent transactions by searching  \nthe Capital IQ database which is just a database of transactions. I \nlooked at all the mergers or acquisitions which were in  the tobacco \nindustry that closed within five years of the transaction here closing.  \nAnd then I restricted it to those that had an enterprise value greater \nthan $500 million. \n(Gompers Tr. 780:17–25.) \n228. Gompers used five precedent transactions:  Japan Tobacc o’s acquisition of \nGryson NV, Japan Tobacco’s acquisition of JT International, ITG’s acquisition of the \nU.S. cigarette brands and other assets of Lorillard and RAI  (“ITG Transaction”), \nRAI’s acquisition of Lorillard, and BAT’s acquisition of Souza Cruz.  (PDX0005.0015; \nGompers Tr. 780:17–781:8; PDX0005.0015.)   Goldman, JPMorgan, and Lazard \nconsidered more precedent transactions than Gompers in their analyses, but each \nincluded a number of the transactions later examined by Gompers.  (PX0115.0260, \n.0542, .0586.) \n229. Gompers determined the multiples from his five precedent transactions, \n(PDX0005.0017), applied th ose multiples and the multiple from the Lorillard \n \n \n \nTransaction alone to RAI’s EBITDA projections , and calculated the followin g \nvaluations:  \n Precedent \nTransactions’ Mean \nPrecedent \nTransactions’ Median \nLorillard \nTransaction \nLast Twelve \nMonths EBITDA $46.46 $41.04 $41.04 \nNext Twelve \nMonths EBITDA $45.80 $41.17 $41.17 \n13–24 Months \nEBITDA $47.19 $42.50 $42.50 \n(Gompers Tr. 783:8–21; PDX0005.0018.) \n230. Dissenters challenged the relevance and applicability of each of the \nprecedent transactions chosen by the Financial Advisors and Gompers.  In particular, \nZmijewski testified that the following selection criteria were appropriate for \ndetermining potential comparable transactions: (i) transactions in the tobacco \nindustry within five years of the Transaction Date, (ii) transactions where the target \nwas a domestic U.S. company, and (iii) transactions where consideration was $1 \nbillion or greater (approximately 2% of the value of the BAT -RAI transaction).  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1300:4–12.)  He found only two transactions that met his three \ncriteria—the Lorillard Transaction and the I TG Transaction, (Zmijewski Tr. \n1302:18–1303:3)—and concluded that neither was comparable enough to the Merger \nto perform a comparable transactions analysis ,42 (Zmijewski Tr. 1307:2–9 (“There \njust aren’t any comparable transactions.  Therefore, you can’t use that analysis.”). \n                                                 \n42 Zmijewski excluded the ITG Transaction because it was a forced sale involving weaker tail \nbrands in contrast to RAI’s strong premium and super -premium brands.  (Zmijewski Tr. \n1303:4–25.)   \n \n \n \n231. Dissenters put particular emphasis on Zmijewski’s rejection of the Lorillard \nTransaction on grounds that RAI had much higher growth prospects at the time of \nthe Merger than it did at the time of the Lorillard Tran saction.  (Zmijewski Tr. \n1304:1–1305:18.)  As Gompers and de Gennaro testified, however, regardless of \ndifferences in the structures of the Lorillard T ransaction and the Merger, the \nLorillard Transaction closed just two years earlier, it involved a U.S. company whose \nbusiness primarily sold cigarettes, and Lorillard’s largest brand was Newport (which \nbecame the largest brand at RAI and which was subject to the same menthol-related \nregulatory risks before and after the Lorillard Transaction).  (Gompers Tr. 781:9–21; \nde Gennaro Tr. 339:18–342:7; Wajnert Tr. 120:6–121:2.)   \n232. While de Gennaro and Gompers agreed that not all of the selected precedent \ntransactions are equally informative, a conclusion with which the Court agrees, 43 as \nwith comparable companies analysis, the goal in performing a precedent transactions \nanalysis is not to identify a perfect or near twin transaction, but to develop \ninformation that would be informa tive and relevant for valuation purposes.  ( de \nGennaro Tr. 337:14–338:1; Gompers Tr. 772:16–773:3; Clark Tr. 1588:23–1589:8.)   \n233. The precedent transactions analysis, particularly as it relates to the \nLorillard Transaction, is informative in considering the value of RAI.  In particular, \nthe deal price was at a higher multiple over RAI’s EBITDA than any other prior \n                                                 \n43 For example, Japan Tobacco’s acquisitions of Gryson NV, a company operating in Belgium, \nand JT International, a company operating in Malaysia, are weak comparable transactions \nto BAT’s acquisition of RAI, a company operating primarily in the United States.  So is BAT’s \nacquisition of Souza Cruz , a company operating primarily in Brazil .  (PDX0005.0015; \nGompers Tr. 780:17–781:8.) \n \n \n \ntransaction involving a U.S. tobacco company that Lazard had analyzed.  (de Gennaro \nTr. 236:6–16; PX0115.0578, .0585.)  This undercuts Dissenters’ contention that BAT \npaid less than fair value for RAI .  Further, although the precedent transactions \nanalysis is of limited value because of the differences in the selected transactions, the \nspecific values generated by the various precedent transactions analyses \ncontemporaneously performed by the Financial Advisors , as well as by Gompers in \nhis analysis, provide support that the deal price of $59.64 was at or above RAI’s fair \nvalue and that Zmijewski’s valuation was clearly excessive. \nv. Analyst Price Targets  \n234. Goldman, Lazard, and JPMorgan each presented a range of equity analyst \nprice targets.  The range found by Goldman was $52 to $62 per share, and the range \nfound by both JPMorgan  and Lazard spanned from $47 to $62 per share .  \n(PX0115.0258, .0539, .0582.)  The $59.64 per share deal price, measured as of January \n16, 2017, was at the upper end of the unaffected analyst price targets for RAI as  a \nstandalone company.  (PX0115.0539.)  Gompers testified that “not a single analyst . . . \nsaid that BAT was getting a steal .”  (Gompers Tr. 803:7–8.)  By contrast, in a \ntransaction that Dissenters identified to try to show that the large disparity between \nRAI’s Unaffected Stock Price  and Zmijewski’s valuation is not unprecedented —the \nleveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in the 1980s —analysts contemporaneously opined \nthat the initial offer for RJR Nabisco was a “lowball bid ” and that in that case , \nmanagement was “trying to steal the company .”  ( Yilmaz Tr. 1997:15–1998:2, \n2000:17–21.)  There was no such concern with BAT’s initial offer for RAI.     \n \n \n \nvi. Mason Capital’s Market Valuation \n235. In November 2016, after BAT made its initial offer but before the final deal \nprice was agreed, Dissenter Mason Capital  sent to the Transaction Committee two \nsubstantially similar letters intended to argue for a higher deal price than BAT was \nthen offering.  (JX0022.0002 –.0004; PX0065.0002–.0005.)  In these letters, Mason \nCapital attempted to identify “ any credible arguments or information that would \nsupport a higher stock price for Reynolds than what the market price reflected or \nwhat was reflected in BAT’s offer[.]”  (Constantino Tr. 1843:21–1844:1; JX0022.0002–\n.0004; PX0065.0002–.0005.)   \n236. Mason Capital incorporated its views into a chart containing a multiples -\nbased valuation of RAI.  (JX0022. 0004; PX0065.0004.)  In its chart, Mason  Capital \nstarted with the last year of earnings for each of RAI ’s separately reported business \nsegments.  For each segment, Mason Capital multiplied the earnings by what Mason \nCapital believed to be a reasonable multiple for that segment.  (JX0022.0004; \nPX0065.0004; Constantino  Tr. 1827:6–1829:1, 1846:18– 23.)  Mason Capital then \nadded several dollars per share to reflect additional points of value that it did not \nbelieve were fully incorporated into the reporting segments’ earnings.  (JX0022.0004; \nPX0065.0004; Constantino Tr. 1827:6–1829:1, 1847:12–1848:5.)  After adding these \nestimates together and subtracting RAI’s net debt and other liabilities, Mason  \nCapital arrived at a “Market Value of Equity” of $54.44 per share.  (JX0022.0004; \nPX0065.0004; Constantino Tr. 1827:6–1829:1, 1848:6–25.) \n237. Mason Capital referred to the Market Value of Equity as a “reasonable \nstarting valuation” for purposes of negotiation wi th BAT, (JX0022.0004; \n \n \n \nPX0065.0004), and Constantino admitted that it was “how we, Mason Capital, think \nthat [RAI ’s] st ock should be valued on its own [,]” (Constantino Tr. 1830:16–17, \n1845:19–22; 1850:8– 1851:7).  She further testified that “in terms of fundamental \nvalue, I think [the $54.44/share] represents what we thought the market would trade \nthe stock at if they had the advantage of kind of being caught up with regard to what \nReynolds owns.”  (Constantino  Tr. 1829:9–16, 1848:19–25 (“Q.  The way the \nvaluation’s constructed, it’s an enterprise value analysis.  And enterprise value \nmeans the value of the enterprise, right?  A.  Yes.”).)   \n238.  Constantino made clear that the $54.44 per share valuation did “not include \nany sort of overhang from BAT’s holdings [,]” (Constantino Tr. 1846:10–17), and did \n“not include any sort of minority discount [,]” (Constantino Tr. 1848:16 –18).  \nMason Capital’s letter to the Transaction Committee is persuasive evidence of Mason \nCapital’s pre-litigation views of RAI’s value.   \n239. The difference between Mason Capital’s contemporaneous $54.44 valuation \nand its litigation valuation of $92.17 cannot be explained by the discovery of \nnonpublic information in the litigation process , including of the June 2016 LE year \nsix- through ten-year projections.  Indeed, as part of asserting its appraisal rights, \nbefore the litigation began and before any discovery was had, Mason Capital provided \na fair value estimate of $88.16 per share.  (Compl . Judicial Appraisal ¶ 47.)  Thus, \nbased on Mason  Capital’s own calculations, the nonpublic information obtained \nthrough discovery could have had, at most, an impact of only $4.01 per share .  \n(Constantino Tr. 1854:19–1856:1.)  The substantial discrepancy in Mason Capital’s \n \n \n \ncontemporaneous and litigation -driven valuations of RAI’s shares undermine the \ncredibility and reliability of the latter. \nb. Discounted Cash Flow Valuations \n240. In addition to thei r market-based valuations, each of the three Financial \nAdvisors conducted an independent DCF analysis.  (PX0115.0261, .0541, .0583; Price \nTr. 1060:8–16; de Gennaro Tr. 217:1–14.)  A DCF valuation requires three steps, each \nof which entails making a number of assumptions: (i) estimating the free cash flows \nthat RAI would have been reasonably expected to earn through a projected number \nof years into the future, (ii) estimating the appropriate perpetuity growth rate \n(“PGR”) after the end of the projection peri od, and (iii) estimating the appropriate \nrate at which to discount the expected future cash flows to the valuation date (the \n“Discount Rate ,” often calculated as a WACC).  (Gompers Tr. 725:12–726:15; \nZmijewski Tr. 1243:18–1244:11.)  The parties do not dispute that a DCF is a reliable \nmethodology, and no evidence was introduced at trial that a DCF is not a “customary \nand current valuation technique.”  N.C.G.S. § 55-13-30(c)(5). \n241. Each of the Financial Advisors conducted an independent D CF analysis.  \n(PX0115.0261, .0541, .0583; Price Tr.  1060:8–16; de Gennaro Tr. 217:1–14.)  They \nused a range of inputs to get a resulting range of DCF valuations, which were used \nto account for the fact that small changes to the DCF inputs, like the WACC or PGR, \nwould lead to significant variations in the Company’s value.  (PX0115.0261, .0541, \n.0583; de Gennaro Tr. 203:13–19, 229:15–230:6; Clark Tr. 1441:9–21; Eckler Dep. Tr. \n48:24–15, 79:19–80:18, 108:17–18.)  \n \n \n \n242. While a company’s WACC and its PGR are calculat ed separately, these \ninputs must be scrutinized to ensure that, when incorporated into a DCF, the results \nare not “untethered to reality .”  ( de Gennaro Tr.  360:5–361:1 (“[T]here is an \ninterrelationship between the inputs, and . . . we don’t have a perfect view of the \nfuture so we’re applying a judgment.”).)  Therefore, inputs to a DCF analysis must be \nanalyzed together to determine reasonableness.  As  de Gennaro testified, the inputs \n“[a]re part and parcel.  You can’t just look at one assumption in isolatio n.”  ( de \nGennaro Tr. 328:10–329:4, 325:22–327:1.)     \n243. In the presentation made with its Fairness Opinion, Goldman’s DCF yielded \na range of $45.16 to $72.17 and a midpoint of $55.74 .  (PX0115.0541.)  JPMorgan’s \nDCF led to a range of $47.54 to $68.63 and a midpoint of $56.26.  (PX0115.0261; Clark \nTr. 1441:6–12.)  Lazard’s DCF led to a range of $50.03 to $73.38 and a midpoint of \n$59.59.  (PX0115.0583; de Gennaro Tr. 232:19–233:2.)  Gompers testified that, after \nanalyzing and evaluating the inputs of the Financial Advisors ’ DCF analyses, he \nconcluded that the results are “reasonable in this context ,” even though he believed \n“their valuations are optimistic because of the projections they used .”  (Gompers Tr. \n767:5–20 (“[T]hose five -year projections don’t take into account the possibility that \neven over the next five years, one of those negative events or more may occur.”).)  \n244. Financial projections used in a DCF analysis must be probability-weighted, \nor risk-adjusted, to reflect the expected value of the fut ure cash flows  because, as \nGompers testified, “[i]f you don’t have . . . expected cash flows, you’re not going to get \nto that intrinsic or fundamental value .”  (Gompers Tr. 726:16–729:23 (noting the \n \n \n \n“value when you do a DCF is wholly dependent, entirely dependent on using the \nexpected cash flows, not the best case or upside scenarios”) ; Zmijewski Tr. 1243:18–\n1244:11; Yilmaz Tr. 1964:1–1965:23 (“Q.  And what you need are the expected cash \nflows of the company; right?  A.  That’s correct.  Q.  You’re not look ing for the best \ncase or the worst case; right?  A. . . .  Yes, I am looking for the expected one, not the \nbest-case scenario.”).)   \n245. RAI’s regular financial projection process was not intended to create a \nprobability-weighted value of future cash flows, bu t instead expressly assumed that \ncurrent industry trends and dynamics would continue without substantial change.  \n(JX0009.0001–.0002; PX0047.0002; JX0010.0006; PX0052.0004,  .0006; Gilchrist Tr. \n380:21–391:09 (“Q.  And were these various sensitivities actually modeled into the \nnumbers themselves?  A.  No, they were not.  So this was really intended to show that \nthere is a sensitivity to this and these things could happen.”).)   \n246. As Crew testified, projections that are developed for valuation purposes are \ndifferent from the projections that RAI used to operate on a day-to-day basis.  (Crew \nTr. 711:10–13.)  Specifically, Crew testified that she would not want to use RAI’s ten-\nyear projections for valuation purposes because in a valuation \nthe unknowable, the unquantifiable, you have to somehow figure that \ninto your thinking as a board.  So you can’t just look at these number s \nand say nothing’s ever going to change.  You have to look at the t otal \npicture.   \n(Crew Tr. 705:22–706:5.)  She further explained that the projections for a valuation \nhave to be considered  \n \n \n \nin the context of all of the risks and the potential upsides.  So you have \nto look at it all.  So you can’t just lift this and say, oh, this is w hat the \ncompany’s worth.  No, you’ve got to look at a total context. . . .  Which is \nvery difficult in tobacco.  \n(Crew Tr. 706:9–17; Gompers Tr. 732:24–733:7, 733:20–734:18 (“[I]t’s not only what \nI teach, it’s what I’ve advised when I’ve been on the board that you can have \nprojections for business purposes, but the evaluation for valuation purposes could be \nsubstantially different.”).) \n247. The Financial Advisors  used the October 2016 Projections in their DCF \ncalculations.  As described in deta il above, those projections  were based on the \nOctober 2016 LE, which was developed as part of RAI’s regular financial projection \nprocess, including assumptions concerning, among other things, a “continuation of \nrecent cigarette industry pricing dynamics [,]” “moderate share growth [,]” a “stable \nregulatory environment[,]” and no litigation risk.  (JX0023.0134; JX0010.0004, .0006; \nGilchrist Tr. 382:09–391:09; Gompers; 730:10–731:17 (“The projections were business \nas usual, but they were very clear at saying that these risks were out there and were \nreal probabilities occurring.”).) \n248. Zmijewski used the July 2017 LE as the basis for his DCF valuation.  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1246:13–1247:8.)  Flyer  used the June 2017 LE as a set of ten -year \nprojections to calculate a perpetuity growth rate.  (Flyer Tr. 1075:3–1076:6.)  Like the \nOctober 2016 Projections, the June 2017 LE and the projections therein  came out of \nRAI’s regular financial projection process and assumed  “business as usual” without \naccounting for major “downside risks .”  (Gompers Tr. 730:10–731:17; JX0009.0001–\n.0002; PX0047.0002; JX0010.0006; PX0052.0004, .0006; Gilchrist Tr. 380:21–391:09.) \n \n \n \n249. Although Dissenters suggested at trial that the projections used by the \nFinancial Advisors were viewed as “out of date” by April 2017 based on a set of BAT \ntalking points sent to Price , the forecasts were not out of date for the Financial \nAdvisors’ purposes \nbecause that’s valuing the company as a stand-alone entity.  This [BAT \ndocument] is looking at the entity as a combined entity g oing forward.  \nAnd I think they’re talking into their shareholders . . . that don’t expect \nthe results that we show for Reynolds American to be the exact same as \nwhat’s in the forecast because there are these things . . . that didn’t occur \nthat we would have done in the ordinary course of business, but we did \nnot do because the transaction was being contemplated. \n(Price Tr. 1044:9–1047:19; DX0056.0003.)  In fact, the evidence indicates that, for the \nperiods that overlapped, the October 2016 Projections were a bit more optimistic than \nthe July 2017 LE relied on by Zmijewski .  (Zmijewski Tr. 1370:17–1372:7 (“Q.  In \nbetween . . . November of ‘16 . . . [and] June 2017 . . . , did the company’s outlook for \nthose five years improve or did it worsen?  A.  It’s about the same without the \nmanagement overlays.  So probably a little lower, but about the same.”).  C ompare \nDX0240, at tab “Top Side Summary,” with DX0141, at tab “Consol Fcst.”) \n250. The Financial Advisors understood that RAI included certain assumptions \nin its ordinary course financial projections and that these projections were subject to \nspecifically identified sensitivities that were not reflected in the numerical forecasts.  \nThese sensitivities include d major competitive, regulatory, litigation , or other \nexogenous shocks.  (JX0010.0003–.0004, .0006; JX0023.0134.)   \n251. As Clark testified, JPMorgan’s understanding was that there were \n“significantly larger downsides to the financial forecasts than there were upsides .”  \n(Clark Tr. 1435:6–8.)  Gompers  likewise noted that RAI was susceptible to a \n \n \n \n“tremendous number of game changing downside risks .”  ( Gompers Tr. 730:10–\n731:17.)  For these reasons, the RAI Board and management recognized that the \nprojections were optimistic and biased upwards.  ( Wajnert Tr. 49:8–11; Price  Tr. \n984:20–24; Gompers Tr. 734:19–735:7.)  Gompers agreed, noting that the projections \nwere “more like an upside case” rather than “the expected value case.”  (Gompers Tr. \n729:24–730:9.) \n252. At trial, Zmijewski  disagreed with this characterization of RAI’s financial \nprojections.  He noted that the downside ri sks faced by RAI are largely unknowable \nin their scope, unpredictable in their timing , and unquantifiable in their impact to \nRAI.  He therefore used the management projections as if they were a set of expected \ncash flows.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1255:1–1259:21 (“But uncertainty doesn’t in any way \neliminate the validity of having expected cash flow.  Expected cash flows are based \non uncertain forecasts.”).)   \n253. Zmijewski explained that RAI “had experience forecasting and they do that \non a regular basis.  As you see, t hey forecast annually a ten- year forecast and then \nthey have an operating plan once a year, and then they update those forecasts every \nmonth.  So they pay a lot of attention to the forecasts [.]”  (Zmijewski Tr.  1251:22–\n1252:8.)  As a result, Zmijewski dete rmined that management’s projections were a \nreliable estimate of RAI cash flows because they were bottoms-up estimate forecasts \ncreated in the ordinary course of business.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1251:4–21.)  \n254. Zmijewski’s approach disregards the expressly stated as sumptions and \nsensitivities to RAI’s financial projections.  While these assumptions and sensitives \n \n \n \nwere not incorporated into the numerical projections that RAI developed and used in \nthe ordinary course of business, that does not mean that they can be ign ored when \nvaluing the Company.  The evidence indicates that if one or more of these risks were \nto materialize, it would have a dramatic , negative effect on the Company’s growth \nand profitability.  A valuation predicated upon the theory that a tobacco company like \nRAI will suffer no  significant adverse regulatory, tax , or competitive effects in the \nfuture is simply not credible or reliable.   \n255. In defending his view that the management forecasts did not have an \nupward bias, Zmijewski  testified tha t “as long as  the upside and downside, after \nadjusting for the timing, the amount, and the probability, i[f] they offset each other, \nthe forecasts that we’re using in the management forecasts are exactly the right \nforecasts to use .”  ( Zmijewski Tr. 1258:19–23 (emphasis added).)  But the evidence \nwas clear that the upside and the downside to the management forecasts do not \n“offset each other,” because the downside was much more serious, meaning that the \nforecasts are more optimistic than the expected cash flows. \n256. Dissenters also contended that RAI’s Financial Advisors ’ DCF valuations \nwere too low because the October 2016 Projections contained five years, and not ten \nyears, of projections.  First, a s discussed previously, t here is no evidence to support \nDissenters’ contention that RAI deliberately withheld ten-year projections to drive a \nlower valuation within BAT’s price range.  (See supra § II(E)(d)(vi)).  Moreover, each \nFinancial Advisor testified unequivocally that the information it received from RAI \nmanagement, including the five -year October 2016 Projections, was entirely \n \n \n \nsufficient to adequately and competently perform the Advisor’s valuation analysis.  \n(Eckler Dep. Tr. 61:3–12; de Gennaro Tr. 352:8–13; Clark Tr. 1597:12–16.)   \n257. To support its conte ntion that five -year projections were inadequate, \nDissenters introduced evidence that (i)  Lazard, in its work on the Lorillard \nTransaction, was provided with ten -year projections, ( DX0148.0009–.0010; de \nGennaro Tr. 260:20–262:9); (ii) prior to receiving the October 2016 Projections, junior \nmembers of the Lazard deal team were unsure whether the projections they received \nwould contain five or ten years, ( DX0157.0001; de Gennaro Tr. 280:17–281:14); and \n(iii) a junior member of the JPMorgan deal team emailed RAI’s Holland asking for a \ndetailed ten-year projection, (DX0067.0001; Clark Tr. 1518:1–21).   \n258. This evidence, however, does not warrant a conclusion that the Financial \nAdvisors’ use of five -year projections was unreasonable; it indicate s only that the \nFinancial Advisors considered whether ten years of projections were available.  The \nevidence shows that when BAT’s offer arrived in October 2016, RAI did not have up-\nto-date ten-year projections and provided the Financial Advisors with the most recent \nset of projections the Company had completed, which were the five -year projections \nin the October 2016 LE.  The Financial Advisors  wanted the most recent set of \nprojections rather than projections from June 2016 that had already been revised four \ntimes.  (Clark Tr. 1519:1–11.)  Despite Dissenters’ arguments to the contrary , the \nrecord is clear that the Financial Advisors received all the information they believed \nthey needed for their work.   \n \n \n \n259. Moreover, the evidence shows that RAI management was actually \nadvocating for a higher  valuation and the highest possible purchase price for the \nCompany.  ( Price Tr. 1054:23–1055:4, 1055:11–14.)  For example, in October 2016, \nbefore providing its most recent projections to the Financial Advisors , RAI \nmanagement added the Top-Side Adjustments that served to increase projected pre-\ntax income by approximately $300 million per year.  (DX0240, at tab “Top Side \nSummary”; Price Tr. 990:10–16.)   \n260. In response to this evidence, Dissenters asked questions suggesting that the \n$1.4 billion increase attributable to the Top-Side Adjustments was “swamp[ed]” by a \n$3 billion planned share repurchase program, (Price Tr. 1055:15 –16), but that \nsuggestion is not  supported by the evidence , (DX0075.0001; Price Tr. 1021:14–\n1022:1).  As Price testified, the cash used for a share repurchase program is a non -\noperating expense and does not affect the cash flow figures used in a DCF analysis.  \n(Price Tr. 1055:5–17.)   \n261. Further, when negotiations between RAI and BAT had reached an impasse \nin December 2016, RAI management assisted the Financial Advisors  in providing \ninformation to BAT intended to support a higher valuation than BAT’s models \nshowed.  Indeed, at the Transactio n Committee’s behest, Goldman and JPMorgan \nattempted to convince BAT to pay a higher price by showing that BAT’s financial \nmodel was flawed, and that updating BAT’s valuation model with proper inputs \nwould demonstrate that a higher price would still be accretive for BAT.  \n(DX0057.0002; Price Tr. 1034:20–1035:12, 1060:17–25.)  These types of actions are \n \n \n \ninconsistent with Dissenters’ allegations of a concerted effort by RAI management to \nmislead the Financial Advisors into undervaluing RAI.  ( Price Tr. 1034:20–1035:12,  \n1060:17–25; DX0057.0002.)  \n262. Based on the evidence, the Financial Advisors ’ use of the October 2016 \nProjections as an input in their DCF calculations was reasonable.  These projections \nwere RAI’s most current financial projections at the time, and RAI management \nsupplemented those projections with a wealth of additional information for the \nFinancial Advisors’ consideration, including the financial presentation from the 2016 \nStrategy Day with ten years of operating income and growth rates.   \ni. Perpetuity Growth Rates \n263. A PGR is the rate at which a company’s expected free cash flows are \nassumed to grow indefini tely after the period for which there are year -by-year \nforecasts.  (Gompers Tr. 742:17–743:4.)  In a typical industry, a company is often \nassumed to have a PGR between the rate of inflation and the rate of nominal GDP \ngrowth.  ( Gompers Tr. 743:15–744:6; de Gennaro Tr. 368:15–369:6.)  Where an \nindustry is expected to decline in the future,  however, a PGR below the rate of \ninflation may be appropriate; it is not unusual to see a zero or negative PGR used for \ncompanies or industries that are in structural decl ine, like the tobacco industry.  \n(Gompers Tr. 744:7–23, 746:4–5; Crew Tr. 640:21–641:10; de Gennaro Tr. 204:3–25, \n326:6–13, 368:17–369:6; Clark Tr. 1446:1–12.) \n264. The Financial Advisors  used the following PGR ranges  in their DCF \nanalyses:  Goldma n, negative 0.50% to positive 0.50% , (PX0115.0541); JPMorgan , \n \n \n \n0.00% to positive 1.00%, (PX0115.0261; Clark Tr. 1445:1–6); Lazard, negative 0.50% \nto positive 0.50%, (PX0115.0583; de Gennaro Tr. 227:7–18).   \n265. In the Financial Advisors’ DCF analyses, the vast majority of the total value \nof RAI was comprised by the terminal value, i.e., the value attributable to the period \nof time after the explicit year-by-year forecasts, which requires carefully considering \nthe appropriate PGR “ because it is the most critical factor in terms of determining \nthe value of RAI .”  ( Gompers Tr. 757:24–758:20; Clark Tr. 1441:22–1442:2; de \nGennaro Tr. 227:19–229:14, 311:19– 312:22, 349:16– 351:3; Zmijewski Tr. 1282:19–\n1283:20.)   \n266. The Financial Advisors’ PGR ranges were based on research into, and their \nown experience and knowledge regarding, the tobacco industry and RAI’s competitive \nposition within the industry , including their understanding of the threats and \npotential upsides facing the Company and tobacco companies generally.  (de Gennaro \nTr. 203:5–12, 204:3 –25, 225:8 –18; Clark Tr. 1445:7–25; Eckler Dep. Tr. 64:1–24, \n65:15–24, 66:20–67:06.)   \n267. The Advisors also considered ( i) growth rates used for other tobacco \ntransactions, including the 2015 Lorillard Transaction , (ii) industry analysts’ views \nregarding appropriate growth rates for a tobacco company, and (iii) the concern that \nincreased prices would not be able to offset increasing volume declines in the longer \nterm.  (DX0068.0003; Clark Tr. 1445:7–17; Eckler Dep. Tr. 80:11–81:02; de Gennaro \nTr. 224:10–225:7, 300:12–23.)  Gompers identified the same factors in his analysis of \n \n \n \nthe Financial Advisors’ PGR ranges as evidence supporting their reasona bleness.  \n(Gompers Tr. 746:8–747:2, 879:15–24.)   \n268. In order to test their perpetuity growth rates, the Financial Advisors  \nchecked their analyses using terminal exit multiples, among other things, as a “sanity \ncheck.”  (Clark Tr. 1441:22–1442:2, 1445:18–25, 1448:2–23; de Gennaro Tr. 204:3–25, \n227:19–229:14, 300:12–23, 311:19–312:22, 365:5–366:6; Eckler Dep. Tr. 78:22–79:18, \n79:19–80:10, 84:11–85:02.)  A terminal exit multiple is the portion of the DCF value \nthat resides in the period after the end of the year -by-year projections, i.e., the ratio \nof earnings in the last year of the projection period to the terminal value .  The \nterminal exit multiple is  a measure of the company’s growth rate in the terminal \nperiod and can be compared to a company’s current multiple to check the \nreasonableness of the terminal period assumptions.  (Gompers Tr. 752:1–753:16.)  In \ngeneral, a company’s terminal exit multiple should be near  but below the company’s \ncurrent multiple because “looking forward, you would expect the growth rate off into \nthe future five years from now will be lower than the growth rate today .”  (Gompers \nTr. 753:12–757:23.)  \n269. Gompers opined that the Fin ancial Advisors’ PGR ranges were reasonable \nbased on his own analysis, which was the same analysis that he would have \nperformed had he conducted his own DCF analysis.  (Gompers Tr. 745:5–12.)  Just as \nthe Financial Advisors  had done, Gompers  checked the Financial Advisors ’ PGR \nranges against RAI’s implied terminal exit multiple and found that the choice of \nPGRs was reasonable, in particular because they were lower than RAI’s multiple at \n \n \n \nthe time of BAT’s October 20 O ffer.  ( Gompers Tr. 753:12–757:23; PDX0005.0007.)  \nSpecifically, he identified RAI’s pre-Merger trading multiple as 12.4x, and found that \nthe Financial Advisors’ implied terminal exit multiples ranged from 10.5x to 11.5x.  \n(PDX0005.0007; Gompers Tr. 753:19–755:16.)  Gompers , as det ailed above,  also \nperformed a comparable companies analysis and precedent transactions analysis that \nconfirmed the reasonableness of the Financial Advisors’ PGRs.  (Gompers Tr. 770:7–\n11, 779:25–780:8.)   \n270. Lazard used the same PGR range in its work on behalf of RAI in the \nLorillard Transaction, even though RAI was the seller in the Merger and had been \nthe purchaser in the Lorillard T ransaction.  (de Gennaro Tr. 225:8–18.)  Dissenters \ncontended that it was in appropriate for Lazard to use the same PGR for both \ntransactions because the Lorillard Transaction was “transformative[,]” (Gilchrist Tr. \n494:4–7), and a “fundamental change[,]” (de Gennaro Tr. 305:1–16), that resulted in \na “new and improved [ RAI,]” (de Ge nnaro Tr. 365:5– 366:6).  But as d e Gennaro \ntestified, Lazard’s work on the Lorillard Transaction included a valuation of the pro \nforma combined “new and improved” RAI —the exact same company that was then \nsold to BAT—meaning that any “fundamental change” ha d already been considered \nin the va luation performed for the Lorillard T ransaction.  ( de Gennaro Tr. 239:20–\n240:6; DX0393.0147–.0148.)   \n271. Moreover, de Gennaro explained that a component of the PGR range was \ntrends in the U.S. tobacco landscape, and that there had been no significant changes \nsince Lazard’s initial analysis.  ( PX0115.0583; de Gennaro Tr. 225:8–12.)  Lazard’s \n \n \n \nPGRs were based on a long -term view of  the prospects of the Company  and the \nindustry rather than the specifics of a few nearer- term years.  (de Gennaro Tr. \n303:20–307:18.)  After performing reasonableness checks on its DCF results, Lazard \ndetermined that “there was nothing suggesting that it w as an unreasonable set of \nassumptions[,]” (de Gennaro Tr. 311:19–312:22), and that there was “no reason to be \nuncomfortable with the perpetual growth rate” because “all the trends were the same \nin terms of volume declines.”  (de Gennaro Tr. 307:11–18.) \n272. Dissenters also suggested that the Financial Advisors ’ PGRs were too low \nbecause they were applied after five years of projections instead of t en years.  \n(DX0068.0001–.0003; Clark Tr. 1529:15–1530:12; Eckler Dep. Tr. 67:16–20; 67:23–\n68:5.)  In support, Dissenters cite an internal JPMorgan email in which the JPMorgan \ndeal team discusses the appropriateness of different ranges of PGRs.  (DX0068.0002–\n.0003.)  The evidence suggests, however, that JPMorgan  used a higher PGR than it \notherwise would ha ve used if it  had begun applying the PGR after ten years of \nprojections.  JPMorgan’s contemporaneous documents reveal, and Clark consistently \ntestified, that JPMorgan discussed internally changing the range of PGRs  to a \nnegative range if given an up-to-date set of ten-year projections: \nQ.  And why would you have used lower growth rates if you had ten-year \nprojections than growth rates you had used after the five years of \nprojections?  \n \nA.  Because our anticipation was that there would be, you know, some \ngrowth – continued growth at the company in years six through ten and \nthus, to account for that, in the context of the five years of projections \nthat we did have, we used a slightly higher range of perpetuity growth \nrates relative to if we had ten years worth  of projections, and then had \naccounted for that potentially higher growth in years six through ten.  \n \n \n \nWe would have married that with a view that the industry would \ncontinue to decline following that point in time at a likely negative rate. \n(Clark Tr. 1446:17–1448:1; DX0068.0002– .0003.)  As noted above, JPMorgan \nultimately determined that a detailed set of ten -year projections was not necessary \nto perform its valuation work.  (Clark Tr. 1432:23–1433:3.) \n273. Dissenters have suggested that the PGR ranges use d by the Financial \nAdvisors amounted to an assumption that RAI’s business would “fall off a cliff after \nfive years of sustained year after year growth[.]”  (Sadighi Tr. 28:9–12.)  But a growth \nrate below inflation does not mean that RAI would stop being profitable or soon cease \nto exist.  Rather, because RAI had such high cash free cas h flows, it would continue \nfar into the future even with a growth rate below inflation.  As Eckler explained,  \nSo the free cash flow EBITDA would have been $9 billion,  so with $9 \nbillion of free cash flow and very little leverage, I can’t think of a single \ninstance of a company that ’s not viable.  So the judgment was that $9 \nbillion would continue into perpetuity. \n(Eckler Dep. Tr. 81:3–5, 81:7–82:8.) \n274. Further, as Gompers testified, Dissenters’ view is a “mischaracterization of \nwhat a zero percent growth rate means.”  (Gompers Tr. 747:18–22.)  In the Financial \nAdvisors’ DCF models, RAI’s growth does not necessarily stop cold right after the \nprojection period.  (Eckler Dep. Tr. 67:18–68:05; Gompers Tr. 747:18–749:17, 750:14–\n751:2.)  A PGR “averages over the time with maybe some positive and then negative \nin the future and averages across scenarios some of which may be very large negative \nevents that happen.”  (Gompers Tr. 749:13–17.)  Thus, a company with a 0% growth \nrate could continu e to see positive growth for some time, which would then be \nbalanced out by negative growth and/or by the possibility of a major adverse event.   \n \n \n \n275. Compared to the PGR ranges used by RAI’s Financial Advisors in their DCF \nanalyses, the 2.24% PGR that Zmijewski incorporates into his DCF analysis is \nsubstantially higher.  Dissenters’ PGR was calculated as follows:  Flyer first \ndetermined that a 1% or  1.25% PGR was appropri ate to use after 2026.  ( Flyer \nTr. 1075:14–122.)  In support of his 1% PGR conclusion, Flyer pointed to JPMorgan’s \nuse of 1.0% as the upper bound of its PGR range and to RAI’s use of a 3% PGR in its \nstock repurchase plan.  (Flyer Tr. 1129:1–17.)  Flyer was asked by Dissenters’ counsel \nto use a 1% or 1.25% PGR in conjunction with the growth rates  extracted from the \nlast five years of the June 2017 LE to calculate a “blended” PGR to be applied starting \nin 2023. 44  ( Flyer Tr. 1078:9–11.)  This blended rate is simply a mathematical \ncalculation in which Flyer converted his 1.0% PGR and the growth rates for the years \ncovered by the June 2017 LE into a single flat rate.  ( Flyer Tr. 1078:23–1079:19.)  \nThe result is a blended PGR of 2.24% or 2.42%.  (Flyer Tr. 1075:3–1076:6.)   \n276. In his DCF analysis, Zmijewski  chose to use Flyer ’s 2.24% blended PGR.  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1244:7–9.)  No testimony was offered as to why he chose the lower of \nFlyer’s blended PGRs, and Zmijewski testified that he had not tested what the results \nof his DCF analysis would have been had he used Flyer ’s higher 2.42% blended \ngrowth rate.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1363:1–10.)   \n                                                 \n44 Flyer ran the calculations for 1% and 1.25% PGR after 2026 but focused the bulk of his \ntrial testimony on explaining the reasonableness of a 1% PGR after 2026.  (Flyer Tr. 1079:7–\n1079:19.)   \n \n \n \n277. Zmijewski testified that he had “no opinion on growth rates for this \ncompany[,]” (Zmijewski Tr. 1379:17–18), and that  he did not calculate a PGR to use \nin his DCF analysis because \nafter I was engaged in this matter and I started working on this \nparticular compa ny, I realized this company isn’ t your standard \nconsumer products company.  This is a company that[ ] . . . has a highly \nconcentrated industry, you quickly discover volumes are decreasing, but \nrevenues are going up.  So you know prices are increasing at a faster \nrate than volumes are decreasing.  So this is not your standard industry.  \nSomebody with good expertise needs to figure out how all of that pulls \ntogether to think about a long -run forecast.  You need industry \nexpertise.  I don’t have that expertise. \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1264:1–11.)  Instead, Zmijewski relied entirely on the PGR calculated \nby Flyer, even though the vast majority of Zmijewski’s valuation is dependent on the \nPGR that was used.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1362:21–1363:2.)  For example, simply changing \nthe PGR from 2.2% to  0%, the midpoint of Goldman and Lazard’s PGR ranges, in \nZmijewski’s DCF analysis decreased his valuation from $92.17 to $58 .00 per share.  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1396:2–9.)  Incorporating the range of PGRs used by the Financial \nAdvisors (negative 0.5% to positive 1.0%) into Zmijewski’s analysis results in a range \nof valuations of $53.62 to $69.56.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1396:10–1398:13.) \n278. In calculating his PGR, Flyer did not incorporate into his analysis the effects \nor the likelihood of adverse regulation on menthol cigarettes, concluding that he \n“didn’t see any reason why [the June 2017 LE projections] were biased.”   (Flyer Tr. \n1195:18–1196:1.)  For reasons stated above, it is not credible for a valuation of RAI to \nassume that a menthol ban is impossible or that such a ban would have no effect on \nRAI’s future cash flows.   \n \n \n \n279. Flyer also test ified that he “explicitly estimated the 1  percent for \ncombustibles [i.e. , cigarettes]” and yet admitted that combustibles “may be 15, 20 \npercent of the business” in 2026, as compared to approximately 90% at the time of \nthe Merger.  (Flyer Tr. 1207:9–23.)  Any scenario in which such a set of circumstances \nwould obtain is exceedingly unlikely.  If combustibles were to drop that dramatically \nin the years leading up to 2026, there is no reason to believe they would then grow at \n1.0% in perpetuity thereafter. \n280. Flyer further testified  that it was inappropriate to calculate a PGR of 0% \nafter 2021 (five years), as the Financial Advisors did, when the Company projected \nrobust growth through 2026.  (Flyer Tr.  1121:18–23.)  Flyer’s PGR analysis ignores, \nhowever, the substantial evidence showing that these ten -year projections were not \nintended to create a probability -weighted value of future cash flows, disregarded \nsignificant assumptions and sensitivities that could dramatically impact RAI’s \nbusiness, and were largely extrapolations of current industry trends and dynamics \nwithout substantial change.   And Flyer ignores that a 0% PGR can represent \ncontinued but slowing growth for a period followed by a plateau and then negative \ngrowth in the future to balance out the positive growth in the earlier years.  (Gompers \nTr. 749:13–17.) \n281. Just as Gompers  checked the reasonableness of the PGRs used by RAI’s \nFinancial Advisors , he also checked the reasonableness of the PGR used in \nZmijewski’s DCF valu ation by calculating its implied terminal exit multiple .  \nGompers calculated Zmijewski’s implied terminal exit multiple to be 17.7x, which \n \n \n \nwas significantly higher than the Financial Advisors’ terminal exit multiples and also \nsignificantly higher than RAI’ s multiple  of 12.4x  at the time of BAT’s October 20 \nOffer.  (PDX0005.0007; Gompers Tr. 753:23–757:23.)  Zmijewski’s 17.7x terminal exit \nmultiple means that under his valuation, RAI would be growing at a faster rate five \nyears into the future than at the present time —an unreasonable expectation given \nthat tobacco is an industry in “structural decline.”  (Crew Tr. 640:21–641:10; Gompers \nTr. 756:19–757:23.) \n282. Based on its review of the evidence, the Court finds the PGR ranges used by \nthe Financial Advisors to be reasonable and reliable, and the PGRs calculated by \nFlyer and used by Zmijewski to be unreasonable and unreliable.  \nii. Discount Rate/WACC \n283. A discount rate is a rate of return used to discount future cash flows back to \npresent value.  It is intended to capture the level of risk associated with a stream of \ncash flows in the context of the market as a whole.  (Gompers Tr. 726:10–15.)  A lower \ndiscount rate will lead to a higher present value of a company.  (Clark Tr. 1444:21–\n25.)   \n284. Both sides used a WACC for purposes of discounting RAI’s future cash flows.  \nA WACC is based primarily on the cost of the company’s debt, the cost of its equity, \nthe relative percentages of debt and equity in its capital structure, the volatility of \nthe company’s common stock, an appropriate risk premium , and the applicable tax \nrate.  (PX0115.0278; PX0115.0562; PX0115.0627.)   \n285. There is very little disagreement between the WACC calculations performed \nby Gompers, Zmijewski, and the Financial Advisors .  The Financial Advisors  used \n \n \n \nthe following discount rate ranges: Goldm an, 5.00% to 6.50% (PX0115. 0541); \nJPMorgan, 5.75% to 6.75% (PX0115.0261; Clark Tr. 1444:13–17); and Lazard, 5.00% \nto 6.00% (PX0115.0583; de Gennaro Tr. 226:7–10).  Similarly, Gompers calculated the \nWACC for RAI as of July  25, 2017 at 5.78% , (Gompers Tr. 761:11–762:4), and \nZmijewski calculated the WACC for RAI as of July  25, 2017 at 5.7%, (Zmijewski Tr. \n1243:18–1244:11, 1267:23–1268:22). \n286. Gompers’s and Zmijewski’s WACC calculations resulted in only a 2% to 3% \ndifference in valuation.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1268:7–22; Gompers Tr. 761:22–762:3.)  The \nprimary source of disagreement between the  two experts concerned whether to use \nthe promised yield or the expected yield when calculating RAI’s cost of debt.  \nGompers’s use of promised yield has greater evidentiary support because the cash \nflows used in the DCF analyses were  not risk-adjusted and therefore were not truly \nexpected cash flows, (Gompers Tr. 763:18–764:5), and Zmijewski’s use of the expected \nyield was prone to error because he estimat ed the expected yield by referring to a \nportfolio of similarly rated debt rather than by using the actual terms of RAI’s debt \ninstruments, (Gompers Tr. 764:6–11).  \niii. 2016 Share Repurchase Program \n287. On occasions prior to BAT’s October 20 Offer , members of RAI’s finance or \naccounting teams performed DCF calculations of RAI.  In the ordinary course of \nbusiness, RAI would, as an initial matter, use an 8% WACC.  (PX0047.0002; Gilchrist \nTr. 422:14–424:2.)  This 8% WACC was “risk-adjusted” and used for purposes such as \nevaluating capital expenses.  ( Gilchrist Tr. 423:15–424:2.)  When analyzing riskier \npotential expenses, RAI would increase the WACC, and for safer investments , it \n \n \n \nwould decrease the WACC.  Gompers opined that this type of WACC calculation was \nnot a market-derived cost of capital and was improper when conducting a valuation.  \n(Gompers Tr. 760:23–763:6; PX0047.0002.)  \n288. In June 2016, members of RAI’s accounting team performed a DCF \ncalculation in connection with identifying the proposed authorization ceiling fo r the \nplanned share repurchase program.  (See supra § II(E)(e).)  Initially, RAI ran a range \nof DCFs with a wide variety of discount rates and PGRs, amounting to 30 total \nscenarios and valuations.  In its DCF calculation for the share repurchase program, \nRAI created a series of scenarios using the first five years of the June  2016 LE, a \nrange of risk -adjusted WACCs from 7% to 9.5% , and a range of perpetuity growth \nrates from 1% to 4%.  The average of the 30 DCF valuations in June 2016 was $51.46 \nper share.  (DX0622, at tab “Sheet1.”)  RAI management later conducted additional \nscenarios, adding 60 scenarios using a set of “Constrained” projections and a different \ntax rate.  The average share price resulting from the second set of scenarios was  \n$53.33.  (DX0138, at tab “Sheet1.”)   \n289. The June  2016 DCF calculations also identified the “scenario utilized for \npurposes of [RAI’s] goodwill evaluation at most recent year-end[.]”  This scenario used \nan “Assumed WACC” of 9.5% and an “Assumed Terminal Growth Rate” of 3%.  \nApplied to the first five years of the June 2016 LE, the calculation resulted in a total \nequity value for RAI of $38.94 per share.  ( DX0622, at tab “ Sheet1”; Gilchrist Tr. \n424:10–425:16.)   \n \n \n \n290. Flyer cites as support for his 1.0% PGR beginning in 2026 the PGR ranges \nof 1 .0% to 4 .0% appearing in the DCF calculation wo rksheet prepared by RAI in \nconnection with the share repurchase plan.  ( Flyer Tr. 1129:1–17, 1233:1–10; \nDX0138, at tab “Sheet1”; DX0622, at tab “Sheet1.” )  Flyer ’s reliance on that \nworksheet is misplaced.  The range of PGRs  used by RAI management cannot be  \nconsidered in isolation from other inputs like the range of discount rates .  (Gompers \nTr. 760:3–13; de Gennaro Tr. 328:10–329:4, 325:22– 327:1.)  Further,  RAI’s DCF \ncalculations used five years of projections and not ten years , and RAI’s PGR range \nwas applied in 2022, not 2026.  (DX0138, at tab “Sheet1”; DX0622, at tab “Sheet1.”) \n291. The evidence shows that the WACC and PGR used by RAI for purposes of \nthe share repurchase plan were inextricably linked, such that RAI was concerned \nmore with the valuation produced by the interaction between the two inputs and less \non what the precise inputs were.  (Gilchrist Tr. 421:12–20; Gompers Tr. 760:3–13.) \n292. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the DCF scenarios run for the share \nrepurchase plan provide support for a fair value at or below the $59.64 per share deal \nprice. \niv. Lazard’s Has-Gets Valuation in the Lorillard Transaction \n293. Prior to the Merger, Lazard had experience in large -scale tobacco \ntransactions, including advising RAI in connection with the Lorillard Transaction .  \n(JX0006.0004; DX 0151.0015; de Gennaro Tr.  186:21–188:8.)  As previously noted , \nde Gennaro was a lead banker for RAI in that transaction.  (DX0151.0006.) \n294. Even though Lazard represented R AI as a buyer in the Lorillard \nTransaction, Lazard’s valuation work there was consistent with  the work it \n \n \n \nperformed on behalf of RAI as a seller i n the BAT transaction.  RAI performed the \nsame valuation analyses and incorporated similar assumptions about industry trends \nin the tobacco industry into its valuation work.  (de Gennaro Tr. 224:10–226:6.) \n295. In both the Lorillard Transaction and the Merger, RAI performed a “has -\ngets” valuation analysis of the pro forma entity resulting from each transaction.  (de \nGennaro Tr. 195:2–9, 235:10–16.)  A “has -gets” analysis is essentially a comparison \nbetween the projected value of the existing company as a going concern —what a \nshareholder already “has” —and the projected value of the potential newly created \ncompany—what a shareholder “gets.”  (de Gennaro 200:9–201:7; Wajnert Tr. 133:5–\n21.) \n296. In calculating its pro forma DCF valuation for RAI, Lazard used a range of \nperpetuity growth rates between negative 0.5% and positive 0.5% and a WACC range \nof 5.0% to 6.0%.  (DX0393.0147–.0148; de Gennaro Tr. 194:23–195:16; 239:19–240:9.)  \nThe results of Lazard’s “has- gets” analysis of the pro forma combination of RAI and \nLorillard was a valuation range of $60.15 to $93.39 per share.  (DX0393.0147.) \n297. Dissenters relied on the high-end of this valuation in pre -trial briefing and \nat trial as evidence supporting the reasonableness of their proposed $92.17 per share \nvaluation.  ( Wajnert Tr. 131:7–144:19; Defs .’ Pre trial Br. 23 –24, ECF No. 190 .)  \nHowever, as Wajnert identified during his cross-examination and as de Gennaro later \nexplained, Dissenters failed to account for the fact that, following the close of RAI’s \nacquisition of Lorillard in June 2015, RAI effected a two-for-one stock split in August \n2015—doubling the number of outstanding shares of RAI common stock from \n \n \n \n700 million to 1.4 billion.   ( Wajnert Tr. 170:3–7; de Gennaro Tr.  208:8–209:13, \n238:20–24; DX0317.0001, .0004; JX0023.0029, .0085.)  As a result of the stock split, \nLazard’s has-gets valuation from the Lorillard deal equates to a range of between \n$30.08 and $46.70 per share.   ( de Gennaro Tr.  240:10–22, 241:12– 242:5.)  Thus, \nrather than supporting Zmijewski’s valuation, this analysis (which Dissenters \nthemselves touted as an appropriate benchmark) strongly undermines it and instead \nsupports the deal price as fair value for RAI’s shares. \nc. Fair Value Does Not Include a Control Premium \n298. A control premium is the additional value that a buyer ascribes to an asset \nunder the assumption that the buyer will be able to derive more value from that asset.  \n(Gompers Tr. 789:14–17.)  In other words, a s Gompers explained, “the control \npremium is essentially what an acquirer is willing to pay because they can better \nmanage that asset, drive additional cash flows fro m that asset or get synergies .”  \n(Gompers Tr. 845:17–20.)   \n299. The value attributable to a control premium is a subjective value on behalf \nof the acquirer; that is, it only reflects the value that the acquirer believes it can add.  \n(Gompers Tr. 912:10–17 (“[S]omebody buys the assets because they believe that \nthey’re going to be better.  They’re going to be able to, you know, fire lazy managers \nand the like.” (emphasis added)).)  Because this value is unique to the particular \nacquirer—here, BAT —the “control premium represents the value only under the \ncontrol of the [acquirer].”  (Gompers Tr. 912:17–18.) \n300. As Yilmaz testified, a company’s value is determined from the perspective \nof “an independent firm that is expected to go on as an independent entity[.]”  (Yilmaz \n \n \n \nTr. 1866:24–1867:7.)  Yilmaz clarified: “Just to be sure we are all on the same page, \nthis does not have any kind of minority discount or some kind of acquisition premium \nor control premium attached to it.”  ( Yilmaz Tr. 1867:8–10.)  Gompers agreed with \nYilmaz:  “So if what you’re trying to value is the firm, the fair value of the firm, \nassuming no transaction, you should not gross it up by some control premium .”  \n(Gompers Tr. 911:7–9.)   \n301. Thus, evidence relating to whether certain calculations in the record need \nto have a control premium added to them to be reflective of RAI’s fair value is neither \npersuasive nor relevant in determining RAI’s fair value here.  (Wajnert Tr. 165:23–\n166:4, 167:10– 17, 168:4– 13; Gilchrist Tr.  551:1–17; Gompers Tr. 846:16–848:9, \n854:24–855:3, 858:5– 22, 901:19 –902:16, 908:10– 18; DX0277.0019– .0020; \nPX0115.0397–.0398; DX0277.0019–0020; PX0115.0397 –0398; Constantino Tr. \n1829:24–1830:3, 1830:10–24, 1848:16–18.)   \nd. Fair Value Determination \n302. Based on the admissible evidence of record, the Court concludes that \nDissenters’ valuation of $92.17 is an extreme outlier.  It implies a $50 billion \nmispricing of RAI’s shares, which if accepted would appear to be the largest \nmispricing ever identified in an appraisal case  in North Carolina, Delaware, or \nelsewhere, by far.  Moreover, Dissenters’ approach to valuation is unreasonable both \nas a matter of common sense fact -finding and under North Carolina law , insisting \nthat the only reliable ev idence of value is their expert’s litigation -generated DCF \nvaluation, which is starkly inconsistent with all other evidence of value including the \n \n \n \nmarket evidence, contemporaneous DCFs, and various sanity checks that Dissenters’ \nexperts agree are a typical part of the valuation process.   \n303. Dissenters’ theory that RAI management and the Financial Advisors  \nconspired to sell the Company at a depressed price is not supported by the record, \nwhich revealed that diligent and knowledgeable professionals worked in good faith to \nget the best result they could for RAI’s shareholders. \n304. Based on the admissible evidence introduced at trial, the Court finds the \nfair value of RAI as of the date of the Merger was no more than the $59.64 per share \nthat Dissenters have already been paid. \nIII. \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n305. This case was properly designated as a mandatory complex business case \nand assigned to the undersigned .  The Court has authority to make its Findings of \nFact following the completion of the trial and the submission of all disputed issues \nfor resolution by the Court without a jury .  Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, \nthe Court makes the following Conclusions of Law.  Any Findings of Fact that are \nmore appropriately deemed Conclusions of Law are incorporated by reference into the \nCourt’s Conclusions of Law. \nA. North Carolina’s Appraisal Statute \n306. “Appraisal is the exclusive remedy for a shareholder who wishes to exercise \na dissenter’s rights.”  Osher v. Ridinger, 162 N.C. App. 155, 157, 589 S.E.2d 905, 907 \n(2004); see also Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 542 A.2d 1182, 1186 (Del. 1988) (“An \nappraisal proceeding is a limited legislative remedy intended to provide shareholders \n \n \n \ndissenting from a merger on grounds of inadequacy of the offering price with a judicial \ndetermination of the intrinsic worth (fair value) of their shareholdings.”).   \n307. N.C.G.S. § 55-13-30(a) provides that “[i]f a shareholder makes a demand for \npayment under N.C.G.S. § 55-13-28 which remains unsettled, the corporation shall \ncommence a proceeding . . . by filing a complaint with the Superior Court Division of \nthe General Court of Justice to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued \ninterest.”  The North Carolina appraisal statute , however, does not create a general \nright to appraisal  for shareholders in a corporation like RAI with stock that is \n“[t]raded in an organized market and has at least 2,000 shareholders and a market \nvalue of at least twenty million dollars[.]”  Id.  § 55 -13-02(b)(1).  Nevertheless, \n“appraisal rights shall be a vailable pursuant to subsection (a) of this section for the \nholders of any class or series of shares where the corporate action is an interested \ntransaction.”  Id. § 55-13-02(b)(4) (emphasis added).   \n308. An “interested transaction” under the appraisal statute  is “[a] corporate \naction described in N.C.G.S. § 55-13-02(a), other than a merger pursuant to N.C.G.S. \n§ 55-11-04 or N.C.G.S. § 55-11-12, involving an interested person and in which any of \nthe shares or assets of the corporation are being acquired or converted.”  Id. § 55-13-\n01(7) (emphasis added). \n309. The statute defines an “interested person” as \n[a] person, or an affiliate of a person, who at any time during the one-\nyear period immediately preceding approval by the board of directors of \nthe corporate action met any of the following conditions: 1.  Was the \nbeneficial owner of twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of \nthe corporation, other than as owner of excluded shares[, or] 2.  Had the \npower, contractually or otherwise, other than as owner of excluded \n \n \n \nshares, to cause the appointment or election of twenty-five percent (25%) \nor more of the directors to the board of directors of the corporation.” \n \nId. § 55-13-01(7)(a). \n \n310. The Merger was an “interested transaction” as defined in the appraisal \nstatute because it was a qualifying “corporate action” there under and BAT was an \n“interested person” due to its 42% shareholder stake and right under the Governance \nAgreement to appoint five out of fourteen directors to the RAI Board.  ( Corr. Stip’d \nFacts ¶ 4; JX0020.0006, at § 2.01I(ii); Wajnert Tr. 60:13–21, 61:25–62:8.)  Therefore, \nDissenters are entitled to appraisal rights.  \n311. As such, Dissenters are then entitled to a judgment for “the amount, if any, \nby which the court finds the fair value of the shareholders’ shares, plus interest, \nexceeds the amount paid by the corporation to the shareholder for the shareholder’s \nshares.”  N.C.G.S. § 55-13-30(e)(i).  The trial court shall also assess all court costs of \nthe proceeding “against the corporation, except that the court may assess costs \nagainst all or some of the s hareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the court \nfinds equitable, to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, \nvexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this Article.”  \nId. § 55-13-31(a). \nB. Goal of the Appraisal Proceeding \n312. There is little case law in North Carolina addressing judicial appraisal \nactions under  section 55-13-30.  See Russell M. Robinson,  II, Robinson on North \nCarolina Corporation Law § 27.06[1] (7th ed. 2019) (“There is no reported appellate \nNorth Carolina decision determining the fair value of shares in an appraisal \n \n \n \nproceeding.”).  Delaware ’s courts, in contrast, have developed a substantial body of \nlaw determining fair value through judicial appraisal.  Althoug h Delaware’s \nappraisal statute, 8 Del. C. § 262, is not identical to section 55-13-30, the two statutes \neach require a determination of “fair value”45 and are sufficiently similar that the \nCourt finds decisions of the Delaware courts under section 262, although not binding, \nto be helpful guidance in interpreting the North Carolina appraisal statute and \ndeciding the fair value of RAI’s shares in this action.  See, e.g., Corwin v. British Am. \nTobacco PLC, 251 N.C. App. 45, 53, 796 S.E.2d 324, 331 (2016) , (“North Carolina \ncourts often look to Delaware  courts for guidance regarding unsettled business law \nissues.”), overruled on other grounds, 821 S.E.2d 729 (N.C. 2018) ; First Union Corp. \nv. SunTrust Banks, Inc., 2001 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 10, 2001) \n(“North Carolina courts have frequently looked to Delaware  for guidance because of \nthe special expertise and body of case law developed in the Delaware Chancery Court \nand the Delaware Supreme Court.”).   \n313. Under the North Carolina and Delaware appraisal statute s, “[t]he trial \ncourt’s ‘ultimate goal in an appraisal proceeding is to determine the “fair or intrinsic \nvalue” of each share on the closing date of the merger.’ ”  In re Appraisal of Stillwater \nMining Co., Consol. C.A. No. 2017 -0385-JTL, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at *56– 57 \n(Del. Ch. Aug. 21, 2019) (quoting Dell, Inc. v. Magnetar Glob. Event Driven Master \nFund Ltd., 177 A.3d 1, 20 (Del. 2017)).  “There may be no perfect methodology for \n                                                 \n45 Similar to the North Carolina appraisal statute, the Delaware ap praisal statute asks a \ncourt to determine “the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from \nthe accomplishment or expectation of the merger.”  8 Del. C. § 262(h). \n \n \n \narriving at fair value for a given  set of facts,” but a trial court’s conclusions should \n“follow logically from those facts and [be] grounded in relevant, accepted financial \nprinciples.”  Dell , 177 A.3d at 22– 23.  “The basic concept of value . . . is that the \nstockholder is entitled to be paid for that which has been taken from him, viz., his \nproportionate interest in a going concern.”  Merion Capital L.P. v. Lender Processing \nServs., No. 9320 -VCL, 2016 Del. Ch. LEXIS 189, at *37 (Del. Ch. Dec. 16, 2016) \n(quoting Tri-Cont’l Corp. v. Battye, 74 A.2d 71, 72 (Del. 1950)). \nC. Burden of Proof \n314. North Carolina’s appraisal statute omits a specific reference to burden of \nproof.  Delaware’s statute contemplates that “the burden to establish fair value by a \npreponderance of the evidence rests on both  the petitioner and the respondent.”  \nLaidler v. Hesco Bastion Envtl., Inc., C.A. No. 7561-VCG, 2014 Del. Ch. LEXIS 75, at \n*20 (Del. Ch. May 12, 2014) (emphasis added) .  Given that both statutes compel the \nCourt to determine fair value rather t han to decide between the parties’ competing \npositions, the Court concludes that Delaware’s approach is consistent with the text \nand intent of North Carolina’s appraisal statute and should be applied here.   \n315. As a result, the Court concludes  that, as in Del aware, “[n]o presumption, \nfavorable or unfavorable, attaches to either side’s valuation, and [e]ach party also \nbears the burden of proving the constituent elements of its valuation position . . . , \nincluding the propriety of a particular method, modificati on, discount, or premium.”  \nIn re Panera Bread Co., C.A. No. 2017-0593-MTZ, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 42, at *41–42 \n(Del. Ch. Jan. 31, 2020) ( internal quotation marks and footnotes omitted).  As the \n \n \n \nDelaware Chancery Court has explained, in language this Court concludes should \napply equally under section 55-13-30, \n[T]he Court . . . has discretion to select one of the parties’ valuation \nmodels as its general framework or to fashion its own.  The Court may \nevaluate the valuation opinions submitted by the parties, select the most \nrepresentative analysis, and then make appropriate adjustments to the \nresulting valuation.  The court also may make its own independent \nvaluation calculation by . . . adapting or blending the factual \nassumptions of the parties’ experts.   It is also entirely proper for the \nCourt . . . to adopt any one expert’s model, methodology, and \nmathematical calculations,  in toto , if that valuation is supported by \ncredible evidence and withstands a critical judicial analysis  on the \nrecord.  When . . . none of the parties establishes a valuation that is \npersuasive, the Court must make a determination based on its own \nanalysis. \n \nIn re Appraisal of Dell  Inc., C.A. No. 9322-VCL, 2016 Del. Ch. LEXIS 81, at *59– 60 \n(Del. Ch. May 31, 2016) (internal quotation marks  and citations omitted), aff’d in \npart, rev’d in part on other grounds sub nom.  Dell, 177 A.3d 1; see also IQ Holdings, \nInc. v. Am. Commer cial Lines Inc., No. 6369 -VCL, 2013 Del. Ch. LEXIS 234, at *2 \n(Del. Ch. Mar. 18, 2013); Gholl v. eMachines, Inc., C.A. No. 19444-NC, 2004 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 171, at *18 (Del. Ch. Nov. 24, 2004). \nD. Fair Value \n316. Under Delaware’s appraisal statute, “fair value does not equal best value.”  \nVerition Partners Master Fund Ltd. v. Aruba Networks, Inc. , C.A. No. 11448 -VCL, \n2018 Del. Ch. LEXIS 160, at *45 (Del. Ch. May 21, 2018) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  The Court concludes that the same is true under North Carolina’s appraisal \nstatute.  Rather, for purposes of section 55 -13-30, the Court concludes that, as in \nDelaware, a “[f]air value for the purposes of appraisal ‘means a price that is one that \n \n \n \na reasonable seller, under all of the circumstances, would regard as within a range of \nfair value; one that such a seller could reasonably accept[.]’ ”  Id. at *44 (quoting DFC \nGlob. Corp. v. Muirfield Value Partners, L.P., 172 A.3d 346, 370 (Del. 2017)).  Nor are \ndissenting shareholders entitled “to the best price th eoretically attainable had \nmarket conditions been the most seller -friendly.”  In re Appraisal Solera Holdings, \nInc., CONSOLIDATED C.A. No. 12080 -CB, 2018 Del. Ch. LEXIS 256, at *51 (Del. \nCh. July 30, 2018); see also Stillwate r, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at *59 (“As the \nDelaware Supreme Court recently explained, ‘fair value is just that, “fair.”  It does \nnot mean the highest possible price that a company might have sold for had Warren \nBuffet negotiated for it on his best day and the Lenape who sold Manhattan on their \nworst.’ ” (quoting DFC, 172 A.3d at 370)).  \n317. Nevertheless, “ ‘[i]t is not sufficient for . . . directors to achieve the best price \nthat a fiduciary will pay if that price is not a fair price.’  Nor is it sufficient to obtain \na fair price if that price is not the best alternative available for the corporation and \nits stockholders.”  In re Dole Food Co. Stockholder Litig., CONSOLIDATED C.A. No. \n8703-VCL, CONSOLIDATED C.A. No. 9079-VCL , 2015 Del. Ch. LEXIS 223, at *112 \n(Del. Ch. Aug. 27, 2015) (citation omitted). \n318. To determine the fair value of a corporation’s stock,  \nthe court can consider a wide range of factual evidence, including, but \nnot limited to, the market price, the merger price, other offers for the \ncompany or its assets, prices at which knowledgeable insiders sold their \nshares, internal corporate documents . . . and valuation work prepared \nfor non-litigation purposes.   \n \n \n \n \nReynolds Am. Inc. v. Third Motion Equities Master Fund, Ltd. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS \n94, at *7– 8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Sept. 12 , 2018) (quoting In re Dole Food Co. , 114 A.3d \n541, 550 (Del. Ch. 2014) ).  “Even where the parties have retained credible experts, \nthe court should consider ‘factual evidence relating to valuation as a cross -check, or \nreality-check, on the litigation- driven figures generated by [those] experts.’ ”  Id. at \n*8 (quoting Dole Food, 114 A.3d at 550).   \n319. In North Carolina, as in Delaware, the court cannot “adopt at the outset an \n‘either-or’ approach, thereby accepting uncritically the valuation of one party, as it is \nthe [c]ourt’s duty to determine the core issue of fair value on the appraisal date.”  In \nre Appraisal of Metromedia Int’l Gp., Inc. , 971 A.2d 893, 899– 900 (Del. Ch. 2009).  \n“[T]he court should first envisage the entire pre-merger company as a ‘going concern,’ \nas a standalone entity, and assess its value as such.  ‘[T] he c orporation must be \nviewed as an on-going enterprise, occupying a particular market position in the light \nof future prospects.’ ”  Dell, 177 A.3d at 20 (quoting In re Appraisal of Shell Oil Co. , \n607 A.2d 1213, 1218 (Del. 1992)); see also Stillwater, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at *57 \n(“[T]he trial court must assess ‘the value of the company . . . as a going concern, rather \nthan its value to a third party as an acquisition.’ ”  (quoting M.P.M. Enters., Inc. v. \nGilbert, 731 A.2d 790, 795 (Del. 1999))); IQ Holdings, 2013 Del. Ch. LEXIS 234, at *2 \n(“Fair value is determined by  valuing the business as a going concern.”).   “ [T]he \nappraisal endeavor is ‘by design, a flexible process.’ ” Dell , 177 A.3d at 21 (quoting  \nGolden Telecom Inc. v. Global GT LP, 11 A.3d 214, 218 (Del. 2010)). \n \n \n \n320. The North Carolina appraisal statute provides that fair value must be \ndetermined “immediately before the effectuation of the corporate action as to which \nthe shareholder asserts appraisal rights[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 55-13-01(5).  Thus, the Court \nmust determine fair value as of the Transaction Date rather than when the M erger \nAgreement was signed in January 2017.  See Stillwater, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at \n*57 (“Put differently, the valuation date is the date on which the merger closes.”).  “If \nthe value of the corporation  changes between the signing of the merger agreement \nand the closing, then the fair value determination must be measured by the ‘operative \nreality’ of the corporation at the effective time of the merger.”  Id. at *57–58. \n321. North Carolina’s statute provides the Court with certain guidelines for \nperforming its valuation.  Under N.C.G.S. § 55 -13-01(5), fair value is to be assessed \n(i) “using customary and current valuation concepts and techniques ,” (ii) “excluding \nany appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action unless \nexclusion would be inequitable ,” and (iii) “without discounting for lack of \nmarketability or minority status.”  The statute does not limit or prescribe the specific \n“valuation concepts and techniques” that the Court may use, and  requires only that \nthey be “customary and current” and “generally employed for similar business in the \ncontext of the transaction requiring appraisal.”  Id.   \n322. In the merger context, courts, economists , and valuation professionals \ncustomarily and currently use a wide range of valuation concepts and techniques, \nincluding but not limited to assessing market evidence of the value of the shares, \nassessing whether the transaction process was one in which the resulting deal price \n \n \n \nis a reliable indicator of value, reviewing internal valuations performed by the \ncompany prior to consideration of the merger, estimating the net present value of the \ncompany’s expected future cash flows (a DCF analysis), comparing the company’s \ntrading multiples to the trading multiples of similar firms, and comparing the \nmultiples paid in the merger to the multiples paid in similar transactions.  See Dole \nFood, 114 A.3d at 550; see also Sieg Co. v. Kelly , 568 N.W.2d 794, 798 (Iowa 1997) \n(applying statute that, like North Carolina’s, is patterned on the Model Business \nCorporation Act: “[a]s we have observed on prior occasions, there is no predominant \nformula for arriving at fair value”).   \n323. “[T]hose knowledgeable about valuation recognize that the field is as much \nart as science.”  Dole Food , 114 A.3d at 553 n.7.  “Fair value is, by now, a \njurisprudential concept that draws more from judicial writings than from the \nappraisal statute itself.”  Del. Open MRI Radiology Assocs., P.A. v. Kessler, 898 A.2d \n290, 310 (Del. Ch. 2006).  Therefore, it is appropriate to view skeptically the use of \nany one approach to the exclusion of all others, particularly when that approach \npurports to identify with precision a value far out of line with all other evidence.  Dole \nFood, 114 A.3d at 557 (“Rather than supporting the petitioners’ idealized depiction of \nvaluation as a scientific process that should be reserved exclusively for neutral \nopiners, the martial metaphor suggests the need to consider other evidence as a check \non the warring experts’ models.”).  Ultimately, “[w]hat is necessary in any particular \nappraisal case is for the Court . . . to explain its fair value calculus in a manner that \nis grounded in the record before it.”  In re Appraisal of Jarden Corp. , \n \n \n \nCONSOLIDATED C.A.

As the notes to the Model Business Corporation Act, on which \nNorth Carolina’s statute is based, explain , “A court determining fair value under \nchapter 13 should give great deference to the aggregate consideration accepted or \napproved by a disinterested board of directors for an appraisal -triggering \ntransaction.”  Model Bus. Corp. Act § 13.01 cmt. 2 (Am. Bar Ass’n 2016).\n46   \n325. Indeed, Delaware courts have recognized that “ the price produced by an \nefficient market is generally a more reliable assessment of fair value than the view \nof a single analyst, especially an expert witness who caters her valuation to the \nlitigation imperatives of a well-heeled client.”  Dell, 177 A.3d at 24.  “The fact that a \ntransaction price was forged in the crucible of objective market reality (as \n                                                 \n46 Dissenters contend that an assessment of deal price in determining fair value is not a \n“customary and current valuation concept and technique” under section 55 -13-01(5).  \nDissenters’ contention, however, has no support in North Carolina case law and is sq uarely \nrefuted by the legislative history reflected in the Model Business Corporation Act \ncommentary set forth above. \n \n \n \ndistinguished from the unavoidably subjective thought process of a valuation expert) \nis viewed as strong evidence that the price is fair.”  Van de Walle v. Unimat ion, Inc., \nC.A. No. 7046, 1991 Del. Ch. LEXIS 27, at * 50 (Del. Ch. Mar. 6, 1991).  As a result, \nDelaware courts will in appropriate cases “afford[  ] substantial, if not exclusive, \nweight to deal price in the fair value analysis.”  Dell, 177 A.3d at 30.47    \n326. Nevertheless, “[t]here is no presumption that the deal price reflects fair \nvalue.”  Stillwater, 2019 Del. Ch.

Although “[t]here is no checklist or set of minimum characteristics for giving \nweight to the deal price[,]” id., the Delaware courts have recognized “objective indicia \n                                                 \n47 See also, e.g., Verition Partners Master Fund, Ltd. v.

Other “objective indicia” include “negotiations at arm’s-length; board \ndeliberations without any conflicts of interest; buyer due diligence and receipt of \nconfidential information about the company’s value; and seller extraction of multiple \nprice increases.”  Panera, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 42, at *44 (internal quotation marks, \nbrackets, and footnotes omitted).   \n328. As noted by the court in Panera, “[t] he Delaware Supreme Court has \nparticularly stressed the absence of post-signing bidders as an objective indicator that \nthe sale process was reliable and probative of fair value.”  Id. at *44; see also, e.g., \nAruba, 210 A.3d at 136 (“It cannot be that an open chance for buyers to bid signals a \nmarket failure simply because buyers do not believe the asset on sale is sufficiently \nvaluable for them to engage in a bidding contest against each other.”); Dell, 177 A.3d \nat 29 (“Fair value entails at minimum a price some buyer is willing to pay —not a \nprice at which no class of buyers in the market would pay. ”); id. at 33 (finding also \nthat absence of a higher bid meant “that the deal market was already robust and that \na topping bid involved a serious risk of overpayment,” which “suggest [ed] the price \n[wa]s already at a level that [wa]s fair”).   \n329. Although some Delaware decisions have suggested that , in certain \ncircumstances, unless there is a robust auction involving well -informed and \nunconstrained bidders, the transaction price is not a reli able indicator of fair value, \n \n \n \nsee Global GT LP v. Golden Telecom, Inc., 993 A.2d 497, 508 (Del. Ch. 2010) (declining \nto give any weight to the merger price where controlling shareholders refused to allow \nan auction), the Delaware Supreme Court has not retr eated from its long -held view \nthat when “the directors possess a body of reliable evidence with which to evaluate \nthe fairness of a transaction, they may approve that transaction without conducting \nan active survey of the market[,]” Barkan v.

LEXIS 30 3, at *116 –17 (declining to impose \n“minimum requirements for other sale processes to meet before the deal price can be \nconsidered as a persuasive indicator of fair value”).  \n330. Indeed, Delaware courts have recognized that “[a]t least for a widely held, \npublicly traded company, a sale process could [result in an informed sale] through the \npublic announcement of a transaction and a sufficiently open post -signing market \ncheck.”  Stillwater, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at *70.  Moreover, “a board may pursue \na single transaction partner, so long as the transaction is subject to an effective \nmarket check under circumstances in which any bidder interested in paying more has \na reasonable opportunity to do so.”   Id. at *75 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nThat said, “if a board fails to employ any traditional value maximization tool, such as \n \n \n \nan auction, a broad market check, or a go-shop provision, that board must possess an \nimpeccable knowledge of the company’s business for the Court to determine that it \nacted reasonably.”  Panera, 2020 Del.

Even when the deal price is not given controlling weight, it remains a \nrelevant indicator of fai r value that should not be ignored, particularly when \nindependent and well-informed directors negotiated with the buyer at arm’s length.  \nSee Dole Food, 114 A.3d at 559; Jarden, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 271, at *10 (finding fair \nvalue to be consistent with the “less reliable, but still relevant, deal price less \nsynergies value”); Blueblade Capital Opportunities LLC v. Norcraft Cos., C.A. No. \n11184-VCS, 2018 Del. Ch. LEXIS 255, at *73–74 (Del. Ch. July 27, 2018) (concluding \nthat even when a merger price is not a reliable indicator of fair value, “[t]hat does not \nmean, however, that the Merger Price is irrelevant for purposes of the Court’s fair \nvalue determination.  To the contrary, it is appropriate to consider the Merger Price \nas a ‘reality check’ on the Court’s DCF valuation” (emphasis omitted)). \n332. In this case, there are  numerous objective indicia of a robust deal process  \nthat led to a deal price that reliably reflected RAI’s fair value.   \n333. First, RAI’s stock traded in an efficient market.  At all relevant times, t he \nCompany had a market capitalization  of approximately $67 billion , its shares were \npublicly traded in high volumes and with high liquidity on the NYSE, its stock was \nwidely covered by equity analysts, information concerning the Compa ny was widely \n \n \n \navailable and readily disseminated, and the market reacted to breaking news and \ninformation concerning the Company .  (PX0063.0010, .0025; PX0115.0181; \nJX0017.0003; de Gennaro Tr. 187:18–188:8, 215:15–23); see, e.g., Dell, 177 A.3d at 6–\n7, 27 ( noting that “the  evidence suggests that the market for Dell’s shares was \nactually efficient and, therefore, likely a possible proxy for fair value” because, among \nother things, Dell’s stock actively traded on the NASDAQ, the company had a $20 \nbillion market cap, the stock was widely covered by equity analysts, and its share \nprice “quickly reflected the market’s view on breaking developments”); Stillwater, \n2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at *164, *173 (relying on certain “ attributes of market \nefficiency characteristics such as market capitalization, public float, weekly trading \nvolume, bid-ask spread, analyst following, and market reaction to breaking news and \ninformation”).    \n334. Second, through the Governance Agreement  and its other contractual \nrelationships with BAT , RAI had freedom to make decisions independent of BAT \nconcerning the Merger, (Wajnert Tr. 63:18–64:3; JX0023.0080), providing reliable \nevidence that the Merger was an arm’s -length transaction.  Indeed, the Transaction \nCommittee twice  rejected BAT’s merger offers without countering , strongly \nsuggesting that the Transaction was prepared to recommend RAI’s continued \nindependence as an alternative to executing a transaction with BAT unless BAT \nincreased the bid price.  (JX0023.0067 –.0073.)  Moreover, there was ample evidence \nthat RAI seriously considered strategic alternatives to a merger with BAT.  (Wajnert \nTr. 73:24–74:24; Cameron Dep. Tr. 106:16–107:11; Crew Tr. 665:16–666:15); see, e.g., \n \n \n \nSolera, 2018 Del. Ch. LEXIS 256, at *52 (“Reliance on the deal  price as evidence of \nfair value is strengthened when independent  representatives of a target company \nactively negotiate with potential buyers and demonstrate a real willingness to reject \ninadequate bids.”). \n335. Third, the Transaction Committee and the Board were free of conflicts in \nnegotiating and deliberating upon the Merger.  The Transaction Committee was \ncomposed of fully independent, sophisticated executives with substantial experience \nin considering and negotiating complex mergers and acquisition transactions.  From \nmanagement’s regular presentations and submissions to the Committee and the \nBoard, including those concerning RAI management’s financial projections, the \nCommittee and the Board had impeccable knowledge of the Company’s business and \nits future prospects for growth.  The Committee and the Board were able to consider \nthe proposed transaction and any alternatives , including maintaining RAI as an \nindependent entity, fully free of conflicts, and were aware that BAT would not force \na deal on an unwilling RAI.  (de Gennaro Tr. 214:9–215:14; Wajnert Tr. 63:4–10, 68:8–\n69:17); see, e.g., Dell, 177 A.3d at 28 (citing fact that special committee was “composed \nof independent, experienced directors and armed with the power to say ‘no’ ” as factor \nsupporting fairness of deal price); Columbia Pipeline , 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 303, at \n*64–65 (noting six of seven board members were experienced outside directors in \nsupporting fairness of deal price).  \n336. Fourth, BAT assessed RAI’s value having access to extensive public \ninformation about the Company as well as confidential, nonpublic information shared \n \n \n \nat regular RAI Board mee tings.  (Wajnert Tr. 146:15–149:15; Gompers Tr. 844:22–\n845:2); see, e.g., Panera, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 42, at *45–46 (citing buyer’s access to \npublic and nonpublic information in supporting fairness of deal price) ; see also, e.g., \nDFC, 172 A.3d at 349 (similarly noting that deal price was “informed by robust public \ninformation[ ] and easy access to deeper, non-public information”).   \n337. Fifth, as a result of the Transaction Committee’s efforts, RAI was able to \nextract four price increases from BAT during the course of the Merger negotiations.  \nThese increases—from $56.50 to $59.64 per share —resulted in an additional $4.5 \nbillion for RAI’s shareholders.  (JX0023.0068–.0076; Wajnert Tr.  80:19–22; Nowell \nDep. Tr. 173:25–175:10, 175:17–176:25); see, e.g., Dell, 177 A.3d at 28 ( holding the \ndeal price supported fair value where “ [t]he Committee, composed of independent, \nexperienced directors and armed with the power to say ‘no,’ persuaded [buyer] to raise \nits bid six times”) ; Panera, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 42, at *46 –47 (finding two price \nincreases supported deal price as fair value); Columbia Pipeline, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS \n303, at *65–66 (holding the deal price supported fair value where committee extracted \ntwo price increases from buyer). \n338. Finally, although the Transaction Committee did not solicit other buyers or \nengage in an auction process, no third-party bidders expressed interest or submitted \na bid during the Merger negotiations or in the six -month post -agreement signing \nperiod despite widespread public awareness of BAT’s October 20 Offer soon after it \nwas made.  (Wajnert Tr. 90:3–6; Clark Tr. 1429:16–18); see, e.g., Stillwater, 2019 Del. \nCh. LEXIS 320, at * 131 (“The failure of any other party to come forward provi des \n \n \n \nsignificant evidence of fairness, because ‘[f]air value entails at minimum a price some \nbuyer is willing to pay—not a price at which no class of buyers in the market would \npay.’ ” (quoting Dell, 177 A.3d at 29)). \n339. Dissenters contend that RAI’s deal process was wholly unreliable and thus \nthat the deal price in no way reflects fair value.  In particular, Dissenters’ experts, \nYilmaz and Zmijewski, opine that the Transaction Committee’s failure to seek out \npotential buyers other than BAT, (Yilmaz Tr. 1938:1–3), or to push BAT to dilute its \nshares, subsidize potential bidders’ costs, or offer support for an alternative \ntransaction, (Yilmaz Tr. 1941:21–1942:1; Zmijewski Tr. 1311:3–8), render the deal \nprice unreliable, (Yilmaz Tr. 1868:11–14; Zmijewski Tr. 1308:11–1309:13).  As proof, \nZmijewski asserts that Japan Tobacco was interested in acquiring RAI but did not \nbid due to BAT’s ownership position.  (Zmijewski Tr. 1312:20–1313:3.)  Dissenters \nsuggest that, given Japan Tobacco’s acquisition of six tobacc o companies in the past \nfive years, Japan Tobacco would have bid for RAI if BAT had been open to an \nalternative bid.  (DX0272.0001 (email stating “in a different world where BAT did not \nown its stake [Japan Tobacco] would have made a play for RAI”).  \n340. The Court disagrees.  While RAI could have improved the optics of its deal \nprocess by actually soliciting bidders and pressing BAT to encourage alternative \nbidders, there were few (if any) companies in the tobacco industry or adjacent \nindustries that could have made an offer for RAI.  Although Japan Tobacco appears \nto have been the only one of these potential bidders that conceivably might have bid \nfor RAI other than BAT, Japan Tobacco never expressed interest or submitted a bid  \n \n \n \ndespite its almost certain knowledge of BAT’s October 20 Offer and the public deal \nannouncement in January 2017.  (Wajnert Tr. 171:19 –172:12.)  No  evidence was \nintroduced from Japan Tobacco (or any other potential third-party bidder) to suggest \nthat Japan Tobacco (or any other potential t hird-party bidder) would have bid had \nBAT been open to such an  offer, and the evidence offered to prove Japan Tobacco’s \ninterest—an internal email within Goldman reporting what an unnamed person at \nJapan Tobacco allegedly said—is hearsay and hardly persuasive.  (DX0272.0001.) \n341. In addition, while  the Merger Agreement included a no -shop provision, \nBAT’s information rights, and a $1  billion termination fee, (JX0023.0061–.0062), no \npersuasive evidence was introduced to suggest that these provisions undermined the \nsales process or otherwise discouraged other bidders, including Japan Tobacco, from \ncoming forward.  As a result, the Court finds that the Committee’s decision not to \nsolicit potential alternative buyers or to push BAT to change its position on \nalternative bids does not undermine the reliability of the deal price under  the \ncircumstances here.  See, e.g., Dell, 177 A.3d at 28 (where news of a potential sale was \npublic, “interested parties would have approached the Company . . . if serious abo ut \npursuing a deal”); Panera, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 42, at *49 (finding failure of market \nparticipants “to pursue a merger when they had a free chance to do so . . . provides \nsignificant evidence of fairness” of the deal price); Highfields Capital, Ltd. v. A XA \nFin., Inc., 939 A.2d 34, 60 (Del. Ch. 2007) (“If MONY was truly worth $43 per share” \nrather than the $31 deal price, “certainly some savvy investor likely would have \ncompeted with AXA, as each dollar per share below that level, according to \n \n \n \nHighfields’s theory, wou ld have resulted in the purchaser realizing approximately \n$50 million in value.”); see also, e.g., Aruba, 210 A.3d at 136. \n342. The additional testimony Dissenters presented to dispute the reliability of \nthe deal price, in particular that from Yilmaz, was also unpersuasive.  Yilmaz \nconceded that he did not consider the specifics of the Merger in forming his opinions \nand instead opined as a “theorist.”  ( Yilmaz Tr. 1968:24–1969:7.)  He also \nacknowledged that it was possible that a board of directors could obtain fair value \neven where the sole bidder was a large blockholder, (Yilmaz Tr. 1974:7– 1975:18), \nexplaining further that \nif the board was all well meaning and [the] board knew everything that \nwas relevant and they don’t give in to any pressure and they were abl e \nto do the best thing for their shareholders, it is possible that they can \nget fair value,   \n(Yilmaz Tr. 2009:12–2010:2).   \n343. In addition, while he opined that it was “highly likely” that BAT’s ownership \nstake adversely affected the deal price, (Yilmaz Tr. 1949:23 –1950:9), Yilmaz did not \nattempt to measure any supposed effects deriving therefrom.  He also did not analyze \nthe possibility of RAI’s suffering from agency problems due to BAT’s ownership stake \nor review the deposition testimony of the Transaction Committee members who \nengaged with BAT in the negotiations.  ( Yilmaz Tr. 1976:4–1977:6, 1978:14–1980:6, \n1981:23–1982:6.)  In  fact, in giving his opinio n on the reliability of the deal price, \nYilmaz did not consider or assess whether the Transaction Committee actually \nresisted BAT in the negotiations.  (Yilmaz Tr. 1977:7–1979:15.)  Yilmaz’s theoretical \n \n \n \nopinions are insufficient to undermine the compelling  evidence indicating that the \ndeal process led to a price reflecting the fair value of RAI.   \n344. Further, the “golden parachute” compensation paid to certain members of \nRAI management and the contingent fee nature of the compensation paid to the \nFinancial Advisors does not undermine the reliability of the deal price as fair value.  \nThere was no evidence that an y member of RAI’s management placed his or her \npersonal interests above the best interests of the Company, and the same is true for \neach of the Financial Advisors.  Indeed, Delaware courts have noted that \n“[c]ontingency clauses are standard in financial ad visor agreements and seldom \ncreate a conflict of interest.”  Panera, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 42, at *74.  There was no \nevidence of such a conflict here.  See id.  at *76 (finding that a financial advisor’s \ncontingency fee did not undermine the reliability of the deal price and concluding that \n“[i]n any event, [the advisor’s] fairness opinion would not have precluded a board \ndetermination that it was better for [the seller] to remain a standalone company”). \n345. Similarly, Dissenters’ challenges to the reliability of the information RAI \nprovided to the Financial Advisors, including their use of five -year rather than ten -\nyear projections, does not undermine the deal price’s reliability.  To the contrary, it \nis clear these projections, increased by the management overlays,  were the most \naccurate and up-to-date projections RAI had available.  Cf. Dole Food, 2015 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 223, at *102 (criticizing management for “[w]ithholding the company’s latest \nprojections” from the spec ial committee and advisors  (internal quotation mark \nomitted)).   \n \n \n \n346. Nor does the Financial Advisors’ choice of inputs for their DCF  analyses, \nincluding their choice of perpetuity growth rate and their decision to apply that rate \nin year six of their DCF calculations, undermine the deal price’s reliability.  See, e.g., \nMerion Capital, 2016 Del. Ch. LEXIS 189, at *55 (finding financial advisors’ DCF -\nbased valuation ranges consistent with market indicators and thus supportive of deal \nprice as fair value). \n347. Accordingly, based on the evidence presented, the Court finds that the \nMerger was negotiated at arm’s length by independent , fully informed, and deeply \nknowledgeable directors with the assistance of independent and experienced \nadvisors, all of whom had ext ensive experience in the tobacco industry and a deep \nand impeccable knowledge of RAI and its potential opportunities, challenges, and \nfuture prospects.  The Committee and the Board acted with full transparency and in \nrelentless pursuit of value , rejected t wo BAT offers outright , indicating their \nseriousness in continuing as an independent entity, and extracted four price increases \nfrom BAT resulting in an additional $4.5 billion for RAI’s shareholders .  The non-\nBAT shareholders voted overwhelmingly (99% of shares voted) in favor of the Merger, \na transaction that had received widespread favorable reaction from industry \nobservers and analysts.  As in Dell, and particularly given the fact that RAI’s size and \nindustry position meant that there were few, if any, likely bidders other than BAT, \n“[n]othing in the record suggests that increased competition would have produced a \nbetter result.”  177 A.3d at 28.  The Court thus concludes that, u nder the \n \n \n \ncircumstances present here, even without more aggressive outreach a nd a \ncompetitive auction, the resulting deal price is reliable evidence of RAI’s fair value. \n348. Consideration of the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision in Golden Telecom, \na case heavily relied upon by Dissenters, does not change this result.   Although the \ncase has numerous similarities with the case at bar, including the presence of large, \n40%-plus shareholders who were unsupportive of an alternative transaction, RAI had \ncertain rights and leverage through the Governance Agreement that were not present \nin Golden Telecom.  While the target board in Golden Telecom  treated the deal like \n“a merger proposal by a controlling stockholder,” 993 A.2d at 508, here, as the \nSupreme Court of North Carolina has concluded, the Governance Agreement \nprevented BAT from hav ing effective control of RAI.  See Corwin, 371 N.C. at 625, \n821 S.E.2d at 743.  Further, the contemporaneous market reaction to the deal in \nGolden Telecom , where the “weight of the evidence suggest[ed] that the market \nbelieved that [the buyer] was getting a bargain [,]” id. at 509, was far different than \nhere, where the market believed the Transaction Committee succeeded in negotiating \na fair price, (Gompers Tr. 802:25–803:8; Yilmaz Tr. 2003:4–22).  \nF. Alternative Methods of Valuation \n349. In Delaware, the appraisal statute expressly commands a court in appraisal \nactions to “take into account all relevant factors” and not to ignore any indicia of fair \nvalue.  8 Del. C. § 262(h).  This Court has previously held that “[e]ven where the \nparties have retained credible experts, the court should consider ‘factual evidence \nrelating to valuation as a cross-check, or reality-check, on the litigation-driven figures \n \n \n \ngenerated by [those] experts.’ ”  Reynolds, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 93, at *12 (quoting Dole \nFood, 114 A.3d at 550).)   Accordingly, the Court considers alternative methods of \nvaluation to test the reliability of the deal price as fair value. \na. Unaffected Market Price \n350. One common valuation concept is to consider the price an asset fetches in \nthe market.  As this Court has previously observed in an appraisal action, \n[P]ublicly traded companies operate in an environment where there is a \nmarket mechanism which provides a strong, if not determinative, \nindicator of the value of minority shares.  There are feder al and state \nstatutory protections built into transactions involving publicly held \ncompanies.  Information from which shareholders can evaluate \ntransactions is readily available from public companies because of \ndisclosure and filing requirements of the federal securities laws.   \nBeam v. Worldway Corp. , 1997 NCBC LEXIS 8, at *14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 23, \n1997).\n48   \n351. Delaware precedent is in accord, holding that “the price a stock trades at in \nan efficient market is an important indicator of its economic value that should be \ngiven weight[.]”  Aruba, 210 A.3d at  138; Jarden, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 271, at *58 \nn.322 (noting that courts may “look to stock price to corroborate a fair value \nconclusion”).  “Indeed, ‘ [w]here there is an established market for a corporation’s \nstock, market value must be considered in appraising the value of the corporation’s \nshares.’ ”  Dole Food , 114 A.3d at 559 ( quoting Cooper v. Pabst Brewing Co. , Civil \n                                                 \n48 Dissenters contend that a consideration of unaffected market price in assessing fair value \nis not a “customary and current valuation concept and technique” under section 55-13-01(5).  \n(Defs.’ Opening Post-Trial Br. 26–27.)  The Court disagrees.  Not only does this Court’s Beam \ndecision, cited above , conclude otherwise, but Dissenters’ reading of the statutory text is \nunduly restrictive in this context. \n \n \n \nAction No. 7244, 1993 Del. Ch. LEXIS 91, at *22 (Del. Ch. June 8, 1993) ).  “[T]he \nefficient market hypothesis . . . teaches that the price produced by an efficient market \nis generally a more reliable assessment of fair value than the view of a single analyst, \nespecially an expert witness who caters her valuation to the litigation imperatives of \na well-heeled client.”  Dell, 177 A.3d at 24.   \n352. For this reason, courts have used a company’s unaffected market price as a \nbarometer for fair value as “[m]arket prices are typically viewed superior to other \nvaluation techniques because, unl ike, e.g., a single person’s discounted cash flow \nmodel, the market price should distill the collective judgment of the many based on \nall the publicly available information .”  DFC, 172 A.3d at 369– 70; see also Jarden, \n2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 271, at *58 (“When  the market is efficient, the trading price of \na company’s stock can be a proxy for fair value.”).   \n353. The Delaware Supreme Court has noted the importance of market price in \ndetermining the fair value of highly regulated industries like tobacco: \nPublicly tra ded companies in industries like tobacco, energy, \npharmaceuticals, and certain commercial products are subject to close \nregulation, the development of which can affect their future cash flows. \nPrecisely because of that reality, the market’s assessment of t he future \ncash flows necessarily takes regulatory risk into account as it does with \nall the other reasonable uncertain factors that affect a company’s future.  \n \nDFC, 172 A.3d at 372. \n \n354. Dissenters’ arguments attacking the use of RAI’s market price are \nunavailing.  In particular, t he Court rejects Dissenters’ contention that a stock’s \ntrading price can never show fair value because it implicitly contains a minority \ndiscount.  (Defs.’ Opening Post-Trial Br. 26–27, 49.)  While Dissenters’ argument may \n \n \n \nhave some currency in closely -held corporations, it has no application here in the \npublic company setting.  (Gompers Tr. 787:1–9); see, e.g., Lawrence A. Hamermesh & \nMichael L. Wachter, The Short and Puzzling Life of the “Implicit Minority Discount” \nin Delaware Appraisal Law, 156 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 5–6 (2007) (stating that “not a single \npiece of financial or empirical scholarship affirms the core premise of the [implicit \nminority discount] - that public company shares systematically trade at a substantial \ndiscount to the net present value of the corporation”).   \n355. Based on the evidence presented and the Court’s findings of fact concerning \nRAI’s Unaffected Stock Price and its Adjusted Unaffected Stock Price , the Court \nconcludes that each support the reliability of the deal price of $59.64 per share as the \nfair value of RAI’s shares as of the Transaction Date. \nb. Discounted Cash Flow Analyses \n356. Courts may also consider more theoretical “valuation concepts and \ntechniques,” such as analyses of comparable companies, comparable precedent \ntransactions, and DCF analyses.   \n357. A DCF analysis is an accepted valuation methodology.  See, e.g., Columbia \nPipeline, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 303, at *137 (“The DCF method is a technique that is \ngenerally accepted in the financial community.”).  “A DCF analysis, although complex \nin practice, is rooted around a simple principle: the value of the company at the time \nof the merger is simply the sum of its future cas h flows discounted back to present \nvalue.”  AOL, 2018 Del. Ch. LEXIS 63, at *26 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nYet, “a DCF analysis is only as reliable as the inputs relied upon and the assumptions \n \n \n \nunderlying those inputs. . . .  [T]he use of math should not obscure the necessarily \nmore subjective exercise in judgment that a valuation exercise requires.”  Id. at *26–\n27 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Importantly, “[i]nputs in a discounted cash \nflow are predictions which are necessarily speculativ e in nature.” Harris v. Rapid -\nAm. Corp., Civil Action No. 6462, 1990 Del. Ch. LEXIS 166, at *18 (Del. Ch. Oct. 2, \n1990), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 603 A.2d 796 (Del. 1992).   \n358. The weight and utility of DCF analysis and other methodologies will depend \non the specific circumstances of the case.  They are generally given less weight in \ncases like this one where there was an active public market for the stock and a robust \ndeal process.  See, e.g., DFC, 172 A.3d at 370 (“[A] singular discounted cash flow model \nis often most helpful when there isn’t an observable market price.”) ; Union Ill. 1995 \nInv. L.P. v. Union Fin. Grp., Ltd., 847 A.2d 340, 359 (Del. Ch. 2003 ) (“In view of the \nmarket’s opportunity to price UFG directly as an entity, the use of alternative \nvaluation techniques like a DCF analysis is necessarily a second -best method to \nderive value.”).   \n359. The DCF calculations in this case aptly illustrate the Delaware Supreme \nCourt’s observation that , despite their widespread acceptance,  “DCF valuations \ninvolve many inputs —all subject to disagreement by well -compensated and highly \ncredentialed experts—and even slight differences in these inputs can produce large \n \n \n \nvaluation gaps.”  Dell , 177 A.3d at 38. 49  T he Delaware Court of Chancery has \nexplained,  \nThe DCF model typically can generate a wide range of estimates.  In the \nworld of real transactions (capital budgeting decisions for example) the \nhypothetical, future-oriented, nature of the model is not thought fatal to \nthe DCF technique because those employing it typically have an intense \npersonal interest in having the best estimates and assumptions used as \ninputs.  In the litigation context use of the model does not have that \nbuilt-in protection.  \n \nCede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc. , Civil Action No. 7129, 1990 Del. Ch. LEXIS 259, at \n*26 n.17 (Del. Ch. Oct. 19, 1990).   \n360. The wide variability and susceptibility to manipulation attendant to DCF \nanalysis in appraisal litigation has increasingly caused Delaware courts to question \nits reliability.  See, e.g., Highfields, 939 A.2d at 52 –53 (stating that the DCF \nmethodology “has much less utility in cases where the transaction giving rise to \nappraisal was an arm’s -length merger”); In re Appraisal of Jarden Corp. , \nCONSOLIDATED C.A. No. 12456-VCS, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 994, at *3 n.4 (Del. Ch. \nSept. 16, 2019) (“I am more convinced than ever that the experts’ inability to agree \non inputs is evidence that DCF is not reliable here, particularly given the presence of \na reliable ‘market-based metric.’ ” (quoting Stillwater, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at \n*174); Columbia Pipeline, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 303, at *140, *142 (“ Dell and DFC \nteach that a trial court should have greater confidence in market indicators and less \n                                                 \n49 For example, as discussed above, a change in PGR from 2.2% to 0% drops Zmijewski’s DCF \nvaluation from $92.17 to $58.00 per share , an over $50 billion reduction in share value .  \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1396:2–9.)   \n \n \n \n \nconfidence in a divergent expert determination. . . .  The wide swings in output that \nresult from legitimate debate over reasonable inputs undermine the reliability of \n[petitioners’ expert’s] DCF model.”).   \n361. This is particularly so for post -merger DCFs prepared by experts for \npurposes of litigation.  See, e.g. , Doft & Co. v. Travelocity.com Inc., C.A. No. 19734, \n2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 75, at *28 (Del. Ch. May 2 1, 2004) (“[T]his court is inherently \nsuspicious of post -merger, litigation -driven forecasts because ‘ the possibility of \nhindsight bias and other cognitive distortions seems untenably high. ’ ”  (quoting \nAgranoff v. Miller, 791 A.2d 880, 892 (Del. Ch. 2001))).   \n362. When a DCF analysis is used, Delaware courts have increasingly cautioned \nthat “it is only reliable when it can be verified by alternative methods to DCF or by \nreal world valuations.”  S. Muoio & Co. v. Hallmark Entm’t Invs. Co., Civil Action No. \n4729-CC, 2011 Del. Ch. LEXIS 43, at *75 (Del. Ch. Mar. 9, 2011), aff’d , 35 A.3d 419 \n(Del. 2011).  Indeed, courts in Delaware have consistently rejected DCF -based \nvaluations that differ dramatically from other evidence of value.  See, e.g., Stillwater, \n2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 3 20, at *3 (“The experts disagreed over too many inputs, and \nthe resulting valuation swings were too great, for this decision to rely on a [DCF] \nmodel when a market -tested indicator is available.”); Columbia Pipeline , 2019 Del. \nCh. LEXIS 303,  at * 139 (“[The expert’s] valuation of $32.47 per share stands in \ncontrast with contemporaneous market evidence.”);  Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., \nCivil Action No. 7129, 2003 Del. Ch. LEXIS 146, at *13 –14 (Del. Ch. Dec. 31, 2003), \naff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds , 884 A.2d 26 (Del. 2005) (“Easton’s \n \n \n \nprojections are supported by several independent indicia of value, while Torkelsen  \ndoes not even attempt to perform reasonableness checks upon his valuation.”);  Gray \nv. Cytokine Pharmascis., Inc., C.A. No. 17451, 2002 Del. Ch. LEXIS 48 , at *23 (Del. \nCh. Apr. 25, 2002) (“In sum, when compared to other indications of value, Davis’s \nvaluation is such an outlier that it casts doubt on its reliability, quite apart from its \nexact assumptions and methodologies.”).   \n363. Applying these principles here, and for the reasons discussed at length \nabove, (see supra § II(F)(b)), the Court concludes that the DCF analyses performed by \nthe Financial Advisors were reliable and constitute persuasive evidence that the fair \nvalue of RAI’s shares as of the Transaction Date was at or below the deal price of \n$59.64 per share.   \n364. The Court further concludes that Zmijew ski’s DCF analysis and his \nvaluation of RAI at $92.17 per share is unreliable.  Indeed, Zmijewski’s valuation of \nRAI’s shares for this litigation is an extreme outlier when compared to all other \nindicia of value in the record  and is based on projections un suited for valuation \nanalysis and a blended PGR that is unsupported by credible and persuasive evidence, \nundermining its reliability either as a basis to challenge the deal price as fair value \nor as support for Dissenters’ requested $92.17 per share valuation.   \nc. Comparable Companies/Comparable Transactions Analyses \n365. It is common practice to cross -check the output of a DCF analysis against \ncomparable companies analyses.  See DFC, 172 A.3d at 386–88 (finding it reasonable \nfor the Chancery Court to consider comparable companies in fair value \n \n \n \ndetermination).  “The idea is that if the market expects  comparable companies to \ngrow at a certain rate, then one can infer the growth of the subject  company by \napplying a multiple drawn from the comparables to a relevant metric, such as \nEBITDA or revenues.”  In re Appraisal of the Orchard Enters., C.A. No. 5713-CS, 2012 \nDel. Ch. LEXIS 165, at *29 (Del. Ch. July 18, 2012).   \n366. As the court in Panera recently explained, \nBefore a comparable companies multiples analysis can be undertaken \nwith any measure of reliability, it is necessary to establish a suitable \npeer group through appropriate empirical analysis.  If, and only if, a \nproper peer set can be selected, the nex t step in the comparable \ncompanies analysis is to select an appropriate multiple and then \ndetermine where on the distribution of peers the target company falls.  \nWhere the experts’ identified companies are too divergent from the \ncompany in terms of size, p ublic status, and products, to form \nmeaningful analogs for valuation purposes, this Court will disregard \nthis valuation metric. \n \nPanera, 2020 Del. Ch. LEXIS 42, at *100 ( internal quotation marks and footnotes \nomitted).   \n367. Like a comparable companies analysis, “[a] comparable transactions \nanalysis is an accepted valuation tool in . . . appraisal cases.  The analysis involves \nidentifying similar transactions, quantifying those transactions through financial \nmetrics, and then applying the metrics to the company at issue to ascertain a value.”  \nHighfields, 939 A.2d at 54.  “The utility of the comparable transactions methodology \nis directly linked to the ‘similarity between the company the court is valuing and the \ncompanies used for comparison.’ ”  Id. (quoting Lane v. Cancer Treatment Ctrs. of Am., \nC.A. No. 12207-NC, 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 108, at *126 (Del. Ch. July 30, 2004)).  \n \n \n \n368. Based on the evidence presented  and as discussed above,  the Court \nconcludes that the comparable companie s and comparable transactions analyses \nperformed by the Financial Advisors each serve as a useful market or “sanity” check \nshowing that Zmijewski’s valuation is clearly excessive.  (See supra § F(a)(iii).)  The \nanalyses are less useful as support for the d eal price as fair value.  T he Court gives \nno weight to the comparable companies analysis for this purpose, see, e.g., Lane, 2004 \nDel. Ch. LEXIS 108, at *126 (“At some point, the differences become so large that the \nuse of the comparable company method becomes meaningless for valuation purposes.” \n(quoting In re Radiology Assocs., Inc. Litig. , 611 A.2d 485, 490 (Del. Ch. 1991)) ), but \nfinds that the Lorillard Transaction provides support that the deal price is a reliable \nindicator of the fair value of RAI’s shares as of the Transaction Date. \nd. Contemporaneous Market Reaction \n369. Delaware courts often consider analyst commentary concerning proposed \ntransaction prices in assessing the valuation of a company in appraisal actions.  See, \ne.g., DFC, 172 A.3d at 353, 373.  Contemporaneous analyst reaction to BAT’s October \n20 Offer was decidedly positive, generally supporting the reliability of the deal price \nas fair value for RAI’s shares.  This is  in marked contrast to the two cases on which \nDissenters principally rely where the opening bid in each was criticized as unfair to \nshareholders: Golden Telecom, 993 A.2d at 509,  and the RJR Nabisco transaction \nfrom the 1980s, (Yilmaz Tr. 1997:22–1998:2, 2000:17–21).   \n370. Moreover, the vast majority of RAI’s public shareholders, including the \nCompany’s officers and directors, approved the deal price  negotiated by the \n \n \n \nTransaction Committee  even though the majority -of-the-minority condition gave \nthem the power to vote it down.  (Corr. Stip’d Facts ¶ 18; DX0277.0011; DX0324.0002; \nJX0023.0044; Crew Tr. 671:23–672:10.)  Such s trong non-BAT officer, director, and \nshareholder approval provides powerful, contemporaneous evidence that the deal \nprice constituted fair value for RAI’s shares.   See, e.g. , Technicolor, 1990 Del. Ch. \nLEXIS 259, at *105 (“Yet knowledgeable officers and directors all sold their stock for \n$23 per share.  This fact while itself not conclusive is relevant in concluding that as \nof January 24, 1983, sophisticated, knowledgeable persons would not have concluded \nthat Technicolor stock had an inherent value of $62.75[.]”).   \n371. The Court finds unpersuasive Yilmaz’s contention that the shareholder vote \nshould be disregarded because the shareholders did not have the June 2017 ten-year \nprojections.  (Yilmaz Tr. 1903:20–1904:22.)  The Court finds little relevance in RAI’s \nyear six through ten projections for valuation purposes, and no persuasive evidence \nwas presented that disclosure of those projections would have changed the \nshareholder vote.  Moreover, the October 2016 Projections disclosed in the Proxy were \nmore optimistic than the first five years of the June 2017 projections, (Zmijewski Tr. \n1370:17–1372:7), providing no basis to conclude that shareholders would have voted \nagainst the transaction had the June 2017 projections been disclosed. \n372. Further, Mason Capital’s own contemporaneous view of RAI’s value on a \nstandalone basis shortly after the October 20 Offer suggests that the deal price was \nfor fair value.  (See supra § II(F)(a)(vi).)  That valuation of $54.44 per share—derived \nbefore litigation commenced and Mason received in discovery RAI’s ten -year \n \n \n \nprojections on which so much of Dissenters’ case rests —serves as a useful market \ncheck to the $59.64 per share deal price  and undermines the reliability of both \nMason’s litigation valuat ion of $88.16 per share  and Zmijewski’s $92.17 per share \nvaluation as reasonable determinations of fair value. \nG. Exclusion of Value in Anticipation of the Corporate Action \n373. The Court must value RAI as a standalone business as of the closing date \non July 25, 2017, as though the Merger were not planned and did not happen.  See \nN.C.G.S. § 55-13-01(5) (requiring court to “exclud[e] any appreciation or depreciation \nin anticipation of the [ merger]”).50  That means the Court must exclude any value \narising from synergies that were expected from the Merger.  See Boettcher v. IMC \nMortg. Co., 871 So. 2d 1047, 1053 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004) (determining fair value \nunder an appraisal statut e patterned on the Model Business Corporation Act \n“required the exclusion of any appreciation or depreciation in IMC’s shares based \nupon anticipation of the consummation of the proposed asset sale”); see also Jarden, \n2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 271, at *6–7 (noting that Delaware law requires “back[ing] out” \nsynergies (citing ACP Master, Ltd. v. Sprint Corp. , Nos. 8508-VCL, 9042-VCL, 2017 \nDel. Ch. LEXIS 125, at *79 (Del Ch. July 21, 2017))).   \n374. Here, the deal price includes the portion of the $400 million (or \napproximately $0.28 per share) in anticipated synergies that was paid to the RAI \n                                                 \n50 The Delaware appraisal statute is similar:  “Through such proceeding the Court shall \ndetermine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the \naccomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, \nto be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.”  8 Del. C. § 262(h) (emphasis \nadded). \n \n \n \nshareholders.  (JX0021.0007; JX0023.0068.)  Dissenters are not entitled to the value \nof those synergies, so t hose amounts must be deducted from the deal price to arrive \nat fair value under the statute.   See, e.g., Union Ill., 847 A.2d at 356 ( instructing \ncourts to exclude “any value that the selling company’s shareholders would receive \nbecause a buyer intends to operate the subject company, not as a stand -alone going \nconcern, but as a part of a larger enterprise, from which synergistic gains can be \nextracted”); Stillwater, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 320, at *138 (“In an arm’s -length, \nsynergistic transaction, the deal price generally will exceed fair value because target \nfiduciaries bargain for a premium that includes . . . a share of the anticipated \nsynergies[.]” (quoting Olson v. ev3, 2011 Del. Ch. LEXIS 34, at *10 (Del Ch. Feb. 21, \n2011))). \n375. Likewise, the Court should no t adjust its valuation of RAI to incorporate a \ncontrol premium  because a control premium is not part of the company as a \nstandalone enterprise.  A s Gompers testified, a  “control premium is the value to \nsomebody else who [thinks he/she] can derive more valu e from [the existing] assets” \nthan current management can, which is “not the value of that company under the \nexisting management –  assuming that no transaction occ urred.”  ( Gompers Tr. \n789:14–17.)  Thus, a control premium does not inhere in the standalone company but \ninstead “represents the value only under the control of the [acquirer.]”  (Gompers Tr. \n912:17–18.)  As such, a control premium is value arising “in anticipation of” the \nmerger, N.C.G.S. § 55-13-01(5), and, accordingly, must be excluded from the appraisal \nvalue of the pre-merger company, (Yilmaz Tr. 1867:8–10; Gompers Tr. 911:7–9). \n \n \n \nH. No Discount for Lack of Marketability or Minority Status \n376. North Carolina’s appraisal statute also provides that the valuation should \nnot be discounted “for l ack of marketability or minority status .”  N.C.G.S. \n§ 55-13-01(5).  Neither lack of marketability nor minority status are at issue in this \ncase.   \n377. First, there is no lack of marketability of RAI shares because of RAI’s highly \nliquid and transparent market on the NYSE.  (JX0017.0003.)  Second, Dissenters did \nnot have “minority status” because RAI did not have a majority or controlling \nshareholder.  (JX0023.0080; Wajnert Tr. 63:18– 64:18.)  As the  Supreme Court of \nNorth Carolina has already held, BAT was not a controlling shareholder because the \nGovernance Agreement placed “contractual handcuffs” on BAT that prevented it from \noppressing RAI’s remaining shareholders or otherwise exercising control.  Corwin, \n371 N.C. at 619, 821 S.E.2d at 739.  To the extent Dissenters suggested at trial that \nthe existence of a large blockholder can affect  the value of a company’s shares, \n(Yilmaz Tr. 1969:8–1971:2), Dissenters offered no specific evidence in support of that \ntheory in this case.   \nI. Interest, Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs \n378. Section 55-13-30(e) provides, in relevant part, that “each shareholder made \na party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment either (i) for the amount, if any, by \nwhich the court finds the fair value of the shareholder’s shares, plus interest, exceeds \nthe amount paid by the corporation to the shareholder for the shareholder’s shares[.]”  \nUnder N.C.G.S. § 55-13-01(6), “interest” is calculated by applying the statutory rate \n“from the effective date of the corporate action un til the date of payment.”  Thus, \n \n \n \nunder the statute, interest stops running on an amount when that amount is paid.  \nAs a result, because RAI’s payment obligations to Dissenters ceased when it paid each \nDissenter $59.64 per share plus interest in 2017, no fu rther interest is due to \nDissenters under the statute.   Other states with similar statutes have interpreted \ntheir statutes similarly.51   \n379. Dissenters’ arguments to the contrary are without merit.   They argue that \nsection 55-13-30 requires judgment to be calc ulated by starting with the adjudged \nfair value of RAI’s shares, add interest at the legal rate through the date of judgment, \nand then subtract the amounts already paid.  (Defs.’ Opening Post -Trial Br. 61–63.)  \nGiven the large sums involved here, such an interpretation would result in an interest \naward to Dissenters in this action of over $100 million even though the Court has \nconcluded that RAI paid them fair value for their shares.  The Court concludes that \nthis is a nonsensical result, one supported neit her by the text of the statute nor the \nintent of the legislature.     \n380. N.C.G.S. § 55-13-31(b)(1) also provides that  \n[t]he Court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the expenses for \nthe respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable . . . [a]gainst \nthe corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding \nappraisal . . . if the court finds the corporation did not substantially \ncomply with the requirements of G.S. 55-13-20, 55-13-22, 55-13-25, or \n55-13-27.   \n \n                                                 \n51 See, e.g., Pueblo Bancorporation v. Lindoe, Inc., 63 P.3d 353, 357 (Colo. 2003); Ely, Inc. v. \nWiley, No. LA-22998, Slip Op. at 9 (Iowa Dist. Ct. Aug. 31, 1994), rev’d on other grounds, 546 \nN.W.2d 218 (Iowa Ct. App. 1996) ; First W. Bank Wall v. Olsen , 621 N.W.2d 611, 615 (S.D. \n2001); Utah Res. Int’l, Inc. v. Mark Techs. Corp., 342 P.3d 761, 768 (Utah 2014); HMO-W Inc. \nv. SSM Health Care Sys. , 667 N.W.2d 733, 735- 36 (Wis. Ct. App. 2003);  Brown v. Arp & \nHammond Hardware Co., 141 P.3d 673, 677 (Wyo. 2006). \n \n \n \nAlthough Dissenters have sought their expenses here, the Court finds that RAI \nsubstantially complied with each of the cited statutes and therefore that an award of \nattorneys’ fees and expenses against RAI is not justified. \n381. Finally, N.C.G.S. § 55-13-30(a) provides,  \nThe court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the \ncourt may assess costs against all or some of the shareholders \ndemanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent \nthe court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not \nin good faith with respect to the rights provided by this Article. \n \nRAI does not seek, nor does the Court find grounds, to assess costs against \nDefendants.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that costs should be assessed against \nRAI as provided under section 55-13-30(a). \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n382. The evidence at trial of all “valuation concepts and techniques ,” “excluding \nany appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the ” merger and “ without \ndiscounting for lack of marketability or minority status,” establishes the fair value of \nRAI’s shares as of the Transaction Date to be no more than $59.64 per share.   \n383. An imperfect, but nonetheless robust , deal process conducted by \nindependent and sophisticated directors and financial advisors  with d eep and \nimpeccable knowledge of RAI’s business and growth prospects considered all \nreasonable and likely alternatives, extracted multiple price increases from BAT, and \nnegotiated a final deal price of $59.64.  The market valued RAI stock at well under \n$59.64 prior to BAT’s first offer and likely would have continued to do so through the \nTransaction Date if the Merger had not occurred.  Properly conducted DCF analyses, \n \n \n \nincluding three separate analyses conducted by RAI’s highly regarded, independent, \nand conflict -free financial advisors, support a fair value of $59.64 or less.  The \nacquisition multiples in precedent transactions , while of less value,  suggest a fair \nvalue below $59.64,  and when considered together with the trading multiples  for \ncomparable companies, at a minimum and with all other evidence of value introduced \nat trial, provide a useful market or sanity check undermining the extraordinary \n$92.17 per share valuation reached by Zmijewski, which , if accepted, would suggest \nan enormous, implausible mispricing of more than $50 billion.  \n384. For these and all the reasons set forth above, t he Court concludes that t he \nfair value of RAI stock as of the Transaction Date was no more than the deal price of \n$59.64 per share.   \n385. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby ENTERS JUDGMENT ordering that: \na. No further sums are due from RAI to Defendants for payment of \nDefendants’ shares; \nb. RAI shall not be liable for Defendants’ attorneys’ fees and expenses \nincurred in connection with this action; and \nc. RAI shall pay Def endants’ court costs as provided in N.C.G.S. 55 -13-\n31(a) no later than forty-five (45) days after the entry of this Judgment. \nThis the 27th day of April, 2020. \n      /s/ Louis A.

As noted in the Judgment to which this Appendix B is attached, the parties \nlodged numerous objections to proffered exhibits and testimony during the trial.  The \nCourt ruled on many of these objections at the time they were made.  As to others, \nhowever, the Court received the proffered exhibits and testimony subject to objection \nand permitted post-trial briefing and argument on the objections.  The Court’s rulings \non the parties’ remaining evidentiary objections are set forth below in this Appendix \nB and are incorporated into the body of the Judgment as if set forth in full therein. \n2. “The trial court has wide discretion in making [a determination of the \nadmissibility of evidence] and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.”  \nHamilton v. Thomasville Med. Assocs., Inc., 187 N.C. App. 789, 792, 654 S.E.2d 708, \n710 (2007) (quoting Heatherly v. Indus. Health Council, 130 N.C. App. 616, 619, 504 \nS.E.2d 102, 105 (1998)). \nA. RAI’s Objections to Zmijewski’s and Yilmaz’s Opinions \n3. RAI objects to the Court’s consideration of select testi mony and \ndemonstrative exhibits offered by two of Dissenters’ expert witnesses, Zmijewski, \n(Zmijewski Tr. 1266:4 –16, 1267:5–21, 1286:1–1287:7, 1324:10–18, 1325:21– 1328:8, \n1329:5–1332:1, 1341:10– 1347:18, 1348:4 –1351:7, 1358:23– 1361:17, 1362:18 –20; \n                                                 \n54 The Court does not redefine in this Appendix B terms that have been defined in the \nJudgment, and such terms shall have the same meaning in this Appendix B as they have \nbeen defined in the Judgment. \n \n \n \nZmijewski’s demonstrative slides, 55 at Slide 26, Slide 58), and Yilmaz, (Yilmaz Tr. \n1914:21–1920:3), because Dissenters failed to timely disclose the opinions reflected \nin this evidence, (Reynolds American Inc.’s Post -Trial Evid. Br. 1 –9 [hereinafter \n“RAI’s Evid. Br .”], ECF No. 216).  Although the Court is sympathetic to RAI’s \nconcerns that Zmijewski and Yilmaz offered expert opinions at trial that neither \nexpert had previously disclosed, the Court nevertheless, in the exercise of its \ndiscretion, hereby overrules RAI ’s objections in the circumstances here.  The Court \nnotes, however, that the challenged testimony and demonstrative slides lack \npersuasive force, and the Court thus affords them little weight in its determination \nof RAI’s fair value. \nB. RAI’s Objections to Constantino’s Testimony \n4. RAI objects to portions of Constantino’s testimony, (Constantino Tr. \n1798:19–1800:6, 1801:15–1802:4), that it believes constitutes hearsay regarding the \nrisk of heightened menthol regulation and certain messaging by RAI and Lorillard \nmanagement regarding the risk of a menthol ban, (RAI’s Evid. Br. 9–12).  The Court, \nin the exercise of its discretion, hereby overrules RAI’s objections but finds the \nchallenged testimony lacking in evidentiary value and gives it little weight in the \nCourt’s determination of RAI’s fair value. \n                                                 \n55 These demonstrative slides were not marked with an exhibit number, but redacted versions \nof the slides in question were attached to RAI’s Post -Trial Evidentiary Brief.  (See ECF No. \n217.4.) \n \n \n \nC. Dissenters’ Objections to Deposition Testimony of Holland, Nowell, Eckler, \nand Peters  \n5. Dissenters contend that certain designated deposition testimony should be \nexcluded, (Defs.’ Opening Post-Trial Evid. Br. 14–17 [hereinafter “Defs.’ Evid. Br.”], \nECF No. 214), including all of RAI’s affirmative designations of Holland’s Rule \n30(b)(6) testimony, (Holland 30(b)(6) Dep. Tr.), certain designated testimony of \nNowell, (Nowell Dep. Tr . 94:6–24, 168:11–24, 171:20–172:5, 172:13–16, 175:11–16, \n182:6–24), and Eckler, (Eckler Dep. Tr. 79:19 –80:23, 108:23 –109:16, 113:3– 114:9, \n137:8–138:16), and certain counter -designations of the deposition testimony of \nPeters, (Peters Dep. Tr. 75:14 –22, 110:14–21, 160:22–162:4, 162:15–164:2, 164:25–\n166:25).  The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, hereby overrules Dissenters’ \nobjections.  The Court notes, however, that it has not relied on most of this testimony \nin reaching its determination of fair va lue, and where it has, as noted by specific \nreference in the Judgment, the testimony is cumulative to other evidence establishing \nthe facts or conclusions for which this testimony is cited. \nD. Dissenters’ Objections to Gompers’s Expert Testimony \n6. Dissenters se ek to exclude the testimony of RAI’s expert, Gompers, on \ngrounds that Gompers improperly: (i) vouched for the Financial Advisors’ DCF \nanalyses, (Defs.’ Evid. Br. 10), (ii) attempted to summarize the factual record and \ncharacterize lay witness testimony, (Defs.’ Evid. Br. 11), (iii) testified to the efficiency \nof the market for RAI stock based on a non -testifying expert’s prior deposition \ntestimony, (Defs.’ Evid. Br. 12), and (iv) parroted hearsay analyst reports without \nconducting any independent analysis, (Defs.’ Evid. Br. 13). \n \n \n \n7. The Court, in the exercise of its discretion  and for the reasons set forth \nbelow, overrules Dissenters’ objections and considers Gompers’ testimony in \ndetermining the fair value of RAI’s shares in this action. \n8. Vouching occurs when an expert merely “parrots” or “rubber stamps” an \nopinion from another witness.  See In re Wagner, No. 06 -cv-01026, 2007 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 22769, at *10 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 29, 2007); 56 Loeffel Steel Prods., Inc. v. Delta \nBrands, Inc. , 387 F. Supp. 2d 794, 808– 09, 824  (N.D. Ill. 2005).  Experts cannot \nmerely vouch for the opinions of others.  See, e.g., State v. Bullock, No. COA10-320, \n2010 N.C. App. LEXIS 2058, at *7 (N.C. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2010) (“[E]xpert testimony \nis not admissible to vouc h for a witness’s credibility.”); see also, e.g. , Louis Vuitton \nMalletier v. Dooney & Bourke, Inc., 525 F. Supp. 2d 558, 664 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (“[T]he \nexpert witness must in the end be giving his own  opinion.”); FrontFour Capital Grp. \nLLC, v. Taube, C.A. No. 2019-0100-KSJM, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 97, at *50 (Del. Ch. \nMar. 11, 2019) (“[The expert] opined that the process used by various investment \nbanks was reasonable, but an expert cannot simply vouch for the work of someone \nelse.”).  \n9. Gompers’s work in this case was not mere vouching; he did not simply \n“rubber stamp” the Financial Advisors’ opinions or claim their work as his own.  To \nthe contrary, Gompers performed his own detailed, independent analyses using \n                                                 \n56 North Carolina courts may look to decisions interpreting the relevant Federal Rules of \nEvidence in construing the North Carolina Rules of Evidence.  See, e.g. , State v. McGrady, \n368 N.C. 880, 887–88, 787 S.E.2d 1, 7 (2016); N. C. R. Evid. 102, cmt. (“A substantial body of \nlaw construing [the Federal Rules of Evidence] exists and should be looked to by the courts \nfor enlightenment and  guidance in ascertaining the intent of the General Assembly in \nadopting these rules.”). \n \n \n \ncustomary valuat ion techniques and relying on his training and expertise as a \nfinancial economist, to test the validity and reasonableness of the Financial Advisors’ \ninputs, analyses, and valuations.  (Gompers Tr. 745:2 –20, 752:1–757:23; PDX0005.)  \nAs such, Dissenters’ ch allenge on this basis is overruled.  See, e.g., Iconics, Inc. v. \nMassaro, 266 F. Supp. 3d 461, 469 (D. Mass. 2017) (“Nor may an expert  ‘parrot’ the \nconclusions of other witnesses, although an expert  may rely on other witness’s \ntestimony or other expert conclusions to form an opinion.”); Cholakyan v. Mercedes-\nBenz USA, LLC, 281 F.R.D. 534, 544 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (“[A]n expert can appropriately \nrely on the opinions of others if other evidence supports his opinion and the record \ndemonstrates that the expert  conducted an independent  evaluation of that \nevidence.”); Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., No. C 04-02123 WHA, 2008 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 124780, at *18 (N.D. Cal. May 22, 2008) (“[T]he expert might \nscrutinize a . . . test, its protocol, and its participants so carefully that it would be \nreasonable to rely on it after the fact.”). \n10. Gompers also did not improperly provide a summary of the factual record.  \nAn expert is not permitted to “rehash[  ] otherwise admissible evidence” or testify \n“solely for the purp ose of constructing a factual narrative based upon record \nevidence.”  Highland Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Schneider, 379 F. Supp. 2d 461, 468– 69 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2005) (citations omitted) ; see also, e.g., Factory Mut. Ins. Co. v. Alon USA \nL.P., 705 F.3d 518, 524 (5th  Cir. 2013) (“Rule 703 was not intended to abolish the \nhearsay rule and to allow a witness, under the guise of giving expert testimony, to in \neffect become the mouthpiece of the witnesses on whose statements or opinions the \n \n \n \nexpert purports to base his opin ion.” (internal quotation marks omitted) ).  Gompers \nhas done neither here.  Rather, as noted above, Gompers performed extensive \nindependent work to test the Financial Advisors’ DCF -based valuations of RAI, \n(Gompers Tr. 745:2 –20, 752:1–753:18, 770:7–771:6, 779:25–780:25), to adjust RAI’s \nunaffected stock price to account for changes between the October 20 Offer and the \nTransaction Date, (Gompers Tr. 789:21 –792:25), and to explain why Zmijewski’s \nvaluation of RAI was an outlier when compared to all other evid ence of value in the \ncase, (Gompers Tr. 799:16–801:23, 802:12–803:8).  See Sharkey v. J.P. Morgan Chase \n& Co., 978 F. Supp. 2d 250, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“[I]nformation and testimony [that] \nis not accessible to a lay person . . . is admissible as expert tes timony.”).  Dissenters’ \nchallenge on this basis is therefore overruled.  \n11. Neither was Gompers’s testimony concerning the market efficiency of RAI \nstock improper, nor did he improperly rely upon an expert whose conclusions are not \npart of the record.  First,  there is no legal or evidentiary rule in North Carolina \nrequiring a court’s determination of market efficiency to reflect a consideration of \nexpert testimony.  Indeed, courts in Delaware and elsewhere have identified \nnumerous factual criteria to be considered in assessing whether the market for a \nparticular security is efficient.  See, e.g., In re Appraisal of Jarden Corp. , C.A. No. \n12456-VCS, 2019 Del. Ch. LEXIS 271, at *57– 60 (Del. Ch. July 19, 2019); In re \nAppraisal Solera Holdings, Inc. , C.A. No. 12080 -CB, 2018 Del. Ch. LEXIS 256, at \n*60–62 (Del. Ch. July 30, 2018); Cammer v. Bloom , 711 F. Supp. 1264, 1285 –87 \n(D.N.J. 1989).  While expert testimony no doubt can be helpful in this determination, \n \n \n \nthere is no reason why, in the appropriate case, a trial cou rt cannot make this \ndetermination solely from the factual record.  And here, as discussed in the body of \nthe Judgment, ample evidence was introduced at trial to permit a finding of market \nefficiency for the trading of RAI’s stock. \n12. In addition, Gompers did not present any testimony regarding market \nefficiency that relied on another expert.  See, e.g. , J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc. v. Gen. \nMotors Corp., 243 F.3d 441, 444–45 (8th Cir. 2001) (affirming exclusion of testifying \nexpert’s testimony that was “inextricably linked” to excluded expert’s testimony); \nBeck’s Office Furniture & Supplies, Inc. v. Haworth, Inc. , No. 95-4018, No. 95-4029, \n1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 20608, at *21 (10th Cir. Aug. 16, 1996) (“Experts . . . may not \nmerely parrot the opinions of other experts whose conclusions are not themselves in \nthe record.”).  Instead, both he and Yilmaz testified that they had not seen any \nevidence contradicti ng market efficiency.  (Gompers Tr. 785:3 –11, 785:20– 786:8; \nYilmaz Tr. 1967:4– 13.)  Dissenters’ challenge on these grounds are therefore \noverruled.  \n13. Finally, Gompers did not act as a conduit for otherwise inadmissible \nhearsay.  See, e.g., Laugelle v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 2014 Del. Super. LEXIS \n508, at *48 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 6, 2014) (“[E]xperts are not to serve as a ‘conduit’ for \notherwise inadmissible hearsay  statements.”); see also, e.g. , United States v. Baca, \nNo. CR 16 -1613 JB, 2018 U.S. Di st. LEXIS 211943, at *52 (D.N.M. Dec. 17, 2018) \n(“[T]he expert must form his own opinions by ‘applying his extensive experience and \na reliable methodology’ to the inadmissible materials.”); Gannett Co., Inc. v. Kanaga, \n \n \n \n750 A.2d 1174, 1187 (Del. 2000) (“The  danger exists, however, that Rule 703 can be \nused as a ‘back door’ hearsay exception –  a crafty litigant could give hearsay to its \nexpert for the purpose of having the expert refer to it as a basis for the expert’s \nopinion.” (citation omitted)); Towerview LLC v. Cox Radio, Inc. , C.A. No. 4809-VCP, \n2013 Del. Ch. LEXIS 159, at *6–7 (Del. Ch. June 28, 2013) (“[The expert] did not refer \nto the document in his expert report or testify about it at trial or in his deposition.  \nHence, there is no basis for treatin g the document as admissible as nonhearsay to \nsupport [his] expert opinion under Rule 703.”); In re J.C., No. COA08-1339, 2009 N.C. \nApp. LEXIS 344, at *7 (N.C. Ct. App. Apr. 7, 2009) (The “admissibility [of evidence \nunder Rule 703] does not depend on an ex ception to the hearsay  rule, but on the \nlimited purpose for which it is offered.” (quoting State v. Wood, 306 N.C. 510, 516–17, \n294 S.E.2d 310, 313 (1982))). \n14. Although Dissenters correctly argue that the analyst reports on which \nGompers relied are hearsay, the Financial Advisors and both sides’ experts agreed \nthat analyst reports are frequently relied upon by valuation experts in appraisal \nactions, (Gompers Tr. 745:2 –20, 802:12 –24; Zmijewski Tr. 1380:17– 1381:2; de \nGennaro Tr. 187:18–188:8, 199:2–19; Clark Tr. 1445:1–17; Constantino Tr. 1790:17–\n1791:11, 1793:25–1794:9; Eckler Dep. Tr. 58:18–59:4), and experts are allowed to rely \non hearsay if it is reasonable to do so, as it is here, see N.C. R. Evid. 703 (“If of a type \nreasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or \ninferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.”); \nsee also, e.g., Towerview LLC, 2013 Del. Ch. LEXIS 159, at *5 (“A document may be \n \n \n \nconsidered nonhearsay if it is admitted as basi s evidence to help the factfinder \nunderstand the expert’s thought process and determine what weight to give to the \nexpert’s opinion.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); id.  at *9 (“Petitioner tacitly \nhas accepted the fact that analyst reports are proper evidence for the experts to \nconsider[.]”); Hammel v. USF Dugan, Inc. , 178 N.C. App. 344, 349, 631 S.E.2d 174, \n178 (2006) (“When an expert witness testifies to the facts that are the basis for his or \nher opinion, ‘such testimony is not hearsay  [because it is used] to show the basis of \nthe opinion.’ ” (quoting State v. Robinson, 330 N.C. 1, 25, 409 S.E.2d 288, 302 (1991))); \nIn re Lint, No. COA02-1109, 2003 N.C. App. LEXIS 1156, at *6 (N.C. Ct. App. June \n17, 2003) (Rule 703 “permits an expert witness to rely o n an out -of-court \ncommunication as a basis for an opinion and to relate the content of that \ncommunication to the [fact-finder].”).   \n15. Here, Gompers examined each individual analyst report and explained how \nthe reports supported his conclusions; he did not s imply adopt them as his own or \nread them into the record.  (Gompers Tr. 729:24–730:9, 745:21–747:2, 785:24–786:8.)  \nAs such, this testimony is properly admitted, and Dissenters’ objection is overruled.  \nState v. Brewington , 367 N.C. 29, 45, 743 S.E.2d 626,  635 (2013) (“[T]he  expert \nopinion was ‘independent’ and . . . the report was not used for the truth of the matter \nasserted because it was only used to support this ‘independent opinion’ of a qualified \nexpert.”).   \nE. Adverse Inference Concerning Shivdasani/Missing Witness Rule \n16. Dissenters seek to invoke the “missing witness rule” to obtain an inference \nthat the expert testimony of Dr. Anil Shivdasani (“Shivdasani”) concerning market \n \n \n \nefficiency, an expert retained by RAI , would have been adverse to RAI because RAI \ndecided not to call him as a witness at trial.  (Defs.’ Evid. Br. 5–9.)  Dissenters suggest \nRAI elected not to call Shivdasani because he found that the market for RAI’s stock \nwas inefficient and, because of a recent adverse court ruling, would be seen as lacking \ncredibility.  (Defs.’ Evid. Br. 6.)   \n17. North Carolina courts have applied the “missing witness rule” to fact \nwitnesses with unique information that was unavailable from another source.  See, \ne.g., Sunbelt Rentals, Inc. v. Head & Engquist Equip., L.L.C. , 2003 NCBC LEXIS 6, \nat *135– 36 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 2, 2003).  The rule has been characterized as \n“similar” to “the well -established principle of ‘spoliation of evidence[.]’ ”  McLain v. \nTaco Bell Corp., 137 N.C. App. 179, 183, 527 S.E.2d 712, 715–16 (N.C. Ct. App. 2000) \n(citing Yarborough v. Hughes, 139 N.C. 199, 209, 51 S.E. 904, 908 (N.C. 1905)).  As \none court has noted,  \nWhat is called the “ missing witness rule ” is not a rule ; it is simply a \n“permissible inference that a factfinder may draw from the absence of a \npotential witness who might have knowledge of facts at issue in the \ncase,” when the witness is “peculiarly available” to the party not calling \nthe witness. \n \nRockwell v. State, No. 150, 2019 Md. App . LEXIS 651, at *7 (Md. App. Aug. 2, 2019) \n(quoting Harris v. State, 182 A.3d 821, 832 (Md. 2018)).  “Notably, an adverse \ninference cannot be drawn when the witness is not available, or where his testimony \nis unimportant or cumulative, or where he is equal ly available to both sides.”  \nDansbury v. State, 1 A.3d 507, 521 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2010) (emphasis added) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  “[T]he doctrine applies only if the missing \n \n \n \nwitness is particularly under the control of the defendant rather t han being equally \navailable to both parties.”  State v. Montgomery, 183 P.3d 267, 278 (Wash. 2008). \n18. The Court, in the exercise of its discretion, denies Dissenters’ request for an \nadverse inference arising from Shivdasani’s failure to testify.  First, Dissenters \ndeposed Shivdasani and could have introduced his videotaped deposition testimony \nat trial under N.C. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4) , which provides that “The deposition of a \nwitness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court \nfinds: . . . the witness is an expert witness whose testimony has been procured by \nvideotape as provided for under Rule 30(b)(4).”  Because Shivdasani’s testimony was \navailable to both sides, there is no basis for the adverse inference permitted by the \nrule.   \n19. Moreover, North Carolina courts have never suggested that the missing \nwitness rule should apply to expert witnesses.  Indeed, there are sound reasons why \nit should not, including that there may be “ many explanations for a party’s decision \nnot to call  a particular expert that may have nothing to do with a party’s fear that \nthe expert will reveal prejudicial information[,]” including cost, redundancy, \nresolution of claims, dismissal of parties, and witness availability.   Washington v. \nPerez, 98 A.3d 1140, 1153– 54 (N.J. 2014) (noting additional reasons to reject \napplication of the rule to experts include that (i) “ the content of an expert witness’s \ntestimony is unlikely to be a mystery to the parties and their counsel when a case \nproceeds to trial”; (ii) “an expert is unlikely to be in exclusive possession of factual \nevidence that would justify an adverse inference charge”; and (iii) “court rules do not \n \n \n \ncompel a litigant who has disclosed the name and opinion of a particular expert to \ncall that expert to testify at trial”); see also  In re Care & Treatment of Gonzalez, 763 \nS.E.2d 210, 215 (S.C. 2014) (holding that an “unfavorable inference may be drawn \nonly from a party’s failure to call an available, material witness where under all the \ncircumstances, the failure to produce such witness creates suspicion of a willful \nattempt to withhold competent evidence”).  \nF. Post-Merger Evidence \n20. Dissenters objected at trial to RAI’s effort to introduce evidence relating to \nthe period after the Transaction Date 57 as irrelevant to the determination of fair \nvalue.  (Defs.’ Evid. Br. 1–5.)  RAI also lodged a conditional objection, contending that \nshould the Court sustain Dissenters’ objection, Dissenters’ post -merger evidence, \nwhich Dissenters offered solely as rebut tal to RAI’s, should likewise be excluded.  \n(RAI’s Evid. Br. 24–29.)   \n21. North Carolina offers little guidance concerning a court’s consideration of \npost-merger evidence in determining fair value under the appraisal statute, section \n55-13-30.  The North Carolina appraisal statute itself is silent, simply instructing the \ncourt to determine “[t]he value of the corporation’s shares . . . immediately before the \neffectuation of the corporate action as to which the shareholder asserts appraisal \nrights[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 55 -13-01(5).  North Carolina case law does not adequately fill \n                                                 \n57 The challenged evidence is as follows: Gompers Tr. 793:16–797:25, 800:14–801:20, 918:14–\n923:3; Flyer Tr. 1080:17– 1082:20, 1083:3– 1084:16, 1115:5– 15, 1192:18– 1196:1, 1197:3–\n1199:2, 1203:14– 1204:9; Fragnito Tr. 1671:6– 10, 1686:24– 1687:9, 1692:20– 21, 1707:18–\n1709:7; Constantino Tr. 1794:10–1795:10, 1795:14–19.  \n \n \n \nthe gap.  See, e.g., IRA for Benefit of Oppenheimer v. Brenner Cos., 107 N.C. App. 16, \n25, 419 S.E.2d 354, 360 (1992) (“The post-merger financial information does not affect \nInterstate’s findings made prior to the merger.”). \n22. The Court thus turns to Delaware for  guidance.  Delaware courts in \nappraisal litigation will “permit consideration of post -merger evidence that could \nhave been discerned at the time of the merger, but [do not permit] consideration of \npost-merger evidence that was not capable of being known on the date of the merger.”  \nIn re Cinerama Inc., C.A. No. 7129, 1999 Del. Ch. LEXIS 32, at *11 (Del. Ch. Feb. 25, \n1999) (emphasis omitted); see also Cavalier Oil Corp. v. Harnett, Civil Action Nos. \n7959, 7960, 7967, 7968, 1988 Del. Ch. LEXIS 28, at *47 (Del. Ch. Feb. 22, 1988) (“Post-\nmerger data may be considered only if it is ‘known or susceptible of proof as of the \ndate of the merger and not the product of speculation.’ ” (quoting Weinberger v. UOP, \nInc., 457 A.2d 701, 713 (Del. 1983))), aff’d, 564 A.2d 1137 (Del. 1989).  \n23. Courts have on occasion considered competent evidence of events post -\ndating the relevant corporate action when those events are relevant to the \nreasonableness of a company’s pre-closing views of its future business prospects.  See, \ne.g., Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., 758 A.2d 485, 499 (Del. 2000) (“[T]his Court held \nthat post-merger evidence is admissible ‘to show that plans in effect at the time of the \nmerger have born fruition.’ ” (quoting Gonsalves v. Straight Arrow Publishers, In c., \n701 A.2d 357, 362 (Del. 1997))); In re Appraisal of PetSmart, Inc. , No. 10782- VCS, \n2017 Del. Ch. LEXIS 89, at *44 n.268 (Del. Ch. May 26, 2017) (finding that “post -\nclosing performance is probative of the reliability of . . . management projections”); \n \n \n \nGearreald v. Just Care, Inc., C.A. No. 5233-VCP, 2012 Del. Ch. LEXIS 91, at *10 (Del. \nCh. Apr. 30, 2012) (noting “[t]he Court . . . should take into account all relevant factors \nknown or ascertainable as of the merger date that illuminate the future prospects of \nthe company”). \n24. RAI argues that its post- merger evidence here addresses RAI’s proper \nconsideration of regulatory risks, the dynamic quality of the vapor industry, and the \nlack of support for Dissenters’ claim that the market mispriced RAI.  (RAI’s Evid. Br. \n25–26.)  Such evidence, however, reaches beyond the reasonableness of RAI’s pre-\nclosing views of its future business prospects and is therefore not properly considered \nin this proceeding.  In the exercise of the Court’s discretion, Dissenters’ objec tion is \ntherefore sustained.  See, e.g. , Kahn v. Household Acquisition Corp. , 591 A.2d 166, \n175 (Del. 1991) (excluding evidence of post -merger offers “as valid indications of \nmerger-date fair value because they were not ‘known or susceptible of proof as of the \ndate of the merger’ ” (quoting Weinberger, 457 A.2d at 713)).  Consistent with RAI’s \nconditional objection, the Court , in the exercise of its discretion, will likewise \ndisregard the post-merger evidence offered by Dissenters. \nSO ORDERED, in the exercise of the Court’s discretion and effective \ncontemporaneously with the filing of the Judgment  to which these rulings are \nattached as Appendix B and incorporated therein.
