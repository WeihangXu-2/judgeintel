THIS MATTER is before the Court upon Defendant YRC Worldwide Inc.’s \n(“YRC”) Cross Motion for Summary Judgment (the “Summary Judgment Motion”) in \nthe above-captioned case. \n2. Having considered the Summary Judgment Motion, the original briefs in \nsupport of and in opposition to the motion,  the arguments of counsel at the May 23, \n2018 hearing on the motion,  the supplemental briefs submitted by the parties in \nsupport of and in opposition to the motion, and other appropriate matters of record, \nthe Court hereby concludes that YRC’s Summary Judgment Motion should be \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set forth herein. \n                                                 \n1  Recognizing that this Order and Opinion cites and discusses the subject matter of \ndocuments that the Court has previously allowed to remain filed under seal in this case, the \nCourt elected to file this Further Order and Opinion on Defendant YRC Worldwide  Inc.’s \nCross Motion for Summary Judgment under seal on November 15, 2018.  The Court \npermitted the parties an opportunity to advise whether the Order and Opinion contained \nconfidential information that either side contended should be redacted from a public version \nof this document.  On November 15, 2018, both Plaintiff and Defendant advised the Court \nthat no redactions are necessary.  Accordingly, the Court removes the “filed under seal” \ndesignation and files this Order and Opinion, without redactions, as a matter of public record. \n \n \nLincoln Derr PLLC, by Sara R.

The Court has previously discussed the factual and procedural history of \nthis action in its June 26, 2018 Order and Opinion, as reported at Vizant \nTechnologies, LLC v. YRC Worldwide Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJune 26, 2018).  Consequently, this Order and Opinion revisits only those facts that \nare relevant to the Court’s decision herein.  The details recited are not findings of fact \nbut a summary “of material facts which . . . are not at issue[.]”  Hyde Ins. Agency, Inc. \nv. Dixie Leasing Corp., 26 N.C. App. 138, 142, 215 S.E.2d 162, 165 (1975). \nA. Factual Summary \n \n4. This action arises out of an alleged breach of a Professional Services \nAgreement (the “PSA”) between Plaintiff Vizant Technologies, LLC (“Vizant”) and \nYRC.  (See Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J.  Ex. 2, at 5 [hereinafter “PSA”], ECF \nNo. 84.3.) \n5. YRC—the parent entity of several freight companies that operate \nthroughout North America—has a large number of customers who pay for shipping \nservices by credit card.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3, ECF No. 88.)  When one of \nits customers pays using a credit card, YRC pays a credit card processing fee.  (Def.’s \n \n \nBr. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3.)   YRC incurs substantial costs in credit card fees each \nyear due to the number of customers that it serves and the number of orders that it \nfills.  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 3.)   At all times relevant to this lawsuit, YRC \nhas sought to reduce these costs.  (Whitsel Dep. 29:8–23, ECF No. 96.) \n6. Vizant holds itself out as a consultant that can help clients reduce costs \nassociated with financial payments.  (See Br. Supp. Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. X, ECF \nNo. 133.)  Vizant approached YRC in mid-2014 to offer its services, and after a series \nof negotiations, the two entities executed the PSA.  (PSA 5.)  By the terms of the PSA, \nVizant agr eed to “perform an evaluation, assessment and customized analytical \nreview” of the “Financial Payments” YRC received and “identify, indicate and \nquantify specific and actionable strategies and solutions” that would reduce YRC’s \ncosts associated with those payments.  (PSA § 2.)  In return, YRC agreed to pay Vizant \na percentage of YRC’s savings resulting from the strategies and solutions identified \nby Vizant.  (PSA § 10.)   \n7. Under the terms of the PSA, Vizant’s fee was calculated by comparing YRC’s \n“Pre-Agreement Financial Payment Costs” with YRC’s “Post -Agreement Financial \nPayment Costs.”  (PSA § 8.)  If the post -agreement costs were less than the pre -\nagreement costs, YRC would pay Vizant a percentage of the difference.  (PSA § 8.)   \nThe PSA defined “Post -Agreement Financial Payment Costs” as the Financial \nPayment Costs YRC incurred “as a result of the strategies and solutions that [were] \nidentified and recommended by Vizant in performance of its professional services[.]”  \n(PSA § 6.) \n \n \n8. On July 9, 2015, a fter completing an initial assessment of YRC, Vizant \npersonnel attempted to present an in -person report  on Vizant’s initial \nrecommendations to YRC management.  Vizant Techs., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, \nat *6.  Two of these recommendations included charging an account management fee \nfor credit card transactions and convincing customers to switch from paying by credit \ncard to paying by Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) batch payments.  Id. at *6, *23.   \n9. Minutes into the presentation, YRC’s manag ement stopped Vizant’s \nemployees and reminded them that YRC was already considering some of the \nproposed measures for lowering credit card costs.  (Lopez Aff. ¶ 7, ECF No. 101.)  \nWhen YRC asked if Vizant believed it was entitled to a fee for savings resulting from \nthese measures, one of Vizant’s representatives responded, “Yes.”  (Wilson Dep. 83:5–\n16, ECF No. 95; Lopez Aff. ¶ 7.)  YRC then ended the meeting.  (Wilson Dep. 271:11–\n16.)  Soon thereafter, Vizant sent hard-copy and electronic versions of its Rep ort to \nYRC.  (Christiansen Dep. 30:1–31:25, ECF No. 122.)  YRC sent Vizant a written notice \nof termination two months later .  (Pl.’s Mem. L. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 28, at 1, \nECF No. 84.29.) \nB. Procedural History \n \n10. Vizant seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against YRC as well as \ndamages for breach of the PSA.  As part of its claimed damages, Vizant contends that \nit is owed outstanding fees for savings that YRC allegedly realized through successful \nefforts to c onvince customers to pay  using ACH rather than credit cards (Vizant’s \n“ACH Damages”).  Vizant Techs., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *23. \n \n \n11. On January 18, 2018, Vizant filed a motion for summary judgment.  On \nJanuary 19, 2018, YRC filed its cross motion for summary judgment, requesting that \nthe Court grant summary judgment “as to [P]laintiff’s claims for breach of contract.”  \n(Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 87.)   In briefing and at oral argument, each side \npresented the Court with its proposed interpretation of the PSA’s provisions , each \ncontending that its respective interpretation required summary judgment in its favor. \n12. Vizant contended that the PSA requires YRC to pay a fee to Vizant because \nYRC has realized savings as a result of the strategies and solutions identified in \nVizant’s report.  Vizant Techs., LLC , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65,  at *9.  Under Vizant’s \nreading of the PSA, it does not matter whether Vizant’s services actually caused YRC \nto implement cost-saving measures or whether YRC implemented those measures of \nits own accord—if Vizant identified one of the solutions that proved beneficial to YRC, \nVizant argues it is owed a fee.  Id. \n13. YRC, on the other hand, assert ed that the PSA only  requires YRC to pay \nVizant if Vizant’s suggestions actually caused YRC to change business practices and \nrealize savings.  Id. at *10.  YRC denied that it implemented any strategies based on \nthe information in Vizant’s report or presentation and thus argued that it does not \nowe Vizant any fee.  Id.   \n14. YRC also argued that Vizant was unable to provide sufficient evidence to \nsupport its claim for ACH damages .  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 32 –33.)  In \nparticular, YRC attacked the opinions offered by one of Vizant’s experts, Scott \nEmmanuel (“Emmanuel”), who calculated Vizant’s claimed damages.  Vizant Techs., \n \n \nLLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *23.  By way of a post-discovery motion to strike, YRC \nasked the Court to strike Emmanuel’s opinions on Vizant’s claimed ACH  Damages, \ncontending that those opinions were speculative and unreliable.  Id.  In connection \nwith its Summary Judgment Motion, YRC argued that Vizant’s failure to put forward \nreliable evidence of ACH Damages required an entry of “judgment, as a matter of law, \nin YRC’s favor.”  (Def.’s Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 33.) \n15. In an Opinion dated June 26, 2018 , the Court made several conclusions as \nto the parties’ summary judgment motions.  First, the Court concluded that a genuine \nissue of material fact remained as to the interpretation of the PSA ’s fees provision \nthat precluded the Court from entering summary judgment  on that issue .  Vizant \nTechs., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *18.  Second, the Court concluded that even if \nYRC’s interpretation of the PSA was required as  a matter of law, Vizant had \npresented circumstantial evidence sufficient to create a question of fact as to whether \nYRC implemented the strategies found in Vizant’s report , i.e., evidence of a sharper \ndecline in credit card payments in the year following Vizant’s report which might \nsupport Vizant’s contention that YRC used the suggestions in the report.  Id. at *19.  \nThird, the Court concluded that questions of fact remained as to YRC’s obligations to \nprovide Vizant with certain financial data under the PS A.  Id. at * 21–22.  In \nconnection with YRC’s motion to strike, t he Court also concluded that Emmanuel’s \nopinions were speculative and unreliable.  Id. at *30.   The Court then denied both \nsides’ summary judgment motions  and struck Emmanuel’s opinions as to  Vizant’s \nACH Damages .  Id. at * 30–31.  The Court did not address YRC’s argument that \n \n \nsummary judgment should be granted in its favor due to Vizant’s inability to present \nreliable evidence of ACH Damages and made no conclusions as to the sufficiency of  \nVizant’s evidence concerning those damages. \n16. On August 6, 2018, YRC filed a motion under Rule 54(b) of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure asking the Court to reconsider its June 26 Opinion.  \nYRC asserted that the Court did not consider YRC’s request for partial summary \njudgment as to ACH Damages and argued that the Court’s decision to strike \nEmmanuel’s opinions as to ACH Damages and Vizant’s failure to offer other reliable \nevidence of such damages required that summary judgment be entered in YRC’s favor \nas to that aspect of Vizant’s claim.   \n17. Vizant argued against further consideration of its claimed ACH Damages at \nsummary judgment .  Both sides submitted briefs on YRC’s motion for \nreconsideration, and the Court held a hearing on the matter on August 30, 2018. \n18. On September  6, 2018, the Court entered an o rder on YRC’s motion for \nreconsideration.  The Court concluded that it was “clear that the issue of summary \njudgment as to Vizant’s ACH Damages was properly raised and before the Court” at \nsummary judgment and that “the Court did not address the sufficiency of Vizant’s \nevidence as to the ACH Damages portion of Vizant’s breach of contract claim or \nexpressly consider YRC’s request for summary judgment on that issue.”  (Order Def.’s \nMot. Reconsideration ¶ 9, ECF No. 205.)   Consequently, the Court concluded that \nYRC’s motion was not a motion for reconsideration but a request that the Court \n \n \ndecide an issue raised under Rule 56  but left unaddressed by the Court’s prior \ndecision.  (Order Def.’s Mot. Reconsideration ¶ 9.)   \n19. Further, to the extent the Court’s previous blanket denial of YRC’s \nSummary Judgment Motion “with regard to Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim ,” \nVizant Techs., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *31, could be read as a ruling on YRC’s \nrequest for summary judgment on the AC H Damages issue, the C ourt noted that \nNorth Carolina case law clearly “indicates that a trial court judge has the authority \nto reconsider his or her own summary judgment ruling ,” (Order Def.’s Mot. \nReconsideration ¶ 10); Levin v. Jacobson, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 66, at *5 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Aug. 25, 2016); see Miller v. Miller , 34 N.C. App. 209, 212, 237 S.E.2d 552, 555 \n(1977) ( “An order denying summary judgment is not  res judicata and a judge  is \nclearly within his rights in vacating such denial. ”); see also  Carr v. Great Lakes \nCarbon Corp., 49 N.C. App. 631, 635, 272 S.E.2d 374, 377 (1980) (“Miller presented \nthe question whether a judge who rules on a motion for summary judgment may \nthereafter strike the order, rehear the motion for summary judgment, and allow the \nmotion.  Such procedure does not involve one judge overruling another, and is proper \nunder Rule 60.”).  The Court therefore vacated its previous denial of YRC’s Summary \nJudgment Motion to the extent the Court’s decision could be read as denying YRC’s \nrequest for summary judgment as to ACH Damages.   (Order Def.’s Mot. \nReconsideration ¶ 10.) \n20. The Court allowed Vizant a period to supplement the record before the Court \nand provide additional briefing as to the sufficiency of Vizant’s ACH Damages at \n \n \nsummary judgment.  YRC was given an opportunity to respond to Vizant’s \nsupplemental filings.  The Court reserved its right to decide whether to hold a further \nhearing on YRC’s Summary Judgment Motion. \n21. Vizant and YRC both submitted supplemental briefs and exhibits to the \nCourt concerning Vizant’s  ACH Damages.  The issue is ripe for resolution, and the \nCourt elects, under the discretion afforded to it by Rule 7.4 of the General Rules of \nPractice and Procedure for the North Carolina Business Court, to decide this matter \nwithout a hearing. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n22. Under Rule 56 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary \njudgment is appropriate where there is “no genuine issue as to any material fact \nand . . . any party is entitled to  . . . judgment as a matter of law.”  Craig v. New \nHanover Cty. Bd. of Educ. , 363 N.C. 334, 337, 678 S.E.2d 351, 353 (2009) (quoting \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).   A fact is material if it “would constitute or would irrevocably \nestablish any material element of a claim or defense.”  Abner Corp. v. City Roofing & \nSheetmetal Co., 73 N.C. App. 470, 472, 326 S.E.2d 632, 633 (1985).  “[A] genuine issue \nis one which can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Kessing v. Nat’l Mortg. \nCorp., 278 N.C. 523, 534, 180 S.E.2d 823, 830 (1971).   “Substantial evidence is such \nrelevant evi dence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion and means more than a scintilla or a permissible inference.”   DeWitt v. \n \n \nEveready Battery Co. , 355 N.C. 672, 681, 565 S.E.2d 140, 146 (2002) (internal \ncitations omitted). \n23. “The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing that \nthere is no triable issue of material fac t.”  Nicholson v. Am. Safety Util. Corp. , 346 \nN.C. 767, 774, 488 S.E.2d 240, 244 (1997).  That burden may be met “by proving that \nan essential ele ment of the opposing party ’s claim is nonexistent,  or by showing \nthrough discovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support  an \nessential element of his claim[.]”  Collingwood v. Gen. Elec. Real Estate Equities, Inc., \n324 N.C. 63, 66, 376 S.E.2d 425, 427 (1989).  If the moving party makes this required \nshowing, “the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to produce a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts, as opposed to allegations, showing that he can at least \nestablish a prima facie case at trial.”  Gaunt v. Pittaway, 139 N.C. App. 778, 784–85, \n534 S.E.2d 660, 664 (2000).  All evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the \nnonmoving party.  DeWitt, 355 N.C. at 682, 565 S.E.2d at 146.   \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n24. In light of the Court’s decision to strike Vizant’s expert’s opinions on ACH \nDamages, YRC contends that Vizant is unable to forecast evidence from which a \nfactfinder could calculate Vizant’s ACH Damages with reasonable certainty.  Because \nVizant cannot produce evidence to support this element of its breach of contract claim, \nYRC argues that the Court should grant partial summary judgment in YRC’s favor \non the issue of ACH Damages. \n \n \n25. As a preliminary issue, the Court first addresses what choice of law applies \nto Vizant’s claim.  As a general rule, North Carolina courts will give a contractual \nchoice of law provision “effect unless the chosen state has no substantial connection to \nthe transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties’  choice, or  \nthe law of the chosen state violates a fundamental public policy of North Carolina .”  \nRecurrent Energy Dev. Holdings, LLC v. SunEnergy1, LLC , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 18, \nat *21–22 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 7, 2017) (citing Cable Tel Servs., Inc. v. Overland \nContracting, Inc. , 154 N.C. App. 639, 642 –43, 574 S.E.2d 31, 33 –34 (2002)).  The \nparties here have expressly agreed —and neither has since disputed —that Kansas \nlaw shall control “any controversy, dispute, or claim arising out of or related to”  the \nPSA.  (PSA § 19.)  Thus, Kansas law governs Vizant’s breach of contract claim.   See \nBayer CropScience LP v. Chemtura Corp., 2012 NCBC LEXIS 43, at *16 (N.C. Super. \nCt. July 13, 2012). \n26. In Kansas, the elements of a breach of contract claim are “(1) the existence \nof a contract between the parties; (2) sufficient consideration to support the contract; \n(3) the plaintiff’ s performance or willingness to perform in compliance with the \ncontract; (4) the defendant’ s breach of the contract; and (5) damages to the plaintiff \ncaused by th e breach.”  Stechschulte v. Jennings , 298 P.3d 1083, 1098 (Kan. 2013).  \nTo satisfy the damages element of the claim, a party “must not only show the injury \nsustained, but must also show with  reasonable certainty the amount of damage \nsuffered as a result of  the injury or breach.”   Venable v. Imp. Volkswagen, Inc., 519 \nP.2d 667, 674 (Kan. 1974).   “A party is not entitled to recover damages not the \n \n \nproximate result of the breach of contract and those which are remote, contingent, \nand speculative in character.”  State ex rel. Stovall v. Reliance Ins. Co., 107 P.3d 1219, \n1228 (Kan. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Consequently, the Supreme \nCourt of Kansas has stated that “[i]n order for the evidence to be sufficient to warrant \nrecovery of damages [for breach of contract] there must be some reasonable basis for \ncomputation which will enable the jury to arrive at an approximate estimate thereof.”  \nVenable, 519 P.2d at 674. \n27. Vizant presents three arguments in opposition to YRC’s request for partial \nsummary judgment.  First, Vizant argues that it has presented sufficient evidence to \nraise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether YRC implemented a strategy of \nswitching customers from credit card to ACH and achieved savings as a result of that \nstrategy.  Second, Vizant argues that, even in the absence of expert testimony on the \nsubject, it has provided sufficient evidence from which a jury could arrive at an \napproximate estimate of the claimed ACH Damages.  Third, Vizant contends that, at \nthe very least, it has provided the best evidence it could under the circumstances and \nthat it should not be penalized for evidentiary deficiencies caused by YRC.  The Court \nwill address YRC’s request for partial summary judgment by addressing each of these \ncounterarguments in turn. \nA. Vizant’s Evidence that YRC Implemented Identified Strategies \n \n28. Vizant’s first argument in its supplemental opposition brief effectively \nrevisits the Court’s previous decision.  There, the Court determined that Vizant’s \nforecast  evidence, “[w]hile circumstantial,” created an issue of fact as to whether YRC \n \n \nimplemented the strategies identified in Vizant’s report and achieved savings as a \nresult.  Vizant Techs., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *19.  Thus, in contending that \nit has presented enough evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to \nwhether YRC encouraged customers to switch to ACH, Vizant argues an already \ndecided issue that YRC’s request for partial summary judgment does not seek to \nrevisit.   \n29. Instead, YRC’s request for partial summary judgment challenges the \nadequacy of the evidence Vizant has put forward to show the amount of ACH \nDamages Vizant claims.  The issue before the Court now is thus not whether Vizant \ncan prove savings were achieved, or even whether Vizant can prove how the savings \nwere achieved, but rather whether Vizant can sufficiently show the amount of savings \nYRC achieved by convincing customers to switch to ACH.  In short, the Court must \ndecide whether Vizant’s evidence provides a reasonable basis for a factfinder to arrive \nat an approximation of Vizant’s ACH damages.  See Venable, 519 P.2d at 674.   The \nCourt thus turns to address that issue. \nB. Vizant’s Evidence of ACH Damages \n \n30. As to its ACH Damages evidence, Vizant argues that  “an issue of material \nfact remains as to whether YRC’s cost reductions must be causally linked to Vizant’s \nrecommendations in order for Vizant to recoup its fee under the PSA. ”  (Pl.’s \nSupplemental Br. Opp’n YRC’s Mot. Summ. J. 11 [hereinafter “Pl.’s Supplemental \nBr.”], ECF No. 209.)  “Thus,” Vizant continues, “all Vizant has to show is that it did \nnot get paid under  . . . the still -to-be-interpreted terms of the PSA to demonstrate \n \n \ndamages for purposes of summary judgmen t.”  ( Pl.’s Supplemental Br.  11.)  This \nassertion does not align with  the Court’s previous ruling or the law applicable to \nVizant’s claim. \n1. The Required Causal Connection Between YRC’s ACH Savings and \nVizant’s ACH Damages \n \n31. In its June 26 Opinion, the Court  held that an issue of fact remained  as to \nwhether Vizant’s right to a fee under the PSA was contingent upon Vizant’s report or \nrecommendations causing YRC to implement the alleged program of encouraging \ncustomers to switch from credit card payments to ACH.  See Vizant Techs., LLC, 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 65, at *18.   In essence, the Court found the evidence in dispute as to \nwhether (i) the parties inte nded Vizant to recoup a fee for simply identifying and \nrecommending strategies that led to savings , including strategies YRC decided to \nimplement independently or had already implemented , or (ii) the parties intended \nVizant to recoup a fee only in the event Vizant identified and recommended a new \nstrategy to YRC and YRC ended up implementing that strategy because of Vizant’s \nrecommendation.  Id. at *17–18.  The Court concluded that the PSA was ambiguous \non this issue and that  evidence in the record pointed to both interpretations being \nreasonable.  Id. at *14–15, *17–18. \n32. In either event, the Court also determined that the PSA required a causal \nconnection between a strategy of convincing customers to switch to ACH and YRC’s \nsavings that would be used to calculate Vizant’s fee.  Id. at *26.  The Court noted that \nVizant’s fee was not meant to be based on any “broad, kitchen-sink savings realized \nafter the execution of the PSA,” but only on those savings YRC achieved as the result \n \n \nof a strategy identified by Vizant.  Id.  Thus, Vizant may be entitled to a fee based on \nsavings resulting from customers switching from credit card to ACH  at YRC’s \nprompting, but Vizant is not entitled to a fee simply because YRC had fewer credit-\ncard-related costs after the PSA was executed.  See id. \n33. In sum, contrary to Vizant’s current argument, Vizant must do more than \nshow it was not paid  under the PSA to recover ACH Damages.  Vizant must also (i) \nprove that YRC achieved savings by convincing its customers to switch from credit \ncard to ACH, id., and (ii) show “with reasonable certainty the amount of damage[s]” \ncaused by any outstanding fee linked to those savings, Venable, 519 P.2d at 674.  The \nCourt has concluded that Vizant has forecast adequate evidence to survive summary \njudgment on the first of these points, see Vizant Techs., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, \nat *19, but must now determine whether the same is true of the second. \n2. The Sufficiency of Vizant’s Forecast ACH Damages Evidence \n \n34. YRC asserts that Vizant has not presented evidence showing the amount of \ncost savings YRC achieved as the result of any “switch-to-ACH” strategy.  Because \nthe source of Vizant’s ACH Damages is the alleged unpaid fee tied to such savings, \nYRC argues Vizant cannot prove its claimed ACH Damages with any reasonable \ncertainty.  While YRC does not appear to contest that some evidence in the record \nshows YRC experienced a decline in the number of customers paying with credit cards \nfollowing the PSA’s execution, YRC contends that Vizant has f ailed to forecast any \nevidence that would allow a reasonable factfinder to determine what portion of that \noverall decline resulted from YRC’s efforts to cause customers to switch to ACH.  YRC \n \n \nalso argues that Vizant’s evidence of general shifts in payment methods cannot \naccount for any incentives YRC paid customers to encourage their switch to ACH, \nanother factor YRC as serts is critical in determining the amount of money, if any, \nYRC actually saved from customers switching. \n35. Before post-discovery dispositive motions practice in this case, Vizant’s most \nsuccinct evidence addressing its claimed ACH Damage s was Emmanuel’s expert \nopinions.  The Court struck Emmanuel’s opinions related to ACH Damages after \nconcluding that they were based on insufficient data, were not the product of a \nreliable method, and were not the product of a method that was reliably applied to \nthe facts of the case.  Id. at *30.  The Court’s conclusions were based, in part, on \nEmmanuel’s o wn deposition testimony, wherein  he admitted several ways  his \ncalculations could not accurately show the amount YRC saved by customers moving \nfrom credit card to ACH: \nQ: In order to calculate how much YRC saved by customers moving from \ncredit card to ACH, you certainly ought to account for the amount that YRC \npaid its customers in incentives to make that move from credit card to ACH, \nright? \n \nA: Correct. \n \nQ: And you have not done that, have you? \n \nA: Correct.  \n \n(Emmanuel Dep. 123:24–124:6, ECF No. 90.10.)   \n \nQ: And you have no idea whether or not what you say was a drop in Visa, \nMasterCard or Discover payments had anything to do with YRC encouraging \na customer to pay by ACH instead of using one of those credit cards, right? \n \nA: Correct. \n \n \n \nQ: You have no idea whether those were the simple result of market forces \nwhere customers change their own  . . . payment type or leave and go to a \ndifferent trucking company, right? \n \n. . . . \n \nA: Correct. \n \n. . . .  \n \nQ: And you don’t know whether that reduction was caused by YRC \nimplementing some recommendation that Vizant put in its report, right? \n \nA: Correct. \n \nQ: All you know is that your math tells you that there was some reduction, \nand who in the world knows why it happened, right? \n \nA: Correct. \n \n(Emmanuel Dep. 111:14–112:1, 137:1–11.) \n \n36. In short, Emmanuel did not attempt to discern what portion of the decrease \nin YRC’s credit-card-related costs was due to customers switching to ACH; he simply \nassumed that each dollar saved should be attributed to a customer switching.  The \nCourt therefore concluded that Emmanuel’s opinions  on ACH Damages were  \nunreliable under North Carolina Rule of Evidence 702(a) and should be struck: \nUnder Emmanuel’s calcul ation, as described by his own testimony, true \nsavings caused by YRC’s customers switching to ACH payments and other \nfactors leading to a reduction in customers paying with credit cards —for \nexample, a reduction in credit card payments due to lost business—would all \nhave been counted as savings for which YRC owed Vizant a fee.  . . . This \ncalculation (i) does not abide by the formula in the PSA, which requires a \ncomparison of pre -agreement costs to post -agreement costs resulting from \nstrategies identified by Vizant, (ii) rests on unjustifiable assumptions, and \n \n \n(iii) could mislead a jury into awarding Vizant damages for what was in \nreality a loss in YRC’s business. \n \nVizant Techs., LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 65, at *29. \n \n37. The Court’s previous analysis of Emmanuel’s ACH  Damages opinions is \npertinent to the matter sub judice  because Vizant’s remaining evidence of ACH \nDamages suffers from the same flaws .  All of Vizant’s evidence shows nothing more \nthan a net decrease in credit-card-related costs in the months and years following the \nPSA and a net trend towards increasing ACH payments.  Simply put, Vizant has no \nevidence that can reasonably approximate what, if any, reduction in YRC’s credit card \ncosts is attributable to encouraging customers to switch to ACH. \n38. For example, the previously presented chart appearing at the top of page \nseven of Vizant’s supplemental brief (the contents of which remain under seal) shows \na general shift towards a greater number of ACH payments and fewer  credit card \npayments during the years  2014–2017, but the total number of each kind of \ntransaction oscillates considerably over that time -span.  (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 7.)   \nThe chart provides a factfinder with nothing more than Emmanuel’s previously \nstricken opinions and invites jurors to engage in the same speculative analysis by \nattempting to discern, without any identifiable framework, what percentage of the \nshown changes occurred due to YRC encouraging  customers to switch  payment \nmethods. \n39. Vizant’s supplementation of the record provides no additional evidence to \nremedy this problem.  Along with its supplemental brief, Vizant submitted twelve \nYRC-produced spreadsheets in pdf and Excel format (“Exhibits 1–12”).  Vizant gives \n \n \nlittle explanation to assist the Court in navigating these spr eadsheets, but contends \nthat Exhibits 1 and 5 represent “ the monetary impact of YRC’s 2015 ACH initiative \nwithin each of YRC’s operating companies,” (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 12), and that \nExhibits 4 and 5 show YRC’s subsidiaries’ revenues by payment type , ( Pl.’s \nSupplemental Br. 14) .  Vizant asserts that it “can argue that YRC’s own evidence \n[shows] the monetary impact of its ACH initiative . . . within the company” and that \nthis “is a reasonable basis on which to calculate the [ACH Damages] figure.”  (Pl.’s \nSupplemental Br. 12.)  The Court has reviewed each spreadsheet and disagrees. \n40. Exhibits 2 and 3 showcase information on YRC’s subsidiaries’ top credit card \naccounts for May 2016 (See Pl.’s Supplemental Br. Exs. 2–3, ECF No. 209.1.)  These \nexhibits do not present any information that would aid a jury in determining whether \ncustomers switched from credit card to ACH or, if so, why they switched.  Exhibits 4 \nand 5 summarize YRC’s revenue and deposits by month from 2013 –2017.  (See Pl.’s \nSupplemental Br. Exs. 4–5, ECF No. 209.1.)  These spreadsheets track the change in \ndeposits by payment type per month for YRC and its subsidiaries, but still provide no \nexplanation for any changes.  Exhibit 6 shows the percentage of YRC’s total deposits \nthat were attributable to credit cards from 2006 –2011.  (See Pl.’s Supplemental Br. \nEx. 6, ECF No. 209.2.)  This exhibit provides no explanation for changes in credit card \ndeposits over time and is outside the time-period relevant for this case.   \n41. Exhibits 7 and 8  show YRC’s credit card revenues broken down by major \ncredit card company and report YRC’s credit card fees for the years 2010–2014.  (See \nPl.’s Supplemental Br. Exs. 7 –8, ECF No. 209.2.)   Exhibit 9 reports credit card \n \n \nrevenue per major credit card company  for YRC’s subsidiaries from October 2015 –\nJanuary 2016.  (See Pl.’s Supplemental Br. Ex. 9, ECF No. 209.2.)   Exhibits 10, 11, \nand 12 break down credit card revenue for YRC and its subsidiaries by month in 2014, \n2016, and 2017 respectively.  (See Pl.’s Supplemental Br. Exs. 10–12, ECF No. 209.3.)  \nNone of these spreadsheets illuminate whether customers switched from credit card \npayments to ACH or why they switched. \n42. Vizant contends that Exhibit 1  to its supplemental brief , an Excel \nspreadsheet Vizant  labeled “ACH Migration Program Impact Sheet,” shows the \nmonetary impact of YRC’s 2015 “ACH initiative.”   (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 12; Index \nSupp. Materials for Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 1, ECF No. 209.1; Pl.’s Supplemental Br. \nEx. 1, ECF No. 209.1.)   YRC, however, argues that this representation is false  and \nbased solely on Plaintiff’s counsel’s interpretation  of Exhibit 1.  According to YRC,  \nExhibit 1 is actually a n unused template created by Abraham Bailin (“Bailin”), the \nfinance manager of one of YRC’s subsidiaries.  (Bailin Aff. ¶¶ 2, 4, 6, ECF No. 213.2.)  \n43. In an affidavit submitted to the Court with YRC’s supplemental brief, Bailin \nstates that he never labeled Exhibit 1 “ACH Migration Program Impact Spreadsheet” \nand that Vizant created that title.  (Bailin  Aff. ¶ 4.)  Bailin also states that Vizant’s \ncharacterization of Exhibit 1 is incorrect.  (Bailin Af f. ¶ 5.)  Bailin testifies  that he \ncreated Exhibit 1 in mid -2016 upon YRC’s request and that Exhibit 1 “does not \nprovide any information about any actual results of any effort to convince customers \nto pay by ACH instead of by credit card .”  (Bailin Aff. ¶ 6.)  Instead, according to \nBailin’s understanding, Exhibit 1 was meant to forecast the financial impact of a \n \n \nscenario in which YRC “essentially mandate[d] that customers  . . . stop paying by \ncredit card.”  (Bailin Aff. ¶ 11.)  Bailin states that upper management rejected that \nstrategy and that, to the best of his knowledge, Exhibit 1 was never used to forecast \nthe financial impact of any program  that was actually implemented.  (Bailin Aff. ¶ \n11.)   \n44. According to Bailin —with the exception of  the revenue and accounts \nreceivable figures from May 2015–April 2016; the April and May 2016 top credit card \naccount figures; credit card revenue figures from January  2015–June 2016; and the \npayment terms YRC had with certain third-party logistics companies —the entirety \nof the figures contained in Exhibit 1  are forecast numbers, placeholder variables \nBailin created to build the model, or figures the model generated by processing actual \nfigures and placeholder variables.   (Bailin Aff. ¶¶ 7, 8 14.)   If YRC actually used \nExhibit 1, Bailin states, “it would have been up to the user” to input new figures based \non known or assumed statistics.  (Bailin Aff. ¶¶ 14–16.) \n45. The Court has reviewed Exhibit 1’s contents and concludes that they \ncorroborate Bailin’s affidavit testimony.  First of all, Exhibit 1 makes the assumption \nthat 100% of the operating revenue eligible to move from credit card payments to \nsome other form of payment would do so,  (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. Ex. 1),  an \nassumption that would not conceivably play out in the real world.  Further, while the \nCourt must view the facts on YRC’s Summary Judgment Motion  in the light most \nfavorable to Vizant, the Court cannot ignore the disparity between  YRC’s \ncharacterization of Exhibit 1 , which  is supported by an affidavit , and  Vizant’s \n \n \ndescription of Exhibit 1, which is supported by nothing more than counsel’s argument \nin Vizant’s supplemental brief.  In light of this lack of evidentiary support for Vizant’s \ninterpretation of Exhibit 1, the Court concludes that Exhibit 1 does not provide any \ninformation from which  a factfinder  could reasonably approximate Vizant’s ACH \nDamages.  See Cone v. Cone, 50 N.C. App. 343, 347, 274 S.E.2d 341, 343 –44 (1981) \n(“When a party, in a motion for summary judgment, presents an argument or defense \nsupported by facts which would entitle him to judgment as a matter of law, the party \nopposing the motion ‘must present a forecast of the evidence which will be available \nfor presentation at trial and which will tend to support his claim for relief.’” (quoting \nBest v. Perry, 41 N.C. App. 107, 110, 254 S.E.2d 281, 284 (1979))) ; Huss v. Huss, 31 \nN.C. App. 463, 466, 230 S.E.2d 159, 161 –62 (1976) (“On a motion for summary \njudgment[,] the court may consider evidence consisting of affidavits, depositions, \nanswers to interrogatories, admissi ons, documentary materials, facts which are \nsubject to judicial notice, and any other materials which would be admissible in \nevidence at trial.”); see also Ronald G. Hinson Elec., Inc. v. Union Cty. Bd. of Educ. , \n125 N.C. App. 373, 379, 481 S.E.2d 326, 330 (1997) (noting that unsworn statements \nby a party’s attorney are not considered evidence at trial). \n46. The testimony of Patrick Moran (“Moran”), another of Vizant’s designated \nexperts, does nothing to remedy the problems with Vizant’s evidence.  Moran testified \nthat YRC’s increase in ACH payments and decrease in credit card payments went \nagainst industry trends because market data showed credit card usage increasing.  \n(Moran Dep. 153:1–21, ECF No. 209.5.)  Moran also testified that he believed a loss \n \n \nin busin ess could not account for the total decrease in  credit card payments YRC \nexperienced.  (Moran Dep. 153:22–154:19.)  This evidence goes to whether YRC was \nencouraging customers to switch to ACH but provides nothing from which a \nreasonable factfinder could begin to approximate what part of YRC’s savings resulted \nfrom any such effort. \n47. Further, YRC is correct that none of the above -mentioned evidence would \nallow a jury to “account for the amount that YRC paid its customers in incentives to \nmake that move from c redit card to ACH,” a consideration that Vizant’s own expert \nagrees is necessary to calculate YRC’s savings.  (Emmanuel Dep. 123:24 –124:6.)  \nNone of Vizant’s evidence, with the exception of Exhibit 1’s placeholder variables, \naddresses any financial incentives, real or forecast, associated with YRC encouraging \ncustomers to switch to ACH.  While this aspect of the ACH Damages calculation may \nbe more nuanced than those issues already discussed, it showcases yet another way \nVizant’s proffered evidence provides no details about what savings YRC actually \nrealized or may have realized as a result of switching customers to ACH.   \n3. Vizant’s Contentions of the “Best Evidence Available” \n \n48. Vizant’s third and final  argument assert s that “[a]ny difficulties in \ncalculating damages from [the submitted] data is a result of the manner [in which] \nYRC itself maintains the data, not Vizant’s failure to bring forth sufficient evidence” \nand that YRC’s inability to track shifts from credit card payments to ACH payments \n“cannot serve as a basis for granting YRC summary judgment.”  (Pl.’s Supplemental \nBr. 15.)  To support this assertion that it “should not be penalized” for YRC’s failure \n \n \nto “keep necessary records,” (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 13), Vizant cites New Dimensions \nProducts, Inc. v. Flambeau Corp. , 844 P.2d 768 (Kan. Ct. App. 1993).  That case , \nhowever, is inapposite. \n49. In New Dimensions, a defendant with “exclusive control over all the records” \nuseful in calculating damages “consisten tly denied” that suc h records existed until \nthe first day of a bench trial.  Id. at 771, 774.  The trial court ordered the records to \nbe produced, allowed the plaintiff to introduce the evidence, and sanctioned the \ndefendant.  Id. at 771.  The evidence finally admitted was imperfect, and the trial \ncourt made certain inferences and assumptions in calculating part s of the plaintiff’s \ndamages for which no evidence existed .  See id. at 771–72, 774.  The trial court’s \naward was affirmed as an exercise of its equitable power to make the plaintiff whole \nby resolving the question of damages “on the best evidence available.”  Id. at 771–73; \nsee also Gillespie v. Seymour, 823 P.2d 782, 797 (Kan. 1991) (“ In assessing damages \nit is within the discretion of the trial court to apply equitable standards in order that \nthe plaintiff may be made whole.”) \n50. In contrast to New Dimensions, here there is no evidence YRC failed to keep \nnecessary records or wrongfully refused to produce records to Vizant.  YRC’s inability \nto track figures that would easily show Vizant ’s ACH Damages did not emerge \nsuddenly when the possibility of lit igation seemed imminent.  Indeed, Vizant’s \nsupplemental evidence reveals a conversation  taking place months before the \ncompanies’ relationship fell apart in which YRC personnel discuss their inability to \ntrack per-customer credit-card-to-ACH changes. (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. Ex. 24, at 1, \n \n \nECF No. 209.4.)  The Court will not relieve Vizant of its burden to prove its case \nsimply because YRC did not keep records that may be convenient to proving that case.  \nBelot v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 497, 4 P.3d 626, 629 (Kan. Ct. App. 2000) (“The burden \nof proving the damages rests on the plaintiff.”). \n51. Furthermore, YRC is not the only entity with access to data that would have \nbeen useful to Vizant in making its damages case.  During discovery, YRC produced \nmultiple documents to Vizant listing YRC’s top credit card customer accounts at \nvarious points in time.  (See Pl.’s Supplemental Br. Exs. 2, 9.)  Each of these customers \nlikely would have possessed data on their methods of paying YRC and would  have \nbeen the best source for evidence tending to show why customers switched from credit \ncard to ACH, i.e., whether they did so because of a YRC strategy or because of \nconvenience, market forces, changes in credit card benefits, or other factors.  Despite \nthis, the record before the Court does not show any attem pt by Vizant to obtain \ndiscovery from these nonparties.  The Court does not believe Vizant is entitled to an \nequitable easing of its burden of proof in such circumstances.  See New Dimensions, \n884 P.2d at 774 (stating that evidence is sufficient where it “shows the extent of the \ndamages as a matter of just and reasonable inference,” but reaffirming that “damages \nmay not be determined by mere speculation or guess” (quoting Vanguard Ins. Co. v. \nConnett, 270 F.2d 868, 870 (10th Cir. 1959))). \n52. In sum, none of the evidence Vizant presents to the Court would “enable the \njury to arrive at an approximate estimate” of Vizant’s ACH Damages.  See Venable, \n519 P.2d at 674.  At most, the forecast evidence shows that YRC’s credit card revenue \n \n \nand credit-card-related costs decreased in the months following the execution of the \nPSA and that YRC’s ACH revenue increased.  While Vizant argues that “these records \nare sufficient to allow a jury to arrive at a reasonable calculation of Vizant’s damages, \nincluding the ACH subcategory,” (Pl.’s Supplemental Br. 15), without any evidence \nallowing a factfinder to even begin to discern what portion of Y RC’s reduced credit \ncard costs may have been tied to YRC’s efforts to switch customers to paying by ACH, \npresenting the current record to a jury and asking it to approximate the claimed ACH \nDamages would be asking jurors to engage in the same speculation t hat formed the \nbasis for Emmanuel’s unreliable opinions.  Kansas law does not allow for Vizant to \nrecover damages on such evidence.  See Reliance Ins. Co., 107 P.3d at 1228 (“A party \nis not entitled to recover damages not the proximate result of the breach  of contract \nand those which are remote, contingent, and speculative in character.”  (internal \nquotation marks omitted)).2   \n53. In light of the above, the Court concludes that YRC has met its burden on \nsummary judgment by showing that Vizant cannot produce evi dence to support its \nclaimed ACH Damages.  Vizant has failed to respond with  a forecast of evidence \ndemonstrating specific facts to prove this element of its brea ch of contract claim at \ntrial.  The Court therefore concludes that summary judgment should be granted in \n                                                 \n2  The Court notes that its conclusion herein would be identical under North Carolina law, \nwhich provides that “the party seeking damages must show that the amount of damages is \nbased upon a standard that will allow the finder of  fact to calculate the amount of damages \nwith reasonable certainty.”  Olivetti Corp. v. Ames Bus. Sys., Inc., 319 N.C. 534, 547–48, 356 \nS.E.2d 578, 586 (1987). \n \n \nYRC’s favor as to Vizant’s claimed ACH Damages.  See Gaunt, 139 N.C. App. at 784–\n85, 534 S.E.2d at 664. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n54. WHEREFORE, the Court hereby AMENDS its June 26, 2018  Order and \nOpinion on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment and Defendant’s Motion to Strike \nand ORDERS as follows: \na. YRC’s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in part .  \nVizant shall not recover damages relating to savings YRC purportedly \nachieved as a result of any strategy  aimed at  causing customers to \nswitch from credit card payments to ACH payments. \nb. YRC’s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment is otherwise DENIED with \nregard to Vizant’s breach of contract claim. \nc. Except as otherwise stated herein, the Court’s decisions in its June 26, \n2018 Order and Opinion are unaffected by this ruling. \nSO ORDERED, this the 15th day of November, 2018.3 \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III    \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III \n     Chief Business Court Judge \n \n                                                 \n3  This Order and Opinion was originally filed under seal on November 15, 2018.  This public \nversion of the Order and Opinion is being filed on November 19, 2018.  Because this public \nversion of the Order and Opinion does not contain any substantive changes from the version \nfiled under seal as to constitute an amendment, and to avoid confusion in the  event of an \nappeal, the Court has elected to state the filing date of the public version of the Order and \nOpinion as November 15, 2018.
