These civil actions arise from the sale (the \"Sale\") of Frontier Spinning \nMills, Inc. (\"Frontier\"), a closely-held corporation in which Plaintiffs were minority \nshareholders.  Frontier was sold to Sun Capital (\"Sun\"), a private equity firm. \n2. Among other things, the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants wrongfully \ncaused the Sale to be structured so that shareholders of a single class of Frontier \ncommon stock were divided into two classes for sale and pricing purposes – the \nPlaintiffs (\"Outside Shareholders\") and the shareholding Defendants (\"Inside \nShareholders\").  The Plaintiffs complain about the fact that the Outside Shareholders \nwere paid less per share than the similarly situated Inside Shareholders when the Sale \nclosed. \n3. The Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants failed to disclose certain \nmaterial facts concerning the Sale and affirmatively made materially misleading \nstatements in order to create a sense of desperation about Frontier's financial condition \nprior to the Sale.  They allege that this induced the Plaintiffs to accept a \ndisproportionately lower share of the purchase price from the Frontier Sale. \n4. Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs were informed fully about how the \nSale was structured, including the disparate pricing of the shares held by Outside \nShareholders and Inside Shareholders.  Further, they contend that by signing a Stock \nPurchase Agreement (\"SPA\") and a separate release relative to the Sale, the Plaintiffs \nknowingly ratified and approved the very things they now are complaining about.  \nDefendants further point out that the SPA contained a specific acknowledgement by \nPlaintiffs that they were approving the Sale knowing that they lacked certain \"Seller \nExcluded Information\" that either then was or later might come into the possession of \nSun and the Inside Shareholders.   Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs should not \nbe heard to complain because any Outside Shareholders who did not want to approve \nthe Sale had a right to dissent and receive \"fair value\" for their shares pursuant to N.C. \nGen. Stat. §55-11-04.1 \n5. In responding to the substantive allegations of the Complaint, the \nDefendants have pled a number of affirmative defenses.  One of those defenses is that \nDefendants were relying on the advice of counsel with regard to material parts of how \nthe Sale was structured, including but not limited to the provision of two disparate \npurchase prices for the respective Frontier shares held by the Outside Shareholders \nand the Inside Shareholders.  This defense has been raised both in the context of \nanswers by one or more Defendants during oral depositions\n2 and by the formal filing of \na Sixth Affirmative Defense (\"Sixth Defense\"), allowed as an amendment to Defendants' \nAnswer by Order of this court on June 29, 2011.3  The Sixth Defense states that: \nIn response to all Plaintiffs' claims based on allegations of \nillegal disparate treatment of \"Outside Shareholders\" and the \n\"Inside Shareholders\" and all Plaintiffs' Claims based upon \nallegations of insufficient mate rial disclosures in the Stock \nPurchase Agreement and ot herwise, which Defendants \nspecifically deny, and if it is determined that there was illegal \ndisparate treatment of the \"O utside Shareholder[s]\" and the \n\"Inside Shareholders\"  or insufficient material disclosure in \nthe Stock Purchase Agreement and otherwise , which the \nDefendants specifically deny, then Defendants assert that in \n                                                 \n1  None of the potential dispositive substantive issues raised by Defendants' contentions are formally \nbefore the court at this time. \n2 See testimony given by former Frontier CEO, George R. Perkins (\"Perkins\"), Perkins Dep. 125:23 – \n126:11; and by former Frontier CFO, Barbara F. Walton (\"Walton\"), Walton Dep. 161:15-16. \n3 Defendants have argued that the defense is not raised formally, and therefore no waiver is effected, by \nthe act of a Defendant-deponent providing an answer that in substance says the Defendant relied upon \nthe advice of counsel in undertaking certain actions with regard to the Sale.  Rather, they argue that a \nprivilege waiver can only arise when the advice of counsel is relied upon formally, and then only in the \nnarrow context of the issue(s) raised by that reliance.  The reported cases Defendants rely upon do not \nappear supportive of Defendants' position.  However, in the context of this matter, given the broad form of \nthe Sixth Defense, the court concludes that Defendants' position makes a distinction without a difference. \nthe discharge of any legal res ponsibilities with respect to \nthese allegations, they relied on the advice of counsel.4  \n  \n6. The Plaintiffs contend that by ra ising the defense that Defendants relied \nupon the advice of counsel, Defendants have waived any attorney-client privilege or \nwork-product privilege between them and counsel with regard to all aspects of the \nSale.5  Specifically, Plaintiffs seek to discover information and to depose the \nDefendants and Frontier counsel, Jamie Clarke, Esq. (\"Clarke\"), of the firm Moore & \nVan Allen, PLLC (\"MVA\"), free of attorney-client or work-product privilege constraints. \n7. In response, the Defendants argue that any such waivers must be very \nnarrowly limited in scope.  They contend that any waiver of the attorney-client privilege \narising from the advice of counsel defense must be confined to specific communications \nthat are related to the subject matter for which the defense is asserted.  Further, \nDefendants argue in substance that a waiver of the attorney-client privilege does not \nconstitute a waiver of the work-product privilege, since the latter involves mental \nprocesses of the attorney and is not necessarily communicated to the client.  Among \nother things, they contend that unless work product was communicated to the client, it \ncould not have been relied upon by the client and should not be discoverable as part of \nan attorney-client waiver.   \n8. The deposition testimony of Perkins and Walton reflects broad reliance by \nDefendants upon the advice of counsel in the context of defending Plaintiffs' allegations \nin this civil action.  The Sixth Defense formally raises the advice of counsel defense in \n                                                 \n4 Am. Answer, Sixth Def. (emphasis added). \n5 Plaintiffs also contend that an \"advice of counsel\" defense, as apparently contemplated by N.C. Gen. \nStat. § 55-8-42, is not available to all or some of the Defendants here.  Although that issue is not formally \nbefore the court at this time, for the limited purposes of this Order the Sixth Defense is deemed to be \nviable as to all Defendants.   \nthree categories: (a) the alleged disparate share pricing treatment of Outside \nShareholders and Inside Shareholders, (b) material disclosures in the SPA and (c) \n\"otherwise.\"  The first category, alleged disparate treatment of the respective \nshareholders, is relatively narrow and susceptible to reasonable definition.  The second \ncategory, alleged insufficient material disclosures in the SPA, is not as narrow.  In the \ncontext of the material allegations in the Complaint, it is not as susceptible to definition.  \nThe third category, \"otherwise,\" is so broad as to be elusive of clear and reasonable \ndefinition. \nAttorney-Client Privilege \n9. The attorney-client privilege long has been a fundamental principle of \nclient-lawyer confidentiality.6  It is one of the cornerstones of the trust that is the \n\"hallmark of the client-lawyer relationship,\"7 and it is not cavalierly invaded by our \ncourts.  However, as Plaintiffs here contend, and Defendants concede, there is ample \nauthority supporting the proposition that the act of raising an advice of counsel defense \nwaives the attorney-client privilege with regard to certain matters in a particular dispute.  \nState v. Fair, 354 N.C. 131 (2001); Jones v. Marble Co., 137 N.C. 185 (1904)8  The \nscope of the waiver is the thorny issue that has caused problems for courts and \nlitigants.  Plaintiffs argue for a broader waiver, relying heavily upon Panter v. Marshall \nField & Co., 80 F.R.D. 718 (D.C. Ill. 1978); and Defendants argue for a more narrow \nwaiver.  Although the reported cases are inconsistent, there is persuasive authority to \nthe effect that such a waiver is limited to communications with counsel involving the \n                                                 \n6 Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6, n. 2, 3. \n7 Id. at n. 2. \n8 This reported case is cited as being located at 137 N.C. 237, and the Cases Reported directory of \nVolume 137 of the North Carolina Reports shows it as being published at p. 237.  However, in reality it is \npublished in Volume 137 at p. 185. \nspecific conduct complained of and ostensibly excused by the advice of counsel \ndefense.  According to such authority, the waiver does not include all communications \nbetween the client and counsel, but rather only those reasonably related to the conduct \nin question.  This court, in Bank of America Securities, LLC v. Evergreen International \nAviation, Inc., 2006 NCBC 2 ¶ 27 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 25, 2006), observed that an \nattorney's advice: \ndoes not necessarily become in issue merely because the \nattorney's advice might affect the client's state of mind in a \nrelevant manner.  Instead, the advi ce of counsel is placed in \nissue where the client asse rts a claim or defense, and \nattempts to prove that claim or defense by disclosing or \ndescribing an attorney client communication. \n \n10. The problem presented in the instant  matter is that, notwithstanding their \narguments to the contrary, the Defendants have elected to raise the advice of counsel \ndefense in a very broad fashion.  It would not have been difficult to limit the factual \ncontext of the Sixth Defense, and potentially any resulting waiver of attorney-client \nprivilege, by limiting the wording of the defense.9  By example, the Sixth Defense could \nhave been limited to advice relied upon with regard to the alleged disparate treatment of \nOutside Shareholders and Inside Shareholders.  However, rather than limit the breadth \nand scope of the Sixth Defense, the Defendants took the opposite course.  They \nbroadly allege that they relied upon the advice of counsel relative to the disparate share \npricing, any material disclosures in the SPA and \"otherwise.\"  Such broad language \nmakes it extremely difficult for the court to define fairly and reasonably where any \nresulting waiver of the attorney-client privilege begins and ends.  While there has been \na waiver of the attorney-client privilege as to communications between the Defendants \n                                                 \n9 In view of this analysis, there is no need to determine what attorney-client waiver, if any, would have \nbeen effected by the deposition testimony of various Defendants had the Sixth Defense not been lodged. \nand Clarke with regard to the Sale, the waiver is not without reasonable limitations, as \nreflected below. \n11. Accordingly, the court CONCLUDES t hat, having raised the Sixth Defense \nin such a broad form, the Defendants have waived the attorney-client privilege as to all \ncommunications, in any form, between any Defendants and Clarke that took place on or \nbefore the March 17, 2008 closing of the Sale and which reasonably relate to: \n(a) The mechanics of and manner in which the Sale was structured; \n(b) The manner in which informa tion concerning the Sale was \ndisclosed to any of the Outside Shareholders; \n(c) The legality of the Sa le and its structure, including considerations of \n(i) the disparate pricing structure between Inside Shareholders and Outside \nShareholders and (ii) the Seller Excluded Information provision in the SPA; \n(d) The manner and level of information disclosed in or omitted from \nthe SPA; and \n(e) The risks and impact of fiduciary dut y considerations on the part of \nany Defendants relative to the Sale. \nWork-Product Privilege \n \n12. The work-product privilege is anot her fundamentally important concept \nthat supports and fosters the principle of client-lawyer confidentiality.10  However, as is \nthe case with the attorney-client privilege, the enforceability of the work-product \nprivilege sometimes becomes an issue when a civil litigant elects to raise an advice of \ncounsel defense. \n                                                 \n10 Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6, n. 3. \n13. As discussed above, the Defendants here vigorously argue that a waiver \nof the attorney-client privilege does not necessarily lead to a waiver of the work-product \nprivilege.  The Plaintiffs argue to the contrary, contending that when reliance upon \nadvice of counsel is raised defensively, one of the underlying fundamental issues is the \nreasonableness of the contended reliance.11  They argue that they should be entitled to \ndiscover attorney work product relevant to the advice ostensibly relied upon in order to \nexamine the underlying good faith and reasonableness of that advice.  Plaintiffs' \narguments are based upon the concepts of (i) waiver, as discussed above with regard \nto the attorney-client privilege and (ii) compelling need12 as discussed below. \n14. This court is not aware of any reported North Carolina appellate cases \ndirectly on point on this issue.  However, other jurisdictions have held that in this \ncontext, fairness dictates the necessity for an examination of the underlying good faith \nand reasonableness of the advice itself, including the circumstances surrounding \nissuance of the legal opinion, and that relevant work product therefore loses its privilege \nprotections.  In the final analysis, it does not make a substantive difference whether the \nunderlying theory of production is one of waiver or of compelling need.  Either way, the \nprivilege is overcome by the need for production.  Panter, 80 F.R.D. at 726; Handgards, \nInc. v. Johnson & Johnson, 413 F. Supp. 926 (N.D. Cal. 1976); Garfinkle v. Arcata Nat. \n                                                 \n11 Among other things, Plaintiffs cite N.C. Gen. Stat. § 55-8-42 for the proposition that to the extent the \nadvice of counsel defense is available to a corporate officer, the officer must have reasonably believed \nthat the advice was within the attorney's professional competence.   \n12 Plaintiffs contend the production they seek is not restricted by the language of Rule 26(b)(3), which only \napplies, upon a showing of \"substantial need\" and \"undue hardship,\" to production of materials prepared \nin anticipation of litigation or for trial and not constituting \"mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or \nlegal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation in which the \nmaterial is sought or work product of the attorney or attorneys of record in the particular action.\"  They \ncontend that the materials they seek do not fall within the Rule 26(b)(3) discovery limitations because the \nmaterials (a) were prepared years ago and not in anticipation of litigation, (b) do not constitute mental \nimpressions, etc. of an attorney or party representative concerning this particular litigation and (c) do not \nseek work product of an attorney of record for Defendants in this matter.   \nCorp., 64 F.R.D. 688, 689 (S.D.N.Y. 1974).  See also Netalog v. Giffin Tech., 2006 WL \n1666747, *3 (M.D.N.C. 2006).  While not binding upon this court, those cases are \ninstructive. \n15. Accordingly, the court CONCLUDES tha t, in light of its determination that \nfiling of the Defendants' Sixth Defense resulted in a waiver of the attorney-client \nprivilege between Defendants and Clarke, the same filing (i) resulted in a waiver of the \nwork-product privilege and/or (ii) gave rise to a compelling need for discovery by \nPlaintiffs with regard to Clarke's and MVA's work product while acting as Frontier legal \ncounsel relative to the Sale.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery, as limited \nbelow, with regard to all notes, documents, e-mails, memoranda, communications or \nother materials, whether in tangible, electronic or other form, that reflect conversations \nbetween any Defendants and Clarke, or between Clarke and other attorneys at MVA, \nthat took place on or before the March 17, 2008 closing of the Sale and which relate to: \n(a) The mechanics of and manner in which the Sale was structured; \n(b) The manner in which informa tion concerning the Sale was \ndisclosed to any of the Outside Shareholders; \n(c) The legality of the Sa le and its structure, including considerations of \n(i) the disparate pricing structure between Inside Shareholders and Outside \nShareholders and (ii) the Seller Excluded Information provision in the SPA; \n(d) The manner and level of information disclosed in or omitted from \nthe SPA; and \n(e) The risks and impact of fiduciary dut y considerations on the part of \nany Defendants relative to the Sale. \nNOW THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing FINDINGS and CONCLUSIONS, \nPlaintiffs' Motion is GRANTED, in part, and it is ORDERED that: \n1. On or before November 16, 2011,  upon appropriate notice given, the \nPlaintiffs may depose Defendants and Clarke with regard to all communications, in any \nform, between any Defendants and Clarke that took place on or before the March 17, \n2008 closing of the Sale and which reasonably relate to: \n(a) The mechanics of and manner in which the Sale was structured; \n(b)  The manner in which information concerning the Sale was \ndisclosed to any of the Outside Shareholders; \n(c) The legality of the Sa le and its structure, including considerations of \n(i) the disparate pricing structure between Inside Shareholders and Outside \nShareholders and (ii) the Seller Excluded Information provision in the SPA; \n(d) The manner and level of information disclosed in or omitted from \nthe SPA; and \n(e) The risks and impact of fiduciary dut y considerations on the part of \nany Defendants relative to the Sale. \n2. With regard to the foregoing te stimony, neither Defendants nor Clarke \nshall fail to respond to propounded questions upon claim of attorney-client privilege. \n3. On or before October 26, 2011,  Defendants, Clarke and MVA shall \nproduce to Plaintiffs all notes, documents, communications or other materials, whether \nin tangible, electronic or other form, that reflect conversations between any Defendants \nand Clarke, or between Clarke and other attorneys at MVA, that took place on or before \nthe March 17, 2008 closing of the Sale and which relate to: \n(a) The mechanics of and manner in which the Sale was structured; \n(b) The manner in which informa tion concerning the Sale was \ndisclosed to any of the Outside Shareholders; \n(c) The legality of the Sa le and its structure, including considerations of \n(i) the disparate pricing structure between Inside Shareholders and Outside \nShareholders and (ii) the Seller Excluded Information provision in the SPA; \n(d) The manner and level of information disclosed in or omitted from \nthe SPA; and \n(e) The risks and impact of fiduciary dut y considerations on the part of \nany Defendants relative to the Sale. \n4. With regard to the foregoing pr oduction, neither Defendants, nor Clarke \nnor MVA shall fail to respond upon claim of work-product privilege. \n5. The Case Management Order in  this matter will be amended under \nseparate Order of even date herewith to accommodate the foregoing discovery. \n6. Except as ORDERED herein, Plaintiffs' Motion is DENIED. \nThis the 6th day of October, 2011. \n           \n "
