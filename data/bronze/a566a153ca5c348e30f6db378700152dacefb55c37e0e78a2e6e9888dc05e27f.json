Mazzariello for Plaintiff Action Performance Companies, Inc. and Third Party Defendant Fred\nWagenhals.\n \nI.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA.\nTHE SPORTS QUEST AND DEI DISPUTE\n \n{5}\n \n      \nSports Quest is a North Carolina corporation with its principal office and place of business in\nIredell County, North Carolina.\n  \nSports Quest enters into licensing agreements with NASCAR racing\nteams to obtain the rights to market merchandise that bears the intellectual property of these organizations,\nincluding various trademarked and copyrighted items.\n  \nKenneth Frady (“Frady”) is the founder and sole\nowner of Sports Quest.\n{6}\n \n      \nDEI \nis also a North Carolina corporation with its principal office and place of business in Iredell\nCounty, North Carolina.\n  \nDEI is a privately held company that amongst other operations exclusively\ncontrols the images and likenesses of the late Dale Earnhardt and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and the automobiles\nused by their racing teams.\n  \nDEI licenses the rights for outside companies to produce, distribute and\nmarket products bearing their likenesses and other intellectual property owned by DEI.\n{7}\n \n      \nAction is \na publicly traded Arizona corporation registered to do business in the State of North\nCarolina.\n  \nAction designs, promotes, markets, and distributes licensed NASCAR related products.\n \nWagenhals is both a citizen and resident of the State of Arizona and is the president and chief executive\nofficer as well as a major shareholder of Action.\n{8}\n \n      \nBeginning in 1998, Sports Quest entered into several licensing agreements with DEI (the “1998\nlicensing agreements”) to produce and market merchandise that bore images and depictions related to both\nEarnhardts and their respective racing teams.\n  \nSubsequent documents executed by both parties extended\nSports Quest’s licensing rights to the elder Earnhardt until the end of 2002 and to the younger Earnhardt\nuntil the end of 2005.\n  \nSports Quest paid royalties based on the sale of licensed products to DEI as\ncompensation for the licensing rights.\n  \nThe president of Sports Quest, Kenneth Frady, a veteran of\nNASCAR merchandising, had developed a relationship with the Earnhardt family before executing the\n1998 licensing agreements.\n{9}\n \n      \nDEI asserts that Sports Quest breached several provisions of the 1998 licensing agreements.\n  \nFirst,\nDEI asserts that Sport Quest violated the agreements’ prohibition on sublicensing to third party vendors.\n \nSecond, DEI alleges that Sports Quest failed to tender royalties due in accordance with the licensing\nagreements.\n  \nSports Quest does not dispute either violation of the 1998 licensing agreements.\n  \nFrady,\nhowever, claims that Sports Quest waived the prohibition against sublicensing because DEI knew about it\nand did not object.\n{10}\n         \nThe critical juncture in this case occurred on June 15, 2000, when Frady met at the DEI offices\nwith the elder Earnhardt and the recently hired vice president of licensing for DEI, Joe Hedrick.\n  \nFrady\nand the elder Earnhardt signed a letter (the “June 15th letter”) that allegedly altered the terms of the prior\nlicensing agreements between DEI and Sports Quest.\n  \nThe parties are in dispute over the particular\ncircumstances, inducements and motivations surrounding the meeting and resultant document.\n \n{11}\n         \nThe June 15th letter had several key provisions at issue in this case.\n  \nFirst, Frady admitted that\nSports Quest violated the prohibition on sublicensing contained in the 1998 agreements.\n  \nSecond, DEI\nrequired Sports Quest to send a letter to third parties stating that it had sublicensed the rights to DEI\nproperties to third parties.\n  \nThe letters were to notify third parties that Sports Quest was no longer an agent\nof DEI, sublicensing agreements would be honored by DEI, renewals would be negotiated with DEI, and\nall royalty payments should be mailed directly to DEI.\n  \nThird, the letter stated that a new licensing\nagreement between DEI and Sports Quest would follow that would supersede the 1998 agreements and\nalso provided the terms to be included in that subsequent document.\n  \nThe parties never entered into a\nsubsequent agreement that incorporated the terms provided for in the June 15th letter.\n{12}\n         \nSports Quest complied with the terms of the letter and notified sublicensees that DEI would\nassume control over agreements concerning properties of DEI.\n  \nThe licensing relationship between DEI\nand Sports Quest following June 15, 2000 operated without any major difficulty until early 2001.\n  \nOn\nFebruary 18, 2001, Dale Earnhardt, Sr. was killed in an accident during a NASCAR race.\n{13}\n         \nIn March 2001, Sports Quest stopped paying royalties without explanation.\n  \nSports Quest did not\npay the royalties even after DEI notified Sports Quest in writing that it had breached the 1998\nagreements.\n  \nOn November 13, 2001, DEI officially terminated the relationship with Sports Quest based\non violations of the 1998 licensing agreements including nonpayment and sublicensing.\n \n{14}\n         \nThe parties have opposite views as to the purpose of the June 15th letter.\n  \nDEI asserts that the\nagreement was an attempt on its part to cure Sports Quest’s breach of the prohibition on sublicensing\nprovided for in the 1998 agreements.\n  \nSports Quest contends that DEI used the June 15th letter to induce\nSports Quest to sever ties with existing customers by assuming control of these relationships.\n  \nFrady\nclaims that DEI deceived him into signing the letter by incorrectly telling him that Sports Quest was in\nbreach of the 1998 agreements and falsely promising a secure future relationship between DEI and Sports\nQuest.\n  \nFrady also contends that the promises made by DEI in the June 15th meeting induced him to\nterminate profitable relationships with customers.\n  \nA factual dispute clearly exists as to the events\nsurrounding the June 15th letter.\n{15}\n         \nThe dispute also turns on factual issues regarding the collapse of Sports Quest’s financial health.\nSports Quest maintains that DEI and Action conspired to deceive it and exercise economic duress to force\nSports Quest out of business.\n  \nOn the other hand, DEI claims Mr. Frady’s recreational habits and lack of\nwork ethic destroyed both his relationship with the Earnhardts as well as his business.\n \nB.\nTHE ACTION AND SPORTS QUEST RELATIONSHIP\n{16}\n         \nThe relationship between Action and Sports Quest dates back to 1997.\n  \nAction provided die-cast\nreplicas of racecars to Sports Quest for resale to the Hamilton Collection (“Hamilton”).\n  \nSports Quest was\nsimply a middleman.\n  \nIt had no contract; it simply submitted purchase orders when it received orders from\nHamilton\n  \nIn March 2001, Wagenhals informed Hamilton that it would sell replica racecars directly to\nHamilton.\n  \nThe decision to sell directly to Hamilton eliminated Sports Quest’s role in the distribution of\nthe replica cars.\n  \nAction also would no longer accept purchase orders from Sports Quest to provide\nproducts to Hamilton.\n{17}\n         \nAt the time of the decision to eliminate Sports Quest as an intermediary, Sport Quest owed over\n$90,000 to Action for previously shipped die-cast cars.\n  \nAction seeks to recover that money in this action.\n \nThe claims to recover those funds are the only matters left between Action and Sports Quest, as the Court\ndismissed the other claims on the motion to dismiss.\nII.\n \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n \n{18}\n         \nPursuant to Rule 56(c) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment shall be\nrendered if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.\n  \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e)\n.\n  \nA genuine issue is one which can be maintained by\nsubstantial\n evidence; a material fact is that which would constitute a legal defense preventing the non-\nmoving party from prevailing.\n  \nBd. of E\nd\n. of Hickory Admin. School Unit v. Seagle\n, 120 N.C. App. 566,\n463 S.E.2d 277 (1995)\n.\n{19}\n         \nThe North Carolina Court of Appeals has explained that a summary judgment movant may meet\nits burden of showing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law by showing either (1) an essential\nelement of the non-movant’s claim is nonexistent, (2) the non-movant cannot produce evidence to support\nan essential element of his claim, or (3) the non-movant cannot surmount an affirmative defense which\nwould bar his claim.\n  \nTaylor v. \nA\nshburn\n, 112 N.C. App. 604, 606-607, 436 S.E.2d 276, 278 (1993), \ncert.\ndenied\n, 336 N.C. 77, 445 S.E.2d 46 (1994)\n.\n  \nOnce defendants have met their burden by proving that an\nessential element of the opposing party’s claim is nonexistent or by showing through discovery that the\nopposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of its claim, the burden shifts to\nthe non-moving party to show that a genuine issue exists by forecasting sufficient evidence of all essential\nelements of the claim.\n  \nFarrelly v. Ha\nm\nilton Square\n, 119 N.C. App. 541, 459 S.E.2d 23 (1995)\n. \nThe non-\nmoving party may not rest upon mere allegations or denials in its pleadings but instead is required to offer\nevidence tending to establish, beyond mere speculation or conjecture, the essential elements of its claims.\n \nN.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n \nIII.\n \nSPORTS QUEST AND DEI DISPUTE\n \nA.\nBREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM & DEI’s\nCOUNTERCLAIM\n \n{20}\n         \nSports Quest’s most central claim in this matter is that DEI breached its contract with Sports\nQuest.\n  \nDEI counterclaims that Sports Quest breached the contract by violating several provisions in the\nlicensing agreement including the prohibition on sublicensing.\n  \nThe elements of breach of contract are the\nexistence of a valid contract and breach of the terms of the contract. \nPoor v. Hill\n, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26,\n530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000).\n  \nA breach of contract is only actionable if a material breach occurs—one that\nsubstantially defeats the purpose of the agreement or goes to the very heart of the agreement, or can be\ncharacterized as a substantial failure to perform.\n  \nFletcher v. Fletcher\n, 123 N.C. App. 744, 752, 474 S.E.2d\n802, 807-08 (1996), \ndisc. rev. denied,\n 345 N.C. 640, 483 S.E.2d 706 (1997)\n.\n{21}\n         \nThe breach of contract claim against DEI is subject to disputed facts.\n  \nThe circumstances\nsurrounding the alleged breach are still unclear.\n  \nBoth sides present different versions of the impetus for\nevents that led to this claim.\n  \nFor example, the Court cannot rule on arguments such as the waiver of the\nsublicensing prohibition or good faith and fair dealing as matter of law while a factual dispute still exists.\n \nThe Court cannot speculate as to what events occurred that led to sublicensing or a failure to exercise the\ntermination provisions, nor is the record clear on what DEI knew about Sport Quest’s licensing\nagreements.\n{22}\n         \nSimilarly, DEI’s counterclaim for breach of contract also raises questions of fact that do not permit\na finding of summary judgment.\n  \nThe circumstances surrounding Sports Quest’s alleged breach are as\nunclear as the facts concerning the breach allegations against DEI.\n  \nIt is clear that Frady stopped paying\nroyalties, but the reasons therefore and the determination of whether or not there existed a prior breach by\nDEI involve credibility issues that the jury must resolve.\n{23}\n         \nThe summary judgment standard does not permit the Court to resolve the factual issues in this\nphase of litigation.\n  \nThe claim and counterclaim for breach of contract both involve the resolution of\ngenuine issues of material fact.\nB\n.\nFRAUD\n{24}\n         \nThe claim of fraud also raises factual issues that at this juncture remain unresolved.\n  \nIn North\nCarolina, the courts define fraud as a false representation or concealment of a material fact, reasonably\ncalculated to deceive, made with the intent to deceive which does in fact deceive, resulting in damage to\nthe injured party.\n  \nMyers & Chapman v. Evans\n, 323 N.C. 559, 568, 374 S.E. 2d 386, 390 (1988).\n  \nThe\nintent to deceive is an essential element of fraud.\n  \nId\n., 374 S.E.2d at 392.\n  \nThe North Carolina Supreme\nCourt disavowed cases that only implicitly recognized intent to deceive.\n  \nId\n.\n \n{25}\n         \nThe essential nature of intent to deceive to a fraud claim makes finding summary judgment in\nfavor of either party a difficult proposition.\n  \nThe facts of this case are clearly in dispute as to how DEI\ninduced Sports Quest to sign the June 15th letter.\n  \nMore importantly, the motivations behind DEI’s action\nare unclear and do not provide a basis in which to resolve this claim before trial.\n  \nThe motivations of DEI\nregarding this agreement are crucial to the intent element of the fraud claim.\n{26}\n         \nThe factual record is not sufficiently clear for the Court to rule on any element of the fraud claim,\nespecially the element of the intent to deceive.\nC.\nTORTIOUS INTERFERENCEWITH PROSPECTIVE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE\n{27}\n         \nPlaintiff Sports Quest asserts that DEI’s actions rise to the level of a business tort that interfered\nwith its ability to avail itself of economic gain.\n  \nNorth Carolina sets a high standard for maintaining a\ntortious interference with prospective advantage claim:\nIn order to maintain an action for tortious interference with prospective advantage, Plaintiff\nmust show that Defendants induced a third party to refrain from entering into a contract\nwith Plaintiff without justification. \nCameron v. New Hanover Memorial Hospital, \n58 N.C.\nApp. 414, 440, 293 S.E.2d 901, 917 (1982). Additionally, Plaintiff must show that the\ncontract would have ensued but for Defendants' interference. \nId\n.\n \nDaimlerChrysler v. Kirkhart\n, 148 N.C. App. 572, 585, 561 S.E.2d 276, 286 (2002).\n \n{28}\n         \nEssential to the claim is first identifying a contract that the defendant induced a third party to\nrefrain from entering.\n  \nPlaintiff fails to identify the requisite future contract in this matter.\n  \nSports Quest\nalleges that DEI interfered with existing contracts and cites specific agreements in an attempt to support\nthis claim.\n  \nPlaintiff, however, fails to identify \nfuture\n contracts with any specificity.\n[1]\n  \nSports Quest’s\nexpectation of future contracts with current customers does not suffice to maintain a tortious interference\nwith prospective advantage claim.\n  \nDalton v. Camp\n, 353 N.C. 647,655, 548 S.E.2d 704, 710 (2001).\n{29}\n         \nSports Quest, moreover, fails to prove that DEI caused Sport Quest’s failure to secure future\ncontracts with third parties.\n  \nContracts obviously did exist between Sports Quest and third parties, but\nmerely proving these agreements existed does not support the assertion that the relationship would\ncontinue.\n  \nSee id\n.\n  \nPlaintiff must offer specific evidence that Sports Quest had a future relationship with\nthese customers and that DEI caused these customers to refrain from entering into further contracts.\n \nSports Quest failed to offer evidence that these relationships involved future contracts.\n  \nThus, the Court\ncannot possibly find that DEI caused customers to refrain from entering into contracts with Sports Quest\nbecause no evidence offered proves further contractual relations.\nD.\nTORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH EXISTING BUSINESS RELATIONS\n{30}\n         \nThe claim of tortious interference with existing business relations provides redress when a\ndefendant induces a third party to not perform an existing contract with the plaintiff.\n  \nNorth Carolina law\nspecifies five elements required to prevail on this claim.\n  \nBeck v. City of Durham,\n 154 N.C. App. 221, 232,\n573 S.E.2d 183, 191 (2002).\n  \nFirst, a valid contract must exist between the plaintiff and a third party that\nprovides the plaintiff with contractual rights.\n  \nSecond, the defendant must have knowledge that the\ncontract exists.\n  \nThird, the defendant must intentionally induce the third party not to perform the\ncontracts.\n  \nFourth, the defendant must induce the nonperformance of the contract without justification.\n \nFifth, the third party’s failure to perform the contract results in actual damage to the plaintiff.\n  \nId\n.\n{31}\n         \nThe first fatal flaws in Sports Quest’s claim for tortious interference with existing business\nrelations is that not all of their relationships with third parties included contracts.\n  \nThe first element\nrequires that a valid contract exist.\n  \nMost notably, Sports Quest’s relationships with Action and Hamilton\ndid not involve contracts, but the parties memorialized their separate transactions with purchase orders.\n \n{32}\n         \nAs discussed in the opinion issued by this Court in February 2004, the mere acknowledgement or\nreceipt of a purchase order does not constitute assenting to the terms of an offer and thus does not create a\ncontractual obligation.\n  \nSee Southern Spindle & Flyer Co. v. Milliken & Co., \n53 N.C. App. 785, 788, 281\nS.E.2d 734, 736 (1981).\n  \nIn \nSouthern Spindle\n, the defendant orally contracted with the plaintiff provider\nfor the servicing of the defendant’s machines.\n  \nId\n. at 786-88, 281 S.E.2d at 735-36.\n  \nPlaintiff\nacknowledged receipt but did not indicate a promise to comply with the terms proscribed in the purchase\norder. \n \nId.\n, 53 N.C. App. at 788, 281 S.E.2d at 738.\n  \nDefendant cancelled the remainder of the oral\ncontract and plaintiff brought an action to recover the money owed under the agreement.\n  \nThe defendant\nfiled a motion to dismiss because the purchase order included an arbitration clause.\n  \nThe \nSouthern Spindle\ncourt denied the motion to dismiss and held that the acknowledgement of a purchase order did not mean\nthat a party assents to the terms provided.\n  \nId\n.\n{33}\n         \nAs in \nSouthern Spindle\n, Sports Quest’s reliance on an acknowledged purchase order is incorrect.\n \nAcknowledged purchase orders do not create by themselves contractual obligations.\n  \nThe purchase orders\nwere the documents that governed the relationships between Action and Sports Quest or Hamilton and\nSports Quest. Moreover, Action did not accept, sign or acknowledge these purchase orders.\n  \nRegarding the\nrelationship with Action or Hamilton, Sports Quest cannot maintain a claim for tortious interference with\nexisting business relations because neither had a contractual obligation to Sports Quest.\n[2]\n{34}\n         \nThe fourth element requires that the plaintiff act without justification and do so with “no motive\nfor interference other than malice.”\n  \nFilmar Racing, Inc. v. Stewart\n, 141 N.C. App. 668, 674, 541 S.E.2d\n733, 738 (2001).\n  \nThe relationships in which Sports Quest bases its claim for tortious interference with\nexisting business relations do not demonstrate that DEI’s motivation was malicious because DEI acted to\nprotect a legitimate business interest.\n  \nSee Area Landscaping v. Glaxo-Wellcome, Inc.\n, 586 S.E.2d 507,\n510, 2003 LEXIS 1825, at *5 (2003); \nRobinson, Bradshaw & Hinson v. Smith\n, 129 N.C. App. 305, 318,\n498 S.E.2d 841, 850 (1998).\n \n{35}\n         \nIn \nArea Landscaping\n, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant Brickman, a rival landscaping\nbusiness, interfered with its contract with Glaxo-Wellcome.\n  \n586 S.E.2d at 510, 2003 LEXIS 1825, at *5.\n \nBrickman obtained the Glaxo-Wellcome contract by underbidding the plaintiff.\n  \nThe court found that the\nplaintiff failed to offer any evidence that Brickman acted with malice as opposed to a legitimate business\ninterest.\n  \nThus, the court affirmed the trial court’s summary judgment ruling in favor of the defendant\nbecause bidding for the contract was a legitimate business interest and did not constitute malicious\ninterference.\n  \nId\n.\n{36}\n         \nSimilarly in the case at hand, Sports Quest offers no evidence that DEI acted \nonly\n with malicious\nintent.\n  \nDEI’s actions obviously harmed Sports Quest’s financial condition.\n  \nThe harm against Sports\nQuest does not suffice to maintain the intentional interference with existing business relations.\n  \nThese\nsame actions, however, obviously benefited the business interests of DEI in two respects.\n \n{37}\n         \nFirst, the elimination of Sports Quest from the intermediary role with Action is a common method\nof preserving relationships in today’s economy.\n  \nContracting the distribution chain provides such benefits\nas improved control over licensing and strengthening preferred distribution relationships.\n  \nSports Quest,\nmoreover, fails to offer specific evidence that DEI acted only with malice in eliminating their intermediary\nrole or that DEI directly interfered with the Hamilton and Sports Quest relationship.\n  \nThus, without\nevidence of malicious intent, Sports Quest cannot maintain an action for intentional interference with\nexisting business relations.\n{38}\n         \nSecond, the allegation that the interference with the sublicensees was malicious fails because\nDEI’s actions advanced a legitimate business interest.\n  \nSublicensing is a means in which the original\nlicensor can lose control over its brand.\n  \nThe inability of the original licensor to approve or reject items\nbearing its trademark can lead to the dilution of the value of the intellectual property.\n  \nFor example, a\nmassive flooding of the market by sublicensees with items of inferior quality bearing the trademark would\nlikely reflect adversely on other products bearing the trademark.\n  \nThe mere possibility that this might\noccur provided DEI with a legitimate business interest regarding the sublicensees.\n{39}\n         \nEven more detrimental to the licensor is that an oversupply of similar goods bearing the trademark\ncan lower the price that trademark will command in the market.\n  \nSimple economics dictates that if an\nuncontrolled supply exceeds the demand in the market then consumers will not pay the original price,\nthereby creating downward pressure on the value of the trademarked goods.\n  \nThe sublicensing of DEI’s\ntrademarks by Sports Quest created the risk that DEI could lose control over its intellectual property,\nhence endangering its value.\n \n{40}\n         \nSports Quest cannot assert that DEI did not advance a legitimate business interest by its attempts to\ncontrol the relationships with sublicensees.\n  \nRegardless of whether DEI waived its prohibition on\nsublicensing with Sports Quest, the decision to disallow Sports Quest from continuing to do so was not\nwithout justification.\n  \nWhether DEI waived the prohibition on sublicensing is inconsequential to this claim\nbecause sublicensing has the potential to harm the value of intellectual property and thus provides a\nbusiness justification for the action.\n  \nThe prevention of loss of value is a legitimate business interest that is\nbeyond only malicious intentions.\n{41}\n         \nSports Quest failed to offer evidence that a contract existed in its relationship with both Action and\nHamilton.\n  \nIn addition, Sports Quest did not support the proposition that DEI acted only with malicious\nintent in its actions regarding the Action and Hamilton relationships.\n  \nThe analysis of this claim pertaining\nto Action and Hamilton, however, does not even require a legitimate business interest because no contract\nexisted in these relationships.\n \n{42}\n         \nSports Quest proved that it had a contractual obligation with its sublicensees.\n  \nDEI, however, had a\nlegitimate business interest in licensing directly to protect the value of its intellectual property assets.\n \nTherefore the Court finds in favor of DEI’s motion for summary judgment on the intentional interference\nwith business relations claim.\n  \nIt is also clear that DEI had the right to, and a legitimate business interest\nin, directly licensing its property.\nE.\nCIVIL CONSPIRACY\n{43}\n         \nNorth Carolina does not recognize civil conspiracy as an independent cause of action.\n  \nToomer v.\nGarrett\n, 155 N.C. App. 462, 483, 574 S.E.2d 76, 92 (2002).\n  \nA civil conspiracy claim requires that the\nplaintiff prove an underlying unlawful conduct by alleging both the agreement of two or more parties to\ncarry out the conduct and an injury resulting from that action.\n  \nId\n.\n  \nPlaintiff fails to offer evidence that an\nagreement existed between DEI and Action to commit unlawful acts that injured Sports Quest.\n  \nThus the\ncivil conspiracy claim fails for two reasons.\n{44}\n         \nFirst, this Court found that Action did not commit an unlawful act regarding Sports Quest.\n \nAction’s decision to deal directly with Hamilton did not constitute an unlawful act.\n  \nSecond, Sports Quest\ndoes not offer any evidence that Action and DEI entered into an agreement to commit an unlawful act.\n \nThus Sports Quest does not as a matter of law have a claim for civil conspiracy against DEI.\nF.\nUNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE\n{45}\n         \nA plaintiff must establish three elements to maintain an unfair trade practices claim.\n  \nFirst, the\nplaintiff must show that the defendant committed an unfair or deceptive practice or act.\n  \nDalton v. Camp\n,\n353 N.C. 647, 656, 548 S.E.2d 704, 711 (2001). Second, the alleged action must occur in or affect\ncommerce.\n  \nThird, the alleged act must injure the plaintiff.\n  \nId\n.\n  \nA practice is unfair if it is unethical or\nunscrupulous and is deceptive if it has the tendency to deceive.\n  \nMarshall v. Miller\n, 302 N.C. 539, 548,\n276 S.E.2d 397, 403 (1981).\n \n{46}\n         \nIn this case, the unfair trade practice is dependent upon the fraud claim.\n  \nSports Quest must prove\nthe fraud claim to sustain an unfair trade claim.\n  \nThe other allegations against DEI do not rise to the level\nof an unfair trade practice, as the actions were in the ordinary course of business.\n  \nThe fraud allegations, if\nproven true, provide an avenue for Sports Quest to prevail on the unfair trade claim.\n  \nIf the jury found\nfraud in connection with the June 15, 2000 amendment, it would be up to the Court to determine if that\nfraud supported an unfair trade claim.\n  \nIf the Court found an unfair trade practice, Sports Quest would then\nelect between its fraud damages and its unfair trade damages.\n  \nThe unfair trade claim is reliant on the\nsuccess of the fraud claim and hence subsumed by it as well.\nIV.\nACTION’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON\nMONEY OWED ON ACCOUNT\n{47}\n         \nThe Court dismissed all of Sports Quest’s claims against Action in the February 12, 2004 Order.\n \nSports Quest’s only defense to the claim that it owed Action the sum of $90,310.46 for die cast racecars\nwas that the pending claims should not be resolved until the Court determined Action’s liability to Sports\nQuest.\n  \nSports Quest maintained that it should not have to pay Action, as the sum owed would serve as a\nset off to Action’s liability to Sports Quest as the result of a verdict in its favor.\n  \nNo claims exist that\nwould hold Action liable to Sports Quest for any sum.\n  \nIn addition, no issue of genuine material fact exists\nas to whether Sports Quest owes Action the sum of $90,310.46 for die cast racecars.\n  \nSports Quest does\nnot deny that it owes Action this sum.\n{48}\n         \nGiven that Sports Quest no longer has any claim pending against Action, the Court grants\nsummary judgment in favor of Action on the statement on account claim.\n  \nThus Sports Quest is liable to\nAction for the sum of $90,310.46 plus interest as provided by law.\nCONCLUSION\nBased upon the foregoing, it is hereby \nORDERED\n, \nADJUDGED\n and \nDECREED\n:\n1.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of Sports Quest is DENIED on Sports Quest’s claim\nagainst DEI for breach of contract;\n2.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is DENIED on Sports Quest’s claim against\nDEI for breach of contract;\n3.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of Sports Quest is DENIED on DEI’s breach of\ncontract counterclaim;\n4.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is DENIED on DEI’s breach of contract\ncounterclaim;\n5.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of Sports Quest is DENIED on the issue of DEI’s\nwaiver of the sublicensing provision;\n6.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of Sports Quest is DENIED on Sports Quest’s claim\nagainst DEI for fraud;\n7.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is DENIED on Sports Quest’s claim against\nDEI for fraud;\n8.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is GRANTED on Sports Quest’s claim against\nDEI for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage;\n9.\n      \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is GRANTED on Sports Quest’s claim against\nDEI for tortious interference with business relations;\n10.\n  \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is GRANTED on Sports Quest’s claim against\nDEI for civil conspiracy;\n11.\n  \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is DENIED on Sports Quest’s unfair trade\npractice claim against DEI;\n12.\n  \nSummary judgment in favor of Sports Quest is DENIED on Sports Quest’s unfair\ntrade practice claim against DEI;\n13.\n  \nSummary judgment in favor of DEI is DENIED on Sports Quest’s request for\npunitive damages;\n14.\n  \nSummary judgment in favor of Action is GRANTED on Action’s claim against\nSports Quest for statement on account.\n \nThis the ____ day of March 2004.\n \n \n[1]\n Sports Quest makes a very general and speculative allegation regarding future contracts: “DEI tortiously interfered with SQI’s\nprospective economic advantage by preventing SQI from entering into future contracts with the third-party manufacturers and\ndistributors with whom SQI had existing contracts on June 15, 2000, future contracts with the third-party manufacturers and\ndistributors, future contracts with Action for the purchase of die cast, and future contracts with Hamilton and others for the sale of\nAction die cast.”\n  \nSports Quest Brief in Response to DEI and Hedrick’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff’s Claims, p.20.\n \nPlaintiff then proceeds to discuss the existing contracts with Sports Quest that DEI allegedly caused third parties to breach.\n  \nSports\nQuest fails to show that these contracts had a future beyond the existing term and operates under the assumption that they would\ninevitably be renewed.\n[2]\n The Court ruled in the last opinion that Action did not breach a contract and that when Sports Quest settled with Hamilton, it\nwaived the right to seek redress for intentional interference."
