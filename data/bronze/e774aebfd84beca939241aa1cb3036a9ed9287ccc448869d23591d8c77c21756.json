As this Court has previously stated, “[t]his action, succinctly put, \nconcerns a dispute among family members over the management and future direction \nof a family business.”  Mauck v. Cherry Oil Co. , 2021 NCBC LEXIS 81, at **2 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Sept. 20, 2021).  The present Motions require the Court to (1) address the \nscope of the fiduciary duty owed by majority shareholders to minority shareholders \nin the context of a close corporation; and (2) untangle the parties’ web of contentions \nand finger -pointing regarding the breakdown in the process for completing the \ncompany’s purchase of the minority shareholders’ shares pursuant to a put/call \nprovision in a shareholders’ agreement. \n \n \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n2. “The Court does not make findings of fact on motions for summary \njudgment; rather, the Court summarizes material facts it considers to b e \nuncontested.”  McGuire v. Lord Corp. , 2021 NCBC LEXIS 4, at **1– 2 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Jan. 19, 2021) (cleaned up).   \n3. A complete summary of the factual and procedural background of this \ncase—as alleged in Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)2—can be found in \nthe Court’s Order and Opinion on Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss  Second Amended \nComplaint.  See Mauck v. Cherry Oil Co., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 39 (N.C. Super. Ct. May \n2, 2022) (“2 May Order and Opinion”).   \n4. The SAC originally contained nine causes of action , consisting of a \nmixture of derivative and individual (or direct) claims asserted by Plaintiffs \nArmistead B. Mauck (“Armistead”) and Louise Cherry Mauck (“Louise”) 3 in their \ndispute with Defendants Julius P. Cherry, Jr. (“Jay”) and Ann B. Cherry (“Ann”) over \nthe control of Cherry Oil Co., Inc. (“Cherry Oil”).  However, as a result of the Court’s \n2 May Order and Opinion , only the following two claims remain: (1) Plaintiffs’ \nindividual claim for breac h of fiduciary duty ; and (2) Plaintiffs’ claim for  breach of \ncontract (based on Defendants’  alleged breach of the above -referenced put/call \nprovision of Cherry Oil’s Shareholders’ Agreement).  Id., at **49. \n \n2 The SAC (ECF No. 48) is the operative pleading by  Plaintiffs for purposes of the present \nMotions. \n \n3 In this Opinion, Armistead and Louise are referred to collectively as either “Plaintiffs” or \nthe “Maucks.” \n \n5. Accordingly, the Court will summarize only those facts and procedural \ndevelopments that are most directly relevant to the  remaining claims that are the \nsubject of the present Motion for Summary Judgment.   \n6. Defendant Cherry Oil is a business that —both directly and through its \naffiliates, AJAL Investments, LLC ( “AJAL”) and C- Gas, LLC (“C -Gas”)4—owns \npropane and refined fuel distribution operation s serving business and residential \ncustomers, in cluding convenience stores .  (Jay Cherry Dep., at  63:8–12, 107:3–6, \n148:20–24, ECF No. 112.1.)  Cherry Oil and its affiliates—which the parties refer to \ncollectively as “Cherry Energy”—have been owned and managed by members of the \nCherry family since Cherry Oil was founded in 1928 by J.P. Cherry, Sr.  (Mauck Aff. \nI ¶ 4, ECF No. 14.)   \n7. Armistead and Louise are married and together own and control 194 \n(approximately 34%) of Cherry Oil’s shares.5  (Mauck Aff. I ¶¶ 2–3.)   \n8. Armistead joined Cherry Oil as an officer and director in 1995 , and he \nperformed various functions a s an employee of  Cherry Oil through the end of 2021 .  \n(Mauck Aff. I ¶ 2; J. Cherry Dep., at 32:2–22, 136:5–7.)   \n9. Prior to being terminated in 2021, Louise was employed by Cherry Oil  \nfor approximately fifteen years and was primarily responsible for payroll and related \ntasks.  (Louise Mauck Dep., at 15:2–4, 17:14–17, ECF No. 112.3.)  Louise also served \n \n4 AJAL and C-Gas are not named parties to this action.   \n \n5 Armistead and Louise each individually own 97 shares of Cherry Oil.  (Mauck Aff. I ¶ ¶ 2–\n3.)   \n \nas a member and officer of Cherry Oil’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) from August \n2000 until her purported removal from the Board on 16 June 2021.  (J. Cherry Dep., \nat 136:5–7; Mauck Aff. I ¶¶ 2–3.)   \n10. Jay and Ann are married and together own and control  390 shares \n(approximately 66%)  of Cherry Oil, which constitutes a  majority interes t in the \ncompany.6  (SAC Ex. D-1, ECF No 48.6.)   \n11. Jay is Louise’s brother and has worked for Cherry Oil since graduating \nfrom college.  (J. Cherry Dep., at 10:7–14.)  Jay also serves both as the chairperson of \nthe Board and as president of Cherry Oil.  ( J. Cherry Dep., at 19:18–20; Mauck Aff. \nIII ¶ 2, ECF No. 40; Cherry Decl. ¶ 2, ECF No. 15.1.)  Ann is a shareholder, director, \nvice president, and assistant secretary of Cherry Oil.  ( Armistead Mauck Dep., at \n87:1–2, ECF No. 112.2.)  \n12. On 15 October 1998, the Maucks and Cherrys entered into a \nshareholders’ agreement (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”) outlining their rights and \nresponsibilities as shareholders of Cherry Oil.  (See S’holders’ Agrmt., ECF No. 15.2.)   \n13. Section 11 of the Shareholders’ Agreement  contains a “put/call” \nprovision that states, in pertinent part, as follows:    \nSection 11: Put/Call.  \n \n. . .  \n \nSubject to the preceding provisions of this Agreement, the Corporation \nshall have the right to purchase (i.e., “call”) from each Shareholder (or \nhis legal representative) all, but not less than all, of his Shares for the \n \n6 Specifically, Jay owns 348 shares (59%), while Ann owns 42 shares (7%).  (SAC Ex. D-1, at \n1.)   \n \nprice specified in Section 6 and upon the terms specified in Section 7.  If \nthe Corporation shall elect to purchase all such Shares, the Corporation \nshall provide notice to the Shareholder whose shares are called (or his \nlegal representative), which such notice shall fix a closing date not more \nthan sixty (60) days after the receipt of the same.   \n \nThe Shareholder subject to a put or call shall vote, and take any other \nnecessary action, in accordance with the vote of the Shareholders \nowning a majority of the remaining Shares.  \n \n(S’holders’ Agrmt. § 11.)   \n14. Section 6 B, in turn, states the following regarding the process for \nvaluation of the selling shareholders’ shares: \nSection 6:   Purchase Price.  The price of each share of capital stock \npurchased pursuant to this Section shall be determined in accordance \nwith Subsections 6A or 6B below.\n7 \n \n. . .  \n \nB. Fair Market Value.  Unless the price per share shall be determined \nin accordance with the provisions of Subsection 6A above, the purchase \nprice for each share of stock shall be the fair market value of e ach such \nshare.  The fair market value of each share of stock shall be determined \nby one or more independent appraisers who shall be agreed upon in \nwriting by the selling Shareholder (or the personal representative of a \ndeceased Shareholder), and the remai ning Shareholders.  The written \ndecision of such appraiser or appraisers shall be binding upon all parties \nas to the fair market value of such shares.  If such parties cannot agree \nupon such appraiser or appraisers within thirty (30) days of the date \nwhen it becomes necessary to determine the fair market value, then, \nwithin fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such thirty (30) day \nperiod, the selling Shareholder (or the personal representative of a \ndeceased Shareholder) shall appoint an appraiser, and the remaining \nShareholders shall appoint a second appraiser, and the two so appointed \nshall appoint a third appraiser.  If the two so appointed fail to appoint a \nthird appraiser within said fifteen (15) day period, the Clerk of Superior \nCourt of Lenoir Cou nty shall appoint a third appraiser.  The written \n \n7 Subs ection 6A applies in situations, unlike here, in which the company and the selling \nshareholders are able to agree on the price for which the shares will be purchased. \ndecision of such appraisers shall be binding upon all parties as to the \nfair market value of such shares. \n(S’holders’ Agrmt. § 6B.)  \n15. In or around 2007, the dispute that ultimately gave rise to this lawsuit \nbegan when Jason Cherry (“Jason ”)—Jay and Ann’s son—joined Cherry Oil as an \nemployee.  ( J. Cherry Dep., at  56:7–8, 12–14.)  Plaintiffs took issue with Jason’s \nperformance as an employee of Cherry Oil, pointing to critical reviews of Jason’s job \nperformance by company employees and a “family business consultant.”  (SAC Ex. I, \nECF No. 48.13; see also SAC Exs. A–C, ECF Nos. 48.3–48.5.)   \n16. The Maucks’ and Cherrys’ efforts to find a path forward together ended \non 17 July 2020, when Jay sent a letter to Armistead and Louise stating as follows: \n[T]he current working relationship has been strained for a while now \nand is not sustainable.  To maintain meaningful relationships and \nprovide for the continuity of operations, we need to develop a plan for \nyou to transition out of ownership of Cherry Oil, C-Gas and AJAL.  \n \n(SAC Ex. V, ECF No. 48.26.) \n17. On 9 April 2021, Plaintiffs sent a letter  (the “Derivative Demand \nLetter”) to Cherry Oil demanding that the company  take appropriate action with \nregard to their allegations of misconduct by the Cherrys  toward the company.  (See \nSAC Ex. I.)      \n18. Before receiving a response to the Derivative Demand Letter, Plaintiffs \ninitiated this action by fil ing their original C omplaint in Lenoir County Superior \nCourt on 6 May 2021 against Defendants Cherry Oil, Jay, and Ann.  ( Compl., ECF \nNo. 3.)  The original complaint asserted five claims for relief: (1) dissolution of Cherry \nOil pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 55 -14-30; (2) removal of Jay and Ann  as directors under \nN.C.G.S. § 55 -8-09; (3) breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud against Jay \nand Ann; (4) breach of contract against Jay (relating to a promise allegedly made by \nhim to Armistead regarding a transfer of stock); and (5) a putative  claim for \nconstructive trust against Jay and Ann.   \n19. This action was designated as a complex business case and assigned to \nthe Honorable Gregory P. McGuire.  (Design. Ord., ECF No. 1; Assign. Ord., ECF No. \n2.) \n20. On 16 June 2021, a special shareholders’ meeti ng (the “16 June \nShareholders’ Meeting”) was held for the purpose of downsizing the number of \nmembers of the company’s Board from four to three.  The vote passed, and Jay, Ann, \nand Armistead were elected as the members of the newly constituted B oard.  As a \nresult, Louise was removed as a member of the Board.  (SAC Ex. N, ECF No. 48.18.)8      \n21. The Maucks attended the 16 June Shareholders’ Meeting  along with \ntheir attorney.  At the meeting, Armistead voiced his objections to the propriety of \nthe notice provided to the shareholders of the meeting, which he claimed was \ninconsistent with Cherry Oil’s Bylaws.  (SAC Ex. N.)  Specifically, Armistead objected \non the following grounds:  \nArticle 2 Section 5 of the bylaws requires ten days’ minimum notice of a \nspecial meeting of the shareholders, and the post office postmark on the \nnotice received by Louise Mauck shows June 7 for a June 16 th meeting.  \nThe post office mark for myself is only partially le gible, but it was \nreceived a day after notice received by Louise, and to be [sic] postmarked \n \n8 As discussed in more detail below, the validity of the actions taken at the 16 Jun e \nShareholders’ Meeting has been vigorously disputed by the Maucks throughout this \nlitigation. \nJune 8.  Insufficient notice to either myself or Louise would not be \nsufficient for the conduct of business at this meeting. \n(SAC Ex. N.)   \n \n22. Immediately after the adjournment of the 16 June Shareholders’ \nMeeting, a special meeting of the newly -elected Board was held  (the “16 June \nDirectors’ Meeting”).  (SAC Ex. Q, ECF No. 48.21.)  At the 16 June Directors’ Meeting, \nJay stated that the matter for consideration was the call by Cherry Oil of the shares \nowned by Armistead and Louise.   (SAC Ex. Q.)  The vote to call the Maucks ’ shares \npassed by a 2-1 vote with Jay and Ann voting in favor of the call vote and Armistead \nvoting against the call  vote.  (SAC Ex. Q.)   Armistead stated an objection to the \nvalidity of the notice of the 16 June Directors’ Meeting.  (SAC Ex. Q.)  \n23. On 5 August 2021, the Maucks received a “Notice of Closing to Be Held \non August 13, 2021,” which provided as follows:  \nIn accordance with the Resolution of the Special Directors’ Meeting held \non June 16, 2021, the date of closing for the sale and purchase of all of \nyour Shares in Cherry Oil Co., Inc. in accordance with Section 11 of the \nShareholders’ Agreement, dated October 15, 1998, will be held on \nAugust 13, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. at the offices of Sitterson and Whitfield, \nP.A., 803 Plaza Boulevard Kinston NC 28501. \n \nThe form of Share Redemption Agreement is provided with this Notice. \n \nPlease bring the original copies of your stock certificates representing \nall of your shares of stock in Cherry Oil Co., Inc. to the closing.  \n    \n(Mauck Aff. II Ex. A, ECF No. 25.1.)   The attached Share Redemption Agreement \nstated that the total purchase price for the Maucks’ s hares would be $175,101 with \n$35,020 of the total purchase price  due to the Maucks at the closing on 13 August \n2021.  (Mauck Aff. II Ex. A, at 2.)  Thereafter, the balance of the purchase price would \n“be payable in ten (10) equal annual installments[.]”  (Mauck Aff. II Ex. A, at 2.)      \n24. On 11 August 2021, Cherry Oil’s attorney sent the Maucks a letter \nstating the following:  \nIn light of your clients’ disagreement concerning the price representing \nthe valuation of Cherry Oil Co., Inc., we will postpone the Friday closing \nto another date. \n \nAt this point, it is incumbent on your clients to come forward with their \nown appraisal pursuant [to] the terms of the Shareholders’ Agreement.  \n \n(Mauck Aff. III Ex. 3, ECF No. 40.4.)   \n25. As discussed in detai l below , o ver the next 1 6 months the parties \n(through their attorneys) engaged in numerous communications on the subject of \nCherry Oil’s purchase of the Maucks’ shares .  However, as of the present date, the \npurchase has never occurred. \n26. On 1 July 2021, this case was reassigned to the undersigned.  (Reassign. \nOrd., ECF No. 11.)   \n27. Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint  on 19 July 2021 .  (“FAC,” \nECF No. 18.)  The FAC restated the allegations and claims from Plaintiffs’ original \nComplaint and added  new derivative claims against Jay and Ann for gross \nnegligence/willful misconduct , breach of fiduciary duty , constructive fraud,  and a \nclaim seeking the removal of Jay and Ann as directors under N.C.G.S. § 55-8-09. \n28. On 1 October 2021, Defendants’ counsel provided Plaintiffs’ counsel with \nnotice of a s pecial shareholders meeting to take p lace on 12 October 2021 (the “12 \nOctober Shareholders’ Meeting”).  (Mauck Aff. V Ex. 9, ECF No. 89.9.)  By letter dated \n6 October 2021, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed Defendants’ counsel that the Maucks \nobjected to the proposed meeting and requested that it be postponed for the following \nreasons: \nFirst, the meeting was not noticed as required by Cherry Oil’s Bylaws \nand suffers the same deficiencies set forth i [n] the objections stated at \nthe June 16, 2021 shareholders meeting[.] . . . Second, the proposed \nagenda misstates the shareholders’ rights and obligations under the \nShareholder Agreement that you previously withheld and the validity of \nactions taken during an improper Board meeting on June 16, 2021. \n \n(Mauck Aff. III Ex. 5, ECF No. 40.6.) \n29. Despite the Mauc ks’ objections, the 12 October Shareholders’ Meeting  \ntook place.  (Mauck Aff. III Ex. 8, ECF No. 40.9.)  At the meeting, Jay “noted that the \nbusiness to be conducted . . . was the removal of Armistead Mauck as a director of \n[Cherry Oil], and the election of [Jason] as a director.”  (Mauck Aff. III Ex. 8.)  Upon \nJay’s motion, Armistead was removed as a director and replaced by Jason.  (Mauck \nAff. III Ex. 8.)        \n30. Also on 12 October 2021, the Maucks  were provided, through counsel, \nwith a “Written Consent of the Directors of Cherry Oil Co., Inc. to Action Without \nMeeting” (the “12 October Written Consent”).  (Mauck Aff. III Ex. 9, ECF No. 40.10.)    \nThe 12 October Written Consent removed Armistead “from the office of Secretary -\nTreasurer of the Corporation, and any and all other officer positions previously held \nby him” and elected Ann as the new Secretary -Treasurer.  (Mauck Aff. III Ex. 9 .)  \nMoreover, the 12 October Written Consent provided that Jason had been elected as \nthe Vice-President of Cherry Oil.  (Mauck Aff. III Ex. 9.)   \n31. On 26 October 2021, Jay, acting in his capacity as President of Cherry \nOil, terminated Louise’s employment with the company.  (Mauck Aff. IV ¶ 9, ECF No. \n51.)      \n32. On 6 December 2021, this Court granted Plaintiffs leave to file the SAC, \n(ECF No. 46), which was filed shortly thereafter on 13 December 2021, (ECF No. 48).    \n33. The SAC added a new  breach of contract claim against Defendants for \nallegedly “fail[ing] to take reasonable and necessary steps [pursuant to the \nShareholders’ Agreement] to complete the call transaction while exercising dominion \nand control over [Plaintiffs’] shares[.]”  (SAC ¶¶ 156–64.) \n34. On 16 December 2021, Armistead was notified by Defendants’ counsel \nthat his employment with C herry Oil was being terminated effective 31 December \n2021.  (Mauck Aff. IV ¶ 3, ECF No. 51.)     \n35. The decision to terminate Armistead’s employment with Cherry Oil was \nmade by Jay, in his capacity as Cherry Oil’s president.  (J. Cherry Dep., at 32:6–18.)  \nA termination letter sent to Armistead  included the following explanation  for Jay’s \ndecision: \nAlthough your employment is at -will and cou ld be terminated for any \nlawful reason, the actions which inform my decision include, among \nother things, bringing a lawsuit to dissolve Cherry Oil, seeking to \ninterfere with Cherry Oil’s relationships with its lenders  and insurers, \nand other generally disruptive and uncooperative behavior inconsistent \nwith your role as an employee of the company.  At this point, I simply do \nnot think that you have Cherry Oil’s best interests at heart or that you \ncan faithfully serve as an employee of Cherry Oil at the same time you \nare suing the company.  \n(Mauck Aff. V Ex. 1, ECF No. 89.1.)   \n36. Armistead was instructed to provide Jay with all of the corporate books \nand accounting records of AJAL and C-Gas.  (Mauck Aff. V ¶ 3; Mauck Aff. V Ex. 1.)  \nIn addition, he was “directed to remove all of [his] belongings and ‘vacate the \npremises’ the following day[,]” 17 December 2021.  ( Mauck Aff. V ¶ 3; Mauck Aff. V \nEx. 1.)  Armistead ceased being an employee of Cherry Oil  as of midnight on 31 \nDecember 2021.  (J.  Cherry Dep., at 32:2–5.)  He was not offered any severance or \ntermination benefits.  (Mauck Aff. V ¶ 3.)    \n37. On 12 January 2022, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss , requesting \nthat the Court dismiss all claims asserted by Plaintiffs in the SAC pursuant to Rules \n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  (Mot. to Dismiss SAC, ECF No. 49.) \n38. In its 2 May Order and Opinion, this Court dismissed all of the claims \nin the SAC except for Plaintiffs’ individual claim for breach of fiduciary duty and new \nclaim for breach of contract ( based on Defendants’ failure to follow through on the \npurchase of the Maucks’ shares following the call vote).   Mauck, 2022 NCBC LEXIS \n39, at **49.  \n39. Defendants filed an Answer to the SAC on 23 May 2022 in which they \nasserted counterclaims against Armistead for breach of fiduciary duty and duty of \nloyalty and breach of the AJAL Operating Agreement , as well as a cou nterclaim \nseeking a declaratory judgment concerning the  parties’ rights under the \nShareholders’ Agreement.  (Answer and Countercls., ECF No. 63.)9  \n \n9 These counterclaims remain pending and are not addressed in this Opinion. \n40. On 7 April 2023, Defendants filed the present Motion for Supervision in \nwhich they have asked the Court to supervise the process for finalizing the purchase \nof Plaintiffs’ shares. \n41. Seven days later, Defendants filed their Motion for Summary Judgment. \n42. The Court held a hearing on the Motions on 25 July 2023, and they are \nnow ripe for resolution.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \n43. It is well established that “[s]ummary  judgment is proper ‘if the \npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together \nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \nand that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.’ ”  Morrell v. Hardin \nCreek, Inc., 371 N.C. 672, 680 (2018) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).  “[A] genuine \nissue is one which can be maintained by substantial evidence.”  Kessing v. Nat’l \nMortg. Corp. , 278 N.C. 523, 534 (1971).  “Substantial evi dence is such relevant \nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and \nmeans more than a scintilla or a permissible inference.”  Daughtridge v. Tanager \nLand, LLC, 373 N.C. 182, 187 (2019) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n44. On a motion for summary judgment, “[t]he evidence must be considered \n‘in a light most favorable to the non -moving party.’ ”  McCutchen v. McCutchen , 360 \nN.C. 280, 286 (2006) (quoting Howerton v. Arai Helmet, Ltd. , 358 N.C. 440, 470 \n(2004)).  “[T]he party moving for summary judgment ultimately has the burden of \nestablishing the lack of any triable issue of fact.”  Pembee Mfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear \nConstr. Co., 313 N.C. 488, 491 (1985) (citation omitted).   \n45. The party moving for summary judgment m ay satisfy its burden by \nproving that “an essential element of the opposing party’s claim does not exist, cannot \nbe proven at trial, or would be barred by an affirmative defense, or by showing \nthrough discovery that the opposing party cannot produce eviden ce to support an \nessential element of [the] claim[.]”  Dobson v. Harris, 352 N.C. 77, 83 (2000) (citations \nomitted).  “If the moving party satisfies its burden of proof, then the burden shifts to \nthe non-moving party to ‘set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue \nfor trial.’ ”  Lowe v. Bradford , 305 N.C. 366, 369– 70 (1982) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. \n56(e)).  If the nonmoving party does not satisfy its burden, then “summary judgment, \nif appropriate, shall be entered against [the nonmovant]. ”  United Cmty. Bank (Ga.) \nv. Wolfe, 369 N.C. 555, 558 (2017) (quoting N.C. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).  \nANALYSIS \nI. Motion for Summary Judgment  \nA. Breach of Fiduciary Duty  \n46. In their breach of fiduciary duty  claim, Plaintiffs assert that Jay and \nAnn—in their capacities as majority shareholders —owed a fiduciary dut y to the \nMaucks by virtue of their status as minority shareholders and that this duty has been \nbreached.    \n47. To succeed on a breach of fiduciary duty claim, “a plaintiff must show \nthat: (1) defendant owed plaintiff a fiduciary duty; (2) the defendant breached that \nfiduciary duty; and (3) the breach of fiduciary duty was a proximate cause of injury \nto the plaintiff.”  Sykes v. Health Network Sols., Inc. , 372 N.C. 326, 339 (2019) \n(citation omitted).    \n48. Under North Carolina law, a fiduciary relationship is defined as “one in \nwhich there has been a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good \nconscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the \none reposing confidence.”  Dalton v. Camp , 353 N.C. 647, 651 (2001) (internal \nquotations omitted).   \n49. With respect to the fiduciary dut y owed by majority shareholder s to \nminority shareholders, this Court has explained as follows:  \nMajority share holders owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders.  \nGaines v. Long Mfg. Co. ( Gaines II), 234 N.C. 340, 344, 67 S.E.2d 350, \n353 (1951) (“The controlling majority of the stockholders of a \ncorporation, while not trustees in a technical sense, have a real duty to \nprotect the interests of the minority in the management of the \ncorporation, especially where they undertake to run the corporation \nwithout giving the minority a voice therein.”); see also Loy v. Lorm Corp., \n52 N.C. App. 428, 432, 278 S.E.2d 897, 901 (1981) (“[I]n North Carolina \nmajority shareholders owe a fiduciary duty and obligation of good faith \nto minority shareholders as well as to the corporation.”).  Those duties \ninclude paying over to the minority shareholder his “just proportion of \nthe income and of the proceeds of the corporate property.”  Gaines II , \n234 N.C. at 344, 67 S.E.2d at 353.  A fiduciary duty arises regardless of \nwhether the majority shareholder is an individual or an entity acting \nthrough individuals. \nJohnston v. Johnston Propert ies, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 119, at **28– 29 (N.C. Super. \nNov. 15, 2018).   \n50. Moreover, in the context of close  corporations, this Court has observed \nthe following: \n[I]n closely -held corporations, “[t]he devolution of unlimited power \nimposes on holders of the majority of the stock a correlative duty, the \nduty of a fiduciary or agent, to the holders of the minority of the stock, \nwho can act only through them -- the duty to exercise good faith, care, \nand diligence to make the property of the corporation produce the largest \npossible amount, to protect the interests of the holders of the minority \nof the stock, and to secure and pay over to them their just proportion of \nthe income and of the proceeds of the corporate property.” \n \nThomas v. McMahon , 2015 NCBC LEXIS 67, at **27– 28 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 23, \n2015) (quoting Loy, 52 N.C. App. at 432–33).     \n51. Based on these principles, the Court expressly held in its  2 May Order \nand Opinion that “it is abundantly clear that under North Carolina law the Cherrys, \nas majority shareholders, owed a fiduciary duty to the Maucks, as minority \nshareholders.”  Mauck v. Cherry Oil Co. , 2022 NCBC LEXIS 39, at **34  (citing \nRaymond James Capital Partners, L.P. v. Hayes, 248 N.C. App. 574, 580 (2016)).  The \nquestion currently before the Court is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists \nas to whether Defendants breached that duty  so as to proximately cause injury to \nPlaintiffs. \n52. Plaintiffs make a number of different arguments in an attempt to show \nthat Defendants  have, in fact,  breached the fiduciary duty owed to the Maucks .  \nHowever, for the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have \nfailed to offer sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on this claim.  \n53. First, Plaintiffs continue to assert that by taking away the Maucks’ long-\ntime management roles within Cherry Oil, Jay and Ann have frustrated the Maucks’ \nreasonable expectations that they would retain such responsibilities going forward  \nindefinitely.  For example, Plaintiffs contend  that Defendants’ actions included \n“engag[ing] in a campaign to exclude Plaintiffs from essential management roles, \nactivities, communications, and decisions[.]”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. , at 14.)  \nHowever, this Court has previously rejected this argument.    \nThe SAC sets out various examples of acts committed by Jay and Ann \nthat Plaintiffs contend demonstrate the Cherrys’ desire to marginalize \nArmistead and Louise while simultaneously increasing Jason ’s role \nwithin the company.   Plaintiffs assert that the Cherrys’ conduct \nconstituted “breach[es] of Armistead and Louise’ s reasonable \nexpectations regarding management of Cherry Oil.” \n \n. . . \n  \nThe SAC is replete with allegations that Jay and Ann have acted \ninconsistently with Plaintiffs’ reasonable expectations regarding their \ncontinuing status with Cherry Oil.  But the Put/Call Provision in Section \n11 of the Shareholders’ Agreement reflects a bargained -for agreement \nbetween the shareholders that a shareholder ’s right to receiv e fair \nmarket value for his or her shares is sufficient to protect the “reasonable \nexpectations” of minority shareholders such as the Maucks.  See Harris, \n243 N.C. App. at 39– 40, 777 S.E.2d 776 (holding that where a \ncomplaining shareholder’ s shares were “c alled” by the corporation \npursuant to a provision in the shareholders’ agreement, the complaining \nshareholder’s “reasonable expectations” were “adequately protected” by \nthe buying out of his shares at the price set forth in the “call” provision). \n \n. . . \n  \n[T]he Court agrees with Defendants that the Put/Call Provision \nprecludes Plaintiffs from relying on a “reasonable expectations” theory \nas the basis for their individual breach of fiduciary duty claim[.] \n \nMauck v. Cherry Oil Co., Inc., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 39, at **8, **20, **34.  \n54. Second, Plaintiffs point to several actions taken by Defendants relating \nto the Maucks’ status as employees, officers, or directors of Cherry Oil.  For example, \nPlaintiffs allege in the SAC that the termination of  Louise’s employment and \nDefendants’ ensuing false characterization of that event as a resignation constituted  \na breach of fiduciary duty.  (SAC ¶ 112.)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs have identified the \nfollowing acts as additional examples:   \nBefore Jay and A nn attempted to call Plaintiffs’ shares and remove \nPlaintiffs as directors on 16 June 2021, they engaged in a campaign to \nexclude Plaintiffs from essential management roles, activities, \ncommunications, and decisions; make discrediting statements about \nArmistead to other employees and investigated transactions involving \nArmistead without any good-faith basis.  \n \n(Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J., at 14.)  \n55. Plaintiffs also argue that when Jay terminated Louise’s employment, he \n“promised her severance which was neve r provided.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. , \nat 7.)   They further assert that with respect to Armistead’s termination, he “was \noffered no severance or other termination benefits, and has received none.”  (Pls.’ Br. \nOpp. Mot. Summ. J., at 8.)  \n56. Finally, Plaintiffs attempt to rely on the fact that “Jay Cherry testified \nin his deposition that since Louise and Armistead started serving on the board in the \nearly 2000s, there had never been any  discussion about Louise and Armistead not \nserving on the board prior to spring 2021” and then contend “ that Jay and Ann’s \ndecision to exclude and remove Louise and Armistead from the Board was an \nunprecedented and egregious act against Plaintiffs.”  ( Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J. , \nat 14–15.)  \n57. However, as discussed above, the fiduciary duty at issue in this case is \npremised solely on Plaintiffs’ status as minority shareholders.   It is axiomatic that \nthe existence of such a duty does not—by itself—mean that the Maucks were entitled \neither to employment (or continued employment) with the company or to service as \nofficers or directors of the company.  Therefore, any of Defendants’ acts relied upon \nby Plaintiffs that relate to the Maucks’ capacities separate and apart from their \nstatus as minority sharehol ders cannot serve as the basis for a valid breach of \nfiduciary duty claim in this case.10     \n58. Third, the Maucks make a series of allegations on the subject of the call \nvote, ranging from (1) Defendants’ failure to give proper notice of the 16 June \nShareholders’ Meeting and the 16 June Directors’ Meeting ; to (2) Defendants’ \ndeliberate decision not to finalize the purchase of the Maucks’ shares.  However, aside \nfrom the fact that (as discussed later in this Opinion ) the record does not actually \nsupport Plaintiffs’ assertions on these issues, they are more appropriately analyzed \nunder Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim than their breach of fiduciary duty claim. \n59. Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty \nby hiding corporate records from Plaintiffs and  by “unlawfully withhold[ing] \ninformation as part of their strategy to undermine Plaintiffs.”  ( Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. \nSumm. J. , at 1, 13.)  Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants withheld \ninformation by  “fail[ing] to provide a copy of the Shareholder Agreement when \nPlaintiffs asked for the [Cherry Oil ] corporate records” and that the Shareholders’ \nAgreement was improperly removed from Cherry Oil’s office.   (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. \nSumm. J., at 14.)   \n \n10 Similarly, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants engaged in conduct such as “mak[ing] \ndiscrediting statements about Armistead to other employees and investigat[ing] transactions \ninvolving Armistead without any good -faith basis.”  ( Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J., at 14 .)  \nHowever, Plaintiffs have failed to cite to case law holding that such conduct would give rise \nto a breach of the fiduciary duty owed by a majority shareholder to a minority shareholder. \n60. However, Cherry Oil’s b ylaws do not require that the Shareholders’ \nAgreement be maintained at Cherry Oil’s offices.   Instead, the only do cument \nrequired thereunder to be kept “at the registered or principal office of the corporation” \nis “a record of shareholders showing the name and address  of each shareholder and \nthe number of shares held by each.”   (Bylaws art. V § 7, ECF No. 100.1.)  Moreover, \nthe proper remedy for a  shareholder improperly denied access to a corporate \ndocument is a statutory claim pursuant to N.C.G.S.  § 55-16-04 rather than through \na breach of fiduciary duty claim.11  \n61. Fifth, Plaintiffs assert that Cherry Oil improperly refused to issue a \ndividend that would have been helpful to the Maucks in satisfying their tax liability \nas set out in K-1 forms they were issued.  However, there is nothing in the summary \njudgment record evidencing a demand by Plaintiffs that Cherry Oil issue a dividend \nto its shareholders.     \n62. Sixth, Plaintiffs assert that  Defendants relied on Plaintiffs’ “outdated \npersonal guarantees [sic]” without Plaintiffs’ permission in obtaining loans from two \nspecific entities—Saratoga Rack Marketing and First Citizens Bank.  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. \nMot. Summ. J. , at 6.)  However, the evidence in the record  either does not support \nthis contention or expressly refutes its valid ity.  For example, a Saratoga Rack \nMarketing representative emailed Armistead to inform him that the guaranties at \nissue were not considered when conducting a credit review: \n \n11 Plaintiffs concede that at all relevant times they possessed an unexecuted copy of the \nShareholders’ Agreement and do not contend that the contents of the unexecuted copy were \nin any respect substantively different from the fully executed version. \n \nAfter we were originally notified of the legal situation within Cherry Oil \nin August 2021, a credit review was performed.  The corporate \nguarantees from both AJAL Investment, LLC and C-Gas, LLC were not \ntaken into consideration at that time.  You can consider both guarantees \nas terminated and no longer supporting the credit of Cherry Oil Co., Inc. \n(Mot. Summ. J. Ex. B, ECF No. 81.2.) \n63. Similarly, a First Citizens Bank employee confirmed via email th e \nfollowing: \nThe bank is aware of the lawsuits and issues between the owners  [of \nCherry Oil].  Nothing has been approved based on the statement that \nappears in the financials.  The bank has approved the line of credit being \nfully aware of all that is happening.  \n \n(Defs.’ Not. of Filing Ex. 4, ECF No. 100.4.) \n64. Finally, the Court has carefully reviewed all of Plaintiffs’ remaining \narguments in support of their breach of fiduciary duty claim and finds that none of \ntheir contentions are sufficient to show a genuine issue of material fact. \n65. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS  Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment with respect to Plaintiffs’ individual claim for breach of fiduciary duty.   \nB. Breach of Contract  \n66. The theory underlying Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim has been \nsomewhat of a moving target. \n67. As pled in the SAC , this claim was premised on the allegation that  \ndespite voting to call Plaintiffs’ shares, Defendants have subsequently “failed and \nrefused to take any steps necessary to close the transaction.”  (SAC ¶ 160.)   \n68. However, in opposing Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment as to \nthis claim, Plaintiffs make very different arguments—contending instead that their \nbreach of contract claim is actually based on the entirely separate proposition that no \nvalid call vote ever took place.   This is so, Plaintiffs contend in their summary \njudgment response brief, for two reasons.  First, Plaintiffs argue that “Defendants \nbreached the Shareholder Agreement when they failed to provide sufficient notice \nwith respect to the 16 June 2021 shareholder meeting [,]” and, as a result, “[a]ny \naction taken at this meeting, including the removal of Louise Mauck as a director and \nthe alleged call of Armistead and Louise’s shares was thus invalid.”  ( Pls.’ Br. Opp. \nMot. Summ. J. , at 19.)  Second , Plaintiffs assert that “the 16 June 2021 call was \ninvalid because under Section 11 [of the Shareholders’ Agreement], [Cherry Oil] has \nthe right to call a shareholder’s shares only after a price is specified in Section 6 and \nupon the terms specified in Section 7.”  (Pls.’ Br. Opp. Mot. Summ. J., at 19)     \n69. Although the SAC elsewhere contains the allegation that improper \nnotice was given of the two 16 June 2021 meetings, the breach of contract claim —as \nnoted above—is implicitly premised on the notion that the call vote was valid  and \nthat the breaching conduct  on the part of Defendants was the failure to go through \nwith the purchase of the Maucks’ shares.  Thus, there is a disconnect between the \narguments contained in Plaintiffs’ summary judgment response brief regarding this \nclaim and the manner in which the claim was actually pled in the SAC. \n70. This Court has explained as follows: \nOur State follows traditional rules of notice pleading.  One of the \npurposes of the complaint is to frame the issues and put the opposing \nparty on notice of them.  Thus, the complaint must give “sufficient notice \nof the events or transactions which produced the claim to enable the \nadverse party to understand the  nature of it and the basis for it . . . . ”  \nSutton v. Duke, 277 N.C. 94, 104, 176 S.E.2d 161, 167 (1970).  Both sides \nbenefit.  For plaintiffs, the notice requirement is backed up by liberal \nrules of discovery and the promise that leave to amend “ shall be freely \ngiven when justice so requires.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 15(a).  For defendants, \nit is an assurance of sorts that they will not be blindsided by new claims \nor theories when preparing for trial. \n. . .  \nBut it is the operative complaint that must adequately notify defendants \nof plaintiff’s claims. . . . Courts routinely caution that parties should \nintroduce new issues through the amendment process, not through \nbriefing, discovery responses, or expert reports. \nPotts v. KEL, LLC , 2019 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *22, *2 4 (N.C. Super. Sep. 27, 2019)  \n(cleaned up and emphasis added).  See also Fund 19-Miller, LLC v. Isbill, 2021 N.C. \nApp. LEXIS 624, at *11– 12 (N.C. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2021) (unpublished) (“Litigants \nare unable to assert new theories of recovery that were not alleged in the complaint \nat summary judgment because these belated changes fail to provide sufficient notice \nof the events or transactions which produced the claim to enable the adverse party to \nunderstand the nature of it and the basis for it.” (citation and quotation marks \nomitted)); see also Bradshaw v. Maiden , 2020 NCBC LEXIS 106, at *19– 20 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Sept. 15, 2020) (declining to consider novel theory of recovery that party \nfailed to plead); Wake County v. Hotels.com, L.P ., 2012 NCBC LEXIS 63, at *30– 33 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 19, 2012) (same).  \n71. In any  event, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ br each of contract \nclaim fails under any of the various theories that they have asserted. \n72. With regard to Plaintiffs’ contention that Defendants breached the \nShareholders’ Agreement by failing to follow through with the actual purchase of the \nMaucks’ shares, t he record shows that Defendants repeatedly attempted to move \nforward with the process but that it was Plaintiffs  who were primarily responsible \nfor the lack of progress.   The Court deems it helpful to set out the chronology of \nrelevant events regarding this issue.   \n73. Following the call vote at the  16 June Directors’ Meeting, Defendants \noffered to pay the Maucks for their shares “based on the higher of the two [Cherry \nOil] valuations in the Propane Resources’ appraisal[.]”12  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. \nEx. 1, ECF No. 80.2.)   However, the Maucks rejected that offer , taking the position \nthat the call vote was invalid.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 1.)    \n74. On 11 August 2021, Defendants’ counsel notified Plaintiffs’ counsel in \nwriting that “[i]n light of [the Maucks]’ disagreement concerning the price \nrepresenting the valuation of [ the company],” the closing date for the c all would be \npostponed.  ( SAC Ex. W, ECF No. 48.27.)  In addition, Defendants’ counsel stated \nthat “[a]t this point, it is incumbent on [the Maucks] to come forward with their own \nappraisal pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders’ Agreement.”  (SAC Ex. W.)   \n75. For the next t welve months, the parties largely focused on c onducting \ndiscovery in this lawsuit.  O n 24 August 2022, Defendants’ counsel sent a letter to \nPlaintiffs’ counsel to address the “logjam regarding the [call] process” and to ascertain \nwhether Plaintiffs were “interested in trying to get the Call process un der the . . . \nShareholders’ Agreement unstuck.”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 1.)  Specifically, \nDefendants’ counsel explained Defendants’ position as follows:  \n \n12 Propane Resources is a third-party company that undertook a business valuation of Cherry \nOil and C-Gas in 2015 at the direction of Armistead and Jay .  In 2020, Propane Resources \nupdated the 2015 valuation.  (A. Mauck Dep. 55:14–56:9.) \nAs you will recall, our clients offered to pay your clients based on the \nhigher of the two  [Cherry Oil]  valuations in the Propane Resources’ \nappraisal.  At the time, our thinking was that your clients would be \ncomfortable with the Propane Resources’ appraisal since the company \nwas chosen by your client who provided them with all of the pertinent \ninformation and had most of the communications with the company. \n \nNevertheless, your clients rejected that offer and took the position that \nthe Call was defective and never appointed their own appraiser which \nwould otherwise have been the next st ep in the process outlined under \nthe Agreement. \n \nIn looking for a way forward, I have confirmed with our clients that they \nwould be willing to buy out your clients’ position in [Cherry Oil]  on the \nsame terms as offered last year, i.e. , using the Propane Resources’ \ncalculation.  In our view, that should be an attractive offer since it would \nuse the higher Propane Resources’ valuation and not include the \notherwise standard fair market value discounts for lack of control and \nmarketability. \n \nIf that offer is not acceptable to you, I would ask that your clients follow \nthe provisions of § 6 of the Shareholders’ Agreement and appoint your \nown appraiser, after which our clients will appoint theirs.  Just to make \nthings clear, in that circumstance our position will be that the [Cherry \nOil] appraisal will be done ac counting for both the C -GAS-[Cherry Oil] \nlease and the discounts described above.   \n \nIn the event that your clients refuse to agree to the Propane Resources’ \nappraisal and refuse to appoint their own appraiser, we will simply, \nwithout prejudice to our current position, restart the Call process. \n \n(Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 1.) \n \n76. In response, by letter dated 9 September 2022, Plaintiffs’ counsel \nrejected Defendants’ offer to purchase the Mauck s’ shares based on the Propane \nResources’ apprais al or otherw ise restart the call process.  ( Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. \nSuper. Ex. 2, ECF 80.3.)  Instead, Plaintiffs’ counsel informed Defendants’ counsel \nthat “the Maucks  are more interested in pursuing a global resolution using the \nmediation process[.]”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 2.)    \n77. On 6 October 2022, Cherry Oil’s Board issued a “Written Consent of the \nDirectors of Cherry Oil Co., Inc. to Action Without Meetin g” (the “6 October Written \nConsent”) confirming, and ratifying, the Board’s prior 16 June 2021 exercise of the \ncall option: \nWHEREAS, at a special meeting of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) \nof the Company held on June 16, 2021 (the “June 2021 Board Meeting”), \nthe Board authorized the Company to exercise its call rights under \nSection 11 of th e Company’s Shareholders’ Agreement, dated October \n15, 1998 (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”), to purchase all of the shares \nof stock in the Company held by Louise Mau ck and Armistead Mauck \n(such Board authorization, the “Call Rights Exercise”) \n. . .  \nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT: \n \nRESOLVED, without in any way prejudicing the effectiveness of the \nCall Rights Exercise at the June 2021 Board Meeting, the Board hereby \nconfirms and ratifies the Call Rights Exercise at the June 2021 Board \nMeeting in all respects, including without limitation the validity and \neffectiveness of the Board’s authorization and approval of the Call \nRights Exercise; and  \n \nFURTHER RESOLVED, without in any wa y prejudicing the \neffectiveness of the Call Rights Exercise at the June 2021 Board \nMeeting, the Board hereby confirms that the Company is authorized to \nand has elected to exercise its call option under Section 11 of the \nShareholders’ Agreement to purchase all of the shares of stock in the \nCompany held by Louise Mauck and Armistead Mauck, all in accordance \nwith the operative terms of the Shareholders’ Agreement[.] \n \n(Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 3, ECF No. 80.4.)  The Board set the closing date for \nthe purchase of the Maucks shares as 5 December 2022.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. \nEx. 7, ECF No. 80.8.)          \n78. In addition, the 6 October Written Consent required Plaintiffs to \ndesignate their appraiser (pursuant to Sect ion 6B of the Shareholders’ Agreement) \nno later than 21 November 2022.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 7.)   \n79. Forty-six days later, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent Defendants’ counsel a letter \ndated 21 November 2022 that identified C. Joseph Ciccarello, CPA, MST, as \nPlaintiffs’ chosen appraiser.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 4, ECF No. 80.5.)  This \nwas the first time since the 16 June 2021 call vote that  Plaintiffs’ counsel had ever \ndesignated an appraiser.         \n80. On 30 November 2022, Defendants’ counsel sent a letter to Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel identifying Cooper Wilburn as Defendants’ designated appraiser and \ninquiring as to what information Plaintiffs’ appraiser, Ciccarello, needed to complete \nhis appraisal of the Maucks’ Cherry Oil shares.  ( Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 5, \nECF No. 80.6.)  Furthermore, Defendants’ counsel noted that “[a]t this point, Mr. \nCiccarello and Mr. Wilburn will need to consult concerning the appointment of a third \nappraiser in the next fiftee n days (which, barring agreement, will fall to the Lenoir \nCounty Clerk of Court to chose [sic]).”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 5 .)  \nDefendants’ counsel also suggested that the 5 December 2022 closing date previously \nset by the Board be pushed back to  “a date to be determined after completion of  the \nappraisal.”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 5.)  Defendants ’ counsel explained his \nconcern that otherwise the parties would only have two weeks to complete the \nappraisal process, including the appointing of a third appraiser.  \n81. On 4 December 2022, the Board executed another “Written Consent of \nthe Directors of Cherry Oil Co., Inc. to Action Without Meeting”  (the “4 December \nWritten Consent”) postponing the 5 December 2022 closing date “to a date to be \nestablished after completion of the appraisal process for the Mauck shares[.]”  (Defs.’ \nBr. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 6, ECF No. 80.7.)  The 4 December Written Consent stated \nas follows: \nWHEREAS, on October 6, 2022, the Board ratified, confirmed and re -\nauthorized the Company’s exercise of all of its call rights under Section \n11 of the Company’s Shareholders’ Agreement, dated October 15, 1998 \n(the “Shareholders’ Agreement”), to purchase all of the shares of stock \nin the Company (collectively, the “Mauck Shares”) held by Louise Mauck \nand Armistead Mauck (collectively, the “Maucks,” and such Board \nauthorization, the “Call Rights Exercise”), such action having been \npreviously authorized by the Board at a special meeting of the Board \nheld on June 16, 2021; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the closing date for the Call Rights Exercise (the “Closing \nDate”) was previously set by the Board for December 5, 2022 pursuant \nto and in accordance with the  terms of Section 11 of the Shareholders’ \nAgreement \n. . .  \nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT: \n \nRESOLVED, the Board hereby authorizes the postponement of the \nClosing Date from December 5, 2022 to a date to be established after \ncompletion of the appraisal process for th e Mauck Shares, as outlined \nand in accordance with the terms of Section 6.B. of the Shareholders’ \nAgreement, and as soon as is reasonably practicable after the completion \nof such appraisal process. \n \n(Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 7.)   \n82. On the following day, Defendants’ counsel sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a \nletter regarding his failure to respond to the 30 November letter and attached the 4 \nDecember Written Consent .  ( Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 6.)  Additionally, \nDefendants’ counsel asked Plaintiffs’ c ounsel for his thoughts on how the two \ndesignated appraisers should proceed with respect to the appointment of the third \nappraiser.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 6.)   \n83. By letter dated 8 December 2022, Plaintiffs’ counsel stated his belief \nthat the Shareholders’ Agreement required  that the appraisal process take place \nbefore a call vote can occur.  ( Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 8, ECF No. 80.9.) 13  \nPlaintiffs’ counsel also reiterated the Maucks’ belief “that the meetings necessary to \ncall shares were not properly noticed or held, and that Defendants’ duties to the \nMaucks render the call option unlawful.”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 8.)   \n84. This timeline is inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants \nhave breached the Shareholders’ Agreement by failing to take steps to follow through \non the purchase of the Maucks’ shares.  To be sure, there were periods during th is \nchronology during which neither party sought to break th e logjam .  On balance, \nhowever, the record shows that if anyone was attempting to thwart the timely \ncompletion of the process it was Plaintiffs rather than Defendants.  On several \noccasions, Defendants sought to move forward with the  valuation process but were \nrepeatedly thwarted by Plaintiffs’ unwillingness to participate.  Indeed, throughout \nthis time period, Plaintiffs continued to maintain that the call vote was invalid.  As a \nresult, Plaintiffs have fallen short of successfully opposing Defendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment on the breach of contract theory actually pled in the SAC.  \n \n13 In this letter, Plaintiffs’ counsel also requested certain discovery responses from \nDefendants.  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super. Ex. 8.)   \n85. Moreover, even if the Court was to consider the “new” theories of liability \nasserted in Plaintiffs’ summary judgment response brief,  its result would remain \nunchanged. \n86. The argument that Plaintiffs assert most vigorously is that notice of the \n16 June Shareholders’ Meeting was improper because  the applicable ten-day notice \nperiod mandated by the bylaws was not given.   \n87. This contention is ba sed on article II, section 5 of the Bylaws, which \ngoverns shareholders’ meetings and states as follows: \nNotice of Meetings:  Written or printed notice stating the time and place \nof the meeting shall be delivered not less than ten nor more than fifty \ndays before the date thereof, either personally or by mail, by or at the \ndirection of the President, the Secretary, or other person calling the \nmeeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. \n. . .  In the case of a special meeting, the notice of the meeting shall \nspecifically state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.   \n \n(Bylaws art. II § 5.)  \n \n88. The notice of the 16 June Shareholders’ Meeting addressed to Plaintiffs \nwas mailed on 4 June 2021.  (Cherry Decl. II ¶ 10, ECF No. 21.) \n89. Because the notice was postmarked 7 June 2021, Plaintiffs contend that \nit could not have been received ( i.e., “delivered”) until less than  ten days before the \nmeeting.  The flaw with Plaintiffs’ argument , however, is that it ignores N.C.G.S. § \n55-2-06(b), which provides t hat “[t]he bylaws of a corporation may contain any \nprovision for managing the business and regulating the affairs of the corporation that \nis not inconsistent with law . . . ”  N.C.G.S. § 55-2-06(b) (emphasis added). \n90. Based on this statutory provision, a leading treatise has noted that “[a]ll \nbylaws must be consistent with . . . all applicable state and federal laws.  Any conflict \nbetween a bylaw provision and the superior authority of . . . a statutory or \nconstitutional provision will necessarily be resolved in favor of the latter.”  1 Robinson \non North Carolina Corporation Law § 4.04. \n91. The above-quoted provision in Cherry Oil’s bylaws making  dispositive \nthe date the notice is actually delivered to the shareholder is superseded by N.C.G.S. \n§ 55-1-41(c), which states in pertinent part as follows:   \nWritten notice by a domestic or foreign corporation to its shareholder is \neffective when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon \nprepaid and correctly addressed to the shareholder’ s address shown in \nthe corporation’s current record of shareholders.   \n \nN.C.G.S. § 55-1-41(c) (emphasis added). \n \n92. Therefore, pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 55-1-41(c), notice to Plaintiffs of the \n16 June Shareholders’ Meeting was proper in that it was mailed twelve days before \nthe meeting.  \n93. Plaintiffs also argue that the 4 June  2021 notice that was mailed to \nPlaintiffs of the 16 June Directors’ Meeting was invalid—albeit for a different reason.  \n94. As recited above, at the 16 June Shareholders’ Meeting, Jay and Ann \n(representing a majority of the company’s shareholders) voted to dissolve the existing \nBoard and replace it with a new Board consisting solely of Jay, Ann, and Armistead.  \nThe newly constituted Board conducted a meeting immediately following the \nconclusion of the 16 June Shareholders’ Meeting in which it voted to call the Maucks’ \nshares.   \n95. Notice of the 16 June Directors’ Meeting was sent to Plaintiffs on 4 June \n2021.  Plaintiffs argue that this notice was invalid because it was sent prior to the \nelection of the “new ” Board of D irectors.  Plaintiffs assert that because the \ncomposition of the Board at the time the Board meeting took place was different than \nits composition at the time notice of the meeting was given, a new notice was required \nto be sent out to the members of the newly constituted Board.  \n96. Plaintiffs’ argument appears to elevate form over substance given that \nthe “new” Board consisted entirely of individuals who had likewise served on the “old” \nBoard—that is, Armistead, Jay, and Ann.  Each of them received sufficient notice of \nthe upcoming 16 June Directors’ Meeting.   \n97. However, even assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs are correct  on this \nissue, any such defect w as cured by the B oard’s adoption of the 6 October Written \nConsent, which —as noted above—ratified the call vote taken at the 16 June  \nDirectors’ Meeting. \n98. At the 25 July hearing  on the present Motions , Plaintiffs’ counsel \nconceded that th e 6 October Written Consent would have cured any notice defects \nregarding the 16 June Directors’ Meeting—assuming that the 16 June Shareholders’ \nMeeting was properly noticed.  Given that the Court has now concluded that notice \nof the 16 June Shareholders’ Meeting was, in fact, properly given, the Court likewise \nconcludes that the  6 October Written Consent  rendered moot any objections to the \nmanner in which notice was given of the 16 June Directors’ Meeting.   \n99. Plaintiffs’ second argument in its summary judgment response brief is \nunrelated to the notice issue.  Instead, Plaintiffs contend in this second argument \nthat the Shareholders’ Agreement should be interpreted as requiring—as a condition \nprecedent to the actual call vote —a prior determination of the value of the  selling \nshareholders’ shares.  For this reason, Plaintiffs contend, it was improper for the call \nvote to have been taken at the 16 June Directors’ Meeting because there had been no \nprior valuation of the Maucks’ shares in Cherry Oil.  \n100. However, the Court is unable to agree with th is interpretation.  As \nPlaintiffs concede , there is no express language in the Shareholders ’ Agreement \nsupporting the proposition that the valuation of the Maucks’ shares was a condition \nprecedent to the call vote.  Moreover, based on its careful reading of the Shareholders’ \nAgreement, the Court believes the better interpretation is that the entire process is \ntriggered by the call vote .  In other words, only once such a vote has occurred does \nthe procedure for determining the price of the selling shareholders’ shares (as set out \nin Section 6) become necessary.    \n101. Therefore, the Court concludes that summary judgment should be  \nGRANTED in favor of Defendants on Plaintiffs’ breach of contract claim.  \nII. Motion for Supervision  \n102. In their Motion for Supervision, Defendants ask the Court “to undertake \nsupervision of the call of shares of [Cherry Oil] pursuant to the  . . . Shareholders’ \nAgreement, dated October 15, 1998 . . . so that the process can finally be completed[.]”  \n(Mot. for Super., at 1 –2.)  Defendants seek the Court’s intervention based on their \ncontention that “Plaintiffs have thwarted the C all process ” while simultaneously \n“assert[ing] a contradictory claim against Defendants for failure to complete the Call \nprocess.”  (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Super., at 5, ECF No. 80.) \n103. Plaintiffs do not appear to oppose Defendants’ request that the Court \ntake some form of supervisory role regarding this process but argue that the Court \nshould first rule on the substantive issues contained in the pending Motion for \nSummary Judgment, including the question  of whether the call vote was taken at a \nproperly noticed meeting.   In this Opinion, the Court has now d efinitively ruled on \nthese issues. \n104. Based on the briefs submitted by the parties and the arguments of \ncounsel at the 25 July hearing, it is clear that the parties disagree in a number of \nrespects on how the process set out in the Shareholders’ Agreement should proceed \ngoing forward, particularly with  regard to harmonizing the respective deadlines \ncontained in Sections 6B and 11.   \n105. Although it appears the Court will need to resolve the parties’ disputes  \non this subjec t, the Court believes the parties should be given the opportunity  to \nsubmit new briefs focusing solely on this issue now that the Court has granted \nsummary judgment on Plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract \nclaims.  \n106. Accordingly, the Court DEFERS ruling on the Motion for Supervision  \nat the present time.  The parties are DIRECTED to file briefs on or before 25 \nSeptember 2023 containing their respective positions on the remaining steps that \nneed to be taken to complete the purchase of the Maucks’ shares by Cherry Oil \npursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement.  Each side’s brief shall contain  no more \nthan 5,000 words and shall comply in all respects with the provisions of the Business \nCourt Rules applicable to briefs.         \nCONCLUSION \n THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED as follows:  \n1. Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED with respect to \nPlaintiffs’ claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract;  \n2. The Court DEFERS ruling on Defendants’ Motion for Supervision; and  \n3. The parties are DIRECTED to file new briefs under the terms set forth \nabove on or before 25 September 2023.  \n SO ORDERED, this the 15th day of September, 2023.  \n        \n \n/s/ Mark A. Davis     \n       Mark A. Davis  \n       Special Superior Court Judge  \n       for Complex Business Cases  "
