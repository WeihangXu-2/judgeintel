Plaintiff Worldwide Insurance Network , Inc. (“Worldwide”) sells insurance \nand other financial products using a network of independent agents.  In this action, \nWorldwide has sued some of its former agents, alleging that they conspired to obtain \nWorldwide’s confidential information and to use that information to compete against \nit.  Defendants now ask the Court to compel arbitration of all claims and to stay the \ncase pending arbitration.  For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS the motion \nin part and DENIES the motion in part.  \nEllis & Winters LLP , by Christopher W. Jackson , and Taylor English \nDuma LLP, by William A. Clineburg, Jr. and Eric S. Fisher, for Plaintiff \nWorldwide Insurance Network, Inc. \n \nBrooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard LLP, by Jeffrey E. \nOleynik, and Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC, by \nBrad C. Moody  and Lott Warren,  for Defendant s Messer Financial \nGroup, Inc., Roy Messer, Bill Rice, Moore’s Financial Group, Inc. f/k/a \nRod Moore & Associates, LLC, and Rod Moore.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \n \nI. \nBACKGROUND1 \n2. Through its Smart Choice ® Agent’s Program , Worldwide enlists \nindependent insurance agents to sell its products and services to end customers.  \n(Compl. ¶¶ 10, 11, ECF No. 3 .)  Defendants are all former participants in the \nprogram, though with varying degrees of involvement and subject to different \ncontracts, at least three of which are relevant here.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 14, 15, 18.) \n3. Two defendants—Rod Moore and Moore’s Financial Group, Inc. (collectively, \n“Moore Defendants”)—are based in Mississippi.  (Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6.)  It isn’t clear from \nthe complaint when the Moore Defendants joined Worldwide’s network of agents, but \nmaterials filed in support of their motion suggest they became agents in June 2015 .  \n(See Mot. to File Under Seal Ex. B, ECF No. 41.2.)  A few months later , the Moore \nDefendants agreed to serve as Worldwide’s territory manager for Mississippi, taking \non the responsibility to recruit and manage other Smart Choice® agents.  (See Compl. \n¶¶ 16, 17.)  They formalized the a rrangement in a Territory Manager Agreement .  \n(Compl. ¶ 18; see also ECF No. 22 [“Territory Manager Agreement”].) \n4. The other defendants , all North Carolinians, are Messer Financial Group, \nInc. and its two founders, Bill Rice and Roy Messer  (collectively, “Messer \nDefendants”).  In November 2015,  they entered into a contract to become  Smart \nChoice® agents (“Agent Agreement”).  (Compl. ¶¶ 13, 14; see also ECF No. 44 [“Agent \n                                            \n1  As context for the Court’s analysis, this section describes the allegations in the complaint \nand also the relevant facts  regarding the pending motion, which  are largely undisputed  \n(though the parties draw different conclusions from them ).  The Court elects to make \nnecessary findings of fact and conclusions of law at the end of this Opinion. \nAgreement”].)  Then, in early 2016, Messer Financial Group entered into a separate \ncontract (“Referral Agreement”) in which it agreed to refer new agents to Worldwide \nin return for a commission .  (Compl. ¶  15; see also  ECF No. 5 4 [“Referral \nAgreement”].)   \n5. These arrangements were all short lived.  The Moore Defendants res igned \nas territory manager  in April 2016 .  (Compl. ¶ 22.)  Worldwide and the Messer \nDefendants terminated the Agent Agreement and the Referral Agreement in June \n2016.  (Compl. ¶ 28.)  \n6. Worldwide now alleges that the whole series of events was a sham.   \nAccording to the complaint,  the Moore Defendants and Messer Defendants  had \nworked together since 2008, yet concealed that fact from Worldwide.  ( See Compl. \n¶ 19.)  When Defendants joined the Smart Choice® Program in 2015, it was allegedly \nthe first step in a conspiracy to obtain Worldwide’s confidential information .  ( See \nCompl. ¶¶ 19, 20.)  Upon leaving the program, Defendants took the next step and \nbegan competing against Worldwide, going so far as to start a new company together \nto do so.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 24, 25, 32, 33–37.)  Worldwide asserts claims for breach of \nthe non-compete, non-solicitation, and confidentiality  restrictions in each contract.  \n(See Compl. ¶¶ 42, 48, 54.)  It also asserts a number of non-contract claims, including \nconspiracy, unjust  enrichment, misappropriation of  trade secrets,  and tortious \ninterference with contract (against only the Messer Defendants).  (Compl. ¶¶ 59, 63–\n66, 71, 77.) \n7. Defendants contend that all of these claims are subject to binding  \narbitration.  (See Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. 3, ECF No. 40  [“Defs.’ Mem.”].)  Each of the \nthree relevant contracts (the Agent Agreement, Referral Agreement , and Territory \nManager Agreement) includes an arbitration clause.  The Agent Agreement states \nthat “[a]ny dispute, claim or controversy arising from or relating to” the agreement \nor to the “construction, validity or enforcement” of the agreement shall be arbitrated \nin accordance with the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association \n(“AAA Rules”) .  (Agent Agreement §  11.2.)  The clauses contained in the Referral \nAgreement and the Territory Manager Agreement , though identical to each other , \ndiffer in important ways  from the language used in the Agent Agreement.  These \nclauses also incorporate the AAA Rules but expressly exclude ce rtain claims  from \narbitration, stating that no party “will be compelled” to arbitrate disputes involving \n“actual or threatened disclosure or misuse of confidential information ,” “a breach of \nany covenant not to compete,” or “a violation of non-solicitation provisions.”  (Referral \nAgreement § 10(D); Territory Manager Agreement § 14(D).)  \n8. In its opposition brief, Worldwide responds that  Defendants unreasonably \ndelayed in seeking arbitration, that  many of its claims arise from  common-law or \nstatutory duties rather than from the contracts, and that no claims fall within the \nscope of any of the arbitration clauses.  (See Pl.’s Resp. in Opp. 1–2, ECF No. 51 [“Pl.’s \nResp.”].)  At the Court’s request, the parties also filed supplemental briefs to address \nwhether questions of arbitrability should be decided by the Court or the arbitrator.  \n(See Pl.’s Supp. Br., ECF No. 64; Defs.’ Supp. Br., ECF No. 65.)   \n9. The Court held a hearing on September 12, 2018, at which all parties were \nrepresented.  The motion is ripe for determination.  \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n10. At the hearing, the parties agreed that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) \ngoverns the resolution of these motions .  E ach contract  includes a choice -of-law \nprovision stating that questions of arbitrability are governed by the FAA and federal \ncommon law rather than state law .  ( See Agent Agreement  § 11.2(F); Referral \nAgreement § 10(C)(7); Territory Manager Agreement § 14(C)(7).)   \n11. “Nonetheless, ‘even when the FAA governs a dispute, state law fills \nprocedural gaps in the FAA as it is applied in state courts.’”  Gaylor, Inc. v. Vizor, \nLLC, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 102, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 30, 2015) (quoting Cold \nSprings Ventures, LLC v. Gilead Scis., Inc., 2014 NCBC LEXIS 10, at *8 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Mar. 26, 2014)).  By statute, when faced with a dispute concerning a purported \nagreement to arbitrate, this Court must “proceed summarily to decide the issue and \norder the parties to arbitra te unless it finds that there is no enforceable agreement \nto arbitrate.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. §  1-569.7(a)(2).  “[I]n determining the threshold issue \nof whether a mandatory arbitration agreement exists, the court necessarily must sit \nas a finder of fact.”  Capps v. Blondeau, 2010 NCBC LEXIS 10, at *7 n.6 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Apr. 13, 2010); see also Griessel v. Temas Eye Ctr., P.C. , 199 N.C. App. 314, 317, \n681 S.E.2d 446, 448 (2009) (“[A]n order denying a motion to compel arbitration must \ninclude findings of fact as to ‘whether the parties had a valid agreement to arbitrate’ \nand, if so, ‘whether the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of that \nagreement.’” (citations omitted)). \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n \n12. Deciding whether a claim is arbitrable is “a two -step inquiry.”  Peabody \nHolding Co., LLC v. United Mine Workers of Am. , 665 F.3d 96, 101 (4th Cir. 2012).  \nThe court must first determine whether the parties intended for the arbitrator or the \ncourt to decide the arbitrability of a dispute .  See id.  Only when the court is the \nproper decision maker should it then decide whether the dispute is in fact arbitrable.  \nSee id.   \n13. At the first step, gateway questions of arbitrability are usually reserved for \njudicial determination.  See, e.g., Virginia Carolina Tools, Inc. v. Int’l Tool Supply, \nInc., 984 F.2d 113, 117 (4th Cir. 1993);  Hall v. Dancy, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 63, at *5–\n6 (N.C. Super. Ct. June 27, 2018) .  But “parties can, and often do, delegate \narbitrability to the arbitrator.”  Charlotte Student Hous. DST v. Choate Constr. Co., \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 88, at *8 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 24, 2018).  When there is clear and \nunmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability, courts must \nenforce the delegation just as they would enforce any other term of th e parties’ \nagreement.  See AT&T Techs., Inc., v. Commc’ns Workers of Am. , 475 U.S. 643, 649 \n(1986); Rent-A-Center, W., Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 69 (2010). \n14. At the second step, court s must apply ordinary principles of contract law.   \nSee, e.g., First Options of Chi., Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944 (1995).  In applying \nthese principles, though, “due regard must be given to the federal policy favoring \narbitration, and ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved in \nfavor of ar bitration.”  Volt Info. Scis.  Inc. v. Bd. of Trs . of Leland Stanford Junior \nUniv., 489 U.S. 468, 475 –76 (1989).  Put another way, “any doubts concerning the \nscope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.”   Moses H. Cone \nMem’l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24–25 (1983). \n15. Applying this two-step inquiry here is a challenge.  The three arbitration \nagreements have different but overlapping language, and two of the three combine \nwhat appears to be a broad delegation of arbitra bility to the arbitrator with a \ncarve-out that narrows the scope of arbitrable issues .  The agreements were also \nsigned by different parties : Rice and Messer signed only the Agent Agreement ; the \nMoore Defendants  signed only  the Territory Manager Agreement ; and Messer \nFinancial Group signed both the Agent Agreement and the Referral Agreement.  The \nCourt considers each in turn.   \nA. Rice and Messer \n16. Both sides agree that the Agent Agreement delegates gateway questions of \narbitrability to the arbitrator.  ( See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 2, 5; Defs.’ Supp. Br. 3–4.)  They \ndo so because the  agreement incorporates the AAA Rules , which state that “[t]he \narbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any \nobjections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement \nor to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim .”  AAA, Commercial Arbitration \nRules and Mediation Procedures, Rule 7(a) (Oct. 1, 2013).  “[V]irtually every [federal] \ncircuit to have considered the is sue” has held that  incorporation of the AAA Rules \ninto an arbitration agreement serves as clear and unmistakable evidence that the \nparties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.  Oracle Am., Inc. v. Myriad Grp ., A.G., 724 \nF.3d 1069, 1074 (9th Cir. 2013) (listing cases); see also Epic Games, Inc. v. Murphy -\nJohnson, 247 N.C. App. 54, 63, 785 S.E.2d 137, 145 (2016). \n17. For Rice and Messer, there is nothing else for the Court to decide.  They are \nsignatories only to the Agen t Agreement.   Worldwide concedes that its claim for \nbreach of that agreement is subject to arbitration.  ( See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 5 .)  And the \nparties’ remaining disputes concern whether  Defendants waived their right to \narbitrate and whether the non-contract claims fall within the scope of the arbitration \nclause—that is , whether conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and related claims are \nclaims “arising from or relating to” the Agent Agreement.  (Agent Agreement § 11.2.)  \nThose disputes are questions of arbitrability for the arbitrator to decide. \n18. Although Worldwide contends that the Court should not compel arbitration \nof its non-contract claims, it provides no sound basis for its position.  Worldwide does \nnot, for example, cite or rely on the line of cases holding that a trial court may refuse \nto send issues of arbitrability to the arbitrator if the y are “wholly groundless.”  E.g., \nArcher & White Sales, Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc. , 878 F.3d 488, 495 (5th Cir. 2017) , \ncert. granted 86 U.S.L.W. 3640 (U.S. June 25, 2018) (N o. 17-1272); but see Jones v. \nWaffle House, Inc. , 866 F.3d 1257, 1268 –69 (11th Cir. 2017) (rejecting “wholly \ngroundless” exception). \n19. Even if it had, the Court would conclude that Rice and Messer’s assertion of \narbitrability is not wholly groundless.   The unjust -enrichment claim depends on \nallegations that Worldwide conferred benefits on Rice and Messer “under” the Agent \nAgreement.  (Compl. ¶  57.)  The tortious-interference claim depends on allegations \nthat Rice and Messer interfered with the contract ual obligations of another Smart \nChoice® agent.  (See Compl. ¶¶ 62–66.)  And the claims for conspiracy, trade -secret \nmisappropriation, and unfair trade practices all depend, in part, on the allegations \nthat Rice and Messer breached the Agent Agreement or m isused the confidential \ninformation received under it.  (See Compl. ¶¶  72, 78, 86, 90 .)  It is not wholly \ngroundless to contend that these claims arise out of or relate to the Agent Agreement.  \nAnd whether they do, in fact, arise out of or relate to the agreement is a question for \nthe arbitrator, not for this Court. \n20. In its supplemental brief, Worldwide requests leave to amend its complaint \nto remove the claim for breach of the Agent Agreement, apparently believing that, in \nthe absence of a contract claim, t he non -contract claims would not be subject to \narbitration.  (See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 5.)  This is incorrect.  The presence or absence of a \ncontract claim has little bearing on whether the parties agreed to arbitrate other \nclaims.  See, e.g., U.S. Nutraceuticals, LLC v. Cyanotech Corp. , 769 F.3d 1308, 1312 \n(11th Cir. 2014) .  Because Worldwide does not dispute that the Agent Agreement \nincludes a valid arbitration clause, even if it dismissed its claim for breach of that \nagreement, Rice and Messe r would be entitled to rely on the arbitration clause and \nto argue that any non-contract claims fall within its scope.  In that circumstance, the \nquestion of arbitrability would still be one for the arbitrator.  The Court therefore \ndenies leave to amend be cause an amendment eliminating the claim for breach of \ncontract would not affect the arbitrability of any other claims. \n21. In short, Worldwide, Rice, and Messer clearly and unmistakably delegated \ngateway questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.  All claims asserted against Rice \nand Messer shall be submitted to binding arbitration. \nB. The Moore Defendants \n22. Although the Moore Defendants are not parties to the Agent Agreement ,2 \nthey rely on it as a basis for compelling arbitration of the claims asserted against \nthem.  (See Defs.’ Mem. 11 n.9.)   There are some circumstances in which  a \nnonsignatory may enforce an arbitration agreement against a signatory.  See, e.g., \nInt’l Paper Co. v. Schwabedissen Maschinen & Anlagen GmbH, 206 F.3d 411, 415 (4th \nCir. 2000); Charlotte Student Hous., 2018 NCBC LEXIS 88, at *11.  But the Moore \nDefendants do not contend that any of those circumstan ces exist here.  Thus, if the \nclaims against the Moore Defendants are arbitrable, it must be due to the arbitration \nclause in the Territory Manager Agreement, not the Agent Agreement.  \n23. The Territory Manager Agreement requires arbitration of disputes “arising \nfrom [the agreement] and the business relationship between” Worldwide and the \nMoore Defendants .  ( Territory Manager Agreement § 14(C).)  Like the Agent \nAgreement, the Territory Manager  Agreement incorporates  the AAA Rules.  (See \n                                            \n2 The Moore Defendants did enter into their own Smart Choice ® Agent Agreement in June \n2015, and that agreement includes an arbitration clause identical to the Agent Agreement \nsigned by the Messer Defendants.  (See Mot. to File Under Seal Ex. B § 11.2 )  Because the \nMoore Defendants do not seek to compel arbitration on the basis of the June 2015 agreement, \nthough, the Court does not consider it. \nTerritory Manager Agreement § 14(C).)  Unlike the Agent Agreement, though, it \nincludes an express carve -out, stating that neither party  “will be compelled to  \narbitrate: (i) any claim or dispute involving actual or threatened disclosure or misuse \nof confidential information; (ii) a breach of any covenant not to compete; or (iii) a \nviolation of non-solicitation provisions.”  (Territory Manager Agreement § 14(D).) \n24. This raises a difficult question: does a carve -out in an arbitration clause \nrequire the Court to decide questions of arbitrability even though the clause also  \nincorporates the AAA Rules?  Worldwide contends that it does; Defendants say no.  \n(See Pl.’s Supp. Br. 3–5; Defs.’ Supp. Br. 2–4.)  Both sides focus on a recent decision \nfrom this Court that applies Delaware law , on the theory that federal law (which \ngoverns here) is the same.  See Local Soc., Inc. v. Stallings, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 94, at \n*23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 9, 2017) (concluding, under Delaware law, that arbitrability \nwas for the Court to decide despite incorporation of AAA Rules). \n25. In fact, the federal courts of appeals are divided on this question.  At least \nthe Second and Fifth Circuits have held that courts must decide the arbitrability of \nclaims arguably subject to a carve -out provision, even if the agreement also \nincorporates the AAA Rules .  See Archer & White Sales , 878 F.3d at 494, 497; \nNASDAQ OMX Grp., Inc. v. UBS Sec., LLC , 770 F.3d 1010, 1032 (2d Cir. 2014); see \nalso Turi v. Main St. Adoption Servs., LLP, 633 F.3d 496, 511 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding \nthat incorporation of AAA Rules did not delegate arbitrability to arbitrator when \nscope of arbitration clause was narrow).  By contrast, the Ninth and Tenth Circuits \nhave held that  incorporation of the AAA Rules evidences an intent to  delegate \narbitrability to the arbitrator regardless of a carve-out.  See Oracle, 724 F.3d at 1076; \nBelnap v. Iasis Healthcare, 844 F.3d 1272, 1275, 1292–93 (10th Cir. 2017). \n26. Because these cases do not give rise to any clear rule of federal law, the \nCourt looks to first principles.  The United States Supreme Court has stressed that \narbitration “is a matter of consent, not coercion.”  Volt Info. Scis. , 489 U.S. at 479.  \n“[P]arties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit,” \nincluding by agreeing to arbitrate arbitrability.  Id.  But no party should “be required \nto submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit .”  United \nSteelworkers of Am. v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960).  Although \nthere is a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, that policy does not \napply to agreements to arbitrate arbitrability.  See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, \n537 U.S. 79, 83 (2002) .  The presumption instead is  that parties do not intend to \ndelegate arbitrability because presuming otherwise “might too often force unwilling \nparties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge, not an \narbitrator, would decide.”  First Options, 514 U.S. at 945. \n27. Bearing this guidance in mind, it is the Court’s duty to enforce the Territory \nManager Agreement according to its terms and under ordinary principles of contract \nlaw.  Here, the parties were free to design an arbitration clause that refers to the \nAAA Rules and also carves out specific claims.  The potential conflict between the two \nterms is neither unusual nor insoluble.  Contracts often include terms that could be \nread to be in tension with one another, and when they do, the Court’s task “is not to \nfind discord in differing clauses, but to harmonize all clauses if possible.”  State v. \nPhilip Morris USA Inc. , 363 N.C. 623, 632, 685 S.E.2d 85, 91 (2009) (citation and \nquotation marks omitted).  \n28. Reading the Territory Manager Agreement as a whole, the Court concludes \nthat the parties intended to divide questions of arbitrability between the Court and \nthe arbitrator.  Section 14(C) represents the parties’ agreement to arbitrate disputes \narising out of their relationship under the AAA Rules “ unless” the disputes are \n“excepted from” arbitration by the carve -out in section 14(D).  (Territory Manager \nAgreement §  14(C).)  Section 14(D) goes on to state that neither side “will be \ncompelled to arbitrate” claims recited in the carve -out.  (Territory Manager \nAgreement §  14(D).)  Taken together , t his language requires the  Court to decide \nwhether a given claim falls within the carve -out and, thus, whether it is subject to \narbitration.  To hold otherwise would require compelling Worldwide to arbitrate those \nclaims, which is precisely what the agreement forbids.   On the other hand, if \narbitrability disputes arise for claims falling outside the carve-out, those disputes are \nfor the arbitrator under the terms of the AAA Rules.  By construing the contract this \nway, the Court gives meaning to the parties’ agreement to incorporate the AAA Rules \nand to exclude specific claims from arbitration. \n29. The Court further concludes that all of Worldwide’s claims against the \nMoore Defendants fall within the carve-out.  Worldwide’s claim for breach of contract \nturns on the contract’s non-compete, non-solicitation, and confidentiality restrictions.  \n(Compl. ¶ 54. )  The non-contract claims all arise from allegations that the Moore \nDefendants enter ed into the contract  for the purpose of obtaining Wor ldwide’s \nconfidential information  and trade secrets so as  to compete unlawfully against  \nWorldwide.  (See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 54, 59, 71, 77, 93.)  Thus, each asserted claim is, at \na minimum, a “claim or dispute involving actual or threatened disclosure or misuse \nof confidential information ,” as set forth in section 14(D).   (Territory Manager \nAgreement § 14(D).)   \n30. The claims asserted against the Moore Defendants are therefore not \narbitrable.  The Court denies the motion to compel arbitration as to those claims. \nC. Messer Financial Group \n31. The claims against  Messer Financial Group present a different wrinkle .  \nMesser Financial Group is a signatory not only to the Agent Agreement  but also to \nthe Referral Agreement, which contains an arbitration clause  identical to the one \ncontained in the Territory Manager Agreement .  (See Referral Agreement § 10(C).)   \nThe question then is who decides arbitrability issues when one arbitration agreement \ndelegates them to the arbitrator and a second agreement reserves at least some issues \nfor the Court. \n32. Neither side was able to find case law squarely on point.  The Court’s \nresearch, though, reveals a clear answer: the arbitrator must decide arbitrability.  \nThe Eleventh Circuit recently held as much in a case with highly similar facts.  See \nU.S. Nutraceuticals , 769 F.3d at  1311 (compelling arbitration when one relevant \nagreement incorporated AAA Rules and a second agreement had a carve -out for \nbreach of confidentiality re strictions).  Several federal district courts have reached \nthe same conclusion.  See, e.g., Cochrane v. Open Text Corp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n78006, at *8 –10 (N.D. Cal. June 16, 2015); Adam Techs. Int’l S.A. de C.V. v. \nSutherland Global Servs, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160155, at *4 (N.D. Tex. May \n26, 2011).   \n33. These decisions are compelling.  Worldwide concedes that the Agent \nAgreement includes a valid arbitration clause and that it clearly and unmistakably \ndelegates questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.  It is at least arguably the case \nthat all claims asserted against Messer Financial Group arise out of or relate to th e \nAgent Agreement.  For the Court to decide that the claims are not arbitrable would \ndefeat the parties’ intent to have the arbitrator make that decision. \n34. Apart from its request for leave to amend its complaint to remove the claim \nfor breach of the Agent Agreement (which the Court has already rejected), Worldwide \noffers no other argument to support denial of the motion to compel arbitration of the \nclaims asserted against Messer Financial Group.  Having determined that Worldwide \nand Messer Financial Group clearly and unmistakably delegated gateway questions \nof arbitrability to the arbitrator in the Agent Agreement, the Court concludes that all \nclaims asserted against Messer Financial Group  must be submitted to binding \narbitration.  \nD. Scope of Stay Pending Arbitration \n35. Defendants ask the Court to stay all proceedings pending resolution of \narbitration.  By statute, “[i]f the court orders arbitration, the court on just terms shall \nstay any judicial proceeding that involves a claim subject to the arbitration.”   N.C. \nGen. Stat. § 1-569.7(g).  If the claim to be arbitrated is severable from any remaining \nclaims, the stay may be limited to the arbitrable claim.  Id.  A court’s decision to grant \nor deny a stay is discretionary.  See Sloan Fin. Grp., Inc. v. Beckett , 159 N.C. Ap p. \n470, 485, 583 S.E.2d 325, 334 (2003); Gaylor, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 102, at *21–22.  \n36. The claims against the Moore Defendants  are tied to the same core set of \nfacts as the claims against the Messer Defendants—a conspiracy between the two to \nobtain Worldwide’s confidential information and then jointly to create a competing \nbusiness.  ( See, e.g., Compl. ¶  20.)  Given the overlap, it would be more efficient to \nawait the arbitrator’s decision —at least as to the question of arbitrability —before \nmoving forward with this litigation.  Accordingly, t he Court, in its discretion,  stays \nall claims pending the arbitrator’s decision as to the arbitrability of the claims against \nthe Messer Defendants.  Upon receiving the arbitrator’s decision  as to arbitrability, \nthe Court will revisit the stay to determine whether it should be maintained as to the \nclaims against the Moore Defendants  or should instead be limited to the arbitrable \nclaims, if any.  \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n \n37. The Court FINDS and CONCLUDES as follows: \na. The Agent Agreement , the Referral Agreement , and the Territory \nManager Agreement include valid arbitration agreement s.  All are  governed by \nthe FAA.   \nb. Worldwide, Rice, and Messer clearly and unmistakably delegated \ngateway questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator in the Agent Agreement.  The \narbitrator must decide any arbitrability disputes as to the claims against Rice and \nMesser in the first instance. \nc. Worldwide and Messer Financial Group clearly and unmistakably \ndelegated gateway questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator in the Agent \nAgreement.  The arbitrator must decide any arbitrability disputes as to the claims \nagainst Messer Financial Group in the first instance. \nd. Worldwide and the Moore Defendants did not clearly and unmistakably \ndelegate gateway question of arbitrability to the arbitrator in the Territory \nManager Agreement.  The claims asserted against the Moore Defendants do not \nfall within the scope of the arbitration clause contained within the  Territory \nManager Agreement and, as a result, are not arbitrable. \n38. For these reasons, the Court GRANTS the motion as to the Messer \nDefendants and ORDERS all claims against the Messer Defendants to arbitration.  \nThe Court DENIES the motion as to the Moore Defendants and ORDERS that the \nMoore Defendants shall not be compelled to arbitration.  The Court STAYS all claims \npending the arbitrator’s decision on the arbitrability of the claims asserted against \nthe Messer Defendants.   \n39. The Court further ORDERS that the parties shall notify the Court of the \narbitrator’s decision as to arbitrability within seven days after the decision has been \nissued. \n \n  \nThis the 2nd day of October, 2018. \n /s/ Adam M.
