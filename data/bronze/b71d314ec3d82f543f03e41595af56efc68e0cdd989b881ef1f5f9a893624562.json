Gilead Sci., Inc., 2015 NCBC 1.\n \n \nBackground \n1. Defendant Gilead Sciences, Inc. (\"Gilead\") has joined Plaintiffs2 as \nrespondents in an arbitration action (\"Arbitration\") pending before the American \nArbitration Association (\"AAA\").3 \n2. Plaintiffs are former investors, shareholders, and directors of Old Kryo, Inc. \n(\"NC Kryo\"),4 a North Carolina corporation. In September 2010, NC Kryo entered into a \ncontract with Gilead (\"Gilead Contract\"), which contained a mandatory arbitration clause. 5 \nIn March 2011, NC Kryo entered into an agreement (\"Kryo Transaction\") to sell all or \nsubstantially all of its assets and business to Kryosphere, Inc. (\"GA Kryo\"), a Georgia \ncorporation.6 As part of the Kryo Transaction, NC Kryo purportedly assigned the Gilead \nContract to GA Kryo.7 Gilead contends that NC Kryo did not obtain prior written consent \nfrom Gilead for the assignment of the Gilead Contract to GA Kryo as required under the \nGilead Contract.8 NC Kryo was subsequently dissolved.9 In October 2013, Gilead initiated \nthe Arbitration against GA Kryo and the Plaintiffs for alleged breach of the Gilead \nContract.10  \n3. Although Plaintiffs did not sign the Gilead Contract, they have been named \nas respondents in the Arbitration. Gilead contends that Plaintiffs committed fraud, \n                                                 \n2 In addition to the remaining Plaintiffs in this action, Gilead named as respondents in the \narbitration Commonwealth Ventures, LLC, Endeavors Venture, and Jeannie Mullen. These former \nPlaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims asserted in this action with prejudice on June 16, 2014. \nGilead additionally named in the arbitration proceeding Kryosphere, Inc., L. Eric Hallman, Douglas \nBaker, Neil Jones, Michael J. Schierbeek, John O. Norton, Patrick Norton, and Ryan Norton. These \nparties were dismissed from this action by Court Order on November 18, 2014.  \n3 Am. Compl. ¶¶ 79-80. \n4 Id. ¶¶ 1-6. \n5 Ex. A to Am.

(\"Arbitration Demand\"). \n \n \ndepleted NC Kryo's resources and are in substance the alter ego of NC Kryo.  Gilead argues \nthat Plaintiffs’ actions and relationship with NC Kryo would expose Plaintiffs to liability to \nGilead under the instrumentality rule even though Plaintiffs were not signatories to the \nGilead Contract or any other arbitration agreement.11 Plaintiffs concede that they could be \ncompelled to participate in the Arbitration if they are liable under the instrumentality \nrule.12 Plaintiffs contend, however, that Gilead has not sufficiently shown misconduct on \nPlaintiffs' part as investors and directors of NC Kryo that would subject them to such \nliability. Plaintiffs therefore brought this civil action seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief from this Court. \n4. On Tuesday, March 4, 2014, the Court heard Plaintiffs' requests for \ntemporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief (\"Injunction Motions\").13 In its \nMarch 26, 2014, Amended Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Notice of \nHearing (\"Preliminary Order\"),14 the Court chose to treat the Injunction Motions as \npreliminary requests pending a determination of Plaintiffs' Declaratory Judgment Claim, \nwhich the Court determined should be treated as a motion to stay arbitration pursuant to \nG.S. 1-569.7 (\"Declaratory Action to Stay Arbitration\").15 In the Preliminary Order, the \nCourt found and concluded that a determination over the arbitrability of the dispute \nbetween the Parties is within the province of the Court, subject to the restriction that the \nCourt refrain from impermissibly considering the dispute's underlying merits.16 The Court \nalso concluded that this dispute is governed by both the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 \n                                                 \n11 See Arbitration Demand. \n12 Pls.'

That is, the Injunction Motions were treated as motions to \ntemporarily stay the Arbitration pending final resolution of the arbitrability dispute. \n16 Id. at 11, 13 ¶¶ 18, 21. \n \n \nUSC § 1 et seq., and North Carolina's Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (\"NCRUAA\"), G.S. \n1-569.1 et seq. More specifically, the NCRUAA governs the procedural aspects of this \ndispute, while the FAA governs with regard to substantive issues. The Court's Preliminary \nOrder resolved the issues raised by Plaintiffs' Injunction Motions, provided a short \ndiscovery period related to the Declaratory Action to Stay Arbitration, and noticed the same \nfor hearing.17 On Friday, December 5, 2014, the Court heard Plaintiffs' Declaratory Action \nto Stay Arbitration. \nProcedure \n5. At the December 5, 2014, hearing, the Parties continued to manifest a \nfundamental disagreement on the procedural contours of a G.S. 1-569.7(b) inquiry in this \nmatter and under these facts. \n6. G.S. 1-569.7(b) requires courts presented with a motion to stay arbitration to \n\"proceed summarily to decide . . . if there is an enforceable agreement to arbitrate.\" As \nnoted in the Preliminary Order, the exact procedural setting contemplated by the statute's \nrequirement of summary determination is not immediately apparent. Plaintiffs, however, \ncorrectly observe that the statute and relevant case law taken together establish that the \nCourt is required to make finding facts in order to determine whether an “enforceable \nagreement to arbitrate” exists which may involve conducting the equivalent of a non-jury \ntrial. See Cornelius v. Lipscomb, __ N.C. App. __, __, 734 S.E.2d 870, 871 (2012) (Court of \nAppeals has \"repeatedly held\" that order denying motion to compel arbitration must include \n                                                 \n17 Plaintiffs' First Cause of Action contains a prayer for declaratory relief on three separate issues. \nSee Am. Compl. ¶ 141 (a)-(c). As noted in the Preliminary Order, the Declaratory Action to Stay \nArbitration includes only the relief sought in subsections (b) and (c) of that paragraph. For reasons \ndiscussed at length in the Preliminary Order as well as below, the court cannot properly consider the \nrelief sought in Am. Compl. ¶ 141(a), which seeks a broad declaration that \"there is no legal or \nfactual basis for Gilead to pierce the [NC Kryo] corporate veil against [Plaintiffs] with regard to the \nGilead Contract.\" \n \n \nfindings of fact as to arbitrability); Routh v. Snap-On Tools Corp., 108 N.C. App. 268 (1992) \n(Routh II) (After remand due to trial court's failure to summarily determine whether valid \nagreement to arbitrate exists, trial court properly held \"non-jury trial\" and made findings of \nfact in order determine motion to compel arbitration); Blow v. Shaughnessy, 68 N.C.App. 1, \n18 (1984), disc. review denied, 311 N.C. 751 (1984) (trial court in motion to stay proceedings \nand compel arbitration was \"sitting as the trier of fact\"); Capps v. Blondeau, 2010 NCBC 7 \nn. 6 (N.C. Super. Ct. 2010) (\"[I]n determining the threshold issue of whether a mandatory \narbitration agreement exists, the court necessarily must sit as a finder of fact. Accordingly, \nfor such limited purpose, the court also may consider evidence as to facts that are in \ndispute.\") (citing \nSlaughter v. Swicegood, 162 N.C. App. 457, 461 (2004)); see also Routh v. \nSnap-On Tools Corp., 101 N.C. App. 703, 706 (1991) (Routh I) (Inappropriate under \npredecessor statute to G.S. 1-569.7 for judge to apply \"a summary judgment standard of \nwhether there was a 'genuine issue of material fact'\").  \n7. While G.S. 1-569.7(b) requires summary determination and perhaps even the \nequivalent of a bench trial, the Court is simultaneously faced with the obligation to avoid \nimpermissible entanglement in the underlying merits of a potentially arbitrable dispute. \nSee, e.g., AT&T Techs., 475 U.S. at 649 (\"[I]n deciding whether the parties have agreed to \nsubmit a particular grievance to arbitration, a court is not to rule on the potential merits of \nthe underlying claims.\"), G.S. 1-569.7(d) (A court should not refuse to compel arbitration \n\"because the claim lacks merit or because grounds for the claim have not been \nestablished\"). This dispute poses a unique tension because deciding “summarily\" the \nquestion of arbitrability necessarily involves consideration of issues very similar to those \ninvolved in the merits of Gilead's instrumentality claim against Plaintiffs in the underlying \narbitration. \n \n \n8. In order to resolve this tension, Gilead urges the Court to follow the Fourth \nCircuit's jurisprudence in J.J. Ryan & Sons, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc Textile, S.A., 863 F.2d \n315 (4th Cir. 1988), Long v. Silver, 248 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2001), and Smith v. Cato, 2006 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 31935 (W.D.N.C. May 9, 2006). The Cato court interpreted J.J. Ryan, \nLong, and other Fourth Circuit precedent as having  \ncarved an exception to the rule that a party should not be compelled to \narbitrate claims which he has not agreed to arbitrate, where (1) the allegations \nagainst a non-signatory and a signatory are based on the same facts, and are \ninherently inseparable or closely in tertwined; and (2) the non-signatory \nexercises substantial control over the signatory's activities.  \n \nCato, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31935 at *20. \n9. Gilead takes the position that the Court should disregard the requirements of \nG.S. 1-569.7 and apply a federal standard18 using the formulation created by the court in \nCato.   Defendants take the position that the Cato standard is \"more demanding than a \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), but less demanding than a motion for summary \njudgment because it requires more than a mere allegation that [Plaintiffs] are subject to the \narbitration agreement, but stops short of requiring Gilead to demonstrate that it is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.\"19  While it is clear that this Court is not to apply a \nsummary judgment standard to its decision, G.S. 1-569.7 does require the Court to make \nfindings of fact and reach a determination as to whether an enforceable agreement to \narbitrate exists.  This a task wholly different than deciding a motion to dismiss or a motion \nfor summary judgment, and not inconsistent with the approach taken by the federal court \n                                                 \n18 It is not entirely clear how application of a federal standard would benefit Gilead here since the \nfederal analogue to G.S. 1-569.7 requires a \"trial\" on the issue of arbitrability and even provides for a \njury trial where that right is asserted. See 9 U.S.C. § 4 (\"If the making of the arbitration agreement \nor the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily \nto the trial thereof.\").  Accordingly, this Court inevitably must make findings of fact that necessarily \nwill touch on the veil-piercing theory raised by Gilead in the underlying arbitration. \n19 Gilead Mem. Opp'n Pls.' Declaratory Action Stay Arbitration (May 19, 2014) (\"Gilead Brief\") at 13-\n14 (emphasis added). \n \n \nin Cato.  Accordingly, the Court does not interpret the Cato standard as being inconsistent \nwith application of the G.S. 1-569.7 requirements. \n10. The Court CONCLUDES that it should summarily decide the question of \nwhether an enforceable agreement to arbitrate exists between Plaintiffs and Gilead under \nG.S. 1-569.7.20  The Court’s inquiry, undertaken for the limited purpose of determining \nwhether the facts establish that Plaintiffs were parties to an enforceable agreement to \narbitrate, will not constitute a final judgment on the merits of Gilead’s veil-\npiercing/instrumentality claim raised in the arbitration. This decision will not have \ncollateral estoppel or res judicata consequences,21 and as such does not contravene the \nrelevant public policy underlying the court's obligation to refrain from ruling on the merits \nof a dispute.22 \n11. Having determined that a full G.S. 1-569.7 inquiry is the proper form of \nanalysis in this case, the Court, solely for the purpose of determining the Motion, makes the \nfollowing FINDINGS OF FACT and CONCLUSIONS OF LAW. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n12. Plaintiff Bruce J. Boehm (\"Boehm\") was an individual investor and director of \nNC Kryo.23 Boehm invested over $190,000 in NC Kryo.  At all relevant times, Boehm was a \n                                                 \n20 However, even if the Court were inclined to follow the reasoning of Cato, as discussed below, the \nCourt finds that an analysis under Cato yield the same result. \n21 See Thomas M. McInnis & Associates, Inc. v. Hall, 318 N.C. 421, 428 (1986) (res judicata requires \n\"a final judgment on the merits in a prior action\"), Bee Tree Missionary Baptist Church v. McNeil, \n153 N.C. App. 797, 799 (collateral estoppel requires the same).  \n22 Cf. MAG Portfolio, 268 F.3d 58 (Second Circuit vacated district court's order compelling arbitration \nand remanded matter to district court \"for an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether the \ncorporate veil . . . should be pierced in order to compel arbitration\" because the instrumentality rule \ndemands a \"very fact specific inquiry involving a multitude of factors\" and the record lacked \n\"sufficient fact finding to support affirmation based on a veil-piercing theory\").\n \n23 Am. Compl. ¶¶ 31, 38. \n \n \nmember of the Board of Directors of NC Kryo but did not hold any position as an officer of \nthat company. \n13. Plaintiff James M. Strathmeyer (\"Strathmeyer\") was an individual director of \nNC Kryo. Strathmeyer was not an individual investor in NC Kryo.24 \n14. Plaintiff Cold Springs Ventures, LLC (\"Cold Springs\"), is a North Carolina \nlimited liability company whose sole member is Strathmeyer. Cold Springs was an investor \nin NC Kryo.25 Cold Springs invested over $180,000 in NC Kryo. \n15. NC Kryo was formed to store and manage various biomaterials, including \nclinical trial samples. NC Kryo and Gilead entered into a Master Services Agreement \n(\"Gilead Contract\"), effective September 1, 2010, whereby NC Kryo agreed to store and \nmanage material belonging to Gilead. The Gilead Contract contained a non-assignment \nprovision, limiting the ability to transfer the agreement without the consent of the other \nparty, and an arbitration clause, which required submission of any dispute arising under \nthe Gilead Contract to arbitration with the AAA. The Gilead Contract was executed on \nbehalf of NC Kryo by L. Eric Hallman (\"Hallman\"), NC Kryo's Chief Executive Officer. 26 \nThere is no evidence in the record that Plaintiffs participated in the negotiation, or even \nwere aware of the existence, of the Gilead Contract. \n16. At various times in the operation of NC Kryo, the company operated with \nvacancies on its Board of Directors and in officer positions.27 At no time in NC Kryo's \ncorporate history did it ever fill all five seats on the Board of Directors.28 \n                                                 \n24 Am.

In their role as directors, Boehm and Strathmeyer participated actively in \nsoliciting funding for NC Kryo and were routinely apprised of the financial condition of that \ncompany by its officers.29 As to the financial condition of the company, Boehm \nacknowledged that NC Kryo \"was always insolvent\" and was \"never a going concern.\"30 \n18. While serving as directors, Boehm and Strathmeyer terminated officers,31 \napproved reimbursements to other directors,32 and actively participated in arranging either \na liquidation or acquisition of NC Kryo.33 During its operation, minutes of meetings of \ndirectors of NC Kryo were routinely kept.34 However, no minutes have been produced from \nany meeting wherein the termination of Eric Hallman as Chief Executive Officer was \ndiscussed or authorized by the Board of Directors. \n19. Subsequent to the execution of the Gilead Contract, and due to the financial \ncondition of the company, NC Kryo's Board of Directors elected to wind down or sell NC \nKryo. Boehm, Strathmeyer, and Hallman35 voted in favor of winding down NC Kryo, while \nDouglas Baker (\"Baker\") abstained.36 \n20. In late 2010, NC Kryo entered into negotiations with John Norton (\"Norton\") \nto purchase NC Kryo's assets and liabilities (\"Kryo Transaction\"). These negotiations \nculminated in the drafting of an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby NC Kryo's assets \nwould be sold for a cash sum in addition to the assumption of NC Kryo's liabilities. When \nthe Kryo Transaction was approved, by both the Board of Directors and the shareholders of \n                                                 \n29 Ex.

M to Gilead Brief. \n \n \nNC Kryo, Boehm and Strathmeyer were the sole directors of NC Kryo. To facilitate \napproval of the Kryo Transaction, Boehm and Strathmeyer, as sole directors, appointed a \nnumber of individuals to fill vacancies in officer positions.37 Following the execution of the \nKryo Transaction, NC Kryo was dissolved.38 It is undisputed that Boehm and Cold Springs \nlost their entire investments in NC Kryo. \n21. In 2013, Gilead performed an audit GA Kryo’s performance under the Gilead \nContract.  The audit revealed that GA Kyro, and previously NC Kryo, had failed to \nadequately perform their obligations  and had breached the Gilead Contract.39 On the basis \nof the results of the 2013 audit, Gilead initiated the Arbitration.40 \n \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW \n22. In North Carolina, \"[t]he general rule is that in the ordinary course of business, \na corporation is treated as distinct from its shareholders.\" State ex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway \nBrands Mfg., LLC, 362 N.C. 431, 438 (2008). However, in proper circumstances a court can \nlook behind the corporate form and disregar d the corporation's separate and independent \nexistence. Id. at 438-39. Our appellate courts have re peatedly cautioned that disregarding \nthe corporate form, or piercing the corporate ve il, is a remedy that \"should be invoked only \nin an extreme case where necessary to serve the ends of justice.\" Dorton v. Dorton, 77 N.C. \nApp. 667, 672 (1985). \n23. \"Piercing the corporate veil . . . allows a plaintiff to impose legal liability for a \ncorporation's obligations, or for torts committed by the corporation, upon some other company \nor individual that controls and dominates a corporation.\" Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, \n                                                 \n37 See Ex. J to Gilead Brief. \n38 See Boehm Depo. 27:22-23. \n39 Ex. V to Gilead Brief. \n40 See Ex. B to Am. Compl. \n \n \n145 (2013). The purpose of piercing the corporate veil is to prevent the use of the corporate \nform for some fraudulent purpose, or to accomplish an unconscionable result. See Ridgeway \nBrands Mfg., LLC, 362 N.C. at 438. \n24. In order to pierce the corporate veil a party must show \"that the corporation is \nso operated that it is a mere instrumentality or alter ego of the sole or dominant shareholder \nand a shield for his activities in violation of the declared public policy or statute of the State.\" \nGreen, 367 N.C. at 145. This \"instrumentality rule\" inquiry involves three elements:  \n(1) Control, not mere majority or co mplete stock control, but complete \ndomination, not only of finances, but of policy and business practice in respect \nto the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this transaction \nhad at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own; and \n \n(2) Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or \nwrong, to perpetrate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or \na dishonest and unjust act in contraventio n of [a] plaintiff's legal rights; and \n \n(3) The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury \nor unjust loss complained of. \n \nId. at 145-46 (internal citations omitted). \n25. Factors relevant to the Court's in strumentality rule analysis include \n\"inadequate capitalization, noncompliance with corporate formalities, lack of a separate \ncorporate identity, excessive fragmentation, siphoning of funds by the dominant shareholder, \nnonfunctioning officers and directors, and absence of corporate records.\" Id. (internal \ncitations omitted). \nElement 1: Complete Domination and Control \n26. Turning to the case at bar, Gilead cont ends that Plaintiffs so controlled and \ndominated NC Kryo that the Court should disregard the corporate form and compel Plaintiffs \nto arbitrate. More specifically, Gilead focuses on four key factors in support of its contention \nthat the Court should pierce the corporate veil in this case. First, Gilead contends that \nPlaintiffs had domination and control over NC Kryo's affairs. Second, NC Kryo failed to follow \n \n \ncorporate formalities and had non-functioning o fficers and directors, or vacancies in those \npositions. Third, Gilead contends that NC Kr yo's financial condition supports veil piercing. \nFinally, Gilead argues that the use of NC Kryo  funds to repay personal expenses justifies \ndisregarding the corporate form. The Court will address each of these contentions in turn. \nDomination and Control over NC Kryo \n27.  Gilead's first contention in support of  their position that the Court should \npierce NC Kryo's corporate veil and compel Plai ntiffs to arbitrate is that Plaintiffs had \nsufficient domination and control over NC Kryo  to support disregarding that entity's \ncorporate form. \n28. The complete domination and control of a corporation is a critical, if not the \nmost critical, element in a court's veil piercing analysis. See generally Green , 367 N.C. at \n145-46. Control, for the purpose of a veil piercing analysis, means \"complete domination, not \nonly of finances, but of policy and business practi ce . . . so that the corporate entity . . . had \nat the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own . . . .\" Green, 367 N.C. at 145 \n(internal citations omitted). Ownership of a corporation, and even participation in the \nmanagement of the corporation, is not sufficien t control to satisfy the instrumentality rule. \nSee Waff Bros., Inc. v. Bank of North Carolina, N.A. , 289 N.C. 198, 210 (1976) (recognizing \nthat ownership of all outstanding stock of two corporations by a single person who served as \nchief executive officer of both corporations did not destroy their corporate identities).  \n29. To begin, as Plaintiffs note, Gilead does  not at all contend that Plaintiff Cold \nSprings was directly engaged in the control of  NC Kryo, though one corporation can be \nsufficiently dominated and controlled by another. See B-W Acceptance Corp. v. Spencer, 268 \nN.C. 1, 8 (1966). Gilead instead appears to ar gue that Plaintiff Cold Springs should be \nrequired to arbitrate based on the control over  NC Kryo exerted by Cold Springs' sole \n \n \nmember, Strathmeyer.41 In doing so, Gilead asks this Court to disregard not only NC Kryo's \ncorporate form, but also that of Cold Springs in order to hold that company liable for the \nactions of its member. While North Carolina la w recognizes this type of \"reverse veil \npiercing,\" see Strategic Outsourcing, Inc. v. Stacks, 176 N.C. App. 247, 254 (2006), Gilead has \nnot provided any evidence that would support doing so in this case. Absent evidence that Cold \nSprings exercised control over NC Kryo, Gi lead has not satisfied its burden under the \ninstrumentality rule and the Arbitration, as it pertains to Plaintiff Cold Springs, LLC, should \nbe STAYED. \n30. Turning to Boehm and Strathmeyer, Gilead argues that the following facts \nsupport finding that those individuals exercised \"complete domination\" and control over NC \nKryo: (i) Boehm was instrumental in the creat ion of NC Kryo and became the first non-\nfounding member of the Board; (ii) Strathme yer suggested a plan for acquiring bridge \nfinancing in April 2010, at the same time it wa s decided that the company would need to be \nsold or wound down, that resulted in his electi on as a director; (iii) Strathmeyer terminated \nEric Hallman from his position as CEO; (iv) Boehm and Strathmeyer voted in favor of the \ndecision to wind down NC Kryo or sell its asse ts; (v) Boehm negotiated the terms of the sale \nto GA Kryo; (vi) Boehm and Strathmeyer orch estrated and approved the execution of the \nKryo Transaction; (vii) Strathmeyer participated in  the installation of officers prior to the \nclosing of the Kryo Transaction; and (viii) the structure of the Board and the lack of any \noutside director enabled Boehm and Strathmeyer to exert control over the company.42 \n                                                 \n41 In its Reply Brief, Gilead also argues that Cold Springs' \"financial influence\" justifies a finding \nthat Cold Springs exercised control over NC Kryo. Reply Br. (May 30, 2014) p. 7. In support of this \nposition, however, Gilead directs the Court to actions that were undertaken by Strathmeyer. Id. at 7-\n8. While Strathmeyer's involvement in NC Kryo was due to the investment of Cold Springs, Gilead \nhas not shown that Cold Springs was anything but a passive investor after Strathmeyer's election to \nthe Board.  \n42 See Gilead Brief pp. 17-19. Many of these facts appear to the Court to be undisputed. See Gilead \nReply Brief p. 2. \n \n \n31. These facts, however, do not demonstra te that Boehm and Strathmeyer had \nsuch complete and total control of NC Kryo as to render that company devoid of any \"separate \nmind, will, or existence of its own.\" Green, 367 N.C. at 145. As directors, Boehm and \nStrathmeyer were charged with overseeing and directing the operation of NC Kryo. \nStatutorily, directors of North Carolina business corporations are charged with exercising, or \ndirecting the exercise of, all corporate powers. G.S. § 55-8-01(b). Gilead's argument regarding \nthe control exercised by Boehm and Strathmeyer is based almost entirely on actions taken \nby those individuals pursuant to their statutor y authority as directors. For example, Gilead \ncontends that Boehm and Strathmeyer made the decision to wind down, or dissolve, NC Kryo \nand that this decision should support piercing the corporate veil. Pursuant to G.S. § 55-14-\n02, however, a corporation's board of directors may propose dissolution for submission to the \ncompany's shareholders. Therefore, the fact that Boehm and Strathmeyer, acting as directors \nof NC Kryo while participating in a meeting of the Board of Directors for which minutes were \nrecorded,\n43 each voted in favor of recommending dissolution does not support Gilead's \ncontention that the corporate veil should be pierced.  \n32. Undoubtedly, Boehm and Strathmeyer exercised control over NC Kryo. Indeed, \nit is undisputed that, at least for a period of time, Boehm and Strathmeyer were the only two \ndirectors of that company. However, Gilead has not shown that such control rose to the level \nof \"complete domination\" as re quired to pierce NC Kryo's co rporate veil and compel those \nindividuals to arbitration. Gilead has not shown that Boehm and Strathmeyer exceeded their \nrole as directors by directing the day-to-day operations of NC. \n33. In sum, while Boehm and Strathmeyer certainly exercised control over NC \nKryo, the record before the Court indicates that the control exercised by those directors does \n                                                 \n43 See Ex. M to Gilead Brief. \n \n \nnot rise to the \"complete domination\" of corporate policy, finances, and practices necessary to \nsupport disregarding the corporate form in this action.  \nFailure to Follow Corporate Formalities \n34.  Gilead next contends that the failure of NC Kryo, and its directors Boehm and \nStrathmeyer, to follow corporate formalities, es pecially in NC Kryo's final days, justifies \npiercing the corporate veil and compelling Plaintiffs to arbitration.  \n35. North Carolina courts are more likely to pierce the corporate veil when the \nprincipals of a corporation make \"no effort to k eep, or pretense of keeping, [their] interest[s] \nand activities separate and apart from those of the corporation.\" Henderson v. Security \nMortg. & Finance Co. , 273 N.C. 253, 260 (1968). Examples of failures to follow corporate \nformalities weighing in support of piercing th e corporate veil include the failure to hold an \norganizational meeting or issue shares, Keels v. Turner, 45 N.C. App. 213, cert. denied, 300 \nN.C. 197 (1980), commingling of personal and corporate funds and a failure to formally keep \ncorporate records, including corporate minutes, Monteau v. Reis Trucking & Constr., Inc. , \n147 N.C. App. 121 (2001), and the transfer of fund s to other entities or individuals without \nformal debt instruments or any other formal records, Atlantic Tobacco Co. v. Honeycutt, 101 \nN.C. App. 160, 166 (1990). However, noncompli ance with corporate formalities, standing \nalone, is insufficient to justify disregarding the corporate form. Hoots v. Toms & Bazzle, P.A., \n100 N.C. App. 412, 419 (1990). \n36. Here, Gilead contends that NC Kryo  failed to keep minutes on several \noccasions, including an April 2010 Board meeting wherein the plan to wind down the \ncompany was discussed,\n44 and when the Board approved, if it ever did, the termination of \nEric Hallman as Chief Executive Officer. Addi tionally, Gilead argues that NC Kryo, and \n                                                 \n44 Though minutes were kept for the meeting wherein the decision to wind down NC Kryo was \nactually put to a vote. See Ex. M to Gilead Brief. \n \n \nspecifically Boehm and Strathmeyer, failed to fill officer and director positions as they came \nopen, and that, when positions were filled, corp orate titles were not taken seriously. Only \nwhen it came to closing the Kryo Transaction, Gilead contends, did the Board appoint a full \ncomplement of corporate officers. Finally, Gile ad contends that the approval of the Kryo \nTransaction by the shareholders of NC Kryo wa s \"tainted\" by the failure to follow corporate \nformalities in that the shareholders were not provided with all material information \nregarding the transaction. In support of this final  contention, Gilead adds that \"there is no \nindication that those shareholders who aske d for a complete copy [of the asset purchase \nagreement] were provided it.\"  \n37. On the evidence presented by the parties , the Court cannot conclude that, on \nthe whole, NC Kryo, by and through Boehm and Strathmeyer, failed to adequately maintain \ncorporate formalities. It does appear that at  least one Board meeting, possibly more, lacked \nadequate record keeping, and that NC Kryo op erated with vacancies on its Board and in \ncorporate offices. While the Court acknowledges the record reveals that, at times, it appears \nthat record keeping was not the highest priori ty for NC Kryo, the evidence presented by \nGilead does not rise to the level that North Carolina appellate courts have required to support \ninvocation of the instrumentality rule. Missing from Gilead's argument is any evidence that \nBoehm and/or Strathmeyer commingled personal funds with NC Kryo funds, transferred NC \nKryo funds between company accounts and personal accounts without formal records, failed \nto properly adopt by-laws, or failed to issue shares. \n38. The inadequacies in record keeping identified by Gilead are not as systemic as \nin cases where failure to maintain corporate formalities has been a factor favoring veil \npiercing. As such, this factor, the failure to maintain corporate formalities, does not weigh in \nfavor of piercing the corporate veil of NC Kryo.  \nNC Kryo's Financial Condition \n \n \n39. Gilead next claims that because NC Kryo was \"always insolvent,\" the Court \nshould pierce the corporate veil and compel  the Plaintiffs to arbitration. In the \ninstrumentality rule analysis, however, courts distinguish between inadequate capitalization \nborne out of deception or fraud, see Fischer Inv. Capital, Inc. v. Catawba Dev. Corp., 200 N.C. \nApp. 644, 653 (2009) (where corporation's prin cipal allegedly transferred assets \"for the \npurpose of avoiding payment\" of a debt), and inadequate capitalization \"arising simply out of \na lack of funds available for contribution to the enterprise.\" Russell M. Robinson II, Robinson \non North Carolina Corporation Law § 2.10[2] (hereinafter \"Robinson\").  \n40. Here, the record before the Court indicates that, while NC Kryo did suffer from \n\"inadequate capitalization\" in the most literal sense, NC Kryo's financial condition was not \nthe product of fraud or deception, but was due instead to NC Kryo's circumstance as a start-\nup company struggling to raise capital. The re cord indicates that NC Kryo made multiple \nattempts to secure operating capital, includ ing those that resulted in the Plaintiffs' \ninvestment in the company. Gilead does not di rect the Court to any evidence in the record \nthat indicates NC Kryo's financial condition was a result of fraud or other improper conduct \non the part of Plaintiffs, such as using corpor ate funds for their personal benefit. Instead, \nGilead contends that NC Kryo's \"congenital insolvency\" supports its veil piercing claim. \nHowever, the mere fact that NC Kryo's capitalization efforts did not ultimately yield enough \ncapital for the company to survive should not,  without more, support the drastic remedy of \ndisregarding the corporate form. \nUse of Corporate Funds for Personal Reimbursement  \n41. Gilead's final factor in support of piercing NC Kryo's corporate veil is that NC \nKryo directors, specifically Plaintiffs Boeh m and Strathmeyer, approved a $5,000 payment \nto Eric Hallman for \"personal expenses.\"  \n \n \n42. One of the factors cited in Green in support of disregarding the corporate form \nis the siphoning of corporate funds by the dominant shareholder. In that case, corporate funds \nwere used \"to pay personal expenses, su ch as home mortgage and utility bills.\" Green, 367 \nN.C. at 145. Similarly, in Fischer Investment Capital, Inc. , the Court of Appeals held that \nthe plaintiff stated a claim for piercing the corporate veil where plaintiff alleged, among other \nthings, that the principal of the defendant, Mark Lewis, siphoned corporate funds for his own \nbenefit. \nFischer Inv. Capital, Inc., 200 N.C. App. at 652. \n43. At the outset, the Court recognizes the situation at bar differs slightly from \nthose, such as Green, in which using corporate funds for personal purposes has been a key \nfactor supporting the application of the instru mentality rule. Here, Gilead does not contend \nthat Boehm and Strathmeyer used their positions as directors to transfer corporate funds to \nthemselves for their personal benefit, but, rather, to benefit another director, Eric Hallman.45 \nNevertheless, Gilead maintains that the approval of the payment to Eric Hallman can \nsupport its veil piercing argument. \n44. It is undisputed that Boehm and Strathmeyer, in their role as directors of NC \nKryo, voted to approve the $5,000 payment to Eric Hallman. However, the evidence presented \nby Gilead does not necessarily support the cl aim that these expenses were \"personal,\" as \nthose in Green, and not genuine business expenses. The minutes from the February 8, 2011, \nBoard meeting in which the reimbursement was approved reflect that these expenses were \nconsidered \"reimbursable.\"46 Moreover, in opposition to Plaintiff's Declaratory Action, Gilead \nsubmitted an e-mail exchange involving Michael J. Schierbeek, then Chief Financial Officer \nof NC Kryo, that reflects that the expenses submitted by Eric Hallman were the subject of at \n                                                 \n45 See Gilead Brief p. 22. \n46 Exhibit FF to Gilead Brief. \n \n \nleast some discussion among the directors and officers regarding whether they were \nreimbursable.47 \n45. Simply stated, it is unclear based on the record before the Court that the \npayment to Eric Hallman for expenses incurred was truly a \"siphoning of corporate funds\" as \noccurred in Green, or as was alleged in Fischer Investment Capital . As such, the \nreimbursement of funds does not necessarily support the drastic remedy of disregarding NC \nKryo's corporate form. \n46. In sum, the record before the Court clearly indicates that Boehm and \nStrathmeyer controlled NC Kryo. However, the control exerted by those individuals does not \nrise to the level of \"complete domination\" required to support piercing the corporate veil. \nElements 2 and 3: Control Used to Perpetrate a Wrong, Proximately Causing  \nGilead's Injuries \n \n47. The exercise of domination and control over the corporation is a \"threshold\" \nrequirement for piercing the corporate veil. See Atlantic Tobacco Co. v. Honeycutt, 101 N.C. \nApp. at 165. Here, having found that the eviden ce before the Court fails to establish that \nPlaintiffs dominated and controlled NC Kryo, \"i t is not possible to proceed to the further \nissues of whether that control was used to perpetrate a wrong, or whether the control \nproximately caused [Gilead's] injuries.\" Id.48 \nCato Analysis \n48. Having already found that a full G.S. 1-569.7 inquiry is the proper method of \nanalysis in this matter, the Court will nevertheless address Gilead's contention that \napplication of the Fourth Circuit standard, as stated in Smith v. Cato, supra, would lead to \ndifferent result.  In Cato, the plaintiff entered into a “complex business and multifaceted \n                                                 \n47 Exhibit CC to Gilead Brief. \n48 The Court also notes that Gilead did not present any evidence that Boehm or Strathmeyer took \nany action with the express intent of defrauding Gilead or any other customer or creditor. \n \n \ncontractual relationship”, including an employment agreement, with Cato Enterprises, \nLLC, and Cato Management, LLC (\"Cato Entities\"). 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31935, **2-3. \nThe employment agreement contained an arbitration clause. Wayland H. Cato, Jr. \n(\"Defendant\") was the manager of both of the Cato Entities. \nId. at *2.  Defendant \n“personally negotiated” the integrated business agreement with plaintiff, and signed the \nemployment agreement in his capacity as manager of the Cato Entities, but not in his \nindividual capacity. Id. at **3-4. The Cato Enterprises subsequently terminated the \nplaintiff, and Cato Entities, the plaintiff and Defendant brought claims against one another \nin court and under the arbitration clause in the employment agreement.  The plaintiff \nsought to compel Defendant to arbitrate claims brought in the federal court lawsuit under \nthe arbitration agreement in the employment agreement. Id. at **6-8. Defendant opposed \narbitration on the grounds that he had not signed the employment agreement in his \nindividual capacity, but only as the manager for the Cato Entities and, accordingly wasn’t a \nparty to the arbitration agreement. Id. at *9. \n49. In Cato, the court recognized that “in an appropriate case” a “non-signatory \ncan enforce, or be bound by, an arbitration provision within a contract executed by other \nparties.”  2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31935, **22-23. The court also held that the Fourth Circuit \nhad created an exception to the general rule that a party could not be compelled to arbitrate \nclaims he has not agreed to arbitrate when \"(1) the allegations against a non-signatory and \na signatory are based on the same facts, and are inherently inseparable or closely \nintertwined; and (2) the non-signatory exercises substantial control over the signatory's \nactivities.\" \nId. at *20.  Applying these factors, the court concluded that the claims being \nraised by and against the non-signatory, Defendant, and the signatories, Plaintiff and the \nCato Entities, were “inherently inseparable and closely intertwined.” Id. at *22. The Court \nfurther held Defendant exercised control over of the Cato Entities as manager, Defendant \n \n \n\"signed the Employment Agreement, which contained an arbitration provision, in his \ncapacity as manager,” and also “personally negotiated each component part of the parties \nintegrated business relationship.” Id. at **21-22.  Accordingly, the court held that \nDefendant should be required to arbitrate.   \n50. This Court finds on that on the record before it that Gilead has not satisfied \nthe two-prong Cato standard.  First, in this case, the allegations against Plaintiffs are not \nbased on the same facts, or inherently inseparable or closely intertwined, with the \nallegations in the underlying arbitration against the signatory to the Gilead Contract, GA \nKryo/NC Kryo (hereinafter collectively “Kryo”).  In the arbitration, Gilead makes claims \narising from the alleged breach of the Gilead contract by Kyro. Gilead alleges, among other \nthings, that Kyro breached the Gilead Contract by improperly storing and recording \nGilead’s samples, and improperly failed to maintain adequate insurance coverage.  Gilead’s \nallegations against Plaintiffs, on the other hand, are aimed at providing a basis for holding \nsomeone liable for damages should they prevail on the breach of contract allegations.  As \ndiscussed at length herein, the allegations against Plaintiff in the arbitration are that they \noperated NC Kyro as a sham, dominated and controlled its business practices, policies and \nfinances, and used such domination and control to perpetrate a fraud on Gilead.  Gilead has \nmade no allegations that Plaintiffs were personally involved in any manner in performing \nNC Kryo’s obligations under the Gilead Contract.  Whatever overlap there may be between \nthe issues of whether Kryo breached the Gilead Contract and the veil-piercing or \ninstrumentality allegations against Plaintiffs, they certainly are not “inherently \ninseparable”.  \n51. Even if Gilead were able to satisfy the first prong of the \nCato standard, it has \nnot shown that the Plaintiffs, as non-signatories, exercised substantial control over the \nsignatory's activities. Here, as discussed above, Gilead's argument that Plaintiffs controlled \n \n \nNC Kryo rests almost entirely on Boehm and Strathmeyer's roles as directors.49 Gilead \npresented no evidence that Plaintiffs exercised control over the day-to-day operations of NC \nKryo as officers or managers.  In addition, in Cato, that Defendant was intimately involved \nin negotiating the agreements underlying the claims between the parties, and even signed \nthe agreement on behalf of the Cato Entities.  Those types of facts simply are not present in \nthis case where there is no evidence connecting Boehm or Strathmeyer to the Gilead \nContract.  \n52. Accordingly, even under the \nCato analysis, Gilead has not shown that \nPlaintiffs should be compelled to arbitrate with Gilead. \nNOW THEREFORE, based on the foregoing FINDINGS and CONCLUSIONS, IT IS \nORDERED that: \n1. To the extent that Plaintiffs' Declaratory Action Staying Arbitration requests \nthis Court to find that Plaintiffs are not bound by the arbitration provision in the Gilead \nContract, that claim is GRANTED. \n2. As to Plaintiff Cold Springs Ventures, LLC, Plaintiff Bruce J. Boehm, and \nPlaintiff James M. Strathmeyer, the Arbitration is permanently STAYED, and Defendants \nare permanently ENJOINED from attempting to arbitrate their claim for breach of the \nGilead Contract against Plaintiffs. \n3. Nothing in this Order shall be construed as a ruling on the merits of \nDefendant Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s instrumentality rule theory, nor shall this Order have any \npreclusive effect on any subsequent attempt to hold Plaintiffs liable to Gilead under the \ninstrumentality rule. \n                                                 \n49 As also noted above, Gilead presents no evidence that Cold Springs exercised any control over NC \nKryo. \n \n \n4. Except as expressly granted herein, Plaintiffs' Declaratory Action to Stay \nArbitration is DENIED. \nThis the 6th day of January, 2015. \n "
