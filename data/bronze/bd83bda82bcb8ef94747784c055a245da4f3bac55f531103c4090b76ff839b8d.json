This is an action for judicial review of the Final Decision on July 20, \n2018 in the matters of Tri-State Scrap Metal, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, OAH File \nNo. 17 REV 5627, Biltmore Iron & Metal Company, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, \nOAH File No. 17 REV 5628, and TT&E Iron and Metal, Inc. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, \nOAH File No. 17 REV 5629.  The matter before the Court involves a dispute between \nPetitioner and Respondents regarding whether Respondents, who are secondary \nmetal recyclers, are entitled to the lower one percent (1%) rate of privilege tax (the \n“Privilege Tax”) on their purchases of certain machinery, parts, and accessories used \nin their operations at their respective facilities.  Respondents purchase and collect \nscrap metal, consisting of both ferrous and non -ferrous metals, and use a variety of \nprocesses to transform the scrap metal into products that can be sold to its customers \nfor use in their own manufacturing facilities.   \n3. In order for Respondents to convert the raw materials into products that \nits customers will purchase, Respondents use several pieces of equipment  and \naccessories, which Respondents classified for tax purposes as mill machinery, parts, \nor accessories pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 105 -187.51, thereby paying a Privile ge Tax at \na rate less than otherwise payable by North Carolina companies for their purchases \nof similar tangible personal property .  Petitioner audited each Respondent’s records \nfor its equipment purchases over various time periods (the “Audit Periods”) and \ndecided, with one exception, that Respondents  were not engaged in manufacturing \nand that, as a result, most of their purchases were not subject to the Privilege Tax.  \nAccordingly, Petitioner issued to each Respondent a Notice of Final Determination , \nwhich found each Respondent liable for additional State and applicable local rates of \nsales and use tax on its purchases. \n4. On August 22, 2017, Respondents filed Petitions for Contested Case \nHearings with the OAH seeking review of their respective Notices of Final \nDetermination issued by Petitioner.  After consolidating Respondents’ cases, and the \nparties’ filing of cross motions for summary judgment, the OAH issued the Final \nDecision denying Petitioner’s motion a nd granting summary judgment in favor of \nRespondents.  Petitioner now petitions this Court to reverse the Final Decision  \nbelieving the OAH’s Final Decision to be erroneous. \n5. The issues to be decided in this action are (a) whether Respondents ’ \noperations at their respective facilities are manufacturing, and if so, (b) whether the \nALJ erred in failing to engage in a purchase-by-purchase analysis when determining \nthat Respondents’ purchases are  mill machinery , parts, or accessories within the \nmeaning of N.C.G.S. § 105-187.51.    \nII. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n6. The parties stipulated on the record that there is no dispute of material \nfact, (Bus. Ct. R. 953), and accordingly, the Court takes the facts as they are presented \nin the Official Record.  Respondents are three secondary metal recyclers operating in \nNorth Carolina.  (Bus. Ct. R. 337, 347, 357 .)  Tri -State, operating under the trade \nname Mountain Metal Recycling, is an S -corporation that operates a facility in \nAsheville, North Carolina.  (Bus. Ct. R. 631, 63 6.)  Biltmore is a C -corporation that \nalso operates a facility in Asheville , North Carolina.  (Bus. Ct. R. 624 –25.)  Finally, \nTT&E is a C-corporation that operates a facility in Garner, North Carolina.  (Bus. Ct. \nR. 707.)  Petitioner North Carolina Department of Revenue is the governmental \nentity responsible for assessing and collecting sales and use taxes.   See N.C.G.S. § \n105-164.2.  Petitioner examined Respondents’ records, leading ultimately to the \nissues before this Court.    \n7. As secondary metal recyclers, Respondents purchase ferrous scrap \nmetal, nonferrous scrap metal, and electronic scrap (collectively referred to as “Scrap \nMetal”) from various sources.  (Bus. Ct. R. 283–84.)  Scrap Metal includes everything \nfrom structural steel  to aluminum cans  to IT and telecom equipment.  (Bus. Ct. R. \n283–84.)  The Scrap Metal  is then transported to Respondents’ respective facilities \nwhere, after Resp ondents take inventory of the materials, the Scrap Metal  will \nundergo one or more operations, including: \nStripping – the use of specialized machinery to strip coating and \ninsulation from copper wire; \n \nBaling – the use of large equipment to crush and compact material into \nhighly condensed bales in specific sizes. \n \nTorching – the use of acetylene or oxygen torches to cut metallic \nmaterials to various specifications. \n \nShearing – the use of large stationary guillotine shears and shears \nmounted on mobile equipment, such as a crane or excavator, to cut and \nseparate raw materials, typically larger items. \n \n(Resp. Br. 4, ECF No. 21; Bus. Ct. R. 284–90, 296–302, 308–14.)  \n8. Respondents all use essentially the same aforementioned processes to \nconvert the Scrap Metal into  final products capable of being sold to their customers \nwith one exception: TT&E uses an operation called shredding, which requires the use \nof a granulator (the “Granulator Shredding Operation”).  The Granulator Shredding \nOperation use s large stationary e quipment (including a granulator) to shred \nmaterials into smaller sizes and separate them into different grades of metal.  (Bus. \nCt. R. 357–58.) \n9. Through these operations, Respondents produce finished products (such \nas bare brite copper, baled aluminum used  beverage cans, baled wire, or #1/2 Steel \nBundles, #1 Heavy Melt Steel, Prepared Plate  and Structural Steel) that are then \nsold to manufacturers, who in turn melt or refine the products for use in their own \nmanufacturing.  (Bus. Ct. R. 284–90, 296–302, 308–14.)  The products are made by \nRespondents to meet specifications provided by either the customer  or industry \nstandards set by  the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries Scrap Specifications \nCircular (“ISRI Specifications”).  (Bus. Ct. R. 342–43.) \n10. During the Audit Periods, Petitioner conducted examinations of each \nRespondent’s records for purchases of equipment and accessories used in one or more \nof the above operations.  As to Tri-State, during Petitioner’s Audit Period from April \n1, 2007 to March 31, 2013, Tri -State purchased , among other goods,  a material \nhandler, generator, baler, can flattener, stripper, shear logger, magnets, shears, \nloaders, and roll off containers, as well as other equipment, parts, s upplies, \nequipment fluids, and fuel.  (Bus. Ct. R. 632–33.)  Petitioner reviewed these purchases \nand on October 23, 2013 issued a proposed Notice of Sales and Use Tax Assessment \nassessing Tri-State for tax on the purchase of these items at the general Stat e and \napplicable local rates of tax.  (Bus. Ct. R. 631, 650.)  Petitioner determined that none \nof the operations conducted by Tri -State were manufacturing and thus none of Tri -\nState’s purchases during the Audit Period were eligible for the lower Privilege Tax.  \n(Bus. Ct. R. 631, 636.)  Tri-State objected to the proposed tax assessment and timely \nrequested a Departmental review.  (Bus. Ct. R. 631.)   On June 29, 2017, after an \nattempt to resolve Tri -State’s objections, Petitioner issued its Notice of Final \nDetermination upholding its proposed tax assessment  and assessing Tri -State for \nadditional tax of $99,111.23, interest of $35,613 .37, and penalties of $59,466.75 .  \n(Bus. Ct. R. 651.)     \n11. As to Biltmore, during Petitioner’s Audit Period from February 1, 2009 \nto January 31, 2012, Biltmore purchased, among other goods, a Sennebogen material \nhandler, a 2009 Magnum, a Volvo excavator, and a roll off container, as well as other \nequipment, parts, supplies, equipment fluids, and fuel.  (Bus. Ct. R. 597.)  Petitioner \nreviewed these purchases and decided that none of the operations conducted by \nBiltmore qualified as manufacturing.  (Bus. Ct. R. 601.)  Accordingly, Petitioner \nissued a proposed Notice of Sales and Use Tax Assessment on February 20, 2013 \nassessing Biltmore  tax on the purchase of these items at the general State and \napplicable local rates of tax.  (Bus. Ct. R. 597, 620.)  Biltmore objected to the proposed \ntax assessment and timely requested a Departmental review.  (Bus. Ct. R. 597.)  \nThereafter, unable to resolve Biltmore’s objections to the tax assessments, Petitioner \nissued a Notice of Final Determination upholding the original tax assessment  and \nassessing Biltmore for additional tax of $61,870.41, interest of $20, 960.46, and \npenalties of $16,967.60.  (Bus. Ct. R. 624.) \n12.  As to TT&E, d uring Petitioner’s Audit Period from August 1, 2009 to \nJuly 31, 2012, TT&E purchased , among other goods,  a granulator, cranes, shears, \ntorches, heavy duty containers, repair parts for equipment, operating supplies, \ncomputer equipment, as well as other equipment, parts, supplies, equipment fluids, \nand fuel.  (Bus. Ct. R. 63 2.)  Petitioner reviewed these purchases , determined that \nTT&E’s operations did not qualify as manufacturing, and issued a proposed Notice of \nSales and Use Tax Assessment assessing TT&E tax on these purchases.  (Bus. Ct. R. \n632–33, 706.)  TT&E objected to the proposed tax assessment and timely requested a \nDepartmental review.  (Bus. Ct. R. 633.)  During the Departmental review, Petitioner \nchanged its prior position, and concluded  that the Granulator Shredding Operation \nwas in fact properly considered “manufacturing.”  Accordingly, TT&E’s purchase of \nthe granulator was subject to the Privilege Tax.  (Bus. Ct. R. 63 3.)  Otherwise, \nPetitioner did not determine that TT&E’s other operations qualified as \nmanufacturing.  (Bus. Ct. R. 633, 710.)  On June 29, 2017, Petitioner issued a Notice \nof Final Determination adjusting the proposed tax assessment to reflect its \ndetermination, assessing TT&E for additional tax of $99,720.81, interest of 31,701.15, \nand penalties of $24,930.21.  (Bus. Ct. R. 707.) \n13. On August 22, 2017, Respondents filed Petitions for Contested Case \nHearings with the OAH seeking review of their respective Notices of Final \nDetermination.  On November 29, 2017, the OAH issued an Order of Consolidation , \nwhich consolidated the matters for hearing pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 150B-26.  On April \n13, 2018, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, which were heard on \nApril 25, 2018 before the Honorable Melissa Owens Lassiter, Administrative Law \nJudge (“ALJ”).  On July 20, 2018, the OAH issued the Final Decision.  ALJ Lassiter \nconcluded that Respondents proved by a preponderance of the evidence that their \nrecycling businesses involved manufacturing, and that, therefore, Petitioner acted \nerroneously when determining that Respondents were no t entitled to remit the \nPrivilege Tax.  (Bus. Ct. R. 1137 –38.)  Accordingly, the OAH granted Respondents’ \nmotions for summary judgment, denied Petitioner’s motion for summary judgment, \nand reversed Petitioner’s Notices of Final Determination.  (Bus. Ct. R. 1130.) \n14. On August 17, 2018, Petitioner  submitted its Petition for Judicial \nReview, which is now before this Court.  (ECF No. 3.)  The parties thereafter filed the \nOfficial Record on November 1, 2018 pursuant to Business Court Rule 13.3.  (ECF \nNos. 14, 15.)  On December 3, 2018, Petitioner filed a brief in support of its Petition \nfor Judicial Review.  (ECF No. 16.)  Respondent s filed their consolidated response \nbrief on February 1, 2019.  (ECF No. 21.)   Petitioner filed a reply brief on February \n14, 2019.  (ECF No. 22.) \n15. The Petition for Judicial Review came before the Court for oral \nargument on April 17, 2019, at which all parties were represented by counsel, and is \nnow ripe for determination.  \n \n \nIII. ANALYSIS \nA. Standard of Review \n16. The task before this Court is to “determine whether the petitioner is \nentitled to the relief sought in the petition based upon [a] review of the final decision \nand the official record.”  N.C.G.S. § 150B-51(c).  The appeal of a final decision of the \nOAH in a contested case  “arising from [a] summary judgment order[ ]  [is] decided \nusing a de novo standard of review.”  Midrex Techs. v. N.C. Dep’t of Revenue, 369 N.C. \n250, 257, 794 S.E.2d 785, 791 (2016).  Accordingly, the Court will “make a de novo \ndetermination of whether [the ALJ] correctly granted summary judgment in favor of \nthe [ Respondents] and against [ Petitioner].”  Id.  “Under the  de novo  standard of \nreview, the [Court] consider[s] the matter anew and freely substitut[es] its own \njudgment for [that of the lower court ].”  Id. (alterations in original) (citations and \nquotation marks omitted).  Summary judgment i s appropriate where there is no  \nfactual dispute and only questions of law remain.  Wal-Mart Stores E. v. Hinton, 197 \nN.C. App. 30, 37, 676 S.E.2d 634, 638 (2009).  \n17. “In reviewing a final decision allowing . . . summary judgment, . . . [i]f \nthe order of the court does not fully adjudicate the case, the court shall remand the \ncase to the [ALJ] for such further proceedings as are just.”  N.C.G.S. § 150B-51(d).   \n18. The facts of t his case are not in dispute.  Instead, Petitioner contends \nthat the ALJ erred (1) in concluding that Respondents’ operations are manufacturing \nas applied to the undisputed facts of this case, and (2)  by failing to engage in a \npurchase-by-purchase analysis to determine if Respondents’ purchases during the \nrespective Audit Periods were mill machinery , parts, or accessories used during the \nmanufacturing process  entitled to the Privilege Tax .   Accordingly, the question s \nbefore this Court involve statutory interpretation and are therefore questions of law.  \nParkdale Am., LLC v. Hinton , 200 N.C. App. 275, 278, 684 S.E.2d 458, 461 (2009).  \nPetitioner contends that the ALJ’s decision is contrary to North Carolina case law \nand Petitioner’s own published interpretations of tax statutes, and consequently, if \nthe proper interpretation of N.C.G.S. § 105-187.51 is applied to the undisputed facts, \nRespondents are not entitled to the Privilege Tax on the items purchased during the \nrespective Audit Periods.   \nB. At Least Some of Respondents’ Operations are Properly Considered \nManufacturing \n \n19. The Court first addresses whether Respondents are manufacturers \neligible for the Privilege Tax.  Section 105-187.51, effective during the Audit Periods \nand therefore the statute that controls the Court’s decision in this matter, provides \nthat a privilege tax of one percent (1%) is imposed on “[a] manufacturing industry or \nplant that purchases mill machinery or mill machinery parts or accessories for \nstorage, use, or consumption[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 105-187.51.  The Privilege Tax is a partial \nexemption from State and local sales and use tax on tangible personal property .  Id.  \nThe taxpayer bears the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \nit is eligible for the lower rate of taxation and entitled to remit the 1% Privilege Tax \nrather than the general State and local rates of tax.  See Piedmont Canteen Serv., Inc. \nv. Johnson, 256 N.C. 155, 163, 123 S.E.2d 582, 587 (1962).   \n20. Accordingly, in order for Respondents’ purchases to be considered “mill \nmachinery or mill machinery  parts or accessories” subject to the Privilege Tax, the \nCourt must first determine whether Respondents are engaged in manufacturing.  The \nundisputed material facts in this case reveal that at least some of the processes and \noperations used at Respondents’ respective facilities support a finding that  \nRespondents are manufacturers and were engaged in manufacturing during the \nAudit Periods.       \n21. Neither N.C.G.S. § 105-187.51 specifically nor N.C.G.S. § 105-164.3 (the \ndefinitional section in Article 5 of the Revenue Act) includes a definition of \n“manufacturer” or “manufacturing.”2  Accordingly, the Court looks to North Carolina \ncase law to determine the definition of these terms within the meaning of the taxing \nstatutes.  In Duke Power v. Clayton , our Supreme Court defined manufacturing “as \nthe producing of a new article or use or ornament by application of skill and labor to \nraw materials.”  274 N.C. 505, 514, 164 S.E.2d 289, 295 (1968 ).  In order for an item \nto be considered manufactured, “the labor must result in a new and different article \nwith a distinctive name, character or use.”  Id. at 513, 164 S.E.2d at 295.  The Court \nin Duke Power also noted, however, that “[t]he word manufacture is not susceptible \nof an accurate definition that is all -embracing or all -exclusive, but is susceptible of \nmany applications and many meanings.”  Id. (emphasis in original) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, while Duke Power  provides, in a general \n                                                 \n2 The Court however notes, though not controlling of the Court’s decision herein, that in 2016, \nthe Legislature amended section 105-187.51B to explicitly extend the Privilege Tax to \nsecondary metal recyclers engaged in the same or similar operations as  Respondents.  N.C. \nSess. Law 2016-94, § 38.2(b).  \nsense, the “usual connotation” for manufacturing, id. at 514, 164 S.E.2d at 295, the \nDuke Power definition of manufacturing must be considered in light of the specific \nindustry, products produced, and the customer market at issue. \n22. Here, the undisputed facts show that Respondents transform Scrap \nMetal that is no longer usable for its intended purpose into new products that have \ndistinct names, characteristics, and uses.  (Bus. Ct. R. 285 –90, 296 –302, 308–14.)  \nLooking at Respondents’ customer base, Respondents’ customers are willing and able \nto purchase Respondents’ final products but have no use for the Scrap Metal before it \nundergoes Respondents’ transformation processes.  (Bus. Ct. R. 352.)  For example, \nscrap steel such as beams or  trusses are transformed into “Prepared Plate and \nStructural,” which, to qualify as such, must meet specific composition, density, and \nsize requirements set by the ISRI specifications or other specifications provided by \nthe customer.  (Bus. Ct. R. 352–53, 510.)   \n23. Furthermore, looking at the products produced, and comparing those to \nthe original products  from which they are derived , there is no question that \nRespondents have created “a new and different article[.]”   Duke Power, 274 N.C. at \n513, 164 S.E.2d at 295.  For example, Respondents may purchase a vehicle that, for \nsome reason or another, can no longer be driven (and therefore has lost its intended \npurpose and value ).  Respondents thereafter perform various operations on that \nvehicle to turn it into a product (or products) that can now be used by a mill or refinery \nat its facilities.  What was once an unmarketable, post -consumer product has new \nmeaning and new value because of Respondents’ efforts and labor .  This is exactly \nwhat Duke Power  contemplates.  The same is true for post -consumer aluminum \nbeverage cans: cans that  once contained, for instance, beer or  carbonated beverage \nproducts and ha ve now been discarded as trash  are entirely different from Baled \nAluminum Used Beverage Can (“UBC”) Scrap, which is created only after \nRespondents dry and clean, flatten, and bale the used cans to a density of 22 pounds \nper cubic foot and bind them with steel bands.  (Bus. Ct. R. 500.)  UBC Scrap, but not \nindividual post-consumer beverage cans, will be purchased by Respondents’ \ncustomers for use at their facilities.  (Bus. Ct. R. 342 –43.)   In essence, Respondents \ncreate new life and new purpose for products that have been discarded and have lost \ntheir intended value —this is entirely consistent with the Duke Power definition of \nmanufacturing.   \n24. Moreover, even though Respondents do not change the intrinsic \ncomposition of the Scrap Metal (i.e. the aluminum beverage can is still aluminum \nafter undergoing Respondents’ operations), the Court believes this has no effect on \nwhether a new and different product with a distinctive use has been created.   See, \ne.g., Brandenburg Indus. Serv. Co. v. Ind. Dep’t of State Revenue, 60 N.E.3d 300, 307 \n(Ind. Tax. Ct. 2016) (“Logic dictates that a copper wire encased within a cement block \nis different from a copper wire without the encumbrance of debris, that sorted metal \nis different from unsorted metal, and that long lengths of metal are different from \nshorter, cut lengths of metal.”). \n25. The Court also believes that Respondents’ operations are analogous to \noperations already considered by Petitioner to be manufacturing.   According to \nPetitioner’s own Sales & Use Tax Bulletin, Petitioner classifies persons in the \nbusiness of ginning cotton (which requires only the separat ion of seeds from cotton \nfibers), water purification plants (which transforms untreated water into purified \nwater), and persons who transform water into ice , as manufacturers.  (Bus. Ct. R.  \n1108, 1111, 1115.)  The Court concludes that the transformation of water into purified \nwater, of water into ice , or the removal of seeds from cotton is no more an act of \n“manufacturing” than the transformation undertaken in Respondents’ operations.  In \neach insta nce, the manufacturer removes, separates, or otherwise changes the \nproperties of the old product to produce a new product capable of use by its customers.  \nJust as Respondents’ customers here will not purchase used loose aluminum cans for \nuse at its facilities, textile manufacturers will not purchase cotton fibers with seeds, \nconsumers will not use liquid water to cool their beverages , and persons will not \nconsume unpurified water. \n26. Petitioner relies on Duke Power  not only for the definition of \nmanufacturing (which remains good law) but also for its underlying facts.  There, our \nSupreme Court considered whether crushed coal was in an “ unmanufactured state.”  \nDuke Power, 274 N.C. at 513, 164 S.E.2d at 295.  At the time of the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in 1968, there was no guiding precedent in North Carolina as to whether the \ncrushing of coal constituted manufacturing within the meaning of taxing statutes.  \nSee id. at 514, 164 S.E.2d at 296.   Accordingly, the Supreme Court analogized the \ncrushing of coal to the crushing and screening of quarried rock and recognized  that \n“[t]he majority of jurisdictions . . . [at that time had held] that quarrying and crushing \nstone is not manufacturing. ”  Id. at 514 –15, 164 S.E.2d at 296.  Accordingly, the \nSupreme Court held that crushing coal is not a manufacturing process and crushed \ncoal was purchased in “an unmanufactured state.”  Id. at 516, 164 S.E.2d at 297.   \nPetitioner now contends that crushing coal is no different from Respondents’ \noperations here.     \n27. Based on the Court’s review of the Duke Power decision, it appears that \nPetitioner at that time had not given  much guidance regarding its position on what \nwas or was not manufacturing to aid the courts of this State in their analysis.  See id. \nat 514, 174 S.E.2d at 296.  As a result, and in the absence of case or statutory law in \nNorth Carolina interpreting North Carolina taxing statutes, the Supreme Court was \nrequired to look to the law of other states in order to assess the meaning of \n“manufacturing.”  Under those circum stances, the Supreme Court in Duke Power  \nprovided a definition for manufacturing and applied it strictly to the facts of that case.  \nHowever, more than fifty years have passed since the Supreme Court’s conclusion in \nDuke Power.  Over that time, Petitioner has been called on to determine whether \nspecific processes in differing contexts satisfy the requirements for manufacturing as \ndefined in Duke Power  and ha s, on a number of occasions,  determined that such \nprocesses are, in fact, manufacturing.  (See Bus. C t. R. 1100–16 (listing specific \nindustries that are considered manufacturers by Petitioner).)  Notably, Petitioner has \ndetermined that “[q]uarries . . . regularly operated for the production of stone, sand, \nclay, marble, granite, gravel, crushed stone and similar products for commercial \npurposes are deemed to be manufacturing plants and industries [.]”  (Bus. Ct. R. \n1109.)  The subsequent determinations by Petitioner are arguably at odds with the \nSupreme Court’s analysis in Duke Power .  However, attempting t o harmonize \nPetitioner’s position with the Supreme Court’s decision in Duke Power leads to the \ninescapable conclusion that at least some of the processes engaged in by Respondents \nare manufacturing. \n28. Lastly, and most importantly  as to this first issue , the record reveals \nthat Petitioner concluded in its Notice of Final Determination as to TT&E, that \nTT&E’s Granulator Shredding Operation qualified as manufacturing.  (Bus. Ct. R. \n710.)  The Court is unpersuaded that there is any meaningful difference between this \nprocess and the other processes used by Respondents.  Petitioner’s position would \nhave the Court find that using strippers and sheers (tools purchased by Respondents \nfor which the Privilege Tax is claimed  but Petitioner rejected ) to create bare brite  \ncopper is not manufacturing but achieving the same end product through use of a \ngranulator (the machine purchased by TT&E which was permitted by Petitioner to \ncarry the lower tax rate) is manufacturing.  Respondents argue in their response brief \nthat “[t]he relevant inquiry . . . is whether a new and different product is created—\nnot how that product is created.”  (Resp. Br. 19 (emphasis original).)  The Court \nagrees.  As Petitioner itself concedes, manufacturing is defined in terms of the final \nproduct pro duced: Duke Power  defines manufacturing “as the producing of a new \narticle or use or ornament  by application of skill and labor to raw materials.”  274 \nN.C. at 514, 164 S.E.2d at 295 (emphasis added). \n29. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the Court concludes that \nRespondents are engaged in manufacturing and that the ALJ did not err in reaching \nsuch a conclusion in the Final Decision.                 \nC. The ALJ Erred in Failing to Engage in a Purchase-by-Purchase Analysis \n30. Although the ALJ correctly determined that Respondents are engaged \nin manufacturing, the Court concludes that the ALJ nevertheless erred as a matter \nof law by not conducting a purchase-by-purchase analysis of each Respondent’s items \npurchased during the Audit Periods to determine if each item was “mill machinery or \nmill machinery parts or accessories” used in the manufacturing process.   \n31. Based on a clear reading of N.C.G.S. § 105-187.51, while being a \nmanufacturer is a prerequisite to being eligible for the  Privilege Tax, not all items \npurchased by a manufacturer are entitled to the lower rate of taxation.  Rather, \nN.C.G.S. § 105-187.51 requires a two-step analysis: first, there must be a \ndetermination that the purchaser is a  “manufacturing industry or plant [,]” and \nsecond, there must be a determination that the  purchases are of “mill machinery or \nmill machinery parts or accessories[.]”  N.C.G.S. § 105 -187.51(a)(1).  Furthermore, \nN.C.G.S. § 105-187.51(b) provides that the Privilege Tax is “one percent (1%) of  the \npurchase price of the machinery, part, or accessory purchased. ”  Therefore, when \nassessing whether the Privilege Tax is applicable, a purchase -by-purchase analysis \nmust be done.  It would be in err or, based on the plain meaning of the statute, to \nassume all items purchased by a manufacturer are subject to the Privilege Tax.   \n32. Respondents each purchased numerous items during the respective \nAudit Periods for which the Privilege Tax was claimed.  It appears to the Court that \nthe parties did not provide su fficient evidence (or arguments to the contra ry) to the \nALJ of the use of each individual item purchased by Respondents during the Audit \nPeriods and, accordingly, that the ALJ could not and did not analyze in the Final \nDecision whether each item purchased by each Respondent was an item used in the \nmanufacturing process.  The Court believes this was in error, and accordingly, \nremands these consolidated matters to the OAH for further proceedings to conduct a \npurchase-by-purchase analysis.  \n33. In doing so, the Court believes that the ALJ should determine whether \nthe items purchased were used in the production phase of manufacturing.  Pursuant \nto Petitioner’s interpretation of the Privilege Tax statute, only those items used in \nthe “production” phase of manufacturing qualify for the Privilege Tax.  (Bus. Ct. R. \n1083.)  During the respective  Audit Periods at issue, 17 North Carolina \nAdministrative Code 07D.0102(a)(1) , which controls determination of the \napplicability of the Privilege Tax to individual purchases, provided that:  \n“[P]urchases by a manufacturing industry or plant of machinery, and \nparts and accessories therefore for use in production  . . . are classified \nas mill machinery, and  mill machinery parts and accessories  . . . . \nProduction does not include any activity connected with the movement of \nraw materials or ingredients into inventory . . . . Sales to manufacturing \nindustries and plants of machinery, parts and accessories to such  \nmachinery, or other items of tangible personal property which are used \nin the movement of raw materials or ingredients into inventory or . . .  \nwhich are used for  other similar purposes are subject to the applicable \nstatutory state and local sales or use tax.” \n \n17 N.C. Admin. Code 07D.0102(a)(1) (emphasis added). \n \n34. Accordingly, based on the Administrative Code, purchases of items used \nfor the movement of raw materials into inventory are not subject to the Privilege Tax.  \nThe Court finds no other authority contrary to  this position, nor have Respondents \npresented the Court with an alternative position.   In fact, the record reveals that \ncounsel for Respondents “concur[red] . . . that items used in the gathering and \nbringing [of] materials to the [manufacturing facility]  under the statute for this \nperiod do not qualify” for the Privilege Tax.  (Bus. Ct. R. 945.)   \n35. The Final Decision by the ALJ lacks any analysis as to whether each of \nthe purchases at issue were in fact used by Respondents in manufacturing  (and \nspecifically in the production phase of manufacturing) .  Rather, it appears that the \nALJ assumed, without proof, that all claimed purchases were entitled to the lower \nPrivilege Tax because the ALJ concluded as a matter of law that Respondents were \nmanufacturers.  (See Bus. Ct. R. 1138, Conclusion of Law No. 29.)  The record before \nthe ALJ, however, reveals that purchases for which the lower Privilege Tax was \nclaimed include products which were seemingly used for purposes other than \nmanufacturing.  For instance, Respondents claimed the Privilege Tax was applicable \nto purchases of computer equipment and printer ink cartridges .  (See, e.g., Bus. Ct. \nR. 666, 709.) \n36. As a result, finding Petitioner’s interpretation of N.C.G.S. § 105-187.51 \ninstructive, and giving Petitioner deference in this regard, only those items used in \nthe production phase of manufacturing are subject to the Privilege Tax.  Because the \nALJ did not limit her conclusion to items used in the production phase of  \nmanufacturing or  conduct a purchase -by-purchase analysis to determine whether \neach of the items at issue purchased by Respondents w as utilized in this way , the \nCourt remands these consolidated cases to the OAH to determine whether each item \npurchased by R espondents during the Audit Periods is  properly considered mill \nmachinery, parts, or accessories used during the production phase of manufacturing  \nand thus entitled to the Privilege Tax rate.    \nIV. CONCLUSION \n37. For the reasons set forth above, the Court conclud es that the Final \nDecision granting summary judgment in Respondents’ favor, denying Petitioner’s \nmotion for summary judgment, and reversing Petitioner’s Notices of Final \nDetermination, should be AFFIRMED to the extent the ALJ determined that \nRespondents ar e manufacturers.  However , the Court REVERSES the Final \nDecision to the extent the ALJ concluded that all items purchased by Respondents \nare subject to the Privilege Tax.  The Court orders that these consolidated matters be \nREMANDED for further proceedings and a determination by the OAH, based on a \npurchase-by-purchase analysis, as to whether each item purchased by Respondents \nduring the respective Audit Periods was used during the production phase of \nmanufacturing. \nSO ORDERED, this the 8th day of July, 2019. \n \n /s/ Michael L.
