Moody, 2019 NCBC 38. \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nMECKLENBURG COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n18 CVS 13891 \n \nVANGUARD PAI LUNG, LLC; and \nPAI LUNG MACHINERY MILL CO. \nLTD., \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nWILLIAM MOODY; NOREEN \nMOODY; MARY KATE MOODY; \nMICHAEL MOODY; NOVA \nTRADING USA, INC.; and NOVA \nWINGATE HOLDINGS, LLC, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION  \nON PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION  \nTO DISMISS COUNTERCLAIMS  \n \nWILLIAM MOODY; NOVA \nTRADING USA, INC.; and NOVA \nWINGATE HOLDINGS, LLC, \n \n         Counterclaim Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nVANGUARD PAI LUNG, LLC; and \nPAI LUNG MACHINERY MILL CO. \nLTD., \n \n         Counterclaim Defendants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1. This case arises out of disputes between the members and managers  of \nVanguard Pai Lung, LLC (“Vanguard”), a North Carolina limited  liability company.  \nVanguard and its majority member, Pai Lung Machinery Mill Co. (“Pai Lung”) , \nbrought this suit  against six defendants:  William Moody, Vanguard’s former \nPresident and C hief Executive Officer; Nova Trading USA, Inc. (“Nova Trading”), \nVanguard’s minority member and a company wholly owned by Moody; Nova Wingate \nHoldings, LLC, another company owned by Moody; and three of Moody’s family \nmembers.  In short, Plaintiffs allege that Moody has been siphoning cash and assets \nfrom Vanguard to benefit himself and his family for the better part of a decade. \n2. Defendants deny any wrongdoing and claim to be the real victims.  Moody, \nNova Trading, and Nova Wingate Holdings have asserted counterclaims premised on \nallegations that Pai Lung used its majority position to control Vanguard, force Moody \nout of the business, and frustrate the minority rights of Nova Trading.  In addition to \nasserting sundry counterclaims for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, \nMoody and Nova Trading ask the Court to dissolve Vanguard. \n3. Vanguard and Pai Lung  have moved  to dismiss many but not all of the  \ncounterclaims under Rule 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules  of Civil Procedure .  \nFor the following reasons, the Court DENIES the motion.  \nWomble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP, by Matthew F. Tilley, Russ Ferguson, \nand Patrick G. Spaugh, and Perkins Coie LLP, by John P. Schnurer, \nSean T. Prosser, John D. Esterhay,  and Yun  (Louise) Lu, for \nPlaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants Vanguard Pai Lung, LLC and Pai \nLung Machinery Mill Co. LTD. \n \nJohnston, Allison & Hord, P.A., by Patrick E. Kelly, Michael J. Hoefling, \nand David V. Brennan, for Defendants/Counterclaim Plaintiffs William \nMoody, Nova Trading USA, Inc., and Nova Wingate Holdings, LLC.  \n \nBurns, Gray & Gray , by John T. Burns, for Defendants Noreen Moody, \nMary Kate Moody, and Michael Moody.  \n \nConrad, Judge. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \n4. The Court does not make findings of fact on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss.  The following factual summary is drawn from relevant allegations in the \namended answer and counterclaims and its exhibits.  (ECF No. 59 [“Countercl.”].) \n5. Vanguard, a maker and seller of  high-speed circular knitting machines , is \nthe latest incarnation of a business once owned by Singer Co. and, more recently, by \nMonarch Knitting Machinery Corp.  (See Countercl. ¶¶ 10–12, 22.)  Formed in 2009, \nVanguard had three initial members: Pai Lung (with a 51% interest), Nova Trading \n(with a 25% interest), and Leo Yates (with a 24% interest).  (Countercl. ¶ 33.)  Based \nin Taiwan, Pai Lung is one of the world’s la rgest manufacturers of circular  and flat \nweft knitting machines.  (Countercl. ¶ 15.)  Nova Trading, a North Carolina company, \nalso manufactures knitting machines and is wholly owned by Moody.  ( Countercl. \n¶¶ 2, 13.)  Yates is one of Moody’s longtime business partners and industry associates.  \n(Countercl. ¶ 10.) \n6. An Operating Agreement governs Vanguard’s operations and the rights and \nobligations of its members.  The company is managed by a board of managers, which \nmust consist of at least three but no m ore than five managers.  (Pls.’/Counter-Defs.’ \nMem. in Supp. Partial Mot. Dismiss Am. Countercl. Ex. A § 3.1(a), (c), ECF No. 63.1 \n[“Op. Agrmt.”].)  At least initially, Pai Lung had authority to appoint three of the five \nmanagers, and  Nova Trading and Yate s had authority to appoint one each .  (Op. \nAgrmt. § 4.3(b)(i)–(iii).)  Once elected, the managers may make “all decisions with \nrespect to the management of the business and affairs” of Vanguard by a majority \nvote, except for some actions that require a supermajority vote of the members.  (Op. \nAgrmt. § 3.1(a); see also Op. Agrmt. §§ 3.4, 4.4.)  Members, on the other hand, are not \npermitted to “take part in the management or control of the busines s” in their \ncapacity as members.  (Op. Agrmt. § 4.2.)   \n7. To fill its allotted three board positions, Pai Lung appointed its president \nand chairman, James Wang, along with Wang’s father and uncle.  (Countercl. ¶¶ 17, \n34, 35.)  The other two board slots went to Moody ( appointed by Nova Trading) and \nYates (self-appointed).  ( See Countercl. ¶ 34.)  The company’s initial officers , as \nnamed in the Operating Agreement , includ ed Moody as President and Chief \nExecutive Officer and Yates as Secretary and Chief Operating Officer.  (Op. Agrmt. \n§ 3.2(a).)  According to Moody, he also had a separate oral employment agreement in \nhis role as an officer.  (Countercl. ¶ 30.)  \n8. In 2011, Yates resigned, and Wang’s father died.  These events opened two \nvacancies on the board of managers.   (Countercl. ¶¶ 37, 40.)   Yates’s position has \nnever been filled, but Pai Lung filled its open seat with one of its agents.  (Countercl. \n¶¶ 41, 42.)  When Yates resigned, he also sold his membership interest to Vanguard, \nleaving Pai Lung and Nova Trading as the two remaining members , with 67.1053% \nand 32.8947% interests, respectively.  (Countercl. ¶ 38.) \n9. That was the status quo until 2017 when Moody and Wang locked horns \nover company management.  (Countercl. ¶¶  45, 51.)  To start, Pai Lung insisted on \nhiring Penny Peng , a Pai Lung employee and agent, as Vanguard’s fin ancial \nmanager.  (Countercl. ¶¶ 47, 48.)  Moody thought the move was a fiasco.  He objected \nto Peng’s qualifications and her cumbrous practice of consulting Wang, halfway \naround the globe, before making a decision.  (Countercl. ¶¶  49, 50.)  The situation \nonly worsened when Wang began ignoring communications from Moody and others.  \n(See Countercl. ¶ 51.)  Then, in November 2017, the board of managers —chaired by \nWang—voted to remove Moody as President.  (Countercl. ¶¶ 36, 52.)   \n10. At the same time, Peng began withholding commission payments from Nova \nTrading.  ( Countercl. ¶  62.)  These payments were part of an  alleged agreement \n(“Commission Agreement”) made among Pai Lung, Nova Trading, and Vanguard  in \nJanuary 2017 .  (Countercl. ¶¶  55–58, 60–61.)  In a nutshell , Vanguard would pay \nincreased prices for parts and machines that it purchased from Pai Lung, and Nova \nTrading would in turn receive a commission of five percent on parts and ten percent \non machines.  (Countercl. ¶ 56.)  In effect, the Commission Agreement served to offset \nthe decrease in distributions to Nova Trading that would result from the increased \nprices being paid by Vanguard to Pai Lung.  (Countercl. ¶ 60.) \n11. Moody also claims that Vanguard refused to pay him a profit-sharing bonus \nfor 2017.  (Countercl. ¶ 71.)  According to Moody, he agreed at the beginning of 2017 \nto assume additional responsibilities in exchange for a fifteen percent profit-sharing \nbonus, to be paid annually to Moody or Nova Trading (“Profit-Sharing Agreement”).  \n(Countercl. ¶¶ 68, 69.)  That payment was never made.  (Countercl. ¶ 69.) \n12. In mid-2018, a majority of the board of managers terminated  Moody’s \nemployment as C hief Executive Officer.  (Countercl. ¶  52.)  Two months later, \nVanguard and Pai Lung filed this suit .  They allege that Moody, as officer and \nmanager of Vanguard, orchestrated a massive fraud on the company for the past ten \nyears, siphoning money and assets for the benefit of himself and his family. \n13. Moody and Nova Trading1 respond that they are the victims of a scheme by \nWang and Pai Lung to take complete control of Vanguard.   (See Countercl. ¶  53.)  \nToday, Moody remains a Vanguard manager, and Nova Trading remains a member, \nbut they allege that they have been effectively sidelined  by Pai Lung and the Pai \nLung-controlled board of managers .  (See Countercl. ¶¶ 52–54.)  In their amended \nanswer and counterclaims, Moody and Nova Trading assert twelve counterclaims for, \namong other things,  breaches of the Operating Agreement,  the Commission \nAgreement, the Profit-Sharing Agreement, and Moody’s oral employment agreement.  \nThey further assert that Pai Lung, as majority member, owed a fiduciary duty to \nNova Trading, as minority member, and breached that duty.  And they seek judicial \ndissolution of Vanguard.   \n14. In this motion, Pai Lung and Vanguard seek to dismiss eight of the twelve \ncounterclaims.  (Partial Mot. Dismiss Am. Countercl., ECF No. 62.)  The motion has \nbeen fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing on April 17, 2019.  (ECF No. 66.)  The \nmotion is ripe for decision. \nII.  \nANALYSIS\n15. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) “tests the legal sufficiency of the ” \ndisputed pleading, here the amended counterclaims .  Concrete Serv. Corp. v. Inv’rs \nGrp., Inc., 79 N.C. App. 678, 681, 340 S.E.2d 755, 758 (1986).  The motion should be \ngranted only when : (1) the pleading “on its face reveals that no law supports” the \n                                            \n1 The merits of this motion do not implicate the third counterclaimant,  Nova Wingate \nHoldings, or any of the remaining defendants.   \nasserted claim; (2) the pleading “on its face reveals the absence of fa cts sufficient to \nmake a good claim;” or (3) the pleading “discloses some fact that necessarily defeats” \nthe claim.  Corwin v. British Am. Tobacco PLC , 371 N.C. 605, 615, 821 S.E.2d 729, \n736–37 (2018) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \n16. In deciding a R ule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court must treat the well -pleaded \nallegations of the counterclaims as true and view the facts and permissible inferences \n“in the light most favorable to” the non-moving party.  Ford v. Peaches Entm’t Corp., \n83 N.C. App. 155, 156, 349 S.E.2d 82, 83 (1986).  “[T]he court is not required to accept \nas true any conclusions of law or unwarranted deductions of fact.”  Oberlin Capital, \nL.P. v. Slavin , 147 N.C. App. 52, 56, 554 S.E.2d 840, 844 (2001) .  The Court may \nconsider documents that are the subject of the counterclaims  and to which th e \ncounterclaims specifically refer  without converting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a \nmotion for summary judgment.  Weaver v. St. Joseph of the Pines, Inc., 187 N.C. App. \n198, 204, 652 S.E.2d 701, 707 (2007)  (quoting Oberlin Capital, 147 N.C. App. at 60, \n554 S.E.2d at 847).   \nA. Contract Claims \n17. Four disputed counterclaims relate to contracts that were allegedly \nbreached around the time that Vanguard’s board terminated Moody from his official \npositions.  As alleged, Vanguard withheld commissions from Nova Trading under the \nCommission Agreement, refused to pay any bonus under the Profit -Sharing \nAgreement, and failed to pay Moody for accrued vacation time as required by his oral \nemployment agreement.  (Countercl. ¶¶ 126, 132, 143.)  Moody and Nova Trading \nalso allege that Vanguard breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing in each contract.   (Countercl. ¶¶  147, 148.)  These four counterclaims a re \nasserted against only Vanguard. \n18. A theme of Vanguard’s brief in support is that the allegations lack detail \nand are not supported by corroborating evidence.  Vanguard describes the alleged \ncontracts as “vaguely-articulated.”  (Pls.’/Counter-Defs.’ Mem. in Supp. Partial Mot. \nDismiss Am.  Countercl. 7, ECF No. 63 [“Mem. in Supp.”] .)  It contends that the \nallegations omit, among other things, who engaged in contract negotiations, when the \nnegotiations happened, where the contracts were finalized, and why Vanguard would \nsupposedly have been motivated to enter into them.  ( See, e.g., Mem. in Supp. 8, 10, \n11; see also Pls.’/Counter-Defs.’ Reply in Supp. Partial Mot. Dismiss Am. Countercl. \n4, 5, ECF No. 67 [“Reply Br.”].)  It also questions the veracity of several allegations—\nfor example, that certain e-mails were sent or that commission payments were made \nfor part of 2017—because Moody and Nova Trading haven’t supplied evidence to back \nthem up.  (See Mem. in Supp. 8; Reply Br. 3, 5 n.2.)   \n19. Two initial observations are necessary.  First, claims for breach of contract \nare “not subject to heightened pleading standards.”  AYM Techs., LLC v. Rogers, 2018 \nNCBC LEXIS 14, at *52 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 9, 2018).   Rather, they must meet the \nusual, liberal standard of Rule 8, which requires only a “short and plain statement of \nthe claim” sufficient to put the court and parties on notice of the events giving rise to \nthe claim.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1).   It is enough to plead the “(1) existence of a valid \ncontract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, \n26, 530 S.E.2d 838, 843 (2000).  When these elements are alleged, “it is error to \ndismiss a breach of contract claim under Rule 12(b)(6) ,” and o ur appellate courts \nroutinely reverse trial court orders that require anything more.  Woolard v. \nDavenport, 166 N.C. App. 129, 134, 601 S.E.2d 319, 322 (2004) ; see also, e.g. , \nBarbarino v. Cappucine, Inc. , 2012 N.C. App. LEXIS 305, at *7 (N.C. Ct. App. Mar . \n6, 2012) (unpublished) (reversing dismissal of claim for breach of contract); Sanders \nv. State Pers. Comm’n , 197 N.C. App. 314, 322, 677 S.E.2d 182, 188 (2009) (same); \nSchlieper v. Johnson, 195 N.C. App. 257, 266, 672 S.E.2d 548, 554 (2009) (same). \n20. Second, to dismiss a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) for lack of evidentiary support \nwould be error .  “Perhaps the most fundamental concept of motions practice under \nRule 12  is that evidence outside the pleadings .  . . cannot be considered in \ndetermining whether the complaint states a claim on which relief can be granted .”  \nJackson/Hill Aviation, Inc. v. Town of Ocean Isle Beach, 251 N.C. App. 771, 775, 796 \nS.E.2d 120, 123 (2017).  “Neither party has any evidentiary burden at this stage,” and \nthe counterclaims’ “factu al allegations must be taken as true.”  Neier v. State , 151 \nN.C. App. 228, 233, 565 S.E.2d 229, 232 (2002).   \n21. Taken together, all of this means that stating a claim for breach of contract \nis a relatively low bar.  As discussed below, t he allegations of the amended \ncounterclaims, though succinct, meet the minimal requirements of Rule 8 and binding \nappellate precedent. \n1.  Commission and Profit-Sharing Agreements \n22. The parties dispute whether the Commission and Profit -Sharing \nAgreements must be in writing.  Vanguard contends that they must because both are \neffectively amendments to the Operating Agreement.  (See Mem. in Supp. 9 n.5; Reply \nBr. 2–4; Op. Agrmt. § 11.5.)  Even if Vanguard were right about that (which the Court \nneed not decide now), it would not be a reason to dismiss the counterclaims.  Moody \nand Nova Trading  expressly allege that both agreements were “contemporaneously \nmemorialized.”  (Countercl. ¶ 73.)  This is sufficient to allege a writing, assuming one \nwas required, and  must be accepted as true.  See, e.g., Priest v. Coch , 2013 NCBC \nLEXIS 6, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. Jan. 25, 2013) (taking allegation of written contract \nas true and denying motion to dismiss). \n23. Vanguard also argues that Moody and Nova Trading failed to alleg e \nessential contract terms, particularly consideration.  Not so.  The Commission \nAgreement is a three-party contract related to Vanguard’s purchase of machines and \nparts from Pai Lung, apparently for resale in North and Central America.  ( See \nCountercl. ¶¶ 55, 56; Op. Agrmt. § 4.9.)  Each party received some benefit: Pai Lung \nreceived increased prices for its products; Nova Trading received a percentage \ncommission for those sales; and Vanguard received the products sold by Pai Lung.  \n(Countercl. ¶¶  56, 57 .)  Perhaps this was a bad deal , as Vanguard suggests, \n“multiplying the disadvantage” to it by requiring it to pay increased prices and fees \nto both its members.  (Mem. in Supp. 9.)  But “the parties to a contract,” not the Court, \n“are the judges of the adequacy of the consideration.”  Hejl v. Hood, Hargett & Assocs., \nInc., 196 N.C. App. 299, 305, 674 S.E.2d 425, 429 (2009).  Taken as true, the \nallegations plead the existence of consideration, which our courts define “as some \nbenefit or advantage to the promisor or some loss or detriment to the promisee.”  \nDeans v. Layton, 89 N.C. App. 358, 368, 366 S.E.2d 560, 567 (1988). \n24. Likewise, in the Profit-Sharing Agreement, Vanguard agreed to pay a bonus \nin return for Moody’s assumption of additional responsibilities.  (See Countercl. ¶ 68.)  \nThis allegation adequately pleads consideration and provides all the notice that Rule \n8 requires.  Moody and Nova Trading did not need to go further and  “identify what \nthese additional responsibilities were, or how employment responsibilities could even \nbe added to someone wh o was already CEO and  President,” as Vanguard contends.  \n(Reply Br. 6.) \n25. As an additional argument, Vanguard asserts for the first time in its reply \nbrief that the parties to the Profit-Sharing Agreement are not stated clearly enough.  \n(See Reply Br. 5.)  It is doubtful whether this  argument is timely, but in any event, \nthe Court disagrees.  As alleged, the profit-sharing bonus was due to “Nova Trading \nand/or Moody .”  (Countercl. ¶ ¶ 68, 69.)  Taking th is allegation in a light most \nfavorable to Moody and Nova Trading, Moody took on additional duties in return for \na bonus that he directed to be paid to himself or to his wholly owned company.  That \nleaves some ambiguity, but not one that is insoluble or so u nclear that Vanguard \nlacks notice of the events giving rise to the claim. \n26. The Court has considered Vanguard’s other arguments  as to the level of \ndetail given by the allegations about these two agreements  and finds them all \nunpersuasive.  “There is no rule which requires a plaintiff to set forth in his complaint \nthe full contents of the contract which is the subject matter of his action or to \nincorporate the same in the complaint by reference to a copy thereof attached as an \nexhibit.”  RGK, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 292 N.C. 668, 675, 235 S.E.2d 234, 238 \n(1977) (citation and quotation marks omitted) .  T he allegations give Vanguard \n“sufficient notice of the events or transactions which produced the claim.”  Sutton v. \nDuke, 277 N.C. 94, 104, 176 S.E.2d 161, 167 (1970).   \n27. Accordingly, the Court denies the motion to dismiss the counterclaims for \nbreach of the Commission Agreement and the Profit-Sharing Agreement.   \n2.  Moody’s Employment Agreement \n28. The third disputed contract is Moody’s  oral employment agreement.  He \nalleges that Vanguard breached the employment agreement when it failed to pay him \nfor accrued but unused vacation time.  (Countercl. ¶¶ 140, 143.) \n29. Vanguard argues that there is no allegation that Moody’s “oral employment \nagreement expressly included a vacation policy, whether from an employee handbook \nor elsewhere, that became a binding contract.”  (Mem. in Supp. 12.)  But there is.  The \namended counterclaims allege that “Vanguard maintains a standard vacation policy \nthat applies to all Vangu ard employees” and that this vacation policy “was \nincorporated into the employment agreement between Moody and Vanguard, which \nis a valid and enforceable contract.”  (Countercl. ¶¶ 136, 141.) \n30. Next, Vanguard argues that “Moody was placed into the role of CE O and \nPresident through the Operating Agreement” and that, as a result, the terms of the \nOperating Agreement supersede any alleged oral employment agreement.  (See Mem. \nin Supp. 12; Reply  Br. 7; Op. Agrmt. § 3.2(a)–(c).)  It is entirely possible, however, \nthat the Operating Agreement named the initial officers and that those officers also \nhad separate employment agreements.  There is no inherent conflict between the two.  \nSee, e.g., Roth v. Penguin Toilets, LLC, 2011 NCBC LEXIS 46, at *12 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nNov. 30, 2011) (“The Court’s determination that the Employment Agreement contains \nthe terms of Plaintiff’s employment relationship with Defendant is not to say that a \nparticular relationship can only be control led by one document.”); see also Urquhart \nv. Trenkelbach, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 12, at *3–4 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 8, 2017) (noting \nthat LLC members executed individual employment agreements in addition to the \noperating agreement); Chemcraft Holdings Corp. v. Shayban, 2006 NCBC LEXIS 15, \nat *3–5 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 5, 2006) (same). \n31. Taking all allegations as true, as the Court must, Moody and Nova Trading \nhave sufficiently alleged the existence of an employment agreement containing a \nvacation policy  and a breach of that agreement.  The Court denies the motion to \ndismiss the counterclaim for breach of the employment agreement. \n3.  Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing \n32. Moody and Nova Trading also adequately state a claim for breach of the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as to these three contracts.  “In every \ncontract there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party \nwill do anything which injures the right of the other to receive the benefits of th e \nagreement.”  Heron Bay Acquisition, LLC v. United Metal Finishing, Inc. , 245 N.C. \nApp. 378, 385, 781 S.E.2d 889, 894  (2016) (citation and quotation marks omitted ).  \nHere, Moody and Nova Trading allege the existence of three valid contracts and that \nVanguard breached the contracts as part of a scheme to push them out of the \nbusiness.  ( See, e.g. , Countercl. ¶¶  45, 51–54, 65, 71, 133, 144, 148, 149.)  These \nallegations are sufficient to state a claim for breach of the implied covenant.  See, e.g., \nSparrow Sys. v. Private Diagnostic Clinic, PLLC , 2014 NCBC LEXIS 70, at *47 –48 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 24, 2014); Stec v. Fuzion Inv. Capital, LLC, 2012 NCBC LEXIS \n24, at *18–19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 30, 2012).  The Court denies the motion to dismiss \nas to this counterclaim.  \nB. Fiduciary Claims \n33. Nova Trading asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive \nfraud against Pai Lung.  Though these two causes of action are distinct, “an essential \nelement of each claim is the existence of a fiduciary relationship.”  Azure Dolphin, \nLLC v. Barton, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 90, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 2, 2017).  To state \na claim for breach of fiduciary duty,  Nova Trading must plead the existence of a \nfiduciary duty, a breach of that duty, and injury proximately caused by the breach.  \nSee Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 141, 749 S.E.2d 262, 268 (2013).  Constructive \nfraud requires Nova Trading to plead, in add ition, that Pai Lung sought to benefit \nitself through the breach.  See White v. Consol. Planning, Inc. , 166 N.C. App. 283, \n294, 603 S.E.2d 147, 155–56 (2004). \n34. The basis for these claims is  that Pai Lung, the majority member of \nVanguard, breached a fiduciar y duty that it owed to Nova Trading, the minority \nmember.  (See Countercl. ¶¶ 162, 172.)  Pai Lung argues that there is no fiduciary \nrelationship between Vanguard’s members and also that Nova Trading failed to meet \nthe heightened pleading standard for constructive fraud.  (See Mem. in Supp. 14, 17.)2 \n35. As a general rule, members of an LLC do not owe a fiduciary duty to one \nanother, but in some circumstances, “a holder of a majority interest who exercises \ncontrol over the LLC owes a fiduciary duty to minority interest members.”  Fiske v. \nKieffer, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 22, at *9 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 9, 2016) ; see also Kaplan \nv. O.K. Techs., L.L.C., 196 N.C. App. 469, 473, 675 S.E.2d 133, 137 (2009).  A majority \ninterest does not necessarily equate to control.   It all depends on what the LLC’s \nmembers agree to in the operating agreement.   Because “an LLC is primarily a \ncreature of contract,” the members are generally free to arrange their relationship \nhowever they wish.  Crouse v. Mineo, 189 N.C. App. 232, 237, 658 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2008) \n(quoting Russell M. Robinson, II, Robinson on North Carolina Corporate Law § 34.01, \nat 34 -2 to 34 -3 (rev. 7th ed. 20 06)).  Among other things, they may depart from \nstatutory default rules, require supermajority votes for some or all company matters, \nand impose or eliminate fiduciary duties for members and managers .  See, e.g. , \nClaudio v. Sellers, 2019 N.C. App. LEXIS 288, at *4–5 (N.C. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2019) \n(supermajority requirement); Plasman v. Decca Furniture (USA), Inc. , 2016 NCBC \nLEXIS 80, at *36 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 21, 2016) (elimination of fiduciary duties);  \n                                            \n2 Pai Lung’s opening brief includes the additional, conclusory assertion that, “even if Pai Lung \nowed [a fiduciary] duty, Nova Trading has not alleged sufficient facts demonstrating that Pai \nLung breached that duty.”  (Mem. in Supp. 14.)   This argument is unexplained and \nundeveloped, and the Court rejects it without further discussion. \nIsland Beyond, LLC v. Prime Capital Grp., LLC, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 48, at *15 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Oct. 30, 2013) (statutory default rules).  \n36. This is one of the principal differences between LLC members and corporate \nshareholders.  It has long been the rule that majority shareholders, by virtue of their \nmajority status, hold control over the corporation and therefore owe a duty to protect \nthe interests of minority shareholders , who “can act and contract in relation to the \ncorporate property only through the former.”  Gaines v. Long Mfg. Co., 234 N.C. 340, \n344, 67 S.E.2d 350, 353 (1951)  (citation and quotation marks omitted) .  Minority \nmembers of an LLC have a much stronger position because, through “the freedom of \ncontract,” they are able “to obtain minority protections not available to shareholders \nof [a] closely -held corporation.”  Blythe v. Bell, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 17, at * 14 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. Apr. 8, 2013).  \n37. Nova Trading obtained a number of such protections as part of Vanguard’s \nOperating Agreement.  By way of example, m embers may not take part in the \ncompany’s management in their capacity as members.  (Op. Agrmt. §  4.2.)  Nova \nTrading is guaranteed the right to elect one manager to the board of managers.  (Op. \nAgrmt. § 4.3(b)(i).)  And a supermajority vote of the members is needed to amend the \nOperating Agreement, sell the business, remove a member, or take similarly vital \nactions.  (Op. Agrmt. §  4.4.)  The q uestion is whether, as a matter of law, these \nprotections blocked Pai Lung from exercising control over the LLC.   \n38. The answer is no, at least at this early Rule 12 stage.  Nova Trading alleges \nthat Pai Lung is Vanguard’s majority member with an interest edging just over 67%.  \n(Countercl. ¶ 38.)  It further alleges that Pai Lung dominates the board of managers, \nwhich has broad authority to act on behalf of the company .  (See Op. Agrmt. \n§ 3.1(a)(i)–(x).)  The Operating Agreement gives Pai Lung the right to appoint three \nof the five possible managers, thus ensuring a majority.  (Op. Agrmt. § 4.3(b)(ii).)  And \nPai Lung has filled those seats with its  agents, all of whom are “acting for or on its \nbehalf.”  (Countercl. ¶¶ 43, 44.)   \n39. This type of managerial control is one of the  clearest attributes of a \ncontrolling member of an LLC, just as control over a board of directors is an attribute \nof a controlling corporate shareholder.  See, e.g., Plasman, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 80, at \n*17–18, 25 (concluding that plaintiff sufficiently alleged existence of fiduciary duty \nby 55% majority member with “ultimate decision-making authority”); Kelly v. Blum, \n2010 Del. Ch. LEXIS 31, at *54 (Del. Ch. F eb. 24, 2010) (citing control over board of \nmanagers as factor favoring existence of fiduciary duties for majority member under \nDelaware law); see also Corwin, 371 N.C. at 616 –17, 821 S.E.2d at 737 –38 (noting \nthat, under Delaware law, a controlling stockholder is one who exercises actual \ncontrol over the board).  By contrast, this Court has cited the absence of managerial \ncontrol as a reason supporting dismissal of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty \nbrought by one LLC member against another.  See Strategic Mgmt. Decisions v. Sales \nPerformance Int’l , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 69, at * 13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 7, 2017)  \n(granting motion to dismiss in part because 60% majority member had power to \ndesignate only one of two managers). \n40. Pai Lung insists that no fiduciary duty arises simply because it exercised its \nrights, including the right to appoint a majority of the board,  pursuant to the \nOperating Agreement.  (See Reply Br. 8–9.)  But the cases it cites for that proposition \nare inapposite.  This Court has refused to impose a fiduciary duty on minority \nmembers that exercise their voting rights by joining together to outvote a third \nmember.  See Fiske, 2016 NCBC LEXIS 22, at *9 –10; HCW Ret. & Fin. Servs., LLC \nv. HCW Emp. Benefit Servs., LLC, 2015 NCBC LEXIS 73, at *46–47 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJuly 14, 2015); Wortman v. Hutaff, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 47, at *22–23 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nOct. 29, 2013); BOGNC, LLC v. Cornelius NC Self-Storage, LLC, 2013 NCBC LEXIS \n22, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 1, 2013).   \n41. These decisions underscore the obvious difference between  backing a \nmajority coalition and exercising majority control as of right.  In the latter situation, \nit is the imbalance of power inherent in the  relationship between majority and \nminority member  that gives rise to a fiduciary duty .  Thus, w hen the operating \nagreement confers controlling authority on the majority member , it owes a duty not \nto use its control to harm the minority, assuming no other provision disclaims such a \nduty.  Here, Nova Trading has alleged that Pai Lung is not only the majority member \nbut also that it exercises control through the board of managers, and the Operating \nAgreement does not address, much less disclaim, the duties that Pai Lung might owe \nother members.  This is sufficient to survive a Rule 12 motion.  See Dunn Holdings I, \nInc. v. Confluent Health LLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 89, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 24, \n2018) (holding that plaintiff sufficiently alleged that 80% major ity member was a \ncontrolling member). \n42. To be clear, in permitting the claim to move forward, the Court does not hold \nthat Pai Lung owe d a fiduciary duty to Nova Trading.  Pai Lung’s control is \nconsiderable but not complete.   Neither Pai Lung nor the board could dissolve the \ncompany, declare bankruptcy, or amend the Operating Agreement  without Nova \nTrading’s cooperation.  (See Op. Agrmt. §§ 3.4, 4.4, 8.1, 8.3, 10.1.)  These are serious \nlimitations on Pai Lung’s authority and meaningful protections for Nova T rading’s \nminority interest, which could weigh against the existence of a fiduciary relationship \nin the context of a more developed evidentiary record. \n43. At this stage, the facts stated in the amended counterclaims, along with the \nprovisions of the Operating Agreement, suffice to allege the existence of a fiduciary \nrelationship.  The Court therefore denies the  motion to dismiss as to the claim for \nbreach of fiduciary duty.  \n44. Pai Lung also argues that the claim for constructive fraud  should be \ndismissed because Nova Trading has not pleaded it with sufficient particularity.  Our \nappellate courts have made clear that a claim of constructive fraud need not comply \nwith the particularity requirements of Rule 9 as  claims of actual fraud must.  See \nTerry v. Terry, 302 N.C. 77, 85, 273 S.E.2d 674, 678–79 (1981).  Rather, the amended \ncounterclaims must allege “facts and circumstances ‘(1) which created the relation of \ntrust and confidence, and (2) which led up to and surrounded the consummation of \nthe transaction in which [the non-moving party] is alleged to have taken advantage \nof his position of trust to the hurt of’” the movant.  Id. at 85, 273 S.E.2d at 679 (quoting \nRhodes v. Jones, 232 N.C. 547, 549, 61 S.E.2d 725, 726 (1950)) (alterations omitted).  \n45. Nova Trading has satisfied this standard.  It has alleged  a fiduciary duty \nbased on Pai Lung’s status as a controlling majority member of Vanguard.  It has \nfurther alleged that Pai Lung schemed to gain exclusive control over Vanguard.  (See \nCountercl. ¶¶ 45–53, 65, 71, 115, 167–69, 171–75.)  The amended counterclaim goes \nbeyond mere “cursory allegations” and demonstrates the “facts and circumstances” \ngiving rise to the claim.  Hunter v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 162 N.C. App. 477, \n482, 593 S.E.2d 595, 599 (2004); see also Global Textile All., Inc. v. TDI Worldwide , \nLLC, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 159, at *23 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 29, 2018).   \n46. The Court denies the motion to dismiss the claim for constructive fraud.  \nC. Judicial Dissolution \n47. Nova Trading asserts two claims for judicial dissolution of Vanguard .  By \nstatute, a member of an LLC may seek judicial dissolution when “it is not practicable \nto conduct the LLC’s business in conformance with the operating agreement” or when \n“liquidation of the LLC is necessary to protect t he rights and interests of the \nmember.”  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 57D-6-02(2).  Nova Trading invokes the statutory remedy \non both grounds.  It also asserts, separately, that dissolution is appropriate based on \nthe rule set forth in Meiselman v. Meiselman, which permits minority shareholders \nin closely held corporations to seek liquidation when their reasonable expectations \nhave been frustrated.  See 309 N.C. 279, 307 S.E.2d 551 (1983).   \n48. Vanguard and Pai Lung argue that the claim s fail because Nova Trading \nhas not alleged that it is impracticable to operate the business or that liquidation is \nnecessary to protect Nova Trading’s interests .  They contend that the various \nmanagement disagreements set out in the amended counterclaims s how only that \nNova Trading is “unhappy with the terms of the Operating Agreement.”  (Mem. in \nSupp. 18.) \n49. The Court concludes that Nova Trading has adequately stated a claim under \nsection 57D-6-02(2).  As discussed, Nova Trading has alleged that Pai Lung breached \nits fiduciary duty as part of a scheme to take exclusive control of Vanguard .  If true, \nthese improprieties could support a claim that dissolution is necessary to protect \nNova Trading’s interests.  See, e.g., Dunn Holdings I, 2018 NCBC LEXIS 89, at *31–\n32.  Accordingly, the Court denies the motion to dismiss the claim for judicial \ndissolution under section 57D-6-02(2). \n50. Likewise, the Court denies the motion to dismiss the Meiselman claim.    \n“[O]ur courts have not yet decided whether and to what extent  the principles of \nMeiselman apply to actions ” to dissolve  an LLC .  Bennett v. Bennett , 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 19, at *35 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 15, 2019); see also  Pure Body Studios \nCharlotte, LLC v. Crnalic , 2017 NCBC LEXIS 98, at *13 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 18, \n2017); Brady v. Van Vlaanderen, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 61, at *31 –32 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJuly 19, 2017).  Such questions should be addressed on a more fully developed record.  \nParticularly given that the section 57D -6-02(2) claim is moving forward, it  would be \npremature to dismiss the Meiselman claim. \n51. Finally, it bears noting that it is not clear whether an LLC member may \nbring a freestanding Meiselman claim, as Nova Trading has here.  There is a \nreasonable argument that the legislature intended section 57D -6-02(2) to be the \nexclusive avenue for LLC members to seek judicial dissolution, though the \napplication of section 57D-6-02(2) may be informed by Meiselman principles.  Neither \nside addressed this issue, however, so the Court leaves it for another day. \nIII. \nCONCLUSION \n \n52. For all these reasons, the Court DENIES Vanguard and Pai Lung’s partial \nmotion to dismiss.  \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 19th day of June, 2019. \n /s/ Adam M. Conrad    \nAdam M.
