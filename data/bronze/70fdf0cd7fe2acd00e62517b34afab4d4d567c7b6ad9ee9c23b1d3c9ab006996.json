For the reasons stated below, the Motions are \nGRANTED. \nShumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP by Frederick M. Thurman, Jr. for Plaintiff. \nRobinson Bradshaw & Hinson, P.A. by Fitz E. Barringer, Heyward H. \nBouknight, III, and Kindl Detar for Defendant Medflow, Inc. \nMoore & Van Allen PLLC by Benjamin P. Fryer and Nader S. Raja for \nDefendant Dominic James Riggi. \nGale, Chief Judge. \nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n{2} Plaintiff initiated this action on  September 11, 2014, bringing claims \nfor breach of contract, fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices (“UDTP”), and \nunjust enrichment, based on a contract entered on October 20, 1999.  The matter \nwas designated a mandatory complex business case and assigned to the \nundersigned on October 27, 2014. \nChristenbury Eye Ctr., P.A. v. Medflow, Inc., 2015 NCBC 61. \n \n \n{3} Defendant Dominic James Riggi (“Riggi”) filed his motion on November \n21, 2014, moving pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss all claims.  Defendant \nMedflow, Inc. (“Medflow”) also filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion on December 1, 2014.  \nThe Motions have been fully briefed and are ripe for disposition. \nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n{4} The following facts are based on  the allegations of the Verified \nComplaint and are accepted as true for purposes of the Motions. \n{5} Plaintiff Christenbury Eye Center, P.A. (“Christenbury”) is a \nprofessional association located in Charlotte, North Carolina that offers \nophthalmology and ophthalmic services.  Dr. Jonathan D. Christenbury (“Dr. \nChristenbury”) founded Christenbury. \n{6} In 1998 or 1999, Dr. Christenbury approached Riggi about finding or \ndeveloping a software package to help Dr. Christenbury and other ophthalmologists \nmanage their practice and maintain their records.   \n{7} Around the same time, Riggi formed Medflow, which retained a \nsoftware engineer to customize and enhance a general medical records management \nsoftware platform.  Dr. Christenbury paid Medflow in excess of $200,000 to prepare \na software package.   \n{8} On October 20, 1999, Christenbury and Medflow entered into an \nAgreement Regarding Enhancements (“Agreement”).  (Verified Compl. ¶ 15, Ex. A.)  \nThe “Enhancements” are improvements to the original software platform, including \n“customized screens, interfaces, forms, [and] procedures.”  (Verified Compl. Ex. A.)  \nChristenbury assigned its rights in the platform and Enhancements to Medflow and \nretained rights to use and display the platform and Enhancements.  Christenbury \ndid not retain a right to sublicense or distribute the platform or Enhancements.  \nMedflow was prohibited from selling the platform or Enhancements in North \nCarolina or South Carolina without Christenbury’s written consent.  Medflow was \nobligated to pay Christenbury a ten percent royalty for all fees received in \nassociation with the Enhancements’ resale or provision, with a minimum yearly \n \n \nroyalty of $500 for each of the five years after October 20, 1999.   Medflow was to \n“provide Christenbury with a written report on a monthly basis which will include a \ndetailed description of the fees received from [Medflow’s] Customers during the \nprior month, along with payment to Christenbury of all corresponding fees due with \nrespect to such charges for that prior month.”  (Verified Compl. Ex. A.)  Riggi signed \nthe Agreement on behalf of Medflow and an acknowledgment binding him to the \nAgreement’s terms in his individual capacity.  \n{9} Medflow never provided Christenbury with the required written report \nand never paid any royalties to Christenbury. \n{10} In February 2001, Medflow inform ed Christenbury of modifications \nmade to the original software and requested that the Agreement be modified, \nstating, “As you may know, MedFlow has developed a new Refractive Surgery \nManagement Software and wants to install that at Dr. Christenbury’s office.  This \nnew version contains several new components not contained in the original \nMedFlow Refractive Surgery software and many improvements over the original \npackage.”  (Verified Compl. ¶ 16.)  The parties did not ultimately amend the \nAgreement.  Christenbury continued to use the original platform.  Medflow sold the \nnewer version without reporting sales or paying royalties to Christenbury. \n{11} In 2002, an article concerning el ectronic medical records appeared in \nthe publication, Opthalmology Management.  Riggi was interviewed for the article, \nwhich stated that Medflow “created and customizes the EMR in use at Christenbury \nEye Center and at Beach Eye Care.”  (Verified Compl. ¶ 18.)   \n{12} Christenbury received updates to and services for the original platform \n“[f]rom time to time after the execution of the Agreement” from service providers \ndirectly associated with Medflow.  (Verified Compl. ¶¶ 22, 23.)  In 2011, Medflow’s \nservice provider refused to provide Christenbury an update, stating that it no longer \nsupported Christenbury’s platform.  Shortly thereafter, the service provider’s agent \ndemonstrated Medflow’s newer product for Dr. Christenbury.  \n{13} Plaintiff alleges that, “[u]pon information and belief, since October \n1999, Medflow has further developed, modified, and sold the Enhancements, and \n \n \nderivatives thereof, to other ophthalmologic practices, both inside and outside the \nrestricted territory of North Carolina and South Carolina, without paying royalties \nto the Practice.”  (Verified Compl. ¶ 28.)   The Verified Complaint does not clearly \nindicate when Plaintiff discovered the facts on which this allegation is based. \nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n{14} On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court inquires \n“whether, as a matter of law, the allegations of the complaint, treated as true, are \nsufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under some legal \ntheory, whether properly labeled or not.”  Crouse v. Mineo, 189 N.C. App. 232, 237, \n658 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2008) (quoting Harris v. NCNB Nat’l Bank of N.C., 85 N.C. App. \n669, 670, 355 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1987)).  The Court may grant a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) where one of the following is true: (1) the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face \nreveals the absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint \ndiscloses some fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.  Oates v. JAG, Inc., \n314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985). \n{15} For purposes of the Motions, th e Court accepts the factual allegations \nof the Verified Complaint as true without assuming the veracity of Plaintiff’s legal \nconclusions.  Walker v. Sloan, 137 N.C. App. 387, 392, 592 S.E.2d 236, 241 (2000).   \nIV. ANALYSIS \n{16} Plaintiff claims that it is entitled to recover for breach of contract, \nfraudulent concealment, UDTP, and unjust enrichment.  The Court addresses the \nclaims in that order, finding that each should be dismissed. \nA. Breach of Contract Claim \n{17} Plaintiff has clearly pled that there was a contract that Defendants \nbreached.  The question is whether that claim is time-barred.  North Carolina \nimposes a three-year statute of limitations for breach of contract claims.  N.C. Gen. \n \n \nStat. § 1-52(1) (2014).  “[A]s soon as the injury becomes apparent to the claimant or \nshould reasonably become apparent, the cause of action is complete and the \nlimitation period begins to run.  It does not matter that further damage could occur; \nsuch further damage is only an aggravation of the original injury.”  Liptrap v. City \nof High Point, 128 N.C. App. 353, 355, 496 S.E.2d 817, 819 (1998) (quoting Pembee \nMfg. Corp. v. Cape Fear Const. Co., 313 N.C. 488, 493, 329 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1985)).  \nDefendants contend that Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim accrued when \nDefendants first failed to make reports or make royalty payments, so that the claim \nis outside the limitations period.   Plaintiff claims that any limitations period was \ntolled by Defendants’ fraudulent concealment.  Alternatively, Plaintiff claims that it \nis entitled, at a minimum, to royalty payments due within the three years prior to \nthe filing of the Verified Complaint.  Defendants counter that all claims have been \nwaived.   \ni. Statute of Limitations \n{18} Typically, a contract claim begins  to accrue when the breach occurs.  \nPharmaResearch Corp. v. Mash, 163 N.C. App. 419, 424, 594 S.E.2d 148, 152 \n(2004).  Occasionally, “equity will deny the right to assert [a statute of limitations] \ndefense when delay has been induced by acts, representations, or conduct, the \nrepudiation of which would amount to a breach of good faith.”  Watkins v. Cent. \nMotor Lines, Inc., 279 N.C. 132, 139–40, 181 S.E.2d 588, 593 (1971) (quoting Nowell \nv. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 250 N.C. 575, 579, 108 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1959)).  This \nresults from application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, which “arises when an \nindividual by his acts, representations, admissions or silence, when he has a duty to \nspeak, intentionally or through culpable negligence,” induces another to believe in \nand rely upon the existence of certain facts to his detriment.  Miller v. Talton, 112 \nN.C. App. 484, 488, 435 S.E.2d 793, 797 (1993).  To take advantage of equitable \nestoppel, a party asserting an otherwise stale claim must specifically allege: “(1) \nconduct on the part of the party sought to be estopped which amounts to a false \nrepresentation or concealment of material facts; (2) the intention that such conduct \n \n \nwill be acted on by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the \nreal facts.”  Robinson v. Bridgestone/Firestone N.A. Tire, LLC, 209 N.C. App. 310, \n319, 703 S.E.2d 883, 889 (2011) (quoting Bryant v. Adams, 116 N.C. App. 448, 460, \n448 S.E.2d 832, 838 (1994)).  The party asserting the claim must plead the \nnecessary facts with particularity and demonstrate that the defendant’s \nrepresentations delayed it from filing suit.  Duke Univ. v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., \n95 N.C. App. 663, 673, 384 S.E.2d 26, 42 (1989); see also N.C. R. Civ. P. 8(c).  \nAdditionally, the claimant must show that it lacked knowledge, did not have the \nmeans of ascertaining the real facts, and rightfully relied on the opposing party’s \nconduct to its detriment.  Duke Univ., 95 N.C. App. at 673, 384 S.E.2d at 42; \nJohnson Neurological Clinic, Inc. v. Kirkman, 121 N.C. App. 326, 332, 465 S.E.2d \n32, 35 (1996).  “A party cannot rely on equitable estoppel if it ‘was put on inquiry as \nto the truth and had available the means for ascertaining it.’”  Wade S. Dunbar Ins. \nAgency, Inc. v. Barber, 147 N.C. App. 463, 470, 556 S.E.2d 331, 336 (2001) (quoting \nHawkins v. M. & J. Fin. Corp., 238 N.C. 174, 179, 77 S.E.2d 669, 673 (1953)). \n{19} Here, the allegations on the face of the Verified Complaint reveal that \nMedflow did not perform its reporting and payment obligations at least as early as \nOctober 20, 2000, when the first minimum royalty payment was due and \nsubstantially more than three years prior to when the Verified Complaint was filed.  \nThose allegations would then demonstrate that the claim for any payment is time-\nbarred unless the Agreement is considered an installment contract, with a new \nclaim accruing and a new limitations period beginning upon the failure to make \neach payment. \n{20} “Generally, where obligations are payable in installments, the statute \nof limitations runs against each installment independently as it becomes due.”  \nMartin v. Ray Lackey Enters., Inc., 100 N.C. App. 349, 357, 396 S.E.2d 327, 332 \n(1990).  This principle has been applied to annual tax obligations arising out of a \ncontract, lease payments, a computer system service contract, and improper \novercharges for workers’ compensation insurance.  See id.; U.S. Leasing Corp. v. \nEverett, Creech, Hancock & Herzig, 88 N.C. App. 418, 363 S.E.2d 665 (1988); \n \n \nNorthside Pharm., Inc. v. Owens & Minor, Inc., No. 88-3059, 1990 N.C. App. LEXIS \n2457 (4th Cir. Feb. 21, 1990); Jacobs v. Cent. Transp., Inc., 891 F. Supp. 1120, \n1124–25 (E.D.N.C. 1995).  \n{21} Defendants assert that the Agr eement should not be considered an \ninstallment contract because of how an “installment contract” is defined by North \nCarolina’s version of the Uniform Commercial Code.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 25-2-612(1) \n(2014) (“An ‘installment contract’ is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of \ngoods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a \nclause ‘each delivery is a separate contract’ or its equivalent.”).  However, \nauthorities have treated agreements falling outside of this definition as installment \ncontracts for statute of limitations purposes.  See, e.g., Ray Lackey Enters., 100 \nN.C. App. 349, 396 S.E.2d 327; Northside Pharm., Inc. v. Owens & Minor, Inc., No. \n88-3059, 1990 N.C. App. LEXIS 2457 (extending the principle to computer servicing \ncontract). \n{22} Arguably, if the Agreement is an “installment contract,” Plaintiff \nwould have an action for payments and reporting obligations due after September \n11, 2011.  However, the Court need not address this issue because the facts \ndisclosed on the face of the Verified Complaint demonstrate either that Plaintiff \nwaived its rights under the Agreement by its consistent failure to enforce it or that \nDefendants clearly repudiated their obligations to report and make royalty \npayments pursuant to the Agreement.  \nii. Waiver and Repudiation \n{23} “The essential elements of waiver are (1) the existence, at the time of \nthe alleged waiver, of a right, advantage or benefit; (2) the knowledge, actual or \nconstructive, of the existence thereof; and (3) an intention to relinquish such right, \nadvantage or benefit.”  Demeritt v. Springsteed, 204 N.C. App 325, 328–29, 693 \nS.E.2d 719, 721 (2010) (quoting Fetner v. Granite Works, 251 N.C. 296, 302, 111 \nS.E.2d 324, 328 (1959)).  “The intention to waive may be expressed or implied from \nacts or conduct that naturally lead the other party to believe that the right has been \n \n \nintentionally given up.”  Klein v. Avemco Ins. Co., 289 N.C. 63, 68, 220 S.E.2d 595, \n599 (1975) quoted in Demeritt, 204 N.C. App. at 329, 693 S.E.2d at 721.  An \nindividual may express an intention to relinquish a contractual right when he “does \nor forbears to do something inconsistent with the existence of the right or of his \nintention to rely upon that right.”  Hardin v. Liverpool & London & Globe Ins. Co., \n189 N.C. 423, 127 S.E. 353, 354 (1925).   This may include, for example, a failure to \ninsist on closing on a contract that has a “time is of the essence” clause.  Phoenix \nLtd. P’ship of Raleigh v. Simpson, 201 N.C. App. 493, 501–02, 688 S.E.2d 717, 723 \n(2009).   \n{24} Christenbury was on notice of its rights to receive written reports and \nminimum annual royalty payments, but it neither complained of nor insisted on \neither, even though it had the right and opportunity to do so when Riggi requested \ncontractual amendments in 2001, at which time Christenbury had received no \nreport and no minimum royalty payments.  Throughout the period, Christenbury \ncontinued to affirm the Agreement by using and updating the software installed \npursuant to it.   \n{25} The Court finds that the facts di sclosed on the face of the Verified \nComplaint demonstrate that, by declining to take action in regard to Defendants’ \nfailure to submit reports or make royalty payments, Christenbury waived any right \nto future payments to the extent that the Agreement could appropriately be \nconsidered an installment contract.  Alternatively, if Christenbury did not waive its \nrights, Defendants clearly repudiated the contract by their consistent and repeated \nfailure to perform, placing Plaintiff on notice that future reports and payments \nwould not be made. \n{26} A breach of contract may occur by  repudiation, which is “a positive \nstatement by one party to the other party indicating that he will not or cannot \nsubstantially perform his contractual duties.”  \nProfile Invs. No. 25, LLC v. Ammons \nE. Corp., 207 N.C. App. 232, 236, 700 S.E.2d 232, 235 (2010) (quoting Millis Constr. \nCo. v. Fairfield Saphhire Valley, 86 N.C. App. 506, 510, 358 S.E.2d 566, 569 (1987)).  \nTo result in a breach of contract, “the refusal to perform must be of the whole \n \n \ncontract or of a covenant going to the whole consideration, and must be distinct, \nunequivocal, and absolute.”  Profile Invs., 207 N.C. App. at 237, 700 S.E.2d at 235 \n(quoting Edwards v. Proctor, 137 N.C. 41, 44, 91 S.E. 584, 585 (1917)).  Even a \ndistinct, unequivocal, and absolute refusal is not a breach unless the adverse party \ntreats it as such.  \nId.  Where an individual repudiates his obligations under a \ncontract by clear or unequivocal acts and the adverse party is on notice of the \nrepudiation “in such manner that he is called upon to assert his rights,” the statute \nof limitations begins to run from the time the adverse party learned of the \nrepudiation.  Teachey v. Gurley, 214 N.C. 288, 199 S.E. 83, 87 (1938). \n{27} Here, Defendants clearly repudiated  their obligations to report and to \npay royalties under the Agreement.  They advised Christenbury of their intent to \nmarket a newer product.  They requested an amendment to the Agreement that \nChristenbury refused.  Christenbury was on notice of this repudiation shortly after \nOctober 20, 2000, when the first minimum royalty payment was due.  Having failed \nto assert its rights pursuant to the Agreement for approximately fourteen years, a \nbreach of contract claim is now time-barred.\n \n {28} The Court further finds that the a llegations on the face of the Verified \nComplaint demonstrate that Plaintiff cannot defeat the application of the statute of \nlimitations by invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  Plaintiff did not \nrightfully rely on Defendants’ conduct to forebear from filing suit, as the Agreement, \nat a minimum, gave rise to annual royalty obligations that were never paid.   \nB. Fraudulent Concealment Claim \n {29} Fraudulent concealment is a form of misrepresentation entitling a \nclaimant to damages or rescission of a contract.  Friedland v. Gales, 131 N.C. App. \n802, 807, 509 S.E.2d 793, 797 (1998).  The elements of fraudulent concealment are \n(1) concealment of a “[past or existing] material fact, (2) reasonably calculated to \ndeceive, (3) made with intent to deceive, (4) which does in fact deceive, (5) resulting \nin damage to the injured party.”  \nHardin v. KCS Int’l., Inc. 199 N.C. App. 687, 696, \n682 S.E.2d 726, 733 (2009) (alteration in original).  Where the misrepresentation \n \n \nclaim is based on a failure to disclose a material fact, the plaintiff must show the \ndefendant owed him a duty to disclose, “as silence is fraudulent only when there is a \nduty to speak.”  Lawrence v. UMLIC-Five Corp., 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *8 (N.C. \nSuper. Ct. June 18, 2007). \n{30} This Court has previously ruled th at to specifically plead an omission-\nbased claim, a litigant must allege \n(1) the relationship between plaintiff and defendant giving rise to the \nduty to speak; (2) the event that triggered the duty to speak or the \ngeneral time period over which the relationship arose and the fraud \noccurred; (3) the general content of the information that was withheld \nand the reason for its materiality; (4) the identity of those under a duty \nwho failed to make such disclosures; (5) what the defendant gained \nfrom withholding the information; (6) why the plaintiff’s reliance on \nthe omission was reasonable and detrimental; and (7) the damages the \nfraud caused the plaintiff. \nIsland Beyond, LLC v. Prime Capital Grp., LLC, 2013 NCBC LEXIS 48, at *19 \n(N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 30, 2013) (quotations and alterations omitted) (citing \nLawrence, 2007 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *9 (adopting requirements set out in Breeden \nv. Richmond Cmty. Coll., 171 F.R.D. 189, 195 (M.D.N.C. 1997))). \n{31} In order to impose a duty to disclose, a plaintiff must demonstrate \neither that: (1) there is a fiduciary relationship between the parties to the \ntransaction; (2) “a party has taken affirmative steps to conceal material facts from \nthe other;” or (3) “one party has knowledge of a latent defect in the subject matter of \nthe negotiations about which the other party is both ignorant and unable to discover \nthrough reasonable diligence.”  \nHarton v. Harton, 81 N.C. App. 295, 297, 298, 344 \nS.E.2d 117, 119 (1986). \n{32} Plaintiff contends that Defendants had a duty to speak because \nChristenbury “did not have an equal ability to ascertain that Medflow had further \ndeveloped, modified and sold the Enhancements, and derivatives thereof, and \nreceived fees therefrom – all information [was] uniquely within the knowledge of \nMr. Riggi and Medflow.”  (Verified Compl. ¶ 38.)  Christenbury further argues that \na duty to speak can arise from contract, citing Oberlin Capital.  147 N.C. App. at 59, \n \n \n554 S.E.2d at 846 (“A person’s obligation or duty to act may flow from explicit \nrequirements, i.e. [sic], statutory or contractual, or may be implied from attendant \ncircumstances.” (internal quotation and citation omitted)).  But here, if there was a \nduty to speak imposed by contract, it was clear to Christenbury that the duty had \nbeen breached when the first report and minimum payment was due. \n{33} The Court then need not decide whether the Agreement imposed a \nduty to speak, as the failure to adhere to any such duty was clear to Christenbury \noutside the limitations period.   \n{34} Further, the Verified Complaint contains no allegations supporting \nany potential finding that Defendants made representations to induce Christenbury \nnot to assert rights under the Agreement or on which Christenbury relied when \nrefraining from taking action.  “[W]hen the party relying on the false or misleading \nrepresentation could have discovered the truth upon inquiry, the complaint must \nallege that he was denied the opportunity to investigate or that he could not have \nlearned the true facts by exercise of reasonable diligence.”  Id. at 60, 554 S.E.2d at \n847 (quoting Hudson-Cole Dev. Corp. v. Beemer, 132 N.C. App. 341, 346, 511 S.E. \n2d 309, 313 (1998)). \n{35} Seeking to satisfy this requirem ent, Christenbury contends that the \nrelevant information was “uniquely within the knowledge of Mr. Riggi and \nMedflow” (Verified Compl. ¶ 38), supporting the conclusion that Christenbury did \nnot have the ability to discover the truth, excusing any further requirement to \ninvestigate, to allege that it was denied an opportunity to investigate, or to allege \nthat reasonable diligence would not have revealed the true facts.  Essentially, the \nargument is that Defendants’ failure to make royalty payments was equivalent to a \nrepresentation that no sales had been made.  However, that argument is defeated \nby the fact that the Agreement required a report and minimum annual royalty \npayments whether or not sales had occurred.  Moreover, Plaintiff took no action \nupon Defendants’ failure to make a report or to pay minimum royalties.  These facts \ndo not excuse Christenbury’s failure to make an inquiry merely because Defendants \nmight have additional information that was uniquely within their knowledge.  \n \n \n{36} The Court need not rely on the fact that the information concerning \nactual sales of the platform and Enhancements was published in a May 2002 \nOphthalmology Management article.  (Verified Compl. ¶ 18.)  Indeed, Christenbury \nindicated that it had no knowledge of this article at the time it was published.  The \narticle’s existence would, however, suggest that there was independent public \ninformation available to Christenbury had it chosen to make an inquiry when it did \nnot receive reports or royalty payments pursuant to the Agreement.  The \npublication of at least some of this information also undermines Plaintiff’s \nallegation that it was “uniquely within the knowledge of Mr. Riggi and Medflow.”  \n(Verified Compl. ¶ 38.) \n{37}  In sum, the Verified Complaint fails to state a claim for fraudulent \nconcealment.  Eastway Wrecker Serv. v. City of Charlotte, 165 N.C. App. 639, 645, \n599 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2004) (“If the complaint fails to allege that the plaintiff was \ndenied the opportunity to investigate or that the plaintiff could not have learned the \ntrue facts by exercise of reasonable diligence, the complaint fails to state causes of \naction for fraudulent concealment and negligent misrepresentation.”) (internal \nquotation and alteration marks omitted). \n{38} Even if the Verified Complaint were  adequate to state a claim, it would \nbe time-barred.  The statute of limitations governing a fraud claim is three years \nand begins to run from the time the claimant should have discovered the facts \nconstituting the fraud.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52(9).   Plaintiff was on inquiry notice by \nno later than November 2000 that Defendants were not performing any of their \nobligations under the Agreement.   \nC. UDTP Claim \n {39} Christenbury reiterates its brea ch of contract claim and fraudulent \nconcealment claim as a UDTP claim.  The Verified Complaint demonstrates no \naggravating circumstances adequate to raise the breach of contract claim to a \nUDTP violation.  \nSee Gray v. N.C. Ins. Underwriting Ass’n, 352 N.C. 61, 75, 529 \nS.E.2d 676, 685 (2000) (noting that a party must show “substantial aggravating \n \n \ncircumstances attendant to the breach”) (citing Branch Banking & Trust, 107 N.C. \nApp. at 62, 418 S.E.2d at 700 (1992) (“[A] mere breach of contract, even if \nintentional, is not sufficiently unfair or deceptive to sustain [a UDTP action].”))).  \n {40} Further, any UDTP claim is also  time-barred by the four-year statute \nof limitations governing such claims.  N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-16.2 (2014).  The \nlimitations period for UDTP claims based on fraud and contract accrue when the \nclaimant had notice of the breach or fraud.  Pembee Mfg. Corp., 313 N.C. at 493 \nS.E.2d at 354 (holding UDTP claim based on breach of contract accrues when \nclaimant “becomes aware or should reasonably have become aware of the existence \nof the injury”); Nash v. Motorola Comm’cns & Elecs., Inc., 96 N.C. App. 329, 331, \n385 S.E.2d 537, 538 (1989) (holding UDTP claims based on fraud accrue “at the \ntime the fraud is discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of \nreasonable diligence.”). \n{41} As discussed above, Plaintiff shou ld have reasonably become aware of \nthe existence of its injury or the alleged misrepresentation shortly after October 20, \n2000, when the first minimum royalty payment was due.  Plaintiff did not file suit \nuntil almost fourteen years later.  Accordingly, the UDTP claim is time-barred. \nD. Unjust Enrichment \n{42} Where a party has entered into an express contract concerning the \nsubject matter of the dispute, the party is precluded from equitable recovery in \nquantum meruit.  Ron Medlin Constr. v. Harris, 364 N.C. 577, 585–86, 704 S.E.2d \n486, 492 (2010).   Here, Plaintiff’s own allegations demonstrate that the claim arises \nfrom an express contract concerning the platform and Enhancements.  (Verified \nCompl. ¶ 31).  Further, this claim, even if otherwise valid, is likely time-barred for \nthe same reason the statute of limitations has run on the breach of contract claim. \nSee N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52(1). \n \n \n \n \n \n \nV. CONCLUSION \n{43} For the foregoing reasons, the Moti ons are granted.  Plaintiff’s Verified \nComplaint is DISMISSED. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED this the 19th day of June, 2015. \n \n \n \n /s/ James L. Gale \n James L.
