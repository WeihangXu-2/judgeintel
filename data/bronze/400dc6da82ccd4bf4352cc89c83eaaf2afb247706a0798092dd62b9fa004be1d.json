Hinshaw, 2015 NCBC 27.\n \n{2} THE COURT, having considered the parties’ Motions, briefs in support of \nand in opposition to the Motions, the evidence of record, and the arguments of counsel \nmade at the December 15, 2014 hear ing held in this matter, hereby GRANTS the \nHinshaws’ Motion to Disqualify and DENIES Kingsdown’s Motion to Strike. \nTuggle Duggins P.A. by Denis E. Jacobso n, Jeffrey S. Southerland, and Alan \nB. Felts for Plaintiff Kingsdown, Inc. \n \nSmith Moore Leatherwood LLP by Robert R. Marcus, Heather C. White, Whit \nD. Pierce, and Richard A. Coughlin for Defendants W. Eric Hinshaw and \nRebecca Hinshaw. \n \n \nWilliam C. Ray for Defendant Anne Ray. \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \nI. \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{3} Kingsdown commenced this action ag ainst the Hinshaws  and Defendant \nAnne Ray (“Ms. Ray”) on August 29, 2014 and subsequently filed an Amended \nComplaint on September 2, 2014, genera lly alleging that while serving as \nKingsdown’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chairman of the Board of Directors \n(the “Board”), Mr. Hinshaw breached his “duty to act in good faith and in the best \ninterests of Kingsdown” by “repeatedly engag[ing] in self-dealing . . . and . . . abus[ing] \nhis position as a fiduciary,” which “resulted in substantial benefits for himself, [Ms.] \nHinshaw, and Ms. Ray at the expense of Kingsdown.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6–7.) \n{4} Specific to the Motions at issue, Kingsdown alleges that (i) Mr. Hinshaw and \nMs. Ray authorized non-business expenses  for each other and Ms. Hinshaw for \nreimbursement by Kingsdown (Am. Compl. ¶ 10); (ii) Mr. Hinshaw leased his \nundeveloped Ocean Isle Beach property (“Beach Property”) to Kingsdown for \napproximately 15 years and then directed Kingsdown to build a luxurious single-\nfamily home on the property, furnish and clean the property, pay monthly rent, \ninsurance, taxes, and upkeep on the property, all without the Board’s knowledge or \napproval – and the lease allowed Mr. Hins haw to keep all improvements, including \nthe house, on the Beach Property when the lease terminated (the “Beach House \n \nTransaction”) (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13–20); (iii)  Mr. Hinshaw enacted a compensation \nprogram that allowed him to receive exce ssive compensation without the knowledge \nor approval of the Board (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 21–27); and (iv) Mr. Hinshaw directed \nKingsdown to pay his and his wife’s personal travel expenses and personal employees’ \nsalaries (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28–30). \n{5} On October 17, 2014, the Hinshaws responded to Kingsdown’s Amended \nComplaint by filing an Answer with various defenses and two counterclaims, and at \nthe same time filed their Motion to Disqualify along with Mr. Hinshaw’s first \nsupporting affidavit (“First Hinshaw Affi davit”), contending that Tuggle Duggins \nshould be disqualified from representing Kingsdown in this matter by operation of \nNorth Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct 1.9 (“Rule 1.9”) and 1.13 (“Rule 1.13”), \nand because Tuggle Duggins advised Mr. Hi nshaw on the central issues of this \nlawsuit. \n{6} On November 21, 2014, Kingsdown filed a Response Brief in Opposition to \nthe Motion to Disqualify, along with the supporting affidavits of Firm attorneys \nJeffrey Southerland (“Southerland Affi davit”), Denis E. Jacobson (“Jacobson \nAffidavit”), Alan B. Felts (“Felts Affidavi t”), Bradley L. Jacobs (“Jacobs Affidavit”), \nand Kenneth M. Johnson\n2  (“Johnson Affidavit”), essentially arguing that Tuggle \nDuggins’ representation of Kingsdown against the Hinshaws is specifically permitted \nunder North Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct 1.9 and 1.10 (“Rule 1.10”).   \n{7} On December 10, 2014, the Hinshaws filed a Reply Brief in Support of their \nMotion to Disqualify along with Mr. Hinshaw’s second supporting affidavit (“Second \nHinshaw Affidavit”). \n{8} On December 12, 2014, Kingsdown file d a Motion to Strike the Second \nHinshaw Affidavit.  On December 14, 2014, the Hinshaws responded to Kingsdown’s \nMotion to Strike.  On December 15, 2014, Kingsdown submitted William G. Burgin, \nIII’s first affidavit (“First Burgin Affidavit”) in opposition to the Hinshaws’ Motion to \nDisqualify. \n                                                 \n2 Mr. Johnson was a member of the Firm at the time he provided his affidavit. He is no longer an \nattorney at the Firm. (March 12, 2015 Southerland Aff. ¶ 3). \n \n{9} Also, on December 15, 2014, the Cour t held a hearing on the Hinshaws’ \nMotion to Disqualify.  At the hearing, the Court granted Kingsdown leave of court to \nfile one or more additional affidavits in support of its position opposing the Firm’s \ndisqualification in light of the Decemb er 10, 2014 filing of the Second Hinshaw \nAffidavit. \n{10} On December 19, 2014, Kingsdown filed four additional affidavits.  The \naffiants were Kingsdown Director Fairfa x Reynolds, Kingsdown’s special advisor \nJames M. Mann, and Firm attorneys Wayne Tumlin (“Tumlin Affidavit”) and William \nG. Burgin, III (“Second Burgin Affidavit”).3 \n{11} The time for additional submissions and arguments has now expired and \nthe Motions are ripe for resolution. \nII. \nBACKGROUND \n{12} The Court limits its recitation of the background to the facts and allegations \nthat are relevant for purposes of resolving the present Motion. \n{13} Tuggle Duggins has served as Kingsd own’s corporate counsel since 1987, \nrepresenting the company on all legal matters except for patents and trademarks.  \n(First Hinshaw Aff.  ¶ 5; see Southerland Aff. ¶ 7.)  Mr. Hinshaw served as \nKingsdown’s CEO, President, and/or Chai rman of the Board from 1981 until his \nretirement in August 2012.  (First Hinsha w Aff. ¶ 2.)  During the period of his \ninvolvement with Kingsdown, Mr. Hinshaw was also represented by Tuggle Duggins \non a number of personal matters.  According to the Hinshaws, those attorneys, some \n                                                 \n3 Kingsdown has filed a Motion to Strike the Seco nd Hinshaw Affidavit, contending that the Court \nshould not consider the filing because it was not submitted in compliance with N.C. R. Civ. P. 6(d) \n(“Rule 6(d)”), and because it contains Kingsdown’s privileged information.  First, the Court concludes \nthat Plaintiff’s violation of Rule 6(d) does not prejudice Kingsdown because the Court permitted \nKingsdown to tender four additional affidavits in rebuttal.  Rockingham Square Shopping Center, Inc. \nv. Integon Life Ins. Corp., 52 N.C. App. 633, 641, 279 S.E.2d 918, 924(1981) (Rules “6(b) and (d) give[] \nthe trial court discretion to allow the late fi ling of affidavits”).  Second, as explained infra, the Court \nconcludes that the Hinshaws had an attorney-clien t relationship with Tuggle Duggins and therefore \nhad the right to waive the attorney-client privilege and submit statements revealing the details of the \nFirm’s past representation of them.  The Court further concludes that the Second Hinshaw Affidavit \nlargely provided further detail to facts recited in  the First Hinshaw Affidavit and that the Court’s \nconsideration of the Second Hinshaw Affidavit does  not prejudice Kingsdown in light of the Court’s \ndecision to permit Kingsdown to submit additional affidavits in response.   \n \nof whom they allege are still with th e Firm, “performed work for the Hinshaws \nrelating to their homes, their personal property, their bank accounts, their personal \nrelationships, their retirement plans, an d their landlord-tenant relationship with \nKingsdown,” (Defs.’ Reply Supp. Mot. Disqualify, p. 8), all while the firm concurrently \nserved as Kingsdown’s corporate counsel.  The following provides a list of the matters \non which the Hinshaws contend Tuggle Du ggins attorneys represented Mr. and/or \nMs. Hinshaw (which Mr. Hinshaw alleges is not exhaustive):  \n(i.) Bradley Jacobs (currently a Tuggl e Duggins attorney) and Richard \nTuggle (who passed away on January 23, 2012) performed legal services \nin connection with an irrevocable trust for Mr. Hinshaw from 1993 until \n2013, including beneficiary reassi gnments with respect to Mr. \nHinshaw’s life insurance plan, the issuance of new certificates, and the \nhandling of payments, with first, Mr. Tuggle, and later, Mr. Jacobs \nserving as trustee.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(a); \nsee also Southerland \nAff. ¶ 9; Jacobs Aff. ¶ 5.) \n(ii.) In 1997, Mr. Tuggle and William G. Burgin, III (currently a Tuggle \nDuggins attorney) worked on the Beach House Transaction in which \n“Mr. Hinshaw traded his beach house for a beach property that \nKingsdown owned” so that Mr. Hins haw could lease the undeveloped \nBeach Property back to Kingsdown.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(b).)  In \n1998, Mr. Tuggle drafted the leas e, and Mr. Burgin drafted a \nmemorandum of lease that was recorded in the Office of the Register of \nDeeds in Brunswick County to public ly record the lease agreement.  \n(Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(b); see also Defs.’ Reply Supp. Mot. Disqualify, \nEx. B; First Burgin Aff. ¶4; Second Burgin Aff. ¶¶ 2–4.) \n(iii.) In 1998 and 1999, Elizabeth Grimes (no longer a Tuggle Duggins \nattorney) handled various matters in connection with Mr. Hinshaw’s \nseparation and divorce from his ex-w ife.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(c); \nsee also Southerland Aff. ¶ 9.) \n(iv.) In 1999, Mr. Tuggle prepared a tr ust agreement and last will and \ntestament for Mr. Hinshaw. (S econd Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(d); see also  \nSoutherland Aff. ¶ 9.) \n(v.) In 1999, Mr. Burgin prepared a general warranty deed to transfer the \nBeach Property to Mr. Hinshaw from his ex-wife.  (First Burgin Aff. ¶ 5; \nSecond Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(e).)  This deed was recorded in the Office of the \nRegister of Deeds in Brunswick Count y.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(e); \nsee also Defs.’ Reply Supp. Mot. Disqualify, Ex. E.) \n \n(vi.) In 2000, Bill Connor (no longer a Tu ggle Duggins attorney) performed \nlegal work in connection with th e construction of Mr. Hinshaw’s \npersonal residence in Durham, North Carolina, including drafting the \nconstruction agreement.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(f).) \n(vii.) In 2000, Mr. Tuggle and Ms. Grimes (each no longer a Tuggle Duggins \nattorney) drafted and finalized a premarital agreement between the \nHinshaws.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(g).) \n(viii.) In 2002, Mr. Burgin handled a settlem ent relating to the Beach House \nProperty involving Kingsdown’s tenancy.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(i); \nsee also First Burgin Aff. ¶ 6.)  \n(ix.) In 2001 and 2002, Kenneth Johnson (no longer a Tuggle Duggins \nattorney), administered and terminated Mr. Hinshaw’s personal money-\npurchase pension plan and drafted letters to Mr. Hinshaw with advice \nconcerning IRS procedures and regu lations.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ \n5(h); see also Defs.’ Reply Supp. Mot. Disqualify, Ex. D; Southerland Aff. \n¶¶ 12–13.) \n(x.) In 2003, an unknown Tuggle Duggins attorney drafted a power of \nattorney and healthcare power of attorney for Mr. Hinshaw’s son, \nnaming Mr. Hinshaw as attorney-in -fact in both documents. (Second \nHinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(k).) \n(xi.) In 2003, Tuggle Duggins attorneys he lped Mr. Hinshaw refinance the \nBeach Property.  Martha Bailey, a Tuggle Duggins paralegal, signed a \ntitle insurance letter in relation to the refinancing.  (Second Hinshaw \nAff. ¶ 5(l).) \n(xii.) In 2004, Mr. Burgin handled the settlement and closing on a \nMooresville, North Carolina property that was personally owned by Mr. \nHinshaw.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(m).)  \n(xiii.) Mr. Tuggle and Mr. Jacobs structured  and established a life insurance \ntrust for Ms. Hinshaw in 2006 and 2007.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(a); \nsee also Southerland Aff. ¶ 9.) \n(xiv.) In 2006 and 2007, Mr. Tuggle and Mr. Jacobs drafted and revised the \nHinshaws’ last wills and testaments.   (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(n).)  Mr. \nTuggle prepared codicils to the Hinshaws’ wills in 2010 and advised Mr. \nHinshaw to revisit his estate plan as various tax laws changed. (Second \nHinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(n); see also Southerland Aff. ¶ 9.) \n(xv.) From 2006 to 2010, Mr. Johnson handled Mr. Hinshaw’s personal 401(k) \nprofit sharing plan and trust and se nt letters containing tax advice \n \nconcerning IRS procedures and regulations. (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(o); \nsee also Southerland Aff. ¶ 9; see contra Johnson Aff. ¶ 3.) \n(xvi.) In 2011, Mr. Tuggle prepared a rent-abatement agreement on the Beach \nProperty to eliminate rent payments to Mr. Hinshaw for one year.  \n(Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(p).) \n{14} In addition to the numerous personal matters the Hinshaws contend Tuggle \nDuggins attorneys handled for them, Mr. Hinshaw also claims that Tuggle Duggins \nattorneys provided him with advice in his individual capacity regarding his duties as \nCEO of Kingsdown.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶¶ 10, 11(b), 11(c); Def.’s Reply Supp. Mot. \nDisqualify, Ex. G; cf. Tumlin Aff. ¶ 5.)   \n{15} The Hinshaws contend that “[m]any, if not all, of the actions taken by Mr. \nHinshaw that are the subject of the Am ended Complaint were undertaken at the \nsuggestion of [Tuggle Duggins], and, in  discharging his duties, Mr. Hinshaw \nreasonably relied on the advice of [Tuggle Duggins] . . . and reasonably believed that \nthe matters on which Tuggle Duggins prov ided legal advice were within its \nprofessional and expert competence.”  (Hinshaw Defs.’ Answer, Defenses, and \nCounterclaims, p. 14.) \n{16} The Hinshaws assert that at least three of the matters in which Tuggle \nDuggins attorneys allegedly represented the Hinshaws are at issue in this lawsuit. \n{17} First, the Hinshaws contend that Tu ggle Duggins attorneys, including Mr. \nTuggle and Mr. Burgin, handled the Beach House Transaction as well as subsequent \nmatters relating to the Beach Property, which Kingsdown now contends involved \nfraudulent and self-dealing transfers wh ich were in breach of Mr. Hinshaw’s \nfiduciary duties to Kingsdown.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 5(b); s ee Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4–\n12.)   \n{18} Second, the Hinshaws assert that Tuggle Duggins attorneys, including Mr. \nTumlin, allegedly suggested and implemented the key components of Kingsdown’s \nexecutive compensation structure and that  Kingsdown now claims that payments \nmade to Mr. Hinshaw under that structur e were excessive, fraudulent, and self-\n \ndealing transfers in breach of Mr. Hinshaw’s fiduciary duty.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ \n11(b).)   \n{19} Last, the Hinshaws allege that current Tuggle Duggins attorneys, including \nMr. Tumlin, Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Burgin, ha d access to the intimate details of the \nHinshaws’ personal finances, which th e Hinshaws contend are material to \nKingsdown’s claims that Mr.  Hinshaw paid himself ex cessive compensation (Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 21–27), caused Kingsdown to pay Ms. Hinshaw a sham salary to cover \npersonal travel expenses (Am. Compl. ¶ 29),  received self-dealing monetary benefits \nfrom the Beach House Transaction (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 13–20), and received \nunauthorized personal and family benefits  at Kingsdown’s expense (Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n28–30).  \n{20} Kingsdown acknowledges that the Firm represented the Hinshaws in \ncertain limited capacities over the years bu t denies that any current member of the \nFirm represented the Hinshaws in any matters that are the same as or substantially \nrelated to the matters at issue in this lit igation and further that no current Firm \nmember has any material confidential information of the Hinshaws.4  \nIII. \nANALYSIS \nA. Legal Standard \n{21} The trial court’s decision to disqualify counsel is within its sound discretion \nand will not be disturbed, absent an abuse of discretion.  Robinson & Lawing, L.L.P. \nv. Sams, 161 N.C. App. 338, 339, 587 S.E.2d 923,  925 (2003) (citation omitted).  The \nfederal courts have cautioned that “[t]he drastic nature of disqualification requires \nthat courts avoid overly-mechanical adherence to disciplinary canons at the expense \nof litigants’ rights freely to choose their counsel; and that they always remain mindful \nof the opposing possibility of misuse of  disqualification motions for strategic \n                                                 \n4 Although the Firm acknowledges its representation of the Hinshaws, as discussed infra, Tuggle \nDuggins never (i) opened a client matter for the Hinshaws, (ii) sent  an engagement letter to the \nHinshaws, (iii) asked the Hinshaws for payment, or (iv) received payment from the Hinshaws for the \nFirm’s services. (Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot. Disqualify, p. 3.) \n \nreasons.”  Shaffer v. Farm Fresh, Inc. , 966 F.2d 142, 146 (4th Cir. 1992) (citation \nomitted).   \n{22} Indeed, “[i]n order to avoid the potential for abuse, the Fourth Circuit has \nheld that disqualification for violations of an ethical canon ‘may not be rested on mere \nspeculation that a chain of events whose occurrence theoretically could lead counsel \nto act counter to his client’s interests might in fact occur.’” Blaney v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Hosp. Auth., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103159, at *7 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 13, \n2011) (quoting Shaffer, 966 F.2d at 145) (applying North Carolina law).   \n{23} Nevertheless, when deciding a motion to disqualify, courts must be mindful \nthat a primary goal of our ju dicial system is to maintain  public confidence.  This \n“demands that courts prevent even the appe arance of impropriety and thus resolve \nany and all doubts in favor of disqualification.”  Chemcraft Holdings Corp. v. \nShayban, 2006 NCBC 13 ¶ 34 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 5, 2006), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2006%20NCBC%2013.htm; see, e.g. , \nUnited States v. Clarkson, 567 F.2d 270, 273 n. 3 (4th Cir. 1977); HealthNet, Inc. v. \nHealth Net, Inc., 289 F. Supp. 2d 755, 758 (S.D. W. Va. 2003).  As explained by Judge \nDiaz: \nIn preventing the appearance of impropriety, the client’s \nperception of events is of paramount importance and \novershadows the details of hi s attorney’s conduct. The \nconduct of the attorney need not constitute a violation of \nthe Rules of Professional Cond uct, and certainly need not \nrise to the level of professional negligence in order to \nwarrant disqualification. The relevant cases instruct us to \nrefrain from weighing the conduct of counsel with \n‘hairsplitting nicety’ in the context of a motion to \ndisqualify. \nUnited States v. Trafficante, 328 F.2d 117, 120 \n(5th Cir. 1964).   \n \nChemcraft, 2006 NCBC 13 ¶ 34. \n{24} Applying these principles, and after reviewing the briefs, affidavits, and \nother evidence of record advanced by th e parties, the Court concludes that Tuggle \nDuggins should be disqualified from repr esenting Kingsdown against the Hinshaws \nin this action for two primary reasons.  First, on the current record, Rule 1.10(b) \n \nprohibits Tuggle Duggins from represen ting Kingsdown against the Hinshaws \nbecause Kingsdown has not carried its burden to show that the Firm does not have \nany material confidential information of the Hinshaws.  Second, the extensive nature \nof the Firm’s prior representation of the Hinshaws for a period of over twenty years, \nincluding in connection with the Beach House Transaction, which is at the core of this \ndispute, creates an appearance of i mpropriety that requires the Firm’s \ndisqualification.5   \nB. North Carolina Rule of Professional Conduct 1.10(b) \n{25} The Hinshaws argue that Tuggle Duggins should be disqualified for failing \nto comply with Rule 1.10(b).6  That Rule provides as follows: \nWhen a lawyer has terminated an association with a firm, \nthe firm is not prohibited fr om thereafter representing a \nperson with interests materially adverse to those of a client \nrepresented by the formerly associated lawyer and not \ncurrently represented by the firm, unless: \n \n(1) the matter is the same or substantially related to \nthat in which the formerly associated lawyer \nrepresented the client; and \n \n(2) any lawyer remaining in the firm has \ninformation protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is \nmaterial to the matter. \n \nN.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.10(b).  Tuggle Du ggins is disqualified from representing \nKingsdown under Rule 1.10(b) if (1) the Hi nshaws carry their burden to show that \nthey shared an attorney-client relationship with a former Tuggle Duggins lawyer (2) \non matters that are the same or substa ntially related to those in which Tuggle \nDuggins now represents Kingsdown agains t the Hinshaws, and (3) Tuggle Duggins \n                                                 \n5 At this time, the Court’s ruling is limited to th e Firm’s representation of Kingsdown against the \nHinshaws and does not affect the Firm’s representation of Kingsdown against Defendant Anne Ray or \nthe Firm’s representation of Third Party Defendants Hood, McLean, Stephenson, Pearson and Tumlin. \n \n6 Although the Hinshaws do not move for disqualifi cation under Rule 1.10(b) in their Motion to \nDisqualify and Supporting Brief, Kingsdown raises its compliance with Rule 1.10(b) in its Response, \nand the Hinshaws contend in their Reply that the Firm has failed to meet its burden to avoid \ndisqualification under Rule 1.10(b).  The Firm’s compliance with Rule 1.10(b) is therefore properly \nbefore the Court.   \n \ndoes not carry its burden to prove that th e Firm no longer has any of the Hinshaws’ \nmaterial confidential information protected by Rules of Professional Conduct 1.6 and \n1.9(c).  \ni. Attorney Client Relationship \n{26} Whether an attorney-client relationship exists is a question of fact for the \ntrial court.   See Cornelius v. Helms , 120 N.C. App. 172, 175,  461 S.E.2d 338, 339 \n(1995) (citation omitted).  The relationship  “may be implied from the conduct of the \nparties, and is not dependent on the paymen t of a fee, nor upon the execution of a \nformal contract.”  The North Carolina State Bar v. Sheffield , 73 N.C. App. 349, 358, \n326 S.E.2d 320, 325, cert. denied, 314 N.C. 117, 332 S.E.2d 482, cert. denied, 474 U.S. \n981 (1985) (citation omitted).  Rather, th e Court must focus on “whether [the \nattorney’s conduct] was such that an attorney-client relationship could reasonably be \ninferred” by the purported client.  \nId.  “An important factor in determining the \nexistence of the relationship is the client’s subjective belief.”  Flick Mortg. Investors \nv. Epiphany Mortg. , 2006 NCBC 3 ¶ 3 (N.C. Supe r. Ct. Feb. 1, 2006), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2006%20NCBC%203.htm (quoting Teja v. \nSaran, 68 Wn. App. 793, 796, 846 P.2d 1375, 1377 (1993)).   \n{27} Further, “[w]hether an attorney for an organization also represents  a \nconstituent is a question of fact for the trial court.”  Classic Coffee Concepts, Inc. v. \nAnderson, 2006 NCBC 21 ¶ 58 (N.C. Super. Ct. Dec. 1, 2006), \nhttp://www.ncbusinesscourt.net/opinions/2006%20NCBC%2021.pdf (citation \nomitted).  “Determining the reasonablene ss of a constituent’s belief that he was \npersonally represented by the organization’s  attorney is particularly difficult and \nfact-intensive in the context of a closely-held corporation.”  Id. ¶ 61 (citation omitted). \n{28} Kingsdown has offered affidavits from a number of current Tuggle Duggins \nattorneys averring that current Tuggle Duggins attorneys had limited or no \ninvolvement with Mr. Hinshaw, did not repr esent him personally on any occasion \n(and specifically not in connection with any matter at issue in this litigation), and are \nnot “aware” of any confidential information of the Hinshaws.   \n \n{29} Nevertheless, Kingsdown acknowledges  that Tuggle Duggins assisted Mr. \nHinshaw with his separation from his first wife, prepared a premarital agreement on \nhis behalf, represented him in connection with  at least two real estate transactions, \nperiodically updated his wills and related documents, and handled matters involving \ntrusts set up for Mr. and/or Ms. Hinshaw (all without billing either of them directly).  \n(Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot. Disqualify, p. 3–4.)  Kingsdow n also acknowledges that the \nnow-deceased Mr. Tuggle was at all times Mr. Hinshaw’s “primary point of contact at \nTuggle Duggins,” (Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot. Disqualify, p. 10 fn. 7), and performed nearly \nall of the personal legal work the Firm di d for Mr. or Ms. Hinsha w over the years.  \nIndeed, it appears that Mr. Tuggle regularl y provided advice to Mr. Hinshaw, both \nas an executive of Kingsdown and in his personal capacity, and that Mr. Tuggle was \nMr. Hinshaw’s continuing and coordinating point of contact at Tuggle Duggins for all \nof Mr. Hinshaw’s and Kingsdown’s legal matters. \n{30} Accordingly, the Court concludes that  there is ample evidence that Mr. \nHinshaw could reasonably infer that he had an attorney-client relationship with the \nFirm, including with Mr. Tuggle prior to Mr. Tuggle’s death in 2012.     \nii. Same or Substantially Related Matters \n{31} Matters are “substantially related” for the purposes of Rules 1.9 and 1.10(b) \n“if they involve the same transaction or legal dispute or if there otherwise is a \nsubstantial risk that information as would normally have been obtained in the prior \nrepresentation would materially advance th e client’s position in the subsequent \nmatter.”  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.9 cmt. 3.  “The substantially related test requires a \nvirtual congruence of issues, and the rela tionship between the issues in the prior \n[representation] must be patently clear.” Plant Genetic Sys., N.V. v. Ciba Seeds, 933 \nF. Supp. 514, 518 (M.D.N.C. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) \n(interpreting North Carolina Rules of Profes sional Conduct).  “In the context of a \nmotion to disqualify, substantially related has been interpreted to mean ‘identical’ or \n‘essentially the same.’” Hepburn v. Workplace Benefits, LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n52628, at *7 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 15, 2014) (quoting Plant Genetic Sys. , 933 F. Supp. at \n518) (applying North Carolina law).  “[T]he concern is whether there is a reasonable \n \nprobability that confidences were disclosed in the prior representation which could \nbe used against the former client in the current litigation.”  Plant Genetic Sys., 933 \nF. Supp. at 518 (citing In re Stokes , 156 Bankr. 181, 187 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1993) \n(applying North Carolina law)). \n{32} The Hinshaws contend that Tuggle Duggins’ representation of Kingsdown \nin connection with claims relating to the Beach House Transaction, the alleged \npayment of excessive compensation to Mr.  Hinshaw, and alleged improper self-\ndealing by the Hinshaws involve the same or substantially related matters as those \nin which current and former Tuggle Duggin s attorneys previously represented the \nHinshaws.  \n{33} In opposition, Kingsdown contends th at Tuggle Duggins “has never:  (1) \nopened a client matter for [Mr.] Hinshaw; (2 ) sent an engagement letter to [Mr.] \nHinshaw; (3) asked for or received payment from [Mr.] Hinshaw for services provided \nto him; (4) prosecuted any litigation on” his behalf; or (5) organized a company for Mr. \nHinshaw.  (Pl.’s Resp. Opp. Mot. Disqualify, p. 3.)  \n{34} Nevertheless, the Court finds that there is ample evidence that Mr. Tuggle \nrepresented Mr. Hinshaw in matters that are the same or substantially related to the \nmatters involved in the current lawsuit.  In particular, the evidence of record suggests \nthat Mr. Tuggle likely conceived, dire cted, and documented the Beach House \nTransaction between Kingsdown and Mr. Hinshaw, serving as the primary attorney \ninvolved in the Transaction and representing both parties’ legal interests.   \n{35} Moreover, Mr. Hinshaw has averred that Mr. Tuggle advised him personally \nin connection with numerous personal and company transactions over a period of \ntwenty years, and that Mr. Hinshaw “alw ays firmly believed and understood that \nTuggle Duggins was advising [him] about what [he] should do as both an executive of \nKingsdown and personally – particularly given Tuggle Duggins’ extended and \nongoing personal representation of [him].”  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶ 15.)  He has also \naverred that Tuggle Duggins attorneys provided him legal advice concerning \nKingsdown’s executive compensation structure and, in particular, his own \ncompensation.  (Second Hinshaw Aff. ¶¶ 11(b), (d).) \n \n{36} As a result, the Court finds that Mr.  Hinshaw shared an attorney-client \nrelationship with Mr. Tuggle and the Fi rm on matters that are the same or \nsubstantially related to the claims Kingsd own has alleged agains t the Hinshaws in \nthe current litigation. \niii. The Firm’s Possession of Information Protected by Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) that is \nMaterial to the Matter \n \n{37} The Court must next determine whether any current attorney at Tuggle \nDuggins has any of the Hinshaws’ protected information under Rules 1.6 and 1.9(c) \nthat is material to this case.  N.C. R. Pr of’l Conduct 1.10(b)(2).  Rule 1.6 generally \nforbids lawyers from revealing information acquired during the professional \nrelationship with their clients unless the disclosure is impliedly authorized to carry \nout the representation.  See N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.6( a).  Rule 1.9(c) prohibits \nlawyers from using or revealing informatio n learned during the representation of \ntheir clients to their clients’ disadvantage.  N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.9(c).  “The burden \nrests upon the law firm to prove the former attorney did not share any information \nabout the former client with the re maining attorneys in the firm.”  Ferguson, 174 \nN.C. App. at 539, 621 S.E.2d at 328 (citing N.C. R. Pr of’l Conduct 1.9, cmt. 6 and \ndisqualifying firm where the “record [was] devoid of . . . evidence” that attorney did \nnot share confidential information with other members of firm).   \n{38} The Hinshaws argue that in light of  Mr. Tuggle’s involvement with the \ntransactions at issue, the Court should infer that the Firm possesses their \nconfidential information.  See Ferguson, 174 N.C. App. at 539, 621 S.E.2d at 328 (“[A] \nfirm of lawyers is essentially  one lawyer for purposes of  the rules governing loyalty \nto the client.”) (citing N.C. R. Prof’l Conduct 1.10 cmt. 2).   \n{39} In response, Kingsdown has offered a ffidavits from each of the current \nTuggle Duggins attorneys who apparently had any involvement with Kingsdown or \nthe Hinshaws, and each has attested unde r oath that he is not “aware” of the \nHinshaws’ confidential information.  Kingsdown has also offered affidavits to similar \neffect from each of the attorneys involved in this litigation on behalf of the Company.     \n \n{40} Based on Kingsdown’s submissions, however, the Court cannot conclude \nthat Kingsdown has carried its burden to show that no current Tuggle Duggins \nattorney possesses any of the Hinshaws’ material confidential information.   \n{41} First, Mr. Southerland contends that  he has personally reviewed Tuggle \nDuggins’ billing records, which he alleges reflect that no Tuggle Duggins attorneys \nrepresented the Hinshaws on matters that are at issue in this lawsuit.  (Southerland \nAff. ¶ 18.)  The Court, however, does no t find Mr. Southerland’s review of Tuggle \nDuggins’ billing records sufficient to carry the Firm’s burden under Rule 1.10(b).  In \nparticular, Kingsdown alleges that Tuggle Duggins represented Kingsdown, not Mr. \nor Mrs. Hinshaw, in connection with both  the Beach House Transaction and Mr. \nHinshaw’s compensation.  The Hinshaws contend to the contrary, and Tuggle \nDuggins has not brought forward any evidence to indicate that any other firm \nrepresented Mr. Hinshaw in connection with these specific matters.   \n{42} Second, in light of Tuggle Duggins’ admissions that it has never billed Mr. \nHinshaw, opened a client matter for Mr. Hinshaw, sent an engagement letter to Mr. \nHinshaw, or asked for or received paymen t from Mr. Hinshaw fo r services provided \nto him – while at the same time admitt ing that the Firm has represented the \nHinshaws in their personal marital, esta te, trusts, and financial matters over a \ntwenty-year period – the Court is not persuaded that the Firm’s billing records are a \ndeterminative or even reliable source to ascertain whether or not the Firm \nrepresented the Hinshaws in the matters at issue in this case, and likewise, whether \nor not the Firm possesses any of the Hinsha ws’ material confidential information.  \nIndeed, given the Firm’s provision of le gal services to both Kingsdown and the \nHinshaws without maintaining separate reco rds to distinguish between the two, it \ncomes as no particular surprise that th e Firm’s billing records do not reflect the \nFirm’s representation of the Hinshaws in connection with the transactions in dispute.     \n{43} Third, although Mr. Southerland attests that he has “personally reviewed” \nthe Firm’s electronic billing records, Mr. Southerland does not attest that he – or any \nother attorney at the Firm – has conducted a personal review of Kingsdown’s files.  \nSee Currituck Assocs.-Residential P’ship v. Hollowell, 170 N.C. App. 399, 403, 612 \n \nS.E.2d 386, 389 (2005) (explaining that “it is a general legal principle that affidavits \nmust be based upon personal knowledg e”) (citation omitted).  Instead, Mr. \nSoutherland makes broad, conclusory statements alleging that “Tuggle Duggins’ files \nfor matters it has handled for Kingsdown do not contain any confidential or material \ninformation of Mr. Hinshaw’s that is releva nt to this lawsuit,” (Southerland Aff. ¶ \n14), and that these files “contain no ma terials or documents with respect to \ndiscussions with Mr. Hinshaw relative to  the beach house, any alleged corporate \nmisdeeds, or the conveying of Mr. Hinshaw’s confidential information to Tuggle \nDuggins about the alleged transfer,” (Southerland Aff. ¶ 19). \n{44} In short, Kingsdown has not brought forward competent evidence that the \nFirm has conducted a sufficient investigat ion of the Firm’s attorneys and files to \nascertain whether the Firm has knowledge of the Hinshaws’ material confidential \ninformation, or if such an investigation has been conducted, provided evidence of \nwhat the investigation involved, who an d what was consulte d, and what the \ninvestigation found.   \n{45} More specifically, Kingsdown has no t offered evidence concerning the \nexistence, location, and possession of any files that relate to the Beach House \nTransaction – in which it appears that Mr.  Tuggle provided legal advice to both \nKingsdown and Mr. Hinshaw – and whether any current Tuggle Duggins attorneys \nare reflected in these files as having prov ided legal work to the Hinshaws or have \nknowledge of the matters contained in these files.  Such files presumably were created \nand maintained by Mr. Tuggle – or by others at the Firm at his direction – and which, \nunless destroyed, continue in existence at the Firm. Similarly, Kingsdown has not \noffered evidence concerning the existence and content of files that may contain \nmaterial confidential information of th e Hinshaws relating to Mr. Hinshaw’s \ncompensation or matters involving the Hinshaws’ personal travel and other personal \nexpenses which have now been called into question.   \n{46} Unlike the situation often examined under Rule 1.10(b) when a former \nattorney leaves a law firm and takes the cl ient’s files and confidential documents to \nhis or her new law firm, here, where the primary attorney has died and the Firm has \n \ncontinued in existence, the client’s f iles and confidential documents presumably \nremain at the Firm and are available to the other attorneys in the firm.  As such, the \nCourt concludes that the failure of the Fi rm to provide competent and persuasive \nevidence of the existence and whereabouts of these files, and the clients’ confidential \ndocuments and information that may be contai ned therein, is a significant factor in \ndetermining whether Kingsdown and the Firm have met their burden under Rule \n10(b).   \n{47} Given the lack of foundation for Mr. Southerland’s conclusory statements, \nthe limited representations of seven of the firm’s attorneys that they are not “aware” \nof any material confidential informatio n of the Hinshaws, and Rule 1.10(b)’s \nemphasis on a law firm’s demonstration of the lack of actual knowledge of the current \nmembers of the firm, the Court cannot conclude, on this record, that Kingsdown has \nmet its burden under Rule 1.10(b)to show th at current attorneys at the Firm do not \npossess material confidential information of the Hinshaws that is substantially \nrelated to the matters at issue in this lawsuit. \nC. Appearance of Impropriety7 \n{48} Even though the Court has concluded that Kingsdown and Tuggle Duggins \nhave failed to meet the requir ements of Rule 1.10(b), “[t]he conduct of the attorney \nneed not constitute a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct . . . to warrant \ndisqualification.”  Chemcraft, 2006 NCBC 13 ¶ 34.  Separa te and apart from the \ntechnical application of the Rules of Profe ssional Conduct to these facts, our courts \nhave made clear that the Court’s overarching consideration on a motion to disqualify \nis to “prevent even the appearance of impropriety and thus resolve any and all doubts \nin favor of disqualification.”  Id. (citation omitted).   \n{49} Indeed, “the right of one to retain co unsel of his choosin g is secondary in \nimportance to the Court’s duty to main tain the highest ethical standards of \nprofessional conduct to insure and preserve trust in the integrity of the bar.  Avoiding \na conflict and the appearance of impr opriety are the best solutions.”  Superguide \n                                                 \n7 Having concluded Tuggle Duggins has not met its burden to avoid disqualification under Rule 1.10, \nthe Court does not find it necessary to consider whether the Firm is also disqualified under Rule 1.9. \n \nCorp. v. DirecTV Enters., 141 F. Supp. 2d 616, 625 (W.D.N.C. 2001) (citation omitted) \n(applying North Carolina law).  The Cour t’s primary concern in preventing the \nappearance of impropriety is the client’s perception of events.  See Chemcraft, 2006 \nNCBC 13 ¶ 34. \n{50} Here, at a minimum, the Court finds that the Hinshaws have shown that \nMr. Tuggle represented both Kingsdown and Mr. Hinshaw in the Beach House \nTransaction and that Mr. Tuggle’s legal ad vice to Mr. Hinshaw in connection with \nthat transaction will be squarely at issue in this litigation.8  The Court does not find \nit surprising that Mr. Hinshaw would be confused and concerned that the Firm he \nconsidered to be his attorneys in that  transaction would now be suing him for \nallegedly following the advice he claims the Firm provided.    \n{51} It is also clear that the parties will, again at a minimum, engage in a \nvigorous contest over whether Mr. Tuggle, Mr. Tumlin, or other former or current \nTuggle Duggins attorneys provided legal advice concerning Mr. Hinshaw’s \ncompensation on behalf of Kingsdown, Mr.  Hinshaw, or both.  In any event, the \nHinshaws’ alleged reasonable reliance on advice from Tuggle Duggins attorneys will \nbe central to their defense against Ki ngsdown’s allegations that Mr. Hinshaw \nauthorized and received excessive compensation.   \n{52} Further, not only are the Hinshaws likely to call current (and former) Tuggle \nDuggins attorneys as witnesses in this action, 9  but those attorney-witnesses may \npotentially face divided loyalties between their allegiance to the Firm and the defense \nof the Firm’s advice, on the one hand, an d their duty of loyalty to, and zealous \nadvocacy for, their clients, on the other, as that advice, and the parties’ actions in \nalleged reliance on that advice, comes under intense scrutiny.  \n{53} In addition, by Tuggle Duggins’ own admission, the Firm has rendered a \nvariety of personal legal services over many years to the Hinshaws without rendering \n                                                 \n8 The Firm has not offered evidence that it ever sought or obtained a waiver or consent of any kind \nfrom either of the Hinshaws concerning the Firm’s representation of Kingsdown and the Hinshaws. \n \n9 Defendant Ray has also represented to the Court that she intends to have at least two, and perhaps \nup to four, Tuggle Duggins attorneys testify in this matter. \n \nthem a bill, presumably commingling the records and confidential information \npertaining to the Firm’s representation of the Hinshaws with those of Kingsdown.  It \nseems likely that in these circumstances the Firm retains records that the Hinshaws \nregard as confidential and which involve matters, like the Beach House Transaction, \nwhich are material to the current dispute.  As Judge Diaz concluded in \nChemcraft, \n“mere access to this material is enough to justify . . .  disqualification.”  2006 NCBC \n13 ¶ 43; see, e.g., Flick Mortg. Investors, 2006 NCBC 3 ¶¶ 9, 10 (finding attorney’s \ngeneral access to files a basis for disqualification). \n{54} In the end, our courts have instructed that the Hinshaws’ motion “should \nsucceed or fail on the reasonableness of [their] perception that confidences [they] once \nshared with [their] lawyer are potent ially available to [their] adversary.” Id. ¶ 34 \n(quoting HealthNet, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 763).   The Hinshaws have provided sworn, \ndetailed statements attesting to their reasonable, good faith belief that the \nconfidences they shared with Mr. Tuggl e and others at Tuggle Duggins are now \navailable to Kingsdown and can be used against their interests in this litigation.  The \nultimate question on the Motion to Di squalify, thus, is whether the Hinshaws’ \nperception is reasonable.  Based on the record here – where Tuggle Duggins provided \nlegal advice, through Mr. Tuggle as well as through current Tuggle Duggins \nattorneys, to both Kingsdown and Mr. Hi nshaw on various matters, including the \nBeach Property and arguably Mr. Hinshaw’s compensation – both of which are core \nissues in this litigation – the Court concludes that the Hinshaws’ perception that their \nmaterial confidential information is “potent ially available to [their] adversary” is \nreasonable.  As such, the Court finds that an appearance of impropriety exists on \nthese facts. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n{55} Accordingly, based on the foregoing, and despite the drastic nature of \ndisqualification, the Court concludes that  disqualification of Tuggle Duggins from \nrepresenting Kingsdown against the Hinshaws  in this litigation is appropriate.  Id. \n(“[w]here a reasonable client would be concerned by a potential conflict, a court must \n \nerr on the side of disqualification”); see also Ferguson, 174 N.C. App. at 539–40, 621 \nS.E.2d at 328 (disqualifying law firm under  Rule 1.10 because firm failed to prove \nplaintiff’s confidential information was not shared with current members of the firm).   \n{56} WHEREFORE, the Court GRANTS the Hinshaw Defendants’ Motion to \nDisqualify, and hereby DISQUALIFIES Tuggle Duggins from further representation \nof Kingsdown in this matter against the Hinshaws and ORDERS the Firm to comply \nwith the requirements of the North Caro lina Rules of Professional Conduct in \nconnection with any material confidential information of the Hinshaws that the Firm \npossesses.     \n{57} The Court DENIES Kingsdown’s Motion to St rike the Second Hinshaw \nAffidavit. \n{58} Kingsdown shall have through and including April 30, 2015 to hire new \ncounsel to represent the Company in connection with matters adverse to the \nHinshaws in this action and file appropriate notices of appearance.  \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 25th day of March 2015.  \n   \n       \n "
