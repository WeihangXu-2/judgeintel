Titan Valve, LLC, 2019 NCBC 76. \nSTATE OF NORTH CAROLINA \n \nGASTON COUNTY \nIN THE GENERAL COURT OF JUSTICE \nSUPERIOR COURT DIVISION \n18 CVS 1064 \n \nRED VALVE, INC. and \nHILLENBRAND, INC., \n \nPlaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nTITAN VALVE, LLC; BEN PAYNE; \nFABIAN AEDO ORTIZ; and JOHN \nDOES 1-10, \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \nORDER AND OPINION STAYING \nDEADLINES PENDING APPEAL \n \n1. THIS MATTER is before the Court sua sponte to consider whether certain \nrelief previously ordered by the Court must or should be stayed in light of Defendants \nTitan Valve, Inc. (“Titan”), Ben Payne (“Payne”), and Fabian Aedo Ortiz ’s (“Aedo”) \n(collectively, the “Titan Defendants”) recent appeal of various orders, including those \nin which the Court ordered the relief at issue here. \n2. Having considered the parties’ briefs,  the arguments of counsel at the \nOctober 29, 2019 hearing, and the relevant record, the Court concludes that the \nenforcement of the deadlines set f orth in paragraph 149 of the Second Sanctions \nOrder and paragraph 81 of the Second Fee Award should be STAYED pending \nresolution of the Titan Defendants’ appeal. \nNelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP, by David N. Allen, Benjamin \nS. Chesson, and Anna Majestro, for Plaintiffs Red Valve, Inc. and \nHillenbrand, Inc. \n  \nBell, Davis & Pitt, P.A., by Edward B. Davis and Joshua B. Durham, for \nDefendants Titan Valve, Inc., Ben Payne, and Fabian Aedo Ortiz. \n \nBledsoe, Chief Judge. \nI. \n \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n3. On September 3, 2019, the Court issued its Order and Opinion on Plaintiffs \nRed Valve, Inc. and Hillenbrand, Inc. ’s (“Plaintiffs”) Verified Motion for Order to \nShow Cause and Second Motion for Sanctions and Contempt (“Second Sanctions \nOrder”).  ( ECF No. 217.)  In the Second Sanctions Order, the Court: ( i) struck the \nTitan Defendants’ Answer and entered default against them , (Order & Op. Pls.’ V. \nMot. Order Show Cause & Second Mot. Sanctions & Contempt ¶ 149(a)(i) [hereinafter \n“2nd Sans. Order”]); (ii) ordered the parties, within fourteen (14) days of entry of the \nOrder, to meet, confer, and submit for the Court’s review and approval a revised \nReturn Protocol (the “Modified Return Protocol”) , (2nd Sans. Order ¶ 149(a)(ii) (1)); \n(iii) ordered the Titan Defendants, in conjunction with their forensic expert, Reliance \nForensics, to thereafter re-conduct the Return Protocol on all of the Titan Defendants’ \ndevices as provided in the Modified Return Protocol and to bear all fees and costs of \nre-conducting the Return Protocol, (2nd Sans. Order ¶ 149(a)(ii)(2)–(4)); (iv) ordered \nthe Titan Defendants to pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, \nincurred in investigating the conduct necessitating the Second Sanctions Motion and \nseeking and obtaining the relief afforded through the Second Sanctions Motion, with \nthe total amount of fees and expenses and allocation of payment to be addressed by \nseparate order, (2nd Sans. Order ¶ 149(a)(iii)); and (v) ordered the Titan Defendants \nto pay to Plaintiffs the costs associated with the forensic examination ordered in the \nFirst Sanctions Order, (ECF Nos. 139 and 141, filed under seal and publicly, \nrespectively), with the total amount of costs and allocati on of payment again to be \naddressed by separate order, (2nd Sans. Order ¶ 149(a)(iv)). \n4. Two days later, on September 5, 2019, the Court issued its Order and \nOpinion on Plaintiffs’ Petition for Reasonable Expenses Resulting from Plaintiffs’ \nSecond Motion for Sanctions (“Second Fee Award”).  (ECF No. 218.)  As forecasted in \nthe Second Sanctions Order, the Court  in the Second Fee Award ordered the Titan \nDefendants to pay, within thirty-five (35) days of the entry of the Second Fee Award, \nPlaintiffs’ reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, as follows: ( i) \nTitan was ordered to pay Plaintiffs the total amount of $246,577.50, with Aedo and \nPayne held jointly and severally liable for specific portions of that amount, (Order & \nOp. Pls.’ Pet. Reasona ble Expenses Resulting Pls.’ Second Mot. Sanctions ¶ 81(a) \n[hereinafter “2nd Fee Award”]); (ii) Aedo and Titan were held jointly and severally \nliable to Plaintiffs for $106,995.89 of the $246,577.50  awarded, (2nd Fee Award ¶ \n81(b)); and (iii) Payne and Titan were held jointly and severally liable for $85,821.20 \nof the $246,577.50  awarded, ( 2nd Fee Award ¶ 81(c)) , (collectively, “Awarded \nExpenses”). \n5. Shortly thereafter, on September 6, 2019, the Titan Defendants  filed a \nNotice of Appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina appealing twelve of the \nCourt’s orders, including the Second Sanctions Order and the Second Fee Award. 1 \n(ECF No. 219.) \n                                                 \n1  The other orders on appeal are the Court’s (i) March 14, 2018 Temporary Restraining Order, \n(ECF No. 7); ( ii) March 30, 2018 Order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Expedited Discovery, (ECF \nNo. 23); (iii) April 17, 2018 Preliminary Injunction Order, (ECF No. 42) ; (iv) April 17, 2018 \nOrder Clarifying Preliminary Injunction, (ECF No. 43); ( v) January 11, 2019 Order and \n6. At the Court’s request, the parties met and conferred concerning the impact \nof the Titan Defendants’ appeal on the procedural posture of the case, and, on \nSeptember 13, 2019, the parties filed a j oint status report on that issue .  (ECF No. \n220.)  The Court convened a status conference on September 18, 2019 to discuss the \nmatters reflected in the joint status report, including whether the Court could proceed \non any matters in this litigation pending the resolution of the Titan Defendants’ \nappeal. \n7. The day before the status conference, on September 17, 2019, the parties \nfiled a Joint Motion for Extension of Time, (ECF No. 222),  to meet, confer, and submit \nto the Court the Modified Return Protocol required under paragraph 149(a)(ii)(1) of \nthe Second Sanctions Order, which the Court granted the same day,  (ECF No. 224).  \nOn September 19, 2019, and consistent with the Court’s discussions with counsel at \nthe September 18, 2019 status conference, the Court entered an Order of Interim Stay \nof Deadlines Pending Appeal, (ECF No. 226), staying until further order all deadlines \nfor compliance with the Second Sanctions Order and the Second Fee Award, as well \nas all unexpired deadlines in the Case Management Order filed on July 6, 2018, (ECF \nNo. 63), as amended by the Court’s December 20, 2018 Order, (ECF No. 137).   That \nsame day, the Court i ssued a scheduling order, (ECF No. 225), requesting briefing \nand hearing on whether the Court must or should stay the enforcement of the \n                                                 \nOpinion on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions, (ECF No. 139); ( vi) February 5, 2019 Device \nDiscovery Protocol, (ECF No. 152); (vii) February 12, 2019 Order on Defendant Aedo’s Motion \nfor Extension of Time, (ECF No. 157); ( viii) February 27, 2019 Return and Preservation \nProtocol, (ECF No. 162); ( ix) March 14, 2019 Preliminary Order on Plaintiffs’ Motion for \nSanctions, (ECF No. 171); and ( x) March 15, 2019 Order on Plaintiffs’ BCR 10.9 Dispute \nSummaries, (ECF No. 172). \ndeadlines set forth in paragraph 149 of the Second Sanctions Order concerning the \nModified Return Protocol and paragraph 81 of the Second Fee Award concerning the \npayment of the Awarded Expenses. \n8. These matters have been fully briefed, and the Court held a hearing on these \nmatters on October 29, 2019, at which all remaining represented parties were \nrepresented by counsel.   \nII. \nANALYSIS \n9. The parties’ various arguments for and against a stay of the enforcement of \nthe deadlines at issue center around the following  questions: (i) whether the \nenforcement of certain deadlines must be automatically stayed under N.C.G.S. § 1 -\n294; (ii) whether N.C.G.S. §§ 1 -289 and 1-290 and North Carolina Rule of Civil \nProcedure 62 (“Rule 62”) permit enforcement pending the appeal; and (iii) whether \nthe Court should, in any event, exercise its inherent authority to enter a discretionary \nstay of enforcement of the deadlines at issue. \nA. N.C.G.S. § 1-294 \n10. N.C.G.S. § 1-294 provides, in relevant part, that  \n[w]hen an appeal is perfected . . . it stays all further proceedings in the \ncourt below upon the judgment appealed from, or upon the matter \nembraced therein, unless otherwise provided by the Rules of Appellate \nProcedure; but the court below may proceed upon any other matter \nincluded in the action and not affected by the judgment appealed from.   \n \nThe same result occurs upon perfection of an  appeal from an “ appealable \ninterlocutory order[.]”  Veazey v. Durham , 231 N.C. 357, 363, 57 S.E.2d 377, 382 \n(1950).  An interlocutory order “does not dispose of the case[ ] but leaves it for further \naction by the trial court in order to settle and determine the entire controversy.”  Id. \nat 362, 57 S.E.2d at 381.  A lthough generally not appealable, an interlocutory order \nis immediately appealable when it “affects a substantial right that ‘will clearly be lost \nor irremediably adversely affected if the order is not review[ed] before final \njudgment.’ ”  SED Holdings, LLC v. 3 Star Props., LLC, 250 N.C. App. 215, 221, 791 \nS.E.2d 914, 919 (2016)  (quoting Edmondson v. Macclesfield L -P Gas Co. , 182 N.C. \nApp. 381, 391, 642 S.E.2d 265, 272 (2007)) ; see also N.C.G.S. § 1-277(a) (“An appeal \nmay be taken from every judicial order . . . which affects a substantial right claimed \nin any action or proceeding [.]”).  An appealable interlocutory order is treated as a \njudgment for purposes of § 1 -294, so no further proceedings in connection with such \nan order are permitted.  See Veazey, 231 N.C. at 363, 57 S.E.2d at 382; SED Holdings, \nLLC, 250 N.C. App. at 221, 791 S.E.2d at 919; N.C.G.S. § 1-277(a). \n11. A “two-part test has developed” to determine whether an interlocutory order \naffects a substantial right: “the right itself must be substantial and the deprivation \nof that substantial right must potentially work injury to [the appellant] if  not \ncorrected before appeal from final judgment.”   Plasman v. Decca Furniture (USA), \nInc., 800 S.E.2d 761, 768 (N.C. Ct. App. 2017) (quoting Goldston v. Am. Motors Corp., \n326 N.C. 723, 726, 392 S.E.2d 735, 736 (1990)), disc. rev. denied, 812 S.E.2d 849 (N.C. \n2018).  Yet, “the ‘substantial right’ test for appealability of interlocutory orders is \nmore easily stated than applied.”  Waters v. Qualified Pers., Inc., 294 N.C. 200, 208, \n240 S.E.2d 338, 343 (1978).  Moreover, “[n]o hard and fast rules exist for determining \nwhich appeals affect a substantial right.”  Cagle v. Teachy , 111 N.C. App. 244, 246, \n431 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1993); see also RPR & Assocs. v. Univ. of N.C.-Chapel Hill, 153 \nN.C. App. 342, 347–48, 570 S.E.2d 510, 514 (2002). \n12. Rather, whether an interlocutory order affects a substantial right involves \na case-by-case inquiry, SED Holdings, LLC, 250 N.C. App. at 221, 791 S.E.2d at 919 \n(citing Waters, 294 N.C. at 208, 240 S.E.2d at 343), and “[t]he trial court has the \nauthority . . . to determine whether or not i ts order affects a substantial right of the \nparties or is otherwise immediately appealable[,]” RPR & Assocs., 153 N.C. App. at \n348, 570 S.E.2d at 514; see also Plasman, 800 S.E.2d at 768.  The appellant bears the \nburden of showing that an  interlocutory order affects a substantial right .  Feeassco, \nLLC v. The Steel Network, Inc. , 826 S.E.2d 202, 208 (N.C. Ct. App. 2019) (quoting \nJeffreys v. Raleigh Oaks Joint Venture, 115 N.C. App. 377, 380, 444 S.E.2d 252, 254 \n(1994)).   \n13. Plaintiffs contend that enforcement of the deadlines relating to the Modified \nReturn Protocol and the Awarded Expenses do es not affect a substantial right and \nthus “fall[s] outside the scope of an automatic stay” provided by  section 1-294.  (Pls.’ \nMem. Opp’n Staying Modified Return & Pres erv. Protocol & Payment Att’ys’ Fees  \n[hereinafter “Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n”] 2–5, ECF No. 228.)  Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that \nsection 1-294 does not apply to either the Second Sanctions Order or the Second Fee \nAward as a whole ; they argue instead that section 1 -294 should be applied to the \nindividual components of the appealed orders and that the deadlines relating to both \nthe Modified Return Protocol and the Awarded Expenses are “self-executing features” \nof those orders that do not fall under the purview of section 1-294.  (Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n \n3–5); see Rutherford Elec. Mbrshp. Corp. v. Time Warner Entm’t/Advance-Newhouse \nP’ship, 2014 NCBC LEXIS 34, at *5– 6 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 25, 2014) (finding “self -\nexecuting features” are not “ proceedings ‘in the court below ’ ” as contemplated by \nsection 1-294, but rather take effect without further action in or by the trial c ourt); \nsee also Long v. Joyner, 155 N.C. App. 129, 134, 574 S.E.2d 171, 175 (2002) (holding \nthat attorneys’ fee awards under Rule 37 do not affect a substantial right); Bowman \nv. Alan Vester Ford Lincoln Mercury , 151 N.C. App. 603, 612, 566 S.E.2d 818, 824 \n(2002) (finding that the part of an  interlocutory order awarding attorneys ’ fees did \nnot affect a substantial right). \n14. The Titan Def endants contend in opposition that section 1 -294 stays \nenforcement of the deadlines to negotiate the Modified Return Protocol and pay the \nAwarded Expenses because each is a specific challenged provision in a properly \nappealed interlocutory order and thus is directly within “the judgment appealed \nfrom” and a “matter embraced therein.”  (Defs.’ Initial Br. Regarding Stay Pending \nAppeal [hereinafter “Defs.’ Initial Brief”] 3.)  As to the Modified Return Protocol, the \nTitan Defendants argue that enforcing the Protocol ’s deadlines while the current \nappeal is pending will involve t he Court in the subject matter of the appeal  because \nthe appeal includes a review of the legal validity of the Second Sanctions Order from \nwhich the Modified Return Protocol itself arises.  (Defs.’ Initial Br. 3.)  As to the \nSecond Fee Award, the Titan Defendants contend both that enforcing the deadline to \npay the Awarded Expenses is likewise included in a properly appealed interlocutory \norder, bringing enforcement of that deadline within “the judgment appealed from” \nand a “matter embraced therein ,” and that enforcement would affect  a substantial \nright.  (Defs.’ Initial Br. 5.)   \n15. As an initial matter, North Carolina courts have routinely concluded that \nappellate review is immediately available where, as in the Second Sanctions Order, \na trial court strikes a defendant’s answer and enters default.\n2  See, e.g. , Feeassco, \nLLC, 826 S.E.2d at  206–07 (striking answer as sanction affected substantial right \nand was immediately appealable); Walsh v. Cornerstone Health Care, P.A., 829 S.E.2d \n513, 516 (N.C. Ct. App. 2019) (same); Essex Group, Inc. v. Express Wire Servs. , 157 \nN.C. App. 360, 362, 578 S.E.2d 705, 707 (2003) (striking answer and entering default \njudgment affected substantial right and was immediately appealable); Triad Mack \nSales & Serv. v. Clement Bros. Co., 113 N.C. App. 405, 408, 438 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1994) \n(same).   \n16. North Carolina cou rts have also concluded that issues which are \n“inextricably intertwined” with immediately appealable issues likewise affect a \nsubstantial right and may be appealed on an interlocutory basis.  See Carl v. State, \n192 N.C. App. 544, 550, 665 S.E.2d 787, 793 ( 2008) (addressing on appeal the issue \nin an interlocutory order denying a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss because it was \n“inextricably intertwined” with issues before the court) ; see also Kornegay v. Aspen \nAsset Grp., LLC , 204 N.C. App. 213, 240, 693 S.E.2d 723, 741 –42 (2010) (finding \nplaintiff could take action on any issue “separate and distinct” from and not \n                                                 \n2 Plaintiffs acknowledge that a court order striking a defendant’s answer affects a substantial \nright under North Carolina law.  (Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n 4.) \n“inextricably intertwined” with the issue on appeal); Bartlett v. Jacobs, 124 N.C. App. \n521, 524, 477 S.E.2d 693, 695–96 (1996) (finding immediate appellate review proper \nwhere a claim and counterclaim were “sufficiently intertwined” such that  \nadjudication of one could determine the outcome of the other and  two trials on the \nsame issues could result in inconsistent verdicts). \n17. Turning first to the Modified Return Protocol, the Court notes  that all the \nsanctions ordered in the Second Sanctions Order, including the M odified Return \nProtocol, arise from the same facts and circumstances and address the same conduct \nby the Titan Defendants that led to the Court’s decision to strike the Titan \nDefendants’ Answer.  Since the Court’s decision to strike the Titan Defendants’ \nAnswer clearly affects a substantial right, it follows that the enforcement of any of \nthe sanctions imposed in the Second Sanctions Order arising from the same conduct \nis necessarily embraced within the appeal of the Order entering those sanctions.  See, \ne.g., Edmundson v. Lawrence, No. COA08-83, 2008 N.C. App. LEXIS 1453, at *8 (N.C. \nCt. App. Aug. 5, 2008)  (“Since the result of the appeal could moot [a certain issue], \nthe motion [regarding that issue]  was clearly embraced within Plaintiff’s appeal of \nthe underlying action.”).  Thus, the Court concludes that section 1-294 automatically \nstays enforcement of the Modified Return Protocol.    \n18. Even if the Court were to determine, as Plaintiff urges, whether each \nspecific sanction, standing alone, affected a substantial right , the Court concludes \nthat each of t he forms of specific individual relief ordered in the Second Sanctions \nOrder, including the requirements and deadlines concerning the Modified Return \nProtocol, is “inextricably intertwined” with the striking of the Titan D efendants’ \nAnswer.  See, e.g. , Safie Mfg. Co. v. Arnold , 228 N.C. 375, 388, 45 S.E.2d 577, 585 \n(1947) (“While . . . an appeal from an interlocutory order leaves the action for all other \npurposes in the court below, . . .  the disposition of [an] interlocutory order and all \nquestions incident to and necessarily involved in the ruling thereon are carried by the \nappeal to the appellate court. ” (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).  Therefore , for \nthis additional reason, the Court concludes that  the Second Sanct ions Order, \nincluding the Modified Return Protocol,  affects a substantial right and that section \n1-294 stays enforcement of the new Protocol’s deadlines.   \n19. The Court also concludes that section 1 -294 automatically stays \nenforcement of the Second Fee Award.  First, th e Second Fee Award orders the \npayment of fees and costs based on the same conduct on which the Second Sanctions \nOrder relies, and by the express terms of the two appealed orders, each is \n“inextricably intertwined” with the other.  In particular, in paragraphs 149(a)(iii) and \n149(a)(iv), the Second Sanctions Order permits the recovery of Plaintiffs’ reasonable \nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees, and shift s the costs associated with the forensic \nexamination of the Defendants’ devices ordered  in the First Sanctions Order to the \nTitan Defendants.  The Second Fee Award merely specifies the amount of those fees, \nexpenses, and costs  and the deadline by which they must be paid .  Should the \nSupreme Court reverse this Court’s decision to award fees a nd costs in the Second \nSanctions Order, the Second Fee Award will necessarily be reversed and vacated.  \nSee, e.g., Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 733 F.3d 105, 111 (4th Cir. 2013)  (“Two \nseparate rulings are ‘ inextricably intertwined’  if ‘the “same specific question ” will \n“underlie both the appealable and the non-appealable order[.]” ’ ” (citations omitted)).  \nThus, the Second Fee Award affects a substantial right and is properly appealed prior \nto final judgment.   Since payment of the Awarded Ex penses is the subject of the \n“judgment appealed from,” section 1 -294 prevents the Court’s enforcement of the \npayment deadline during the pendency of the current appeal. \n20. The Second Fee Award also affects a substantial right—and thus section 1-\n294 precludes enforcement of its payment deadline—fo r the separate and \nindependent reason that the Award  requires the Titan Defendants to make \nimmediate payment of a substantial amount of money ($246,577.50).  See Estate of \nRedden v. Redden, 179 N.C. App. 113,  116–17, 632 S.E.2d 794, 798 (2006)  (finding \nthat an interlocutory order requiring a party to “make immediate payment of a \nsignificant amount of money” in the amount of $150,000 affected a substantial right), \nremanded on other grounds , 361 N.C. 352, 649 S.E.2d 638 (2007); see also Tibbs v. \nFord, No. COA17 -936, 2018 N.C. App. LEXIS 212, at *5– 6 (N.C. Ct. App. Mar. 6, \n2018) (noting that “this Court has previously determined” an order requiring a party \nto immediately make a significant payment “affected a substantial right”); Beasley v. \nBeasley, 816 S.E.2d 866, 872–73 (N.C. Ct. App. 2018) (holding that, in the family law \ncontext, ordering payment of a “not insignificant” amount of $48,188.15 in attorneys’ \nfees affected a substantial right).  Although Plaintiffs rely on North Carolina family \nlaw cases holding that the payment of attorneys’ fees do not affect a substantial right, \nnone of those decisions involve s the near-term payment of sums in an amount  \napproaching the fees and costs awarded here.  See, e.g., Johns v. Johns, No. COA07-\n1411, 2009 N.C. App. LEXIS 101, at * 9–10 (N.C. Ct. App. Feb. 3, 2009)  (attorneys’ \nfees totaling $8,516.32); Long, 155 N.C. App. at 13 3, 574 S.E.2d at 17 4 (attorneys’ \nfees of $1,980); Cox v. Cox, 133 N.C. App. 221, 233, 515 S.E.2d 61, 69 (1999) (attorneys’ \nfees of $7,500).   \nB. Other Statutes \n \n21. Plaintiffs next argue that N.C.G.S. §§ 1-289 and 1-290 and Rule 62, each of \nwhich permits enforcement of an appealed order during appeal, apply in the current \ncircumstances and that section 1-294 does not.  The Court disagrees. \n1. N.C.G.S. § 1-289 \n22. N.C.G.S. §  1-289, titled “[u]ndertaking to stay execution on money \njudgment[,]” provides, in relevant part, that “[i]f the appeal is from a judgment \ndirecting the payment of money, it does not stay the execution of the judgment unless \na written undertaking is executed on the part of the appellant, b y one or more \nsureties, as set forth  in this section.”  N.C.G.S. § 1 -289(a).  Plaintiffs contend that \nsection 1-289 applies to the deadline in the Second Fee Award because the order is a \nmoney judgment to be executed upon rather than an order to be enforced.  (Pls.’ Mem. \nOpp’n 6.)  The Second Fee Award, however, by its own terms, is an order enforceable \nby contempt, not a judgment  subject to execution, and section 1-289 applies only to \njudgments enforced by execution and not to orders enforceable  by contempt.   See \nFaught v. Faught , 50 N.C. App. 635, 639, 274 S.E.2d 883, 886 (1981)  (holding that \n“G.S. § 1 -289 [is] an exception to G.S. § 1 -294” and that  “G.S. § 1 -289 is applicable \nonly in cases involving a ‘ judgment directing the payment of money. ’ ”) ; see also  \nSimms v. Bolger , 826 S.E.2d 467, 469 (N.C. Ct. App. 2019)  (“Historically, . . . trial \ncourts had no jurisdiction to utilize contempt to enforce . . . orders while the case was \non appeal. ”); Elizabeth Brooks Scherer & Matthew Nis Leerberg, North Carolina \nAppellate Practice and Procedure  § 6.03 (2018)  (“Section 1-289 applies only to  \njudgments directing the payment of money.  An order requiring a party to take a \nspecified action within a certain period of time is not a money judgment subject to \nexecution.  As such, it can be enforced only through contempt proceedings.”). \n2. N.C.G.S. § 1-290 \n23. N.C.G.S. § 1-290 provides that:  \nIf the judgment appealed from directs the assignment or delivery of \ndocuments or personal property, the execution of the judgment is not \nstayed by appeal, unless the things required to be assigned or delivered \nare brought into court, or placed in the custody of such officer or receiver \nas the court appoints, or unless an undertaking be entered into on the \npart of the appellant, by at least two sureties, and in such amount as the \ncourt or a judge thereof directs, to the effect that the appellant will obey \nthe order of the appellate court upon the appeal. \n \nPlaintiffs contend that section 1 -290 permits enforcement of the Modified Return \nProtocol as a judgment directing the delivery of documents and personal property to \nPlaintiffs.  ( Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n  7.)  Like section 1 -289, however, “G.S. §[ ] 1 -290 . . . \nappl[ies] to judgments requiring the ‘assignment or delivery’ of personal property and \nthe ‘sale or delivery of possession’ of real property.”  Faught, 50 N.C. App. at 640–41, \n263 S.E.2d at 887 (emphasis added).  As discussed above, the Second Sanctions Order \nis not in the nature of a final judgment enforceable by execution and, for that reason, \nfalls outside section 1-290’s scope as well.    \n3. Rule 62 \n \n24. Rule 62 states in relevant part, that “[u]nless otherwise ordered by the court, \nan interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction . . . shall not be stayed \nduring the period after its entry and until an appeal is taken or during the pendency \nof an appeal.”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 62(a).  Further, where an injunction order is appealed, \nthe trial court “may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the \npendency of the appeal[.]”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 62(c).  Plaintiffs argue that Rule 62 permits \nenforcement of the Modified Return Protocol because, as part of the Second Sanctions \nOrder, the Protocol is an extension of the Court’s March 14, 2018 Temporary  \nRestraining Order, (ECF No. 7), and April 17, 2018 Preliminary Injunction, (ECF No. \n42), requiring the Titan Defendants to return Red Valve’s property, neither of which \ncan be stayed pending appeal under Rule 62(a) and each of which can be modified \nunder Rule 62(c).  (Pls.’ Mem. Opp’n 7–8.)  The Court concludes, however, that Rule \n62 does not apply to sanctions of the sort ordered here  as they are too far separated \nfrom the original injunction in this case.  \nC. Discretionary Stay \n \n25. Separate and apart from the automatic stay under section 1-294, and as an \nalternative basis for the relief ordered herein, the Court concludes it is appropriate \nunder the circumstances for the Court to exercise its inherent authority to enter a \ndiscretionary stay pending appeal of the deadlines in the Second Sanctions Order and \nin the Second Fee Award. \n26. The Court has the inherent authority to enter a discretionary stay of \nproceedings pending appeal.  See DiCesare v. Charlotte -Mecklenburg Hosp. Auth. , \n2019 NCBC LEXIS 14, at *25 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, 2019); Kornegay Family \nFarms, LLC v. Cross Creek Seed, Inc., 2016 NCBC LEXIS 30, at *22 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nApr. 20, 2016) ; Rutherford Elec. Mbrshp. Corp. , 2014 NCBC LEXIS 34, at *18; see \nalso N.C. R. Civ. P. 62; N.C. R. App. P. 8 .  Although the North Carolina appellate \ncourts have provided “limited guidance” o n whether to grant a discretionary stay \npending appeal, this Court has recognized that a trial court should consider “potential \nprejudice to the appellant.”  Vizant Techs., LLC v. YRC Worldwide, Inc., 2019 NCBC \nLEXIS 16, at * 12 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 1, 201 9); see also Rutherford Elec. Mbrshp. \nCorp., 2014 NCBC LEXIS 34, at *18.   \n27. Here, the Court concludes that requiring the Titan Defendants to negotiate \na potentially unnecessary but most certainly time-consuming and complex Modified \nReturn Protocol or pay the potentially unnecessary but very substantial Awarded \nExpenses is sufficient prejudice to the Titan Defendants to merit the Court’s entry of \na discretionary stay pending appeal. \nIII. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n28. WHEREFORE, the Court, in the exercise of its discr etion, hereby \nORDERS that the Court’s enforcement of t he parties’ obligations under paragraph \n149 of the Second Sanctions Order and paragraph 81 of the Second Fee Award shall \nbe STAYED during the pendency of the Titan Defendants’ appeal or until otherwise \nordered by the Court. \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 17th day of December, 2019. \n \n/s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III    \n     Louis A. Bledsoe, III  \n     Chief Business Court Judge "
