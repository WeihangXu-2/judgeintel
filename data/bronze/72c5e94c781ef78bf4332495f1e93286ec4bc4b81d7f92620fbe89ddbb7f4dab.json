Wagner, Jonathon D. Townsend, and \nMeagan L. Allen, for Defendant Halifax Safeguard Property LLC. \n \nBrown, Judge. \n \nI. \n \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \n3. The Court does not make findings of fact when ruling on motions to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(6).  Rather, the Court recites the allegations asserted and \ndocuments referenced in the challenged pleading —here, Intervenors’ Second \nAmended Complaint in Intervention—that are relevant and necessary to the Court’s \ndetermination of the Motions.  The following background assumes that the well -\npleaded factual allegations of the Second Amended Complaint in Intervention  are \ntrue.  See, e.g., White v. White , 296 N.C. 661, 667 (1979) (requiring the trial court to \ntreat a complaint’s well-pleaded allegations as true under Rule 12(b)(6)).   \n4. Nominal Defendant Carolina Sawmills, LP (“CSLP”) is a limited partnership \norganized under the laws of North Carolina. 4  Defendant Halifax, a North Carolina \nlimited liability company  with its registered office located in Nash County , is the \ncurrent General Partner of CSLP. 5  Halifax, in turn, is managed by a nine -member \nmanagement committee.6  Pro se plaintiffs Jia Qian, Jiangang Jiao, and Lina Li and \nthe Individual Defendants are members of Halifax as well as members of Halifax’s \n \n4 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 21.)  \n \n5 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 20.)  \n \n6 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 59.)  \n \nmanagement committee.7  Intervenor Plaintiffs (“Intervenors”) are two members of \nHalifax and thirty-three limited partners of CSLP.8 \n5. In a bid to obtain permanent residency in the United States, 151 Chinese \nnationals, including the Intervenors,  invested $500,000 each in CSLP through the \nEB-5 immigration program.9  The investment funds, totaling $75,500,000, were then \nloaned by CSLP to Klausner Lumber Two LLC (“KL2”), a sawmill, to satisfy the EB-\n5 program’s investment and job creation requirements.10  \n6. On 10 June 2020, KL2 filed for bankruptcy relief. 11  Soon after, on 21 \nSeptember 2020, Defendant Halifax was appointed as substitute General Partner of \nCSLP following a judgment in a civil action brought by several of CSLP’s limited \npartners during the KL2 bankruptcy proceeding.12   \n7. On 24 February 2023, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of \nDelaware issued an order in KL2’s bankruptcy proceeding directing KL2’s liquidating \n \n7 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 11–17.) \n \n8 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 10.)  The two members of Halifax are also within the \ngroup of thirty-three limited partners of CSLP.   \n \n9 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 8.)  By investing in CSLP, the Chinese nationals became \nlimited partners of CSLP.  \n \n10 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 9.)  \n \n11 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 9.)  \n \n12 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 9.)  \n \ntrust to distribute $31,500,000 to CSLP.13  The distribution was made to CSLP on or \nabout 14 March 2023.14 \n8. The action currently before this Court concerns the use and management of \nthe funds received by CSLP from  the KL2 bankruptcy proceeding.  According to the \nIntervenors, “[o]nce the bankruptcy proceeds were received in March 2023, there was \na 12-month period under [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]  guidance in \nwhich management should have commenced a careful and deliberative process to \ndetermine the amount of the proceeds to be reinvested for those investors requiring \nreinvestment and to be distributed to those investors not requiring reinvestment and \nto identify a suitable reinvestment target [consistent with the requirements of the \nEB-5 program].” 15  Instead, the Intervenors claim, the members of Halifax’s \nmanagement committee “immediately launched into a back -and-forth battle over \ncontrol of the [CSLP] Partnership funds and management decisions, resulting in the \nfiling of this lawsuit in April 2023.”16     \n9. In late July or early August 2023, the pro se plaintiffs, Individual \nDefendants, and Halifax  entered into a Settlement Agreement intended to resolve \nthe parties’ disputes over CSLP’s management. 17  The Settlement Agreement \n \n13 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 56.) \n \n14 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 56.) \n \n15 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 57.) \n \n16 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 57.)  \n \n17 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 58.)  \n \npurported to , among other things, (1) c all for the appointment of a Professional \nManager to handle all day -to-day operations of Halifax and CSLP 18 and (2) c reate \ntwo committees —a Redeployment Committee and a Distribution Committee —\nauthorized to submit a proposal for the redeployment and distribution of CSLP’s \nfunds.19  T he parties contested the enforceability of the Settlement Agreement , \nhowever, which resulted in a lack of resolution of the disputes over CSLP’s \nmanagement and the use of CSLP funds. 20   \n10. On 23 February 2024, the Intervenors filed a Complaint in Intervention  \nseeking “a judicial determination of their rights as to compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement and management decisions regarding the redeployment of partnership \nfunds, and management decisions regarding the distribution of partnership funds.”21  \nIntervenors amended their complaint as a matter of right, adding additional claims \n \n18 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 61.) \n \n19 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 62.) \n \n20 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 58; see also Joint Mot. for Order Approving Settlement \nAgreement, Ex. A – Resol. & Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 42.1.)  This Court has \npreviously declined to enforce the terms of the parties’ Settlement Agreement.  In an Order \nissued on 16 February 2024, the Court held that “far too many issues of material fact remain \nthat preclude the Court from enforcing the terms contained in the parties’ Settlement \n[Agreement].”  (Order on Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss or, Alt., Enforce Settlement Agreement 3, ECF \nNo. 126.)  The Court furthe r concluded that Defendants “failed to establish that the \nSettlement was a full and final settlement which entitles them to enforcement.” (Order on \nDefs.’ Mot. Dismiss or, Alt., Enforce Settlement Agreement 4.)  In an Order issued on 13 June \n2024, the Court again found that “there are too many genuine and disputed issues of material \nfact to rule definitively that the Settlement Agreement, and the provisions found therein, are \nenforceable.”  (Order on Mot. Enf’t Settlement Agreement & Renewed Mot. Appointmen t \nReceiver 6, ECF No. 196.)    \n \n21 (Compl. Intervention ¶ 1, ECF No. 146.) \n \nfor declaratory judgment, breach of fiduciary duty, and appointment of a general \nreceiver.22 \n11. On 14 August 2024, Intervenors moved the Court to amend their complaint \na second time “based on evidence recently obtained by counsel in the lawsuit.”23  The \nCourt granted the motion in part and Intervenors filed the Second Amended \nComplaint in Intervention on 4 November 2024.24 \n12. In their Second Amended Complaint in Intervention, Intervenors allege \n“[Halifax] and those controlling it have repeatedly violated their role as the steward \nof [CSLP] affairs and funds for their own benefit.”25  Specifically, Intervenors allege, \nHalifax and those controlling it have: \na. “engineered a self -dealing loan plan by which they received repayment of \nthree times the amount loaned in a scheme concealed from the [CSLP] \nlimited partners”;26 \nb. “recklessly invested more than $14 million of [CSLP] funds in [Titanium \nESG,] a highly speculative energy -token startup company [,] without \n \n22 (Am. Compl. Intervention, ECF No. 148.)  \n \n23 (Intervenors’ Mot. Leave File Second Am. Compl. 2, ECF No. 220.) \n \n24 (Order Intervenors’ Mot. Leave File Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 247.) \n \n25 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 2.) \n \n26 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 3.) \n \nmeaningful collateral and without authorization, over the objections of \n[CSLP’s] Professional Manager and its limited partners”;27 \nc. “acted in bad faith by promising distribution of [CSLP] capital but then, \nonce they had succeeded in serving their own interests through the \nreinvestment of [CSLP] capital, they reneged on their commitment and \nhave raised a series of pretextual obstacles to any distribution”;28 and \nd. misused . . . [CSLP] capital for the unauthorized payment of legal fees to \nfund an internecine conflict at the [Halifax] management level and to fund \nthe litigation efforts of one faction of [CSLP’s] limited partners against the \nother.”29 \n13. Due to the above-alleged acts, Intervenors assert claims against (i) Halifax, \nPlaintiff Jia Qian, Plaintiff Jiangang Jiao, Plaintiff Lina Li, and the Individual \nDefendants for breach of fiduciary duty; (ii) Halifax and the Individual Defendants \nfor breach of fiduciary duty  and preliminary and permanent injunction ; and (iii) \nHalifax for breach of the Limited Partnership Agreement  and breach of fiduciary \nduty.30  Additionally, Intervenors seek appointment of a receiver and a “declaration \nfrom this Court that the First Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement is \nvalid and that the General Partner is required to distribute to investors, net of \n \n27 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 4.) \n \n28 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 5.) \n \n29 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 6.) \n \n30 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention.) \n \nexpenses, pro rata funds for each investor based on the amount recovered by the \nPartnership in the bankruptcy proceeding.”31 \n14. The Individual Defendants and Halifax filed their m otions to dismiss \nIntervenors’ Second Amended Complaint on 12 November 2024 and 26 November \n2024, respectively.  After full briefing, the Court held a hearing on the Motions on 29 \nApril 2025, at which Intervenors, Halifax, and the Individual Defendants wer e \nrepresented by counsel.32  The Motions are now ripe for resolution. \nII. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n15. In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court may consider \nthe pleading and “any exhibits attached to the [pleading,]”  Krawiec v. Manly , 370 \nN.C. 602, 606 (2018), in order to determine “whether the pleadings, when taken as \ntrue, are legally sufficient to satisfy the elements of at least some legally recognized \nclaim.”  Arroyo v. Scottie’s Pro. Window Cleaning, Inc., 120 N.C. App. 154, 158 (1995).  \nAdditionally, a court may “properly consider documents which are the subject of a \nplaintiff’s complaint and to which the complaint specifically refers even though they \nare presented by the defendant.”  Oberlin Cap., L.P. v. Slavin , 147 N.C. App. 52, 60 \n(2001). \n16. Under Rule 12(b)(6), “the trial court is to construe the pleading liberally and \nin the light most favorable to the plaintiff, taking as true and admitted all  \n \n31 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 152.) \n \n32 The pro se Plaintiffs—Jia Qian, Jiangang Jiao, and Lina Li —also participated in the \nhearing with the assistance of a Mandarin language interpreter provided by the Court. \nwell-pleaded factual allegations contained within the [pleading].” Donovan v. \nFiumara, 114 N.C. App. 524, 526 (1994) (cleaned up); see also Sykes v. Health Network \nSols., Inc., 372 N.C. 326, 332 (recognizing that, under Rule 12(b)(6), the allegations \nof the complaint should be viewed as “true and in the light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party” (cleaned up) ).  The claim is not to be dismissed unless it appears \nbeyond doubt that the non-moving party could prove no set of facts in support of his \nclaim which would entitle him to relief.  U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Pinkney , 369 N.C. \n723, 726 (2017).  The Supreme Court of North Carolina has determined that \n“dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is proper when ‘(1) the complaint on its face \nreveals that no law supports the plaintiff’s claim; (2) the complaint on its face reveals \nthe absence of facts sufficient to make a good claim; or (3) the complaint discloses \nsome fact that necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s claim.’” Corwin v. Brit. Am. Tobacco \nPLC, 371 N.C. 60 5, 615 (2018) (quoting Wood v. Guilford Cnty. , 355 N.C. 161, 166 \n(2002)).  \nIII. \nANALYSIS \n17. Halifax’s and the Individual Defendants’ Motions seek to dismiss all claims \nasserted against them in Intervenors’ Second Amended Complaint in Intervention \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  The Court will take up each claim in turn. \nA. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (against Halifax, Plaintiffs, and Individual \nDefendants) \n \n18. In their first claim for breach of fiduciary duty, Intervenors allege Halifax , \nPlaintiffs, and the Individual Defendants owe fiduciary duties to CSLP and CSLP’s \nlimited partners. 33  Intervenors contend Halifax, Plaintiffs, and the Individual \nDefendants breached their fiduciary duties to CSLP and CSLP’s limited partners by \n“approving and engaging in the improper loan program, borrowing money from \nmembers of the management committee a nd certain other selected members of \n[Halifax] on terms that were unfair to [CSLP]” and by “fail[ing] to provide proper \nnotice of the details of the loan program to the limited partners and fail[ing] to seek \nor obtain their approval.”34 \n19. To state a claim for  breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff must plead the \nexistence of a fiduciary duty, a breach of that duty, and injury proximately caused by \nthe breach.  See, e.g., Green v. Freeman, 367 N.C. 136, 141 (2013).  Where there is no \nfiduciary duty, there can be no claim for its breach.  Governor’s Club Inc. v. Governors \nClub Ltd. P’ship, 152 N.C. App. 240, 247 (2002).    \n20. A fiduciary relationship is one in which “there has been a special \nconfidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good \nfaith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing \nconfidence.”  CommScope Credit Union v. Butler & Burke, LLP, 369 N.C. 48, 52 \n(2016).  “[I]t extends to any possible case in which a fiduciary relationship exists in \nfact, and in which there is confidence reposed on one side, and resulting domination \nand influence on the other.”  Dalton v. Camp, 353 N.C. 647, 651–52 (quoting Abbitt v. \nGregory, 201 N.C. 577, 598 (1931)) (emphasis in original).  “North Carolina recognizes \n \n33 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 112–13.) \n \n34 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 115–16.) \n \ntwo types of fiduciary relationships: de jure, or those imposed by operation of law, \nand de facto, or those arising from the particular facts and circumstances constituting \nand surrounding the relationship.”  Hager v. Smithfield E. Health Holdings, LLC, \n264 N.C. App. 350, 355 (2019) (citing Lockerman v. S. River Elec. Mbrshp. Corp., 250 \nN.C. App. 631, 635 (2016)). \nIntervenors have sufficiently alleged demand futility and that Halifax \nengaged in self-dealing to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6). \n \n21. Preliminarily, Halifax does not contest that it, as general partner of CSLP, \nowes a de jure fiduciary duty both to CSLP and the limited partners.  See He Chi v. \nN. Riverfront Marina & Hotel LLLP , 2023 NCBC LEXIS 89, at *44 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJuly 27, 2023) (“[U]nder the North Carolina Uniform Limited Partnership Act, a \ngeneral partner . . . owes limited partners fiduciary duties as a matter of law.” (citing \nN.C.G.S. § 59-403)); N.C.G.S. § 59-51.  Rather, Halifax contends that the Intervenors’ \nfirst claim for relief should be dismissed because (1) Intervenors ’ breach of fiduciary \nduty claims are derivative in nature and Intervenors  “cannot assert a demand and \ntheir vague, conclusory allegations of demand futility wholly fail to satisfy both their \nstatutorily required pre- suit demand and the heightened pleading standard \ndemanded by North Carolina law to protect Halifax’s substantive rights” and (2) “they \nfail to plead facts adequately rebutting the business judgment rule.”35 \n \n35 (Br. Halifax Safeguard Property, LLC Supp. Mot. Dismiss Intervenors’ Second Am. Compl. \nIntervention [hereinafter, “Halifax Br. Supp.”] 16, 24, ECF No. 259 (emphasis in original).) \n \n22. “A limited partner may bring an action in the right of a limited partnership \nto recover a judgment in its favor if general partners with authority to do so have \nrefused to bring the action or if an effort to cause those general partners to bring the \naction is not likely to succeed.”  N.C.G.S. § 59 -1001.  “In a derivative action, the \ncomplaint shall set forth with particularity the effort of the plaintiff to secure \ninitiation of the action by a general partner or the reasons for not making the effort .” \nN.C.G.S. § 59 -1003 (emphasis added).  Here, Intervenors allege in their Second \nAmended Complaint that: \n[a]ny effort to cause [Halifax to] pursue [CSLP’s] claims as set forth \nherein against itself and against Plaintiffs and Individual Defendants is \nnot likely to succeed because: [Halifax] is controlled by Defendants and \nthose aligned with them, Plaintiffs an d Individual Defendants \ncollectively comprise seven of the nine members of the management \ncommittee of [Halifax] and have personally benefitted from the wrongs \nset forth herein, [Halifax] has not taken any action to date to address \nthese issues despite knowing about them for many months at least, and \n[Halifax’s] litigation counsel in this case was involved in representing \nIndividual Defendants with respect to the challenged redeployment \nactions and use of [CSLP] funds to pay legal fees.36            \n \nThe Court determines that Intervenors have sufficiently alleged their reasons for not \nmaking a demand on Halifax as general partner of CSLP to survive a motion to \ndismiss.37 \n \n36 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 110.) \n \n37 Additionally, this Court previously determined in its Order on Intervenors’ Motion for \nLeave to file Second Amended Complaint that “given the circumstances of this case, along \nwith allegations found within the Proposed Second Amended Complaint, that Intervenors \nhave sufficiently alleged, at least at the pleading stage, their reasons for not making a \ndemand on [Halifax] as general partner of CSLP.”  (Order Intervenors’ Mot. Leave File  \nSecond Am. Compl. 7.)  The Court declines to reconsider its position on demand futility at \nthis stage of the proceedings.    \n23. Regarding the second aspect of Halifax’s argument, “i n a limited \npartnership, the duty of the general partner to the limited partners is a duty to \ndischarge his responsibilities according to the business judgment rule.”  Jackson v. \nMarshall, 140 N.C. App. 504, 510 (2000).  Our Court of Appeals has explained the \nrule as follows: \nThe business judgment rule operates primarily as a rule of evidence or \njudicial review and creates, first, an initial evidentiary presumption that \nin making a decision the directors acted with due care (i.e., on an \ninformed basis) and in good faith in the honest belief that their action \nwas in the best interest of the corporation, and second, absent rebuttal \nof the initial presumption, a powerful substantive presumption that a \ndecision by a loyal and informed board will not be overturned by a court \nunless it cannot be attributed to any rational business purpose. \n \nMauck v. Cherry Oil Co., 2022 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *28 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 2, 2022) \n(quoting Seraph Garrison, LLC v. Garrison , 247 N.C. App. 115, 122 (2016)).  To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss in the face of the business judgment rule, “the Complaint \nmust allege, in other than conclusory terms, that the board was inattentive or \nuninformed, acted in bad faith, or that the board’s decision was unreasonable.”  Cone \nv. Blue Gem, Inc. , 2023 NCBC LEXI S 127, at *19 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 13, 2023) \n(quoting Green v. Con dra, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 20, at *20 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 14, \n2009)).  Conclusory assertions in the pleadings are insufficient and allegations of bad \nfaith must be pleaded through facts.  See Mauck, 2022 NCBC LEXIS 39, at *28–29.   \n24. Here, Intervenors allege (1) a member of Halifax’s management committee \nsolicited loans to be made to CSLP by management committee members, pledging \nthat CSLP would repay these members three times the loan amounts, 38 (2) bank \n \n38 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 76.) \nrecords indicate that all but one of the management committee members loaned over \n$1 million to CSLP and received more than $3 million of CSLP funds in repayment,39 \n(3) “[c]ounsel for Intervenors repeatedly asked counsel for the management \ncommittee members to set forth their position on the loans and to explain how these \nloans could be consistent with their fiduciary duties[,]” 40 and (4) neither Halifax nor \nthe management committee “made any disclosure concerning this triple repayment \nloan to the limited partners of CSLP, nor was the approval of [CSLP’s] limited \npartners ever sought or obtained.” 41  Such allegations of financial self -dealing are \nsufficient to overcome the protections afforded by the business judgment rule at the \n12(b)(6) stage.  Vernon v. Cuomo, 2009 NCBC LEXIS 1, at *38 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. \n17, 2009) (“[T]he protection . . . afforded by the business judgment rule does not apply \nwhere the plaintiff has made an adequate showing that the directors breached their \nduty of loyalty . . . by having . . . engaged in self-dealing[.]”); see also Bandy v. A Perfect \nFit for You, Inc. , 2018 NCBC LEXIS 21, at *14– 15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 7, 2018) \n(denying motion to dismiss breach of fiduciary duty claim where allegations included \na sole director’s failure to stop the corporation “from making fraudulent Medicaid \nreimbursement claims” and engaging in “self-dealing transactions to transfer money \nfrom [the corporation] to herself”).   Accordingly, Halifax’s motion to dismiss \nIntervenors’ claim for breach of fiduciary duty is DENIED.     \n \n39 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 76.) \n \n40 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 77.) \n \n41 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 77.) \nThe Individual Defendants are not in a de jure or de facto fiduciary \nrelationship with CSLP or CSLP’s limited partners and, hence, cannot be \nliable for breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n25. Individual Defendants similarly seek to dismiss Intervenors’ first claim for \nbreach of fiduciary duty, contending “Individual Defendants do not owe CSLP a \nfiduciary duty” and, thus, cannot be held liable for breach of fiduciary duty. 42  The  \nCourt agrees. \n26. The Individual Defendants are members of Halifax as well as members of \nHalifax’s nine-member management committee.43  Members of an LLC which is the \ngeneral partner of a limited partnership do not owe any fiduciary duties as a matter \nof law to the limited partnership, even if those members serve on the management \ncommittee of the general partner.  See He Chi, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 89, at *41.  To hold \notherwise would disregard the protections afforded by the corporate form.44 \n27. Furthermore, as this Court has stated previously, the Individual \nDefendants do not owe de facto fiduciary duties to CSLP.  “ The standard for finding \n \n42 (Defs.’ Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Intervenors’ Second Am. Compl. Intervention [hereinafter, \n“Individual Defs.’ Br. Supp.”] 7, ECF No. 253.) \n \n43 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 14–17.) \n \n44 Additionally, this Court previously determined in its Order on Intervenors’ Motion for \nLeave to file Second Amended Complaint that  \n \n[to t]he extent any fiduciary duties are owed to CSLP, they are owed by \n[Halifax] as the general partner to CSLP as the limited partnership.  Beyond \nthose duties, the Court determines that the Individual Defendants do not owe \nfiduciary duties as a matter of la w to the limited partnership they manage \nindirectly through their management of [Halifax].   \n \n(Order Intervenors’ Mot. Leave File Second Am. Compl. 11.)  The Court similarly declines to \nreconsider its position on the fiduciary duties owed by Individual Defendants.    \na de facto fiduciary relationship is a demanding one: Only when one party figuratively \nholds all the cards—all the financial power or technical information, for example—\nhave North Carolina courts found that the special circumstance of a fiduciary \nrelationship has arisen.”  Lockerman v. S. River Elec. Mbrshp. Corp., 250 N.C. App. \n631, 636 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  It is insufficient to \nallege mere influence over another’s affairs.  Hartsell v. Mindpath Care Ctrs., 2022 \nNCBC LEXIS 130, at **11 (N.C. Super. Ct. Nov. 2, 2022).   \n28. Thus, the question here is whether Intervenors have  sufficiently pled that \nthe Individual Defendants “held all the cards.”   In the Second Amended Complaint \nIntervenors allege “Individual Defendants have used their power over CSLP to make \nthe unilateral, self -dealing decision to misappropriate [CSLP] funds, which would \nonly be possible in a situation where the Defendants ‘hold all the cards.’”45  However, \nthe Individual Defendants consist of a minority of Halifax’s management committee \nand the membership of the management committee has changed in composition \nthroughout this litigation.  Furthermore, as this Court has previously stated, “[i]t is \nclear that [Halifax], as general partner of CSLP —not the Individual Defendants —\nheld some cards as it relates to CSLP.” 46  As no de jure or de facto fiduciary \nrelationship exists between Individual Defendants and CSLP, the Court GRANTS \n \n45 (Intervenors’ Br. Opp. Defs.’ Mot. Dismiss Intervenors’ Second Am. Compl. Intervention \n[hereinafter, “Intervenors’ Br. Opp. Individual Defs.’ Br. Supp.”] 8, ECF No. 276 ; see also \nSecond Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 76–80.) \n \n46 (Order Intervenors’ Mot. Leave File Second Am. Compl. 11.) \n \nIndividual Defendants’ Motion to dismiss Intervenors’ first claim for breach of \nfiduciary duty. \n29. In their response brief, Intervenors also contend that “Individual \nDefendants can be liable for breach of fiduciary duty under a veil -piercing theory.”47  \nHowever, as Individual Defendants state, Intervenors neither allege that the \ncorporate veil should be pierced in their Second Amended Complaint in Intervention \nnor does their brief set out any facts that support application of a veil -piercing \ntheory.48  Thus, the Court declines to address Intervenors’ veil-piercing argument.   \nB. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (against Halifax, Plaintiffs, and Individual \nDefendants) \n \n30. In their second claim for breach of fiduciary duty, Intervenors allege Halifax \nand Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to CSLP and CSLP’s \nlimited partners by “executing a promissory note in the amount of $16.4 million to \nTitanium ESG on a redeployment plan without obtaining the approval of the limited \npartners of CSLP and failed to provide proper notice of the details of the payments \nand promissory note to the limited partners.” 49  Halifax seeks dismissal of \nIntervenors’ second claim, contending it “is barred by the protections afforded under \nthe business judgment rule” and Intervenors “fail[] to allege demand futility with \n \n47 (Intervenors’ Br. Opp. Individual Defs.’ Br. Supp. 8.) \n \n48 (Defs.’ Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Intervenors’ Second Am. Compl. Intervention \n[hereinafter, “Individual Defs.’ Reply”] 6, ECF No. 279.) \n \n49 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 130.) \n \nsufficient particularity.” 50  Individual Defendants similarly seek dismissal of \nIntervenors’ claim, arguing “Individual Defendants do not owe CSLP a fiduciary \nduty.”51  \n31. As stated previously, the Court holds that no de jure or de facto fiduciary \nrelationship exists between Individual Defendants and CSLP.52  Therefore, the Court \nsimilarly GRANTS Individual Defendants’ Motion to dismiss Intervenors’ second \nclaim for breach of fiduciary duty. \n32. Regarding the first aspect of Halifax’s argument, as Intervenors state in \ntheir response brief, Halifax “attempts to use extrinsic evidence to contradict \n[Intervenors’] allegations[.]”53  At the motion to dismiss stage,  “the trial court is to \nconstrue the pleading liberally and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, taking \nas true and admitted all well -pleaded factual allegations contained within the \n[pleading][,]” Donovan, 114 N.C. App. at 526 (cleaned up) , and a claim is not to be \ndismissed unless it appears beyond doubt that the non-moving party could prove no \nset of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief , U.S. Bank Nat’l \nAss’n, 369 N.C. at 726.   It is not for the Court to decide, at this stage of the \nproceedings, whether Intervenors will ultimately succeed on their claim.   \n \n50 (Halifax Br. Supp. 17, 24.) \n \n51 (Individual Defs.’ Br. Supp. 7.) \n \n52 (Supra ¶¶ 25–28.) \n \n53 (Intervenors’ Br. Opp. Def. HSP’s Mot. Dismiss Intervenors’ Second Am. Compl. \nIntervention 7, ECF No. 278.) \n \n33. As stated above, t o survive a motion to dismiss in the face of the business \njudgment rule, “the Complaint must  [only] allege, in other than conclusory terms, \nthat the board was inattentive or uninformed, acted in bad faith, or that the board’s \ndecision was unreasonable.”  Cone, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 127, at *19.  Here, Intervenors \nallege that: \na. “Titanium ESG is a start- up entity, having been incorporated in January \n2024, with no meaningful business operations to date, no track record, and \nno revenue”;54  \nb. “The Professional Manager hired by [Halifax’s] management committee \nrefused to implement the Titanium ESG redeployment plan because it \nwould constitute a breach of fiduciary duties since the investment ‘would \nbe to a startup in need of seed money in a risky industry sector that is \nsubject t o considerable regulatory flux.  Worse, no collateral of any \nsubstance was offered to secure the investment’”;55 \nc. “The Professional Manager discussed the proposed redeployment to \nTitanium ESG with [Halifax’s] EB -5 immigration counsel, who concurred \nwith the Professional Manager’s view that the Titanium ESG investment \nwas improper”;56 and \n \n54 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 95.) \n \n55 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 96.) \n \n56 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 97.) \n \nd. “[Halifax], however, under the control of the Individual Defendants, defied \nthe Professional Manager and the interests of CSLP by executing a \npromissory note in the amount of $16.4 million to Titanium ESG on a \nredeployment plan without obtaining the approv al of the limited partners \nof CSLP and failed to provide proper notice of the details of the payments \nand promissory note to the limited partners.”57 \nBased on the above, the Court concludes that Intervenors have alleged sufficient non-\nconclusory facts that Halifax “was inattentive or uninformed, acted in bad faith, or \nthat the board’s decision was unreasonable.”   Cone, 2023 NCBC LEXIS 127, at *19.  \nTherefore, the Court DENIES Halifax’s motion to dismiss Intervenors’ second claim \nfor breach of fiduciary duty.58     \nC. Declaratory Judgment as to the Distribution of Partnership Capital and \nDistribution Amount \n \n34. Halifax and Individual Defendants next seek to dismiss Intervenors’ claim \nfor declaratory judgment.  In their third claim for relief, Intervenors “seek a \ndeclaration from this Court that the First Amendment to the Limited Partnership \nAgreement is valid and that [Halifax] is required to distribute to investors, net of \nexpenses, pro rata funds for each investor based on the amount recovered by the \nPartnership in the bankruptcy proceeding.”59   \n \n57 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 130.) \n \n58 The Court declines to address Halifax’s argument that Intervenors “fail[] to allege demand \nfutility with sufficient particularity” as the Court has previously concluded that Intervenors’ \nSecond Amended Complaint adequately alleges demand futility.  (See supra ¶¶ 21–22.) \n \n59 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 152.) \n35. Under the Declaratory Judgment Act, “[a]ny person interested under \na . . . written contract or other writings constituting a contract, or whose rights, \nstatus or other legal relations are affected by a . . . contract . . ., may have determined \nany question of construction or validity arising under the . . . contract . . ., and obtain \na declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.”  N.C.G.S. § 1-254.  \nWhen asserting a claim for declaratory judgment, the claimant “must set forth in his \npleading all facts necessary to disclose the existence of an actual controversy between \nthe parties . . . with regard to their respective rights and duties[.]”  Lide v. Mears, 231 \nN.C. 111, 118 (1949).  A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is “seldom an \nappropriate pleading in actions for declaratory judgments, and will not be allowed \nsimply because the plaintiff may not be able to prevail.  It is allowed only when the \nrecord clearly shows that there is no basis for declaratory relief as when the complaint \ndoes not allege an actual, genuine existing controversy.”  N.C. Consumers Power, Inc. \nv. Duke Power Co., 285 N.C. 434, 439 (1974) (emphasis added).   \n36. In seeking to dismiss Intervenors ’ claim for declaratory judgment, Halifax \ncontends that (1) the amendment is not proper or enforceable and (2) the amendment, \neven if it was validly adopted and enforceable, does not require any distribution. 60  \nIndividual Defendants additionally argue Intervenors’ declaratory judgment claim \nfails with respect to them because “the claim will not clarify or settle legal relations \nbetween CSLP and the Individual Defendants.”61 \n \n60 (Halifax Br. Supp. 10–16.) \n \n61 (Individual Defs.’ Br. Supp. 10.) \n \n37. As stated earlier, in deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the C ourt must treat \nthe well -pleaded allegations of the complaint as true and view the facts and \npermissible inferences in the light most favorable to the non -moving party.  A t this \nstage in litigation, the Court does “not predetermine the likelihood that [Intervenors] \nwill win other pretrial motions, defeat affirmative defenses, or ultimately succeed on \nthe merits of [their] case.”  K.H. v. Dixon, 296 N.C. App. 62, 74 (2024) (quoting Craig \nv. New Hanover Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 363 N.C. 334, 341 (2009)) ; see also Davis Next \nFriend LaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 654  (1999) (“The \nissue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims.”).  Here, as Intervenors state, Halifax \n“seeks to dismiss the declarat ory judgment claim on the basis that Intervenors will \nnot ultimately be entitled after trial to the declaration they seek.” 62  This is the \nincorrect legal standard at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage; at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, \nIntervenors’ need only plead the existence of an actual controversy between the \nparties.  Intervenors’ allegations establish a genuine controversy over the validity \nand enforceability of the First Amendment to the Limited Partnership Agreement \nand whether Halifax is required to make distributions to Intervenors.  Therefore, the \nCourt DENIES Halifax’s Motion as to the claim for declaratory judgment. \n38. Regarding Individual Defendants’ argument, Individual Defendants confuse \nwhat is required to sustain a claim for declaratory judgment at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage \n \n62 (Intervenors’ Br. Opp. Def. HSP’s Mot. Dismiss Intervenors’ Second Am. Compl. \nIntervention 3.) \n \nwith when a Court has discretion to decline a request for declaratory relief.  Certainly, \npursuant to N.C.G.S. § 1 -257 (Discretion of Court), a trial court ha s discretion to \n“decline a request for declaratory relief when the requested declaration will serve no \nuseful purpose in clarifying or settling the legal relations at issue [.]”  Chambers v. \nMoses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. , 2021 NCBC LEXIS 63, at *4 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 19, \n2021) (quoting Augur v. Augur , 356 N.C. 582, 588 –89 (2002)).  All Intervenors are \nrequired to plead with regard to this claim to survive a motion dismiss is the existence \nof an actual controversy.  Intervenors’ allegations, as stated above, establish a \ngenuine controversy.  Furthermore, at this stage in the proceedings, the Court cannot \ndefinitively state that Intervenors’ declaratory judgment claim will serve no useful \npurpose in clarifying legal relations between the Intervenors and Individual \nDefendants.   Thus, Individual Defendants’ Motion as to Intervenors’ claim for \ndeclaratory judgment is similarly DENIED.   \nD. Breach of Contract (against Halifax) \n39. Intervenors’ claim against Halifax for breach of contract is premised on \nHalifax’s alleged breach of the Limited Partnership Agreement by “us[ing] over $1 \nmillion of [CSLP] funds to date to finance the litigation efforts of Plaintiffs and \nIndividual Defendants against other limited partners and to finance the appearance \nand assertion of claims by [Halifax] in this litigation.”63  Intervenors contend, “[w]hile \nHalifax is entitled to reimbursement of legitimate expenses relating to [CSLP] \nbusiness, [Halifax] is not permitted to use [CSLP] funds for internal governance \n \n63 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 158.) \n \ndisputes at the [Halifax] level.”64  In particular, Intervenors allege, Halifax breached \nsection 5.06(a) of the Limited Partnership Agreement which provides that:  \nTo the maximum extent permitted by law, the Partnership [(CSLP)] \nshall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the General Partner \n[(Halifax)] and its Affiliates (including the Regional Center) and their \nshareholders, members, managers, officers, directors, a gents, \nemployees, representatives, attorneys, accountants, consultants and \nother persons operating on its behalf from and against any loss, liability, \ndamage, cost, or expense (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising \nout of or alleged to arise out of  any demands, claims, suits, actions, or \nproceedings against the General Partner, by reason of any act or \nomission performed by it (including its employees and agents) while \nacting in good faith on behalf of the Partnership and within the scope of \nthe authority of the General Partner pursuant to this Agreement, and \nany amount expended in any settlement of any such claim of liability, \nloss, or damage; provided, however, that ( i) the General Partner must \nhave in good faith believed that such action was in the  best interests of \nthe Partnership, and such course of action or inaction must not have \nconstituted breach of its fiduciary duty; and (ii) any such \nindemnification shall be recoverable from the assets of the Partnership, \nnot from the assets of the Limited Partner, and no Partner shall be \npersonally liable therefore.  This indemnity shall be operative only \nin the context of third -party suits, and not in connection with \ndemands, claims, suits, actions or proceedings initiated by any \nPartner or any Affiliate thereof against another Partner.   In no \nevent, however, shall a Limited Partner bring suit against the General \nPartner, or recover damages from the General Partner, in an amount \nthat exceeds the amount invested by the Limited Partner in the \nPartnership.65 \n \n40. “Unlike claims subject to Rule 9, a claim for breach of contract is not subject \nto heightened pleading standards[.]”  AYM Techs., LLC. v. Rodgers, 2018 NCBC \nLEXIS 14, at *52– 53 (N.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 9, 2018).  “The elements of a claim for \n \n64 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 155.) \n \n65 (Br. Supp. Mot. Appoint Receiver, Ex. A- Partnership Agreement, ECF No. 83.1 (emphasis \nadded).) \n \nbreach of contract are (1) existence of a valid contract and (2) breach of the terms of \nthat contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, 26 (2000).  “Thus, in any breach of \ncontract action, the complaint must allege the existence of a contract between the \nplaintiff and the defendant, the specific provisions breached, the facts constituting \nthe breach, and the amount of d amages resulting to the plaintiff from such breach.”  \nHowe v. Links Club Condo. Ass’n, 263 N.C. App. 130, 139 (2018) (cleaned up). \n41. Halifax argues that the “Partnership Agreement allows Halifax to be \nreimbursed for expenses, including attorneys’ fees.” 66  Specifically, Halifax contends \nthat “Intervenors focus exclusively on the indemnification and advancement \nprovisions of the [Limited Partnership Agreement], which grant Halifax certain \nrights to demand indemnification from CSLP . . . [even though] [o]ther p rovisions \nclearly provide that Halifax’s costs and expenses incurred to perform its duties as \ngeneral partner are reimbursable even where such reimbursement could be read to \ncontradict other provisions in the [Limited Partnership Agreement].”67    \n42. Halifax’s contention ignores, however, that the trial court must “take the \nallegations in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the \nplaintiff’s favor” when evaluating whether a complaint adequately states a claim for \nrelief for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6).  New Hanover Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v. Stein , 380 \nN.C. 94, 107 (2022) (quoting N.C. Consumers Power, 285 N.C. at 439).  As previously \n \n66 (Halifax Br. Supp. 20.) \n \n67 (Halifax Br. Supp. 20.) \n \nstated, it is not for the Court to decide, at this stage of the proceedings, whether \nIntervenors will ultimately succeed on their claim.   \n43. Here, Intervenors plea d that the “Limited Partnership Agreement \nconstitutes a binding agreement between [CSLP], the Limited Partners, and \n[Halifax][,]”68 that Halifax used CSLP funds “to finance the litigation efforts of \nPlaintiffs and Individual Defendants against other limited partners and to finance \nthe appearance and assertion of claims by [Halifax] in this litigation[,]”69 and that, in \nso doing, Halifax breached section 5.06(a) of the Limited Partnership Agreement. 70  \nIntervenors identify the specific contract provision that was allegedly breached \n(Section 5.06—Indemnification of General Partner), the facts constituting the alleged \nbreach, and the amount of damages resulting from the breach (in excess of $1 million).  \nSee Howe, 263 N.C. App. at 139.  Since Intervenors have met this low bar, the Court \nshall DENY Halifax’s Motion as to Intervenors’ claim for breach of contract. \nE. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (against Halifax) \n44. Intervenors next allege that Halifax breached its fiduciary duties to CSLP \nand CSLP’s limited partners by (1) “us[ing] over $1 million of [CSLP] funds to date to \nfinance the litigation efforts of Plaintiffs and Individual Defendants against other \nlimited partners and to finance the appearance and assertion of claims by [Halifax] \n \n68 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 154.) \n \n69 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 158.) \n \n70 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 157.) \n \nin this litigation” 71 and (2) “improperly transferr[ing] $230,000 out of a [CSLP] \naccount to Financial Advisors relating to the Titanium ESG investment.” 72  Halifax \nseeks dismissal of this claim, contending that it did not breach its fiduciary duties to \nCSLP because the “Partnership Agreement allows Halifax to be reimbursed for \nexpenses, including attorneys’ fees” 73 for the same reasons stated in response to \nIntervenors’ breach of contract claim. \n45. Halifax’s argument, as with the breach of contract claim, focuses on whether \nIntervenors will ultimately succeed on their claim.  At the motion to dismiss stage, to \nstate a claim for breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff need only plead the existence of \na fiduciary duty, a breach of that duty, and injury proximately caused by the \nbreach.  See, e.g., Green, 367 N.C. at 141.   Here, Intervenors allege that (1) Halifax, \n“as the General Partner of [CSLP], owes fiduciary duties to the Partnership and its \nlimited partners, including the duty to act with the utmost good faith and loyalty[,]”74 \n(2) Halifax breached those fiduciary duties by misusing CSLP funds, 75 and (3) “as a \ndirect and proximate result of [Halifax’s] breaches of fiduciary duty, [CSLP] has \nsuffered [over $1 million of] financial harm.”76  The Court concludes Intervenors have \n \n71 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 168.) \n \n72 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 173.) \n \n73 (Halifax Br. Supp. 20.) \n \n74 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 163.) \n  \n75 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 168–74.) \n \n76 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 168, 173, 176.) \n \nalleged sufficient facts to plead a prima facie case for breach of fiduciary duty and to \nwithstand a motion to dismiss at the 12(b)(6) stage.  Therefore, the Court DENIES \nHalifax’s motion to dismiss this claim.        \nF. Preliminary and Permanent Injunction Against Misuse of Partnership \nFunds (against Halifax and Individual Defendants) \n \n46. In their Second Amended Complaint, Intervenors allege Halifax and \nHalifax’s management committee (1) are “using [CSLP] funds on an ongoing basis to \npay their legal fees in this lawsuit[,]” 77 (2) that “the use of [CSLP] funds for this \nlawsuit is unauthorized and a breach of fiduciary duties[,]” 78 and (3) request an \ninjunction to prevent Halifax and Individual Defendants from “continu[ing] to \ndissipate [CSLP] assets[.]” 79  Halifax and Individual Defendants seek dismissal of \nthis claim, contending “[i]njunctions are remedies, not independent causes of \naction.”80 \n47. Halifax and Individual Defendants are correct with respect to Intervenors’ \nclaim for an injunction.  It  is well settled that “injunctive relief is not a standalone \nclaim[.]”  Window World of St. Louis, Inc. v. Window World of Bloomington, Inc., 2021 \nNCBC LEXIS 88, at *15 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. 6, 2021) ; see also BIOMILQ, Inc. v. \n \n77 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 179.) \n \n78 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 183.) \n \n79 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶ 184.) \n \n80 (Halifax Br. Supp. 28  (quoting Al-Hassan v. Salloum, 2020 NCBC 14, at *3 (N.C. Super. \nCt. Feb. 20, 2020)).) \n \n \nGuiliano, 2024 NCBC LEXIS 58, at *26 (N.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 19, 2024) (Injunctive \nrelief “is an ancillary remedy, not an independent cause of action.” (citing Revelle v. \nChamblee, 168 N.C. App. 227, 230 (2005)) ); Brewster v. Powell Bail Bonding, Inc. , \n2018 NCBC LEXIS 76, at *18 (N.C. Super. Ct. July 26, 2018) (“[I]njunctions are \nremedies, not independent causes of action.”).  Since there is no standalone claim for \ninjunctive relief in North Carolina, Halifax’s and Individual Defendants’ Motions are \nGRANTED with respect to this claim.   \n48. However, the Court’s finding here does not preclude Intervenors from \nseeking injunctive relief later in this proceeding should the relevant and credible \nevidence warrant it.  Nor does this finding impact the resolution of Intervenors’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction, filed on 22 November 2024, in which Intervenors, \npursuant to Rule 65, “move[] the Court for a preliminary injunction restraining \n[Halifax] and its managers, members, agents, servants,  employees, attorneys and \nthose persons in active concert or participation with them from using [CSLP] funds \nto pay their legal fees in this lawsuit[. ]”81  The Court simply determines that \nIntervenors’ request is best addressed through Intervenors’ Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction. \nG. Appointment of Receiver \n49. Halifax and Individual Defendants lastly seek dismissal of Intervenors’ \nclaim for appointment of a receiver.  In their Second Amended Complaint, \nIntervenors request that (1) a receiver be appointed for Halifax and CSLP and (2) the \n \n81 (Intervenors’ Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 254.) \n \n“Court authorize the receiver to have full authority of [Halifax], manage the affairs \nof [CSLP] in the best interests of the partners and investors, make all decisions \nregarding the distribution of assets, make all decisions regarding the redeployment \nof assets, and assume control over and dispose of all or any portion of [CSLP’s] assets \nwherever located.”82  Individual Defendants maintain Intervenors’ claim should be \ndismissed in relation to them because the claim “is addressed to [Halifax] . . . [and] is \nnot being made against the Individual Defendants.” 83  Halifax, however, contends \nthat Intervenors’ request for appointment of a receiver has “already [been] denied by \nthis Court on two prior occasions” and “Intervenors offer no allegations reasonably \npresenting the ‘rare and drastic’ conditions necessary fo r the appointment of a \nreceiver.”84     \n50. As Halifax asserts, this Court has thrice considered the issue of appointing \na receiver of Halifax.  The Court first ruled on the issue of appointing a receiver on \n21 February 2024, where it denied Plaintiffs’ and the Intervenors’ separate requests \nfor the appointment of a general receiver over Halifax, holding that “the parties \nseeking appointment of a receiver have not shown the kind of urgent need that \nwarrants the extraordinary relief requested.” 85  On 13 June 2024, the Court \naddressed Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for Appointment of Receiver, ultimately \n \n82 (Second Am. Compl. Intervention ¶¶ 187–88.) \n \n83 (Individual Defs.’ Br. Supp. 10.) \n \n84 (Halifax Br. Supp. 26.) \n \n85 (Order on Mots. Appoint Receiver, ECF No. 143.) \n \ndenying without prejudice the motion. 86  Again, on 24 October 2024, the Court \nconsidered Intervenors’ request for appointment of a receiver, finding “[g]iven the \ncircumstances of this action and how it continues to evolve at every stage, the Court \ndetermines that Intervenors’ claim for appointmen t of receiver is not futile, as \nIntervenors have alleged facts relating to the alleged misuse of CSLP funds for self -\ndealing purposes.” 87  As this action continues to evolve at every stage, the Court \ndetermines it would be premature to foreclose the appointment of a receiver.  \nAccordingly, the Court DENIES the Motions with respect to this claim. \nIV. \nCONCLUSION \n51. WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, the Court hereby GRANTS \nin part and DENIES in part the Motions as follows: \na. Individual Defendants’ Motion is GRANTED with respect to \nIntervenors’ first and second claims for breach of fiduciary duty, and \nIntervenors’ claim s are hereby DISMISSED with prejudice to this \nextent. \nb.
