Freeman, for \nDefendant Tammy Whitworth. \n \n \nBledsoe, Judge. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \n2. Plaintiffs in Window World of Baton Rouge, LLC v. Window World, Inc. (15 \nCVS 1) (the “Roland Action”) and in Window World of St. Louis, Inc. v. Window World, \nInc. (15 CVS 2) (the “Lomax Action”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) allege that they are \nWindow World, Inc. (“WW”) franchisees.  (Roland Third Am. Compl. ¶ 2, hereinafter \n“Roland TAC”; Lomax Third Am. Compl. ¶ 2, hereinafter “Lomax TAC”.)  As the basis \nfor their claims, Plaintiffs generally contend that WW knowingly and intentionally \nwithheld information that Plaintiffs were entitled to receive under f ederal franchise \nlaw, failed to meet its commitment to provide  Plaintiffs access to the best available \nwholesale prices, and required Plaintiffs to execute license agreements that conflicted \nwith the manner in which the parties had done business in the past .  (Roland TAC \n¶¶ 3–4; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 3–4.) \n3. After discovering these allegedly improper practices, certain Plaintiffs \ncomplained to WW.  (Roland TAC ¶ 5; Lomax TAC ¶ 5.)  These Plaintiffs entered into \nnegotiations with WW, entered into a tolling agreement with the company, and \nultimately reached a settlement.   (Roland TAC ¶¶ 6–7; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 6–7.)  \nPlaintiffs allege that WW thereafter reneged on this settlement, and, subsequently, \nPlaintiffs brought this action, (Roland TAC ¶¶ 8–9; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 8–9), asserting \nclaims for breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, unfair or deceptive \ntrade practices, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent transfer , and seeking entry of \n \n \ndeclaratory judgments, reformation of Plaintiffs’ licenses, and injunctive relief .  \n(Roland TAC ¶¶ 222 –300; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 321–405.)  Plaintiffs also seek to hold \nWindow World International, LLC (“WWI”) and Ms. Whitworth liable for each cause \nof action asserted against WW under the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, \ncontending that WW is a mere instrumentality or alter ego of each.  (Roland TAC ¶ \n163; Lomax TAC ¶ 262.)   \n4. Through these Motions, Ms. Whitworth seeks to dismiss Plaintiffs’ piercing \nthe corporate veil remedy against her.  \nII. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \n5. The Court does not make findings of fact on Motions to Dismiss under Rule \n12(b)(6), but only recites those allegations included in each Complaint that are \nrelevant to the Court’s determination of the Motions.  \n6. WW is a North Carolina franchisor that operates a network of \napproximately 200 fran chises across t he United States,  including Plaintiffs’ \nfranchises.  (Roland TAC, ¶¶ 11 –13, 15, 20, 23; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 12–14, 50, 55, 58.) \nUnder their franchise relationship s with WW, Plaintiffs and other WW  franchisees \npurchase vinyl replacement windows, doors and siding, related accessories, and other \nWW trademarked items from WW ’s approved vendors.  (Roland TAC ¶  20; Lomax \nTAC ¶ 55.)  The franchisees then resell to, and install the pr oducts for, customers.   \n(Roland TAC ¶ 20; Lomax TAC ¶ 55.)   \n \n \n7. Plaintiffs allege that they became aware of numerous wrongs committed by \nWW, and in 2012, some of them sought to resolve these issues by negotiating a \nsettlement with WW.  (Roland TAC ¶¶ 3–5, 157; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 3 –5, 237.)  As part \nof these negotiations, Plaintiffs allege that the Roland Action Plaintiffs and Lomax \nAction Plaintiffs James T. Lomax III, Jonathan Gillette, WW of St. Louis, Inc., WW \nof Kansas City, Inc., and WW  of Springfield/Peoria , Inc.  entered into a tolling \nagreement with WW on April 23, 2013, which tolled all causes of action asserted by \nPlaintiffs except for two in the Lomax Action that were subsequently dismissed by \nthis Court (the “Tolling Agreement”).  (Roland TAC ¶ 157; Lomax TAC ¶ ¶ 17, 256.)  \nPlaintiffs additionally allege that WW is estopped from relying on any statute of \nlimitation or laches defense because of its unclean hands, bad faith, and  unfair or \ndeceptive conduct, (Roland TAC ¶ 160; Lomax TAC ¶ 259), and barred from relying \non any statute of limitation defense in light of the continuing wrong doctrine, (Roland \nTAC ¶ 161; Lomax TAC ¶ 260).  Plaintiffs further allege that WW’s wrongful conduct \ncontinued at all times up to the filing of the original complaint in these actions on  \nJanuary 2, 2015.  (Roland TAC ¶ 161; Lomax TAC ¶ 260.) \n8. Plaintiffs also allege that, “during the time period in which Plaintiffs’ legal \nclaims arose, all outstanding shares of the WW stock were owned and controlled by \nthe Whitworth family, first by Leon and Marie Whitworth, then by their son Todd \nWhitworth, and finally by Todd’s widow Tammy Whitworth and a revocable trust \nthat she alone controls.”  (Roland TAC ¶ 165; Lomax TAC ¶ 264.)  Plaintiffs further \ncontend that, since her husband’s death, Ms. Whitworth’s control has “permeated the \n \n \nentire company and extended from WW’s finances to its policy making and business \npractices” such that WW and its affiliates and subsidiaries “had no separate m ind, \nwill, or existence of their own apart from Tammy Whitworth[.]”  (Roland TAC ¶ 166; \nLomax TAC ¶ 265.) \n9. More specifically, Plaintiffs allege that on March 22, 2010, Ms. Whitworth \nbecame the sole shareholder of WW after the death of her husband , Todd, and \nappointed herself WW’s CEO at a time when WW had no board of directors.  (Roland \nTAC ¶ 176; Lomax TAC ¶ 275.)  Soon thereafter, but before WW reinstated its board \nof directors, Plaintiffs allege that Ms. Whitworth (i) transferred all of WW’s shares to \nthe Tammy E. Whitworth Revocable Trust  (the “ Revocable Trust”), which Ms. \nWhitworth solely controls, (Roland TAC ¶ 178; Lomax TAC ¶ 277), (ii) caused WWI \nto be created in anticipation of litigation, (Roland TAC ¶ 200; Lomax TAC ¶ 299), and \n(iii) thereafter, on June 23, 2010, caused WW’s “only significant asset” —its \nintellectual property—to be transferred to WWI, for no value, (Roland TAC  ¶¶ 169, \n178, 201, 202; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 268, 277, 300, 301).   \n10. Plaintiffs further assert that Ms. Whitworth solely owns WWI, (Roland TAC \n¶ 178; Lomax TAC ¶ 277), and created WWI to enrich herself and defraud WW’s \ncreditors, (Roland TAC ¶ 203; Lomax TAC ¶ 302).  According to Plaintiff s, these \nactions did not benefit WW and solely benefited Ms. Whitworth.  (Roland TAC ¶ 203; \nLomax TAC  ¶ 302.)  These allegations form the basis for Plaintiffs ’ claims for \nfraudulent transfer against WW .  (Roland TAC ¶¶ 286–300; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 391–\n405.) \n \n \n11. Plaintiffs also allege that Ms. Whitworth, as the sole and dominant \nshareholder of WW, amended and continued a sole source arrangemen t with \nAssociated Materials, LLC.  (Roland TAC ¶ 183; Lomax TAC ¶ 282.)  Plaintiffs further \nassert that Ms. Whitworth caused WW to maintain a secret level of pricing with \nselected franchisees.  (Roland TAC ¶¶ 129–34, 217; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 220–26, 316.)  \nBased on these allegations , Plaintiffs contend that WW breached its contract \nobligation to provide superior wholesale pricing for the products Plaintiffs purchased, \nsold, and installed as franchisees, (Roland TAC ¶¶ 247–49, 256; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 351–\n53, 360), or in the alternative, that WW has been unjustly enriched, (Roland TAC ¶ \n281; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 385 –86).  Plaintiffs additionally allege that Ms. Whitworth \ncontinued the practice  of unlawfully portraying WW as a licensor , rather than a \nfranchisor, to avoid statutory disclosure requirements.  (Roland TAC ¶ 217; Lomax ¶ \n316.)  The aforementioned conduct forms the basis for Plaintiffs ’ fraud, negligent \nmisrepresentation, and unfair or deceptive trade practice claim s against WW .  \n(Roland TAC ¶¶ 262, 271, 278; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 366, 375, 381.)  \n12. Plaintiffs also allege that from March 2 010 to February 2011 , while Ms. \nWhitworth or the Revocable Trust was WW’s sole and dominant shareholder, WW \nhad no functioning board.  (Roland TAC ¶ 206; Lomax TAC ¶ 305.)  Even after WW \nformed a board of directors in February 2011, Plaintiffs allege that the board’s actions \ncontinued to reflect decisions that advanced Ms. Whitworth’s personal interests over \nthe interests of WW.  (Roland TAC ¶¶ 209–10; Lomax ¶¶ 308–09.)  In particular, \nPlaintiffs allege that WW did not collect payments due and owing on loans in favor of \n \n \nthe Whitworth family , (Roland TAC ¶ 192; Lomax TAC ¶ 291); Ms. Whitworth \ncontinued to draw millions of dollars of WW funds for personal expenses in 2013 and \n2014, (Roland TAC ¶ 193; Lomax TAC ¶ 292); and WW continued to pay other \npersonal expenses of Ms. Whitworth , including litigation expenses, dispute \nsettlements, a motor coach, improvements to Ms. Whitworth’s residence and vacation \nhome, school activities of Ms. Whitworth ’s children, and veterinary expenses.  \n(Roland TAC ¶¶ 194–95, 211; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 293–94, 310).  \nIII. \nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n13. Plaintiffs initiated this action on January 2, 2015.  The Roland Plaintiffs \nsubsequently amended their complaint  on February 16, 2015  as a matter of right .  \nThe Lomax Plaintiffs also amended their complaint as a matter of right on April 13, \n2015.  Plaintiffs later amended their complaints a second time, on March 22, 2016 , \nafter obtaining leave of Court.  Plaintiffs moved the Court for leave to amend their \ncomplaints a third time on August  12, 2016.  The Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion \nover WW and WWI’s (collectively, the “Window World Defendants”) objections on \nJanuary 5, 2017, and Plaintiffs filed their Third Amended Complaints (the “TACs ,” \neach a “TAC”) on January 11, 2017.   \n14. The Window  World Defendants answered the Roland Action TAC on \nFebruary 13, 2017 and the Lomax Action TAC on February 14, 2017. \n15. Ms. Whitworth moved to dismiss each TAC on March 16, 2017.  \n \n \n16. On May 23, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the Objections, contending that the \nCourt sho uld not consider certain documents attached to Ms. Whitworth’s briefs \nsupporting the Motions as documents outside the TACs.  No responses to the \nObjections were filed. \n17. The Court held a hearing on the Motion s on May 24, 2017, at which all \nparties were represented by counsel.   \n18. The Motions and the Objections are now ripe for resolution. \nIV. \nPLAINTIFFS’ OBJECTIONS \n19. Plaintiffs in each case filed an objection to the Court’s consideration of \nthe October 24, 2011 Letter attached as Exhibit A to Ms. Whitworth’s Brief in Support \nof her Motion to Dismiss and the hearing and deposition transcripts attached as \nExhibits A, B, C, a nd D to her Reply Brief (the “Contested Exhibits”).1  (Notice Obj. \nMaterials Outside Pleadings 1–2, hereafter “Obj.”.)  Ms. Whitworth has not filed a \nresponse to the Objections.  As such, Plaintiffs’ Objections are considered and decided \nas uncontested.  BCR 7.6. \n20. When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “a court properly \nmay consider only evidence contained in or asserted in the pleadings.”  Jacobs v. \nRoyal Ins. Co. of Am., 128 N.C. App. 528, 530, 495 S.E.2d 185, 187 (1998).  However, \n                                            \n1  Plaintiffs did not object to the Court’s consideration of the Tolling Agreement and conceded \nat the hearing that it may be considered by the Court because the TACs specifically refer to \nand depend on the Tolling Agreement.  See Schlieper v. Johnson, 195 N.C. App. 257, 261, 672 \nS.E.2d 548, 551 (2009); Oberlin Capital, L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60, 554 S.E.2d 840, \n847 (2001).  Nonetheless, as explained infra, the Court finds it unnecessary to consider the \nTolling Agreement in deciding the Motions. \n \n \nwhere the pleading specifically refers to and depends on certain documents, the Court \nmay consider those documents without converting the motion into one for summary \njudgment under Rule 56 even if presented by the defendant.  See, e.g., Schlieper, 195 \nN.C. App. at 261, 672 S.E.2d at 551; Oberlin Capital, L.P., 147 N.C. App. at 60, 554 \nS.E.2d at 847 (holding that consultation of documents is acceptable when it “does not \ncreate justifiable surprise in the nonmoving party,” including “documents which are \nthe subject of a plaintiff’s complaint and to which the complaint specifically refers”).   \n21. At the same time, the Court may not consider materials that are \nextraneous to the pleading; otherwise, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion will be converted into a \nRule 56 motion and subject to its standards of consideration and review.  See, e.g., \nFowler v. Williamson, 39 N.C. App. 715, 717, 251 S.E.2d 889, 890−91 (1979) (“Where \nextraneous matter is received and considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \nthe motion should then be treated as a motion for summary judgment and disposed \nof in the manner and on the conditions stated in . . . Rule 56.”).  But see Schlieper, 195 \nN.C. App. at 261, 672 S.E.2d at 551 (2009) (“When documents are attached to and \nincorporated into a complaint, they become part of the complaint and may be \nconsidered in connection with a Rule 12 (b)(6) motion without converting it into a \nmotion for summary judgment.”).   \n22. Ms. Whitworth has not contested Plaintiffs’ assertion that the Contested \nExhibits are not documents to which either TAC specifically refers or depends.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs’ Objections are sustained.  The Court disregards and does not \nconsider the Contested Exhibits for purposes of the Motions. \n \n \nV. \nMS. WHITWORTH’S MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n23. Ms. Whitworth moves to dismiss “[p]ursuant  to Rule 12 of the North \nCarolina Rules of Civil Procedure,” on the grounds that “the corporate veil of [WW] \nmay not be pierced to reach  [Ms. Whitworth],  the statute of limitations bars \n[P]laintiffs’ claims, the statute of repose bars [P]laintiffs’ claims, . . . [P]laintiffs have \nfailed to join necessary parties [,]” and Plaintiffs’ failure to allege an in-state injury \nbars its claim under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75 -1.1.  (Whitworth’s Mots. Dismiss 1; \nWhitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 28–29; Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss Lomax TAC 29.)  Ms. Whitworth , therefore, seeks dismissal under Rule \n12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim and Rule 12(b)(7) for failure to join a necessary \nparty.  See N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(g).  (Whitworth’s Mots. Dismiss 1.) \nVI. \nRULE 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS \nA.  Legal Analysis. \n24. In ruling on a  Rule 12(b)(6)  motion to dismiss , the Court considers \n“whether the pleadings, when taken as true, are legally sufficient to satisfy the \nelements of at least some legally recognized claim.”  Arroyo v. Scottie’s Prof’l Window \nCleaning, Inc., 120 N.C. App. 154, 158, 461 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1995).  The Court construes \nthe pleading liberally and generally accepts all allegations as true.  Laster v. Francis, \n199 N.C. App. 572, 577, 681 S.E.2d 858, 862 ( 2009).  Furthermore, “a complaint \nshould not be dismissed for insufficiency unless it appears to a certainty that plaintiff \n \n \nis entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the \nclaim.”  Sutton v. Duke , 277 N.C. 94, 103,  176 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1970) (emphasis \nomitted). \n25. Dismissal pursuant to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is proper “(1) when the \ncomplaint on its fac e reveals that no law supports plaintiff’s  claim; (2) when the \ncomplaint reveals on its face the absence of fact suffic ient to make a good claim; [or] \n(3) when some fact disclosed in the complai nt necessarily defeats the plaintiff’s  \nclaim.”  Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 278, 333 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1985). \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Piercing the Corporate Veil Remedy \n26. The Supreme Cou rt of North Carolina has recognized that “the whole \narea of limited liability, and conversely of piercing the corporate veil , is among the \nmost confusing in corporate law.”  State ex rel. Cooper v. Ridgeway Brands Mfg., LLC, \n362 N.C. 431, 439, 666 S.E.2d 1 07, 113 (2008) (quoting Frank H. Easterbrook & \nDaniel R. Fischel, Limited Liability and the Corporation , 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 89, 89 \n(1985)).  Piercing the corporate veil creates an exception to the rule “that in the \nordinary course of business, a corporation is treated as distinct from its shareholders.”  \nGreen v. Freeman , 367 N.C. 136, 144–45, 749 S.E.2d 262, 270 (2013)  (quoting \nRidgeway Brands, 362 N.C. at 438, 666 S.E.2d at 112).  Instead, veil piercing “allows \na plaintiff to impose legal liability for a corporation’s obligations, or for torts \ncommitted by the corporation, upon some other company or individual that controls \nand dominates a corporation.”  Id. at 145, 749 S.E.2d at 270. \n \n \n27. Veil piercing is an equitable remedy which  “requires a peculiarly \nindividualized and delicate balancing of competing equities.”  Ridgeway Brands, 362 \nN.C. at 440, 666 S.E.2d at 113.  “Disregarding the corporate form is not to be done \nlightly.”  Green, 367 N.C. at 145, 749 S.E.2d at 270  (citing Ridgeway Brands, 362 at \n439, 666 S.E.2d at 112 –13).  However, doing so is appropriate “when applying the \ncorporate fiction would accomplish some fraudulent purpose, operate as a \nconstructive fraud, or defeat some strong equitable claim.”   Ridgeway Brands, 362 \nN.C. at 439, 666 S.E.2d at 112–13 (quoting Bd. of Transp. v. Martin, 296 N.C. 20, 26–\n27, 249 S.E.2d 390, 395 (1978) ); see also White v. Collins Bldg., Inc. , 209 N.C. App. \n48, 52, 704 S.E.2d 307, 310 (2011) (permitting veil piercing “whenever necessary to \nprevent fraud or to achieve equity”); Keener Lumber Co. v. Perry, 149 N.C. App. 19, \n37, 560 S.E.2d 817, 829 (2002) (permitting veil piercing “only in an extreme case \nwhere necessary to serve the ends of justice”).  \n28. In considering whether a veil piercing remedy should be permitted, the \nfactfinder must first determine whether the corporate veil should be pierced.  Green, \n367 N.C. at 145, 749 S.E.2d at 270.  “Evidence upon which [courts of this State] have \nrelied to justify piercing the corporate veil includes inadequate capitalization, \nnoncompliance with corporate formalities, lack of a separate corporat e identity, \nexcessive frag mentation, siphoning of funds by the dominant shareholder, \nnonfunctioning officers and directors, and absence of corporate records.”   Id. (citing \nGlenn v. Wagner, 313 N.C. 450, 455–59, 329 S.E.2d 326, 330–32 (1985)).  In assessing \nthese factors, “[i]t is not the presence or absence of any particular factor that is \n \n \ndeterminative,” but “a combination of factors . . . taken together with an element of \ninjustice or abuse of corporate privilege” that suggest that the corporate veil should \nbe pierced.  Estate of Hurst ex rel. Cherry v. Mo orehead I, LLC , 228 N.C.  App. 571, \n578, 748 S.E.2d 568, 574 (2013) (quoting Glenn v. Wagner , 313 N.C. 450, 458, 329 \nS.E.2d 326, 332 (1985)). \n29. Next, the fact finder must determine whether “a noncorporate defendant \nmay be held liable for [his/her] personal actions as an officer or director.”  Green, 367 \nN.C. at 145, 749 S.E.2d at 270.   To do so , the plaintiff  must prove: (1) that the \ndefendant’s “control of the corporation amount[ed] to ‘complete domination’ with \nrespect to the transaction at issue;” (2) that the defendant “use[d] . . . this control to \ncommit a wrong, or to violate a statutory or other duty in contravention of the other \nparty’s rights;” and (3) that “this wrong or breach of duty [was] the proximate cause \nof the injury to the other party .”  Ridgeway Brands, 362 N.C. at 441, 666 S.E.2d at \n114 (citing Glenn, 313 N.C. at 454 –55, 329 S.E.2d at 330) .  Therefore, evidence of \ndomination and control alone is insufficient ; there must also be a wrong—“an \nunderlying legal claim [against the dominated entity] to which liability may attach[,]” \nGreen, 367 N.C. at 146, 749 S.E.2d at 271.  See also Glenn, 313 N.C. at 458, 329 S.E.2d \nat 333 (requiring “an element of injustice or abuse of corporate privilege”  to permit \nveil piercing).   \n30. Ms. Whitworth first argues that Plaintiffs’ allegations demonstrate that \nshe lacked “complete domination and control” of WW.  Ms. Whitworth asserts that \nthe allegations and exhibits showing (i) the reliance of Plaintiffs on the statements of \n \n \nother officers of WW, (Roland TAC ¶¶ 123–33, 267; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 129 –32), (ii) the \nsignature of WW’s president on documents effectuating transacti ons that are the \nsubject of this suit , (Roland TAC Ex s. F, K; Lomax TAC Ex s. F, K ), (iii) the re -\ninstatement of a board of directors, (Roland TAC ¶ 209; Lomax TAC ¶ 308), and (iv) \nboard minutes suggesting collective decision making, (Roland TAC Exs. R, O; Lomax \nTAC Exs. R, O ), “conclusively establish that [ Ms. Whitworth] did not ‘completely \ndominate’ [WW,]” (Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 8–16; \nWhitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 5–17.)  Although the Court agrees \nthat these allegations and exhibits are likely relevant in determining whether Ms. \nWhitworth actually exercised “complete domination and control,” the proper inquiry \nfor this Court on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is whether these facts, when \nviewed in the light most favorable to P laintiffs, “necessarily defeat[]” Plaintiffs’ veil \npiercing remedy.  Pinney v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. , 146 N.C. App. 248, 253, 552 \nS.E.2d 186, 190 (2001).   \n31. Here, Plaintiffs have asserted that Ms. Whitworth has had complet e \ndomination and control of WW since March 22, 2010 and alleged facts that, viewed in \nthe light most favorable to Plaintiffs, support this contention.  (Roland TAC ¶¶ 176, \n180; Lomax TAC ¶ ¶ 275, 279.)  As alleged, Ms. Whitworth was the CEO and sole \nshareholder of WW when, at a time WW had no functioning board of directors,  she \ntransferred all shares of WW to her Revocable Trust and then assigned all of WW’s \nintellectual property to WWI in order to “deplete[] the assets of WW in an effort to \nfrustrate the ability of WW’s creditors, including Plaintiffs, to recover on legal claims \n \n \nasserted against WW.”  (Roland TAC ¶¶ 205–06, 216; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 304–05, 315; \nsee also Roland TAC ¶¶ 176, 178, 199; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 275, 277, 298.)   \n32. As alleged by Plaintiffs, Ms. Whitworth also caused WW to continue \navoiding required franchisor statutory disclosure requirements, to continue \nmisrepresenting to Plaintiffs WW’s available pricing, and to renew the sole source \nagreement which Plaintiffs a llege boosted prices at their expense and to Ms. \nWhitworth’s personal benefit.  (Roland TAC ¶ 217; Lomax TAC ¶ 316.)  Additionally, \nPlaintiffs assert that Ms. Whitworth’s alleged control has resulted in the reinstated \nboard of directors continuing to act i n her best interest s, rath er than  in the best \ninterests of WW, (Roland TAC ¶ 209; Lomax TAC ¶ 308 ), by, among other things , \nallowing WW to pay for her personal expenses, (Roland TAC ¶ 210, Lomax TAC ¶ 309 \n(taxes)) (Roland TAC ¶ 195; Lomax TAC ¶ 294 (litigation expenses)) (Roland TAC ¶ \n211; Lomax TAC ¶ 310 (personal taxes and purchase of personal property)). \n33. Viewing the allegations of the TAC s in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiffs, the Court concludes that the TACs allege sufficient facts showing that Ms. \nWhitworth had complete domination and control of WW with respect to the \ntransactions at issue, and that Ms. Whitworth’s allegedly wrongful conduct through \nthe exercise of that domination and control was a proximate cause of harm to \nPlaintiffs.  See, e.g ., Ridgeway Brands , 362 N.C. at 442 –43, 666 S.E.2d at 115  \n(reversing trial court’s dismissal of veil piercing claim, given allegations that \ndefendants “deliberately and purposefully chose to line their personal pockets”); \nFischer Inv. Capital, Inc. v. Catawba Dev. Corp., 200 N.C. App. 644, 657, 689 S.E.2d \n \n \n143, 152 (2009) (reversing trial court’s dismissal of veil piercing claim “since its \npleading asserts facts that, if proven to be true, would establish all the elements of \nthe ‘instrumentality rule’”); cf. B-W Acceptance Corp . v. Spencer, 268 N.C. 1, 9 –10, \n149 S.E.2d 570, 576 (1966) (holding that plaintiffs failed to allege facts showing \ncomplete domination and control); Blue Ridge Pediatric & Adolescent Med., Inc. v. \nFirst Colony Healthcare, LLC, 2012 NCBC LEXIS 52, at *15–16 (N.C. Super. Ct. Oct. \n3, 2012) (holding plaintiffs “fail[ed] to point to specific acts of control or domination \nby the Individual Defendants over [Corporate] Subsidiaries”).  See also generally \nEmbree Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Rafco r, Inc. , 330 N.C. 487, 500, 411 S.E.2d 916, 925 \n(1992) (“Under the notice theory of pleading, a statement of a claim is adequate if it \ngives sufficient notice of the events or transactions which produced the claim to \nenable the adverse party to understand its nature and basis and to file a responsive \npleading.”).   \n34. Ms. Whitworth next argues that the veil piercing remedy cannot succeed \nagainst her because she currently is not a shareholder of WW.  (Whitworth’s Br. Supp. \nMot. Dismiss Roland TAC 16–17; Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC \n17–18.)  According to  Plaintiffs, Ms. Whitworth was WW’s sole shareholder from \nMarch 22, 2010 to June 21, 2010, (Roland TAC ¶¶ 176, 178; Lomax TAC ¶¶ 275, 277), \nbut since June 21, 2010, the Revocable Trust, which is solely controlled by Ms. \nWhitworth, has been the sole shareholder of WW.  (Roland TAC ¶ 178; Lomax TAC ¶ \n277.) \n \n \n35. North Carolina appellate decisions, however, have not limited the \navailability of the veil piercing remedy to claims against shareholders.  To th e \ncontrary, the Supreme Court  of North Carolina  has expressly recognized that veil \npiercing “ provides an avenue to pursue legal claims against corporate officers or \ndirectors – who would otherwise be shielded by the corporate form ” and that veil \npiercing “allows a plaintiff to impose legal liability for a corporation’s obligations, or \nfor torts committed by the corporation, upon some other company or individual that \ncontrols and dominates a corporation.”  Green, 367 N.C. at 145–46, 749 S.E.2d at 270–\n71 (emphasis added).   \n36. Nevertheless, where courts have pierced the corporate veil, control or \ndomination has usually been accompanied by direct, or, as here, indirect, ownership.  \nE.g., Ridgeway Brands , 362 N.C. at 440 –41, 666 S.E.2d at 113 –14 (“[T]he \ninstrumentality rule allows for the corporate form to be disregarded if ‘the corporation \nis so operated that it is a mere instrumentality or alter ego of the sole or dominant \nshareholder[.]’”); Statesville Stained Glass v. T.E. Lane Constr. & Supply , 110 N.C. \nApp. 592, 596, 430 S.E.2d 437, 440 (1993) (“When a ‘corporation is so operated that it \nis a mere instrumentality or alter ego of the sole or dominant shareholder and a shield \nfor his [wrongful] activities . . . the corporate entity will be disregarded and th e \ncorporation and the shareholder treated as one and the same [.]’”) (emphasis added) \n(quoting Henderson v. Sec. Mort. & Fin. Co. , 273 N.C. 253, 260, 160 S.E.2d 39, 44 \n(1968)).    \n \n \n37. A mandatory  ownership requirement, however, which the Supreme \nCourt has declined to impose, could create an avenue for the cunning to avoid liability \nwhile maintaining “control . . . in respect to the transaction . . . [such] that the \ncorporate entity as to this transaction had at the time no separate mind, will or \nexistence of its own.”  Green, 367 N.C. at 14 5–46, 749 S.E.2d at 270 (quoting Glenn, \n313 N.C. at 455, 329 S.E.2d at 330).  See also Allred v. Exceptional Landscapes, Inc., \n227 N.C. App. 229, 236, 743 S.E.2d 48, 54 (2013) (reversing factfinder where findings \nof fact insufficient to support conclusion that defendant had “complete domination of \npolicy, finances, and business practices . . . [or] that [defendant] exercised such control \nover [the corporation] that the corporate entity had no separate existence”). \n38. The relevant inquiry therefore is not whether Plaintiffs have plead ed \nthat Ms. Whitworth was a shareholder at the time of the transactions at issue but \nwhether Plaintiffs have alleged facts showing that Ms. Whitworth held and exercised \ndomination and control with respect to the transactions at issue.  Because the Court \nhas already concluded that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded facts showing that Ms. \nWhitworth had the requisite domination and control over WW, and because Plaintiffs \nhave alleged facts showing that since March 22, 2010, Ms. Whitworth ha s held and \nexercised that domination and control over WW, individually or through the \nRevocable Trust, concerning the transactions at issue, the Court concludes that Ms. \nWhitworth’s shareholder -based argument nece ssarily fails .  See N.C. Gen. Stat. § \n36C-6-603(a) (“While a trust is revocable, rights of the beneficiaries are subject to the \ncontrol of, and the duties of the trustee are owed exclusively to, the settlor. If a trustee \n \n \nis a settlor, the trustee’ s actions are presumed to be taken at the direction of the \nsettlor.”).      \nC.  Ms. Whitworth’s Limitations and Repose Defenses. \n39. Ms. Whitworth also argues that Plaintiff s’ claims are barred by the \napplicable statutes of limitations  because she was not a party to the Tolling \nAgreement entered into by Plaintiffs and WW and because the applicable statutes of \nlimitations expired prior to the initiation of this action.  (Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss Roland TAC 19–28; Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 20–28.) \n40. “A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is an appropriate method of \ndetermining whether the statutes of limitation bar plaintiff’s claims if the bar is \ndisclosed in the complaint.”  See Carlisle v. Keith, 169 N.C. App. 674, 681, 614 S.E.2d \n542, 547 (2005) (citing Horton v. Carolina Medicorp , 344 N.C. 133, 136, 472 S.E.2d \n778, 780 (1996)).  Whether a statute of limitations defense may be determined at the \n12(b)(6) stage “depends on whether the facts necessary to adjudicate the defense are \ndemonstrated by the complaint itself or whether additional evidence must be \nconsidered.  BDM Invs. v. Lenhil, Inc., 2012 NCBC LEXIS 7, at *30 (N.C. Super. Ct. \nJan 18, 2012).   \n41. The Supreme Court of North Carolina has held that “when the corporate \ndefendant is the mere instrumentality, or alter ego, of the individual defendant, the \nindividual is not considered a new party” for purposes of the statute of limitations.   \nRidgeway Brands, 362 N.C. at 432, 666 S.E.2d 109.  The court reasoned that because \nthe corporate defendant and the individual defendant are “one and the same” if they \n \n \nare proven to be alter egos, the trial court could not dismiss the claims against the \nindividual defendant on statute of limitations grounds when the statute did not bar \nthe claims against the corporate defendant and the plaintiff had made the necessary \nshowing to sustain an alter ego claim at the pleading stage.  Id. at 441–43, 668 S.E.2d \nat 114–15 (quoting Henderson, 273 N.C. at 260, 160 S.E.2d at 44).   \n42. Applying that logic here, Plaintiffs’ claims against Ms. Whitworth  are \nnot barred by the statute of limitations if , based on the allegations of the TAC s, the \nclaims against her alleged alter ego, WW, are timely.  This conclusion reflects not \nonly that the corporate defendant and individual defendant are one and the same \nunder the purported alter ego theory but also that alter ego liability is not a claim but \na remedy that requires “an underlying legal claim [against the dominated entity] to \nwhich liability may attach.”  Green, 367 N.C. at 146, 749 S.E.2d at 271 (citing Glenn, \n313 N.C. at 455, 329 S.E.2d at 330).  \n43. Turning then to the allegations concerning the timeliness of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims against WW, 2 the Court first addresses Plaintiffs’ contention that its claims \nare timely under the continuing wrong doctrine.  Under that doctrine, “ a statute of \nlimitations does not begin to run until the violative act ceases .”  Williams v. Blue \n                                            \n2  As an initial matter, the Court rejects Plaintiffs’ contention that the filing of WW’s answer \nprecludes Ms. Whitworth’s assertion of limitations and repose  defenses.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. \nOpp’n Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 14; Pls.’ Resp. Br. Opp’n Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 14.)  Even \nif the Court were to assume, as Plaintiffs appear to suggest, that Ms. Whitworth’s affirmative \ndefenses are necessarily limited under North Carolina law to those pleaded by WW, WW \nasserted a statute of limitations defense in its answer —thus preserving Ms. Whitworth’s \nability to assert this defense even under Plaintiffs’ statement of the law.  See, e.g., Gragg v. \nW. M. Harris & Son , 54 N.C. App. 607, 609, 284 S.E.2d 183, 185 (1981 ) (“[T]he statute of \nlimitations is a technical defense, and must be timely pleaded or it is deemed waived.”).   \n \n \n \nCross Blue Shield of N .C., 357 N.C. 170, 179, 581 S.E.2d 415, 423 (2003).  B ased on \nthe Court’s careful review of the TAC s, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have \nalleged facts  that, when taken as true, show that WW engaged in the allegedly \nwrongful conduct that gave rise to each claim up to the time the original complaints \nwere filed in these actions on January 2, 2015.  (Roland TAC ¶¶ 161, 258; Lomax TAC \n¶¶ 260, 354.)  Because the Court cannot conclude that Defendants’ defenses under \nthe applicable statute of limitations, borrowing statute, and statute of repose must \nprevail as  a matter of law on the face  of the TAC s, the Court must deny Ms. \nWhitworth’s Motions to Dismiss to the extent it is based on these defenses.  Carlisle, \n169 N.C. App. at 681, 614 S.E.2d at 547.3  \nD.  Plaintiffs’ Section 75-1.1 Claims. \n44. Finally, Ms. Whitworth argues that Plaintiffs’ claims for unfair or \ndeceptive trade practices under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 fail because Plaintiffs are not \nlocated in and did not suffer injury in North Carolina.  ( Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss Roland TAC 28 –29; Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 29. )  \nNorth Carolina courts follow the choice of law rule lex loci, the law of the situs of the \nclaim, to determine the applicable law for matters affecting substantial rights of the \nparties.  Boudreau v. Baughman, 322 N.C. 331, 335, 368 S.E.2d 849, 853 –54 (1988) \n                                            \n3  Because the Court does not rely upon the Tolling Agreement to resolve Ms. Whitworth’s \nMotion, the Court declines to address Ms. Whitworth’s  argument that Plaintiffs’ material \nbreach of that Agreement made it void and unenforceable , (Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. \nDismiss Roland TAC 26–27; Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 27), or that the \nequitable remedy of veil piercing cannot alter the Agreement’s terms under Cherry v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 162 N.C. App 535, 535 –36, 590 S.E.2d 925, 927 (2004) , \n(Whitworth’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 12). \n \n \n \n(citing Charnock v. Taylor, 223 N.C. 360, 361, 26 S.E.2d 911, 913 (1943)).  “For actions \nsounding in tort, the state where the injury occurred is considered the situs of the \nclaim.”  Id. at 335, 368 S.E.2 d at 854; Harco Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Grant Thornton LLP , \n206 N.C. App. 687, 692, 698 S.E.2d 719, 722 (2010).   \n45. Our appellate courts, however, have not clearly determined whether the \nlex loci rule or the most significant relationship test is the appropriate choice of law \nrule to apply to claims under section 75-1.1.  See, e.g., Associated Packaging, Inc. v. \nJackson Paper Mfg. Co. , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *13 –14 (N.C. Super. Ct. Mar. 1, \n2012) (citing Stetser v. TAP Pharm. Prods. Inc., 165 N.C. App. 1, 15, 598 S.E.2d 570, \n581 (2004)); compare Andrew Jackson Sales v. Bi -Lo Stores, 68 N.C. App. 222, 225, \n314 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1984)  (suggesting adoption of “significant relationship” test), \nwith United Va. Bank v. Air -Lift Assocs, 79 N.C. App. 315, 321, 339 S.E.2d 90,  93 \n(1986) (suggesting adoption of lex loci rule).   \n46. Nonetheless, this Court recently concluded that the Supreme Court of \nNorth Carolina will likely apply the lexi loci rule to section 75-1.1 claims based on its \nrejection of the modern trend towards the “most significant relationship” test in the \ncourt’s Boudreau decision and has applied the lexi loci rule to such claims.  See Soma \nTech, Inc. v. Dalamagas, 2017 NCBC LEXIS 43, at *19 n.5 (N.C. Super. Ct. May 11, \n2017); see als o Associated Packaging, Inc. , 2012 NCBC LEXIS 13, at *13 –18.  \nTherefore, this Court will apply the lex loci rule to the section 75-1.1 claims asserted \nin the Roland and Lomax Actions. \n \n \n47. Under lex loci  delicti, “[t]he plaintiff’s injury is considered to be \nsustained in the state ‘where the last act occurred giving rise to [the] injury.’”  Harco \nNat’l Ins. Co., 206 N.C. App. at 694, 698 S.E.2d at 724 (alteration in original) (quoting \nUnited Va. Bank, 79 N.C. App. at 321, 339 S.E.2d at 94).  In Harco, the court declined \nto recognize a bright line rule that a plaintiff suffers its injury at its principal place \nof business.  Id. at 697, 698 S.E.2d at 725–26.  Therefore, North Carolina courts must \nanalyze and determine whe re a plaintiff in fact sustained its alleged injury to \ndetermine choice of law under the lex loci rule.  Id. \n48. Here, Ms. Whitworth contends that North Carolina law does not apply \nbecause Plaintiffs “are not located in North Carolina, and did not suffer injur y in, \nNorth Carolina.”  (Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 28 –29; \nWhitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 29.)  In opposition, Plaintiffs argue \nthat they were injured in North Carolina when WW “received kickbacks and/or failed \nto disclose the amount and nature of kickbacks, along with other information that \nthey were required to disclose to Plaintiffs as a matter of law.”  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. Opp’n \nMot. Dismiss Roland TAC 23; Pls.’ Resp. Br. Opp’n Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 23.)  In \nthe alternative, Plaintiffs argue that it is premature for the Court to determine where \nPlaintiffs’ claims in fact arose before the factual record has been fully developed  in \nthese cases.  (Pls.’ Resp. Br. Opp. Mot. Dismiss  Roland TAC 23; Pls.’ Resp. Br. Opp. \nMot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 23.)   \n49. Based on its review of the TACs in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, \nthe Court cannot conclude that Plaintiffs were not injured in North Carolina for \n \n \npurposes of the lex loci delicti rule as a matter of law.  Ms. Whitworth’s bare assertion \nthat Plaintiffs “are not located in, and did not suffer injury in, North Carolina” at this \nearly stage of the proceedings is insufficient to sustain Ms. Whitworth’s burden in \nlight of the allegations of Plaintiffs’ purported injuries in the TACs.  (Whitworth’s Br. \nSupp. Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 28 –29; Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax \nTAC 29.)  See generally Neier v. State , 151 N.C. App. 228, 233, 565 S.E.2d 229, 232 \n(2002) (holding that neither  party has an evidentiary burden on a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion and the movant’s burden of demonstrating that the action should be dismissed \nwas “not shifted . . . by inviting the nonmovant to submit case law in support of the \nlegal sufficiency of his claim”).   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Ms. \nWhitworth’s Motions to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ section 75-1.1 claims under Rule 12(b)(6) \nshould be denied.   \nVII. \nRULE 12(b)(7) MOTIONS TO DISMISS \n50. Ms. Whitworth argues that the Revocable Trust, the transferee and \nholder of all of Ms. Whitworth’s WW stock; Leon and Marie Whitworth, WW’s former \nshareholders; and Blair Ingle, WW’s former President,  are necessary parties to this \nlitigation.  (Whitworth’s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Roland TAC 17–18; Whitworth’s Br. \nSupp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 18–19; Whitworth’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss \nRoland TAC 10–11; Whitworth’s Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Lomax TAC 10–11.) \n51. Under Rule 12(b)(7), a claim must be dismissed if a necessary party \ncannot be joined.  N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7).  Rule 19(a) requires “those who are united \n \n \nin interest [to] be joined as plaintiffs or defendants[.]”  N.C. R. Civ. P. 19(a).  A party \nis united in interest , i.e., is a “necessary party,”  if it is “so vitally interested in the \ncontroversy that a valid judgment c annot be rendered in the action completely and \nfinally determining the controversy without his presence [.]”  Strickland v. Hughes , \n273 N.C. 481, 485, 160 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1968) (citations omitted).  Stated differently, \n“[n]ecessary parties are those persons who have rights which must be ascertained \nand settled before the rights of the parties to the suit can be determined.”  Wall v. \nSneed, 13 N.C. App. 719, 724, 187 S.E.2d 454, 457 (1972) (quoting Assurance Society \nv. Basnight, 234 N.C. 347, 67 S.E. 2d 390, 395 (1951)). \n52. Here, Plaintiffs only seek to hold Ms. Whitworth individually liable for \nthe acts of her alleged alter ego, WW, to permit recovery against Ms. Whitworth’s \nindividual assets.  In North Carolina, revocable trusts are by their nature subject to \nthe control and whim of the settlor, who can revoke the trust at any time, see generally \nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 36C -6-603(a), and , as a result , are “subject to the claims of the \nsettlor’s creditors[,]” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 36C-5-505(a)(1).  Consequently, the Revocable \nTrust is not a necessary party in this litigation because  the Court concludes that a \nvalid judgment can be rendered in this action between Plaintiffs and Ms. Whitworth \nthat completely and finally determin es the controversy between them without the \nRevocable Trust’s participation as a party.4 \n                                            \n4  For clarity, however, the Court directs that the case caption be amended hereafter to reflect \nthat Ms. Whitworth has been sued by Plaintiffs both in her individual capacity and as Trustee \nof the Revocable Trust. \n \n \n53. Ms. Whitworth’s contention that Leon and Marie Whitworth  and Blair \nIngle are necessary parties as former shareholder s and officers also fails.  Piercing \nthe corporate veil is not a separate theory of liability but merely a remedy for \nrecovery.  See Green, 367 N.C. at 146, 749 S.E.2d at 271.  A valid judgment can be \nrendered against WW in this litigation, and that judgment applied to Ms. Whitworth \nif the corporate veil i s pierced , without the presence of former shareholder s and \nofficers.  It is axiomatic that a plaintiff “has the right to bring his suit in the manner \nand in the form he may elect[,]” Marshall Motor Co. v. Universal Credit Co., 219 N.C. \n199, 201, 13 S.E.2d 230, 231 (1941), and the fact that Plaintiffs might potentially have \na veil piercing remedy against others in the circumstances here does not require that \nthose persons be joined as necessary parties under Rule 19.   \n54. Therefore, the Court conclu des that neither the Revocable Trust nor \nLeon and Marie Whitworth nor Blair Ingle are necessary parties to these actions and \ndenies Ms. Whitworth’s Motions to Dismiss for failure to join a necessary party under \nRule 12(b)(7). \nVIII. \nCONCLUSION \n55. WHEREFORE, th e Court, for the reasons stated herein, hereby (i) \nSUSTAINS Plaintiffs’ Objections to Materials Outside the Pleadings, and (ii) \nDENIES Ms. Whitworth’s Motions to Dismiss Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint.  \n \n \n \n \nSO ORDERED, this the 12th day of July, 2017.5 \n \n \n     /s/ Louis A. Bledsoe, III   \n     Louis A.
