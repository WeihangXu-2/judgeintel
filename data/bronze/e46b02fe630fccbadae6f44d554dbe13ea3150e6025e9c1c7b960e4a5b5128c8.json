THIS MATTER was designated as a mandatory complex business case by \nOrder of the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court pursuant to N.C.G.S. \n§ 7A-45.4 and assigned to the undersigned on 26 October 2020.  (ECF Nos. 1–2.) \n2. This case came on for trial before a jury on Monday, 27 November 2023 in \nthe Superior Court of Iredell County.  Plaintiff Ashton K. Loyd’s  (“Ashton Loyd ”) \nclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, conversion, and unjust \nenrichment, and Defendants James Michael Griffin  (“Mike Gr iffin”) and Griffin \nInsurance Agency, Inc.’s (“GIA,” and together with Mike Griffin, “Defendants”) claims \nfor breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, were tried to the jury. \n3. The Court granted in part Defendants’ motion for directed verdict at the \nclose of Plaintiff’s evidence and dismissed Ashton Loyd’s unjust enrichment claim.  \nThe Court otherwise denied all motions for directed verdict. \n4. On Thursday, 7 December 2023, the jury returned its verdict on all issues \nof liability and damages submitted as follows:  \nIssue Number 1: Did Mike Griffin, as the majority shareholder of GIA, \nbreach a fiduciary duty that he owed Ashton Loyd?  \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 2: Did Mike Griffin seek to benefit himself through his \nbreach of fiduciary duty? \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 3: Did Mike Griffin cause GIA to convert Ashton  Loyd’s \n345 shares in GIA? \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 4: What was the value, if any, of Ashton Loyd’s shares in \nGIA as of September 2, 2020?  \n \n$3,527,433.00 \n \nIssue Number 5: Is Mike Griffin liable to Ashton Loyd for punitive \ndamages? \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 6: What amount of punitive damages, if any, does the jury \nin its discretion award to Ashton Loyd against Mike Griffin? \n \n$1,000,000.00 \n \nIssue Number 7: Is GIA liable to Ashton Loyd for punitive damages? \n \nNO \n \nIssue Number 8: What amount of punitive damages, if any, does the jury \nin its discretion award to Ashton Loyd against GIA? \n \nN/A \n \nIssue Number 9: Did Ashton Loyd , as an officer of GIA, breach a \nfiduciary duty that he owed GIA? \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 10: What amount of damages, if any, is GIA entitled to \nrecover from Ashton Loyd for breach of fiduciary duty? \n \n$120,000.00 \n \nIssue Number 11: Is Ashton Loyd liable to GIA for punitive damages? \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 1 2: What amount of punitive damages, if any, does the \njury in its discretion award to GIA against Ashton Loyd? \n \n$10,000.00 \n \nIssue Number 1 3: Did Ashton Loyd breach  Section 9 of  the Agency \nAssociate Agent/Office Staff Agreement dated July 1, 2012 by failing \nto comply with applicable insurance laws or regulations?  \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 14: What amount of damages, if any, is GIA entitled to \nrecover from Ashton Loyd for breach of the Agency Associate \nAgent/Office Staff Agreement? \n \n$1.00 \n \nIssue Number 1 5: Was the Shareholders Agreement amended by the \naddition of Andrew Patton as a shareholder of GIA? \n \nYES \n \nIssue Number 16: Did GIA properly demand Ashton Loyd’s performance \nof Section 3 of the Shareholders’ Agreement? \n \nN/A \n \nIssue Number 17: Did Ashton Loyd  breach the GIA Shareholders’ \nAgreement dated June 25, 2018 by not selling his shares in GIA back \nto it? \n \nN/A \n \n(Verdict, ECF No. 186.) \n5. Defendants counterclaimed for breach of contract  seeking specific \nperformance of the terms of GIA’s Shareholders’ Agreement.  While all factual issues \nwere submitted to the jury, “[i]n a contract dispute between two parties, the trial \ncourt may interpret a plain and unambiguous contract as a matter of law[,]” Premier, \nInc. v. Peterson , 232 N.C. App. 601, 605  (2014), because courts “have the power to \ninterpret the terms of contracts[,]” McKinnon v. CV Indus. , 213 N.C. App. 328, 333 \n(2011).  Accordingly, the Court writes separately to determine in this Final Order and \nJudgment whether specific performance is an appropriate remedy, given that the jury \ndetermined that the GIA Shareholders’ Agreement was amended by the addition of \nAndrew Patton as a shareholder of GIA. \n6. When examining the language of a contract, the trial court seeks to \ndetermine the “intent of the parties when the contract was issued.”  N.C. State Bar v. \nMerrell, 243 N.C. App. 356, 370 (2015)  (citation omitted) .  “The language in the \ncontract is given its natural and ordinary meaning, because it is strongly presumed \nthat the parties knew what they agreed and have chosen fit and proper words to \nexpress that agreement in its entirety.”  Crescent Univ. City Venture, LLC v. AP Atl., \nInc., 2019 NCBC LEXIS 46, at *31 (N.C. Super. Ct. Aug. 8, 2019)  (cleaned up).  In \ndetermining the parties’ intent, the Court must construe the contract “in a manner \nthat gives effect to all of its provisions,” if such can be reasonably done.  Johnston Cty. \nv. R.N. Rouse & Co., 331 N.C. 88, 94 (1992). \n7. The GIA Shareholders’ Agreement dated 25 June 2018 (the “Shareholders’ \nAgreement”) provides, in relevant part: \n3. Corporate Purchase.   Upon .  . . (iii)  the termination of the \nShareholder's employment with the C orporation for any reason \n(collectively referred to as a “Triggering Event”), the Shareholder or his \nestate will sell, and the Corporation will purchase, at the Purchase Price \n. . . all of the shares owned by the Shareholder at the time of the \nTriggering Event[.] \n \n* * * * \n \n4. Purchase Price.  Purchase Price [is determined by formula stated \nherein, and] may be reviewed periodically by all of the Shareholders and \nmay be revised upon each review on the basis of the then existing \nbusiness and financial condition and prospects of the Corporation.  The \ngood faith decision of a majority in interest of such Shareholders upon \neach such rev iew shall be conclusive; and each such decision shall be \nnoted in writing and endorsed by each such Shareholder. \n \n* * * * \n \n11. Limitations on Sale.  No purchase or sale shall be effective hereunder \nif any of the following occurs:  . . . (c) The Shareholders have amended \nthis Agreement. \n \n12. Amendment.  All provisions of this Agreement shall be effective until \nchanged by the mutual consent of all the Shareholders, except as \notherwise provided by law. \n \n(Pl.’s Ex. 97 at 2–3, 5, ECF No. 189.33.) \n8. What has largely been at issue in this litigation is the meaning of the word \n“effective” as used in Sections 11 and 12.  Definitions of “effective” include:  \n1. [I]n operation at a given time . A statute, order, or contract is often \nsaid to be effective beginning (and perhaps ending) at a designated time.  \n2. Performing within the range of normal and expected standards.  \n3. Productive; achieving a result. \n \nEffective, Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014).  Using th ese definitions to \nunderstand the meaning of Sections 11 and 12,  the Court interprets  Section 12 to \nmean that all provisions of the Shareholders’ Agreement are to be in operation—\nhaving effect  and consequence—until changed by the mutual consent of all \nshareholders.  Such a change constitutes an amendment to the Shareholders’ \nAgreement.  Logically foll owing from that, the Court interprets Section  11 to mean \nthat, if there is an amendment to the Shareholders’ Agreement as provided for in \nSection 12, no purchase or sale contemplated in Section 3 shall be achieved under the \nShareholders’ Agreement unless t he amendment to the Shareholders’ Agreement \nexpressly provides that those sale provisions remain valid and enforceable. \n9. Therefore, the Court interprets the plain , unambiguous  language of the \nShareholders’ Agreement to mean that no purchase of shares by GIA pursuant to \nSections 3 and 4 would be “effective,” meaning mandate a conveyance of shares from \nthe shareholder to the corporation, if the Shareholders’ Agreement was amended.  If \nGIA’s shareholders, Ashton Loyd and M ike Griffin at the tim e this document was \nexecuted, intended for Sections 3 and 4 to survive an amendment  or modification of \nthe Shareholders’ Agreement,  Section 11(c) would have been excluded from the \nagreement. \n10. To the extent there is any ambiguity as to the meaning of the ter m \n“effective,” it is well settled that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the \ndrafter.  See Novacare Orthotics & Prosthetics E., Inc. v. Speelman , 137 N.C. App. \n471, 476 (2000) (“[W]hen an ambiguity is present in a written instrument, the court \nis to construe the ambiguity  against the drafter --the party responsible for choosing \nthe questionable language. ”).  It is undisputed that Defendants , or their counsel at \nthe time, drafted the Shareholders’ Agreement.  Therefore, even if the term “effective” \nwas unclear or ambiguous  in this context , the Court resolves the meaning in a \nmanner which favors Ashton Loyd.  \n11. Having construed the language of the Shareholders’ Agreement, the Court \nturns to whether Ashton Loyd could have breached the agreement. \n12. “The elements of a claim for breach of contract are (1) existence of a valid \ncontract and (2) breach of the terms of that contract.”  Poor v. Hill, 138 N.C. App. 19, \n26 (2000).   \n13. The jury, as finder of fact, determined the issue of fact concerning whether \nthe parties to the Shareholders’ Agreement modified its terms by mutual consent.  \nThe jury answered this issue “YES.”  Thus, the jury unanimously determined that \nthere was mutual consent of all parties to modify the Shareholders’ Agreement to add \nAndrew Patton as a shareholder.   The evidence before the jury was uncontroverted \nthat, following the execution by Mike Griffin and Ashton Loyd of the Shareholders ’ \nAgreement in June 2018, Andrew Patton became a shareholder of GIA wi th no new \nshareholders agreement being executed by the parties.  Because no new shareholders’ \nagreement was executed following the addition of Andrew Patton as a shareholder, \nand the addition of Andrew Patton as a shareholder resulted in an amendment of the \nShareholders’ Agreement, Sections 11 and 12, read together, terminated the \neffectiveness of Sections 3 and 4.  \n14. The Court instructed the jury that, if they answered Issue N umber 15 \n“YES,” they should not answer the remaining two issues on the Verdict Shee t.  This \nwas because, based on the Court’s interpretation of the Shareholders’ Agreement, \nAshton Loyd could not have breached the Shareholders’ Agreement by refusing to sell \nback his shares  in GIA because his performance  under Section 3 was no  longer \nrequired following an amendment.  See Millis Constr. Co. v. Fairfield Sapphire Valley, \nInc., 86 N.C. App. 506, 509 (1987) (providing that “when performance of a duty under \ncontract is presently due any nonperformance constitutes a breach ,” leading to the \nconclusion that if there is no duty of performance, nonperformance cannot constitute \na breach).  In other words, there was no obligation of performance  by Ashton Loyd  \nunder Section 3 of the Shareholders’ Agreement if the addition of Andrew Patton as \na shareholder  constituted an amendment of the agreement , because Section 11(c) \nspecifically removed that obligation. \n15. Since the jury answered Issue Number 15 “YES”, and given the evidence of \nrecord, the Court concludes that the Shareholders’ Agreement was amended without \nrenewal or restatement of Sections 3 and 4.  Therefore, Ashton Loyd had no \ncontractual obligation to sell his shares in GIA bac k to the corporation.  As a result, \nGIA is not entitled to specific performance as a remedy for its  counterclaim since it \ncannot make out the elements of breach of contract.  See McKinnon, 213 N.C. App. at \n333 (citation omitted) (“For a court to award specific performance, ther e must be a \nbreach of a valid contract.”). \n16. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, based on the verdict of the jury and the \nCourt’s conclusions of law as set forth herein, that:  \na. Judgment is entered for Plaintiff Ashton Loyd against Defendants \nMike Griffin and GIA, jointly and severally, as to Ashton Loyd’s claims for \nbreach of fiduciary duty, constructive fraud, and conversion in the amount \nof $ 4,527,433.00, representing a total sum comprised of both actual and \npunitive damages as found by the jury.  \nb. Judgment is entered for Defendant GIA and against Plaintiff Ashton \nLoyd as to  GIA’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty in the amount of \n$130,000.00, representing a total sum comprised of both actual and \npunitive damages as found by the jury. \nc.
